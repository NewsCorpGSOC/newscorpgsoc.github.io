The D Brief: Another hurricane looms; Grim anniversary in Israel;...	From Helene to Milton: The death toll from late September's Hurricane Helene has risen to at least 230 people as recovery efforts continue in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas, the Associated Press reported Monday. More than 250,000 are still without power across the south, with the majority (136,180) in North Carolina alone, according to Poweroutage.us. New this weekend: 'The entire length of the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia is closed&rdquo; &mdash; that's 469 miles of road &mdash; 'as crews continue their assessment of the damage from Hurricane Helene,&rdquo; the National Park Service said Saturday after erosion washed out significant portions of the scenic highway. 'Based on what the teams have seen so far, significant, and in some cases catastrophic, damage has occurred along the parkway, particularly from milepost 280 to milepost 469,&rdquo; officials said. Panning out: Nearly 7,000 federal workers are helping, including more than 1,200 Urban Search and Rescue personnel who have helped rescue or support more than 3,200 people in North Carolina so far, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Sunday. Additional FEMA workers have shipped out meals, water, generators and tarps to those in need. The Army Corps of Engineers is on duty conducting assessments around North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Their tasks span water/wastewater checks, bridge and road inspections, debris removal, and more. Almost 1,000 active duty soldiers from Fort Campbell and Fort Liberty are also helping out around western North Carolina in the vicinity of the hard-hit mountain town of Asheville, where flooding swept away key stretches of road, leaving many folks stranded. An additional 500 active duty soldiers will join the recovery efforts soon, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Sunday. The thousand or so active troops come from the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Airborne, the 20th Engineer Brigade, the 18th Airborne Corps, and others, according to officials at Northern Command, which helps coordinate efforts across the U.S. mainland, with FEMA leading overall efforts. Worth noting: 'The National Guard has activated more than 6,100 Guardsmen, hundreds of high-water vehicles, and dozens of helicopters and rescue boats from 18 different states in State-Active-Duty status,&rdquo; Ryder said Sunday. Status report: The Georgia National Guard has their hands busy passing out supplies. The Tennessee National Guard is clearing debris. The North Carolina National Guard is doing a bit of it all. And the Florida National Guard is preparing for another major storm, which could make landfall Wednesday, Hurricane Milton. What might lie ahead with Milton: 'A possible 8- to 12-foot storm surge (2.4 to 3.6 meters) in Tampa Bay and said flash and river flooding could result from 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain in mainland Florida and the Keys,&rdquo; AP reports, citing forecasters. Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded his state of emergency declaration on Sunday to 51 counties across the state in anticipation of Milton. He also cautioned that more power outages were likely, and recommended residents keep at least a week's worth of food and water available&mdash;and be ready to drive elsewhere to safety. For the latest, check out Floridadisaster.org/Updates. Misinformation and lies are disrupting Helen recovery efforts, so FEMA has had to create a website to dispel some of the rumors being spread. According to AP: 'Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.&rdquo; Of particular note: Donald Trump 'has lied about the federal hurricane response with staggering frequency and variety,&rdquo; CNN's Daniel Dale reported in a fact check published Sunday. Also not helping: Georgia conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wrote on social media Thursday that unspecified humans 'control the weather.&rdquo; Related reading: 'FEMA's Criswell dismisses 'ridiculous' Helene recovery falsehoods,&rdquo; ABC News reported Sunday after an interview with Criswell; 'Helene recovery is more political online than on the ground,&rdquo; NPR reported Monday; 'Hurricane Milton Intensifies Into A Category 4; Prompts Hurricane And Storm Surge Watches In Florida,&rdquo; the Weather Channel reported Monday morning.

It's been one year since Hamas launched its brutal surprise attack on Israel, killing more than 1,100 people. The Oct. 7, 2023, attack 'brought to the surface painful memories left by millennia of hatred and violence against the Jewish people,&rdquo; President Biden said in a statement Monday. 'One year later, Vice President Harris and I remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist,&rdquo; he said, and stressed, 'We support Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran.&rdquo; 'What Hamas did that day was pure evil &ndash; it was brutal and sickening,&rdquo; said Vice President Kamala Harris in her own statement Monday. 'We will not forget, and we will not lose faith,&rdquo; she said. 'And in honor of all those souls we lost on October 7, we must never lose sight of the dream of peace, dignity, and security for all.&rdquo; Timeline and outlook: Axios looks back at what happened on Oct. 7, 2023, what's going on now, and where it might all lead. Read that, here. Latest: 'At least seven people were injured late Sunday in what Israel said was a Hezbollah rocket attack on the northern Israeli cities of Haifa and Tiberias,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported, adding that on Monday afternoon, Israel bombarded areas around Lebanon's southern city of Tyre. Additional reading: 'Mossad's pager operation: Inside Israel's penetration of Hezbollah,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Saturday. Inside the Marine Corps' first-ever littoral regiment. Much of what the 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment trains for is basic infantry operations&mdash;with a modern and Pacific twist, its leaders told Defense One's Jen Hlad during a recent exercise. 'When we go on the next deployment, we're going to be pretty disaggregated, seizing key maritime terrain, providing the sensing capability and things like that,&rdquo; said Staff Sgt. Dylan Greene of Banjo Company. And unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq, 'The most challenging thing is going to be [that] we do not have air dominance. I would argue we don't even probably have air superiority, just because of near-peer, and also just going to be like signature management.&rdquo; More, here. A destroyer's first deployment took an unexpected turn. The USS Daniel Inouye's maiden deployment was supposed to be seven months long, mostly working with regional partners such as Japan and Korea as part of the Theodore Roosevelt strike group. But as tensions in the Red Sea heated up, the group's deployment was extended, and the brand-new destroyer received a fresh tasking: deter aggression and protect 'the free flow of commerce&rdquo; in the waters of the Middle East. Hlad talked with the destroyer's leadership as it returned to its home port of Pearl Harbor. Read that, here. And lastly: For several months, Chinese government hackers penetrated major U.S. broadband providers, 'potentially accessing information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. Targets included Verizon Communications, AT&T and Lumen Technologies, among others, officials said, describing it as 'a potentially catastrophic security breach,&rdquo; according to the Journal. 'Hackers apparently exfiltrated some data from Verizon networks by reconfiguring Cisco routers,&rdquo; the Washington Post reports (gift link). 'The fact that they were able to make changes in the routers without detection reflects the sophistication of the adversary but also raises questions about Verizon's security posture, analysts said.&rdquo; Read more at BleepingComputer, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-07-2024/400087/	2024-10-07T08:15:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/DB_lander/large.png
Inside the Marine Corps’ first-ever littoral regiment	MARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII&mdash;'Hold right, clear left.&rdquo; Four Marines in helmets and flak jackets are stacked outside a rusty metal building covered in faux brick and wood. The first enters the doorway with his rifle at the ready, followed by the other three, while 2nd Lt. Alex Willbanks observes inside. Other than the color of the camouflage, the scene is virtually indistinguishable from Marine pre-deployment training at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. But instead of a traditional infantry unit preparing for a counterinsurgency fight in the desert, these Marines are part of the Corps' first-ever littoral regiment, getting ready for a potential future war in the Pacific. Back in 2008, Willbanks was one of the young enlisted Marines just learning how to clear a room before he deployed to Afghanistan with 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment. Now he's back as an officer in the two-year-old 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment, passing on his hard-earned knowledge to new Marines. 'The MLR is still rooted in infantry tasks, but has a new flavor to it,&rdquo; Willbanks said after a morning of training at the base's Military Operations on Urban Terrain, or MOUT, facility here. 'It still does the same things that every other unit would do, but now we're looking at the Indo-Pacific region and deploying up there, as opposed to what we did in' the Global War on Terror.&rdquo; The 3rd Marine Regiment became the 3rd MLR on March 4, 2022, in a ceremony that created the first of three such units prescribed by the service's Force Design 2030 transformation effort. A second MLR is now being formed in Okinawa, with a third planned for Guam. Unlike the Corps' traditional infantry regiments, which are composed of a headquarters company and four infantry battalions, the 3rd MLR has a headquarters element and three subordinate commands: 3rd Littoral Anti-Air Battalion, Combat Logistics Battalion 3, and Littoral Combat Team 3. The Force Design concept, including the design of the MLRs, faced criticism from a cadre of retired general officers early on, who said the changes would weaken the Marine Corps and take focus away from the infantry. Willbanks said he understands some of the criticisms, but noted that 'Marines are still doing the same things that they did before, even looking at peacetime, going into Desert Storm and everything. Like, everyone at some point was training to do a certain thing, and then we pivoted immediately to direct ourselves at what the new threat was&hellip;I think everyone's going to have their own preference of what they think the Marine Corps should be doing. But I think at this time, from my understanding, we're doing what is needed.&rdquo; Across base, on a grass sports field across the street from a rocky beach, Staff Sgt. Dylan Greene and the rest of Banjo Company&mdash;part of the Littoral Combat Team&mdash;are rehearsing for fire team attack training. 'The basic skills have not changed at all,&rdquo; Greene said. As the unit moves closer to its planned deployment next summer, the Banjo Company Marines will begin integrating with the scout platoon, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and small drone operators. 'When we go on the next deployment, we're going to be pretty disaggregated, seizing key maritime terrain, providing the sensing capability and things like that,&rdquo; he said. And unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq, 'The most challenging thing is going to be [that] we do not have air dominance. I would argue we don't even probably have air superiority, just because of near-peer, and also just going to be like signature management.&rdquo; Greene said there have been a lot of discussions about how to manage not just electromagnetic and radio signatures, but other types of signatures as well., He pointed out the unit's new camouflage netting, which is smoother than the previous version and provides a 'nice thermal screen&rdquo; for people standing underneath if a drone flies by. Up a steep hill from the sports field, on a training range inside a crater, 1st Lt. Seth Benscoter and Chaos Company's 2nd Platoon are practicing basic infantry skills. 'Buddy fire and movement, being able to shoot at the target&mdash;the guy in front shoot at the target, and the guy behind him sort of see what's going on, assess how the rounds are making it downrange, and then when he's ready, he moves, so on and so forth until they are able to get close,&rdquo; Benscoter said. The skills are the same that any infantry unit might practice&mdash;MLR Marines refer to traditional infantry regiments as 'legacy units&rdquo;&mdash;but as the deployment training cycle continues, 'it'll get more complicated,&rdquo; he said. Asked about how the unit is adapting to the shift in focus from land battles to working with the Navy for amphibious operations, Benscoter said he thinks that's something the entire Marine Corps is working through. 'We haven't done that, aside from [Marine Expeditionary Units] in a very, very long time, and actually affected an amphibious assault at a larger scale,&rdquo; he said. 'I think it's not, it's not really just the LCT and the MLR that's working through that, but it's kind of the entire Corps' priorities.&rdquo; Back at the MOUT facility, Willbanks is underscoring the importance of fundamentals. 'I can't tell you the answer to everything&hellip;you have to be postured and ready to pivot at a moment's notice,&rdquo; he said. 'There are some standardized ways and practices to do these things, but at the end of the day, you have to rely on your instincts.&rdquo; A contractor who served 14 years as a Marine helicopter pilot overhears the conversation and jumps in: 'Just because you can see some guys in an open desert from eight miles away doesn't mean you're going to find anything in a triple-canopy jungle in the middle of the Philippines, right? Like, it doesn't translate sometimes, and you need to be ready to solve that problem.&rdquo; The contractor, Brent Kreckman, said the MLR Marines are 'building those little building blocks, like how to break down the door and clear the room, that they can then go, &lsquo;Well, how am I going to apply this there? And how do I avoid the small drone problems? How do I avoid booby trap problems?' And they get to solve a new problem set&rdquo; without the bias that some of the older Marines have. That ability to take initiative is trained into them, Benscoter said. 'The NCOs in the infantry, and even the more junior guys, they're trained to critically think and to not just follow orders, but to seize initiative,&rdquo; he said. 'I think the best part of the Marine Corps is that no matter what the mission is, no matter what the time period, the technology, whatever, our whole goal is to be ready when we're called on. And I don't think that culture's going anywhere.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/inside-marine-corps-first-ever-littoral-regiment/400084/	2024-10-06T13:17:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/06/mlr_8679447/large.jpg
A destroyer’s first deployment took an unexpected turn	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii&mdash;The USS Daniel Inouye's maiden deployment was supposed to be seven months long, and include mostly 'encouraging stability&rdquo; by working with regional partners like Japan and Korea as part of the Theodore Roosevelt strike group. But as tensions in the Red Sea heated up, the group's deployment was extended, and the brand-new destroyer received a fresh tasking: deter aggression and protect 'the free flow of commerce&rdquo; in the waters of the Middle East. While there, the crew heard an emergency call. 'A distressed mariner is a distressed mariner,&rdquo; Cmdr. Kevin Dore, the commander of the Inouye, said Friday after his ship and crew tied up at their homeport here. 'If an emergency like that happens, it is &lsquo;Get there as fast as you can and do everything you can' to save what, in this case, was two distressed mariners who happened to be Iranian.&rdquo; The crew sent search-and-rescue swimmers out in a small boat, rescued the mariners, and gave them medical assistance. 'That was really one of those moments where we see the team fully come together, because we knew there were lives at stake, and the crew gets that. It's incredible to watch that happen and really to be able to take action and to make a difference,&rdquo; Dore said. Cmdr. Ryan Kelly, the ship's executive officer, said the crew quickly drew on their training. 'Everyone was cool under pressure, and they executed the mission just like we asked, every single time. And that was just another perfect example of being ready for anything,&rdquo; Kelly said. The Inouye returned home Friday to a crowd of cheering families holding signs, leis, and in one case, a Starbucks iced coffee with a curly straw. 'I've been a part of a lot of great crews before, but this team on board Daniel Inouye is one of the most special and unique groups of people that I've ever been a part of,&rdquo; Kelly said. 'Every challenge, every piece of adversity that we felt through an entire nine-month deployment, they just delivered every single time.&rdquo; The homecoming is a key milestone for the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, which was commissioned in 2021 and named for Sen. Daniel Inouye, who represented Hawaii in Congress from 1959, when it became a state, until his death in 2012. Inouye earned the Medal of Honor for his service in the Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. The destroyer served as the air and missile defense commander for the Roosevelt strike group during the deployment, and Dore said the ship's helicopter detachment did 'a massive amount of flight ops,&rdquo; the vast majority of which were at night. 'We asked a lot of them, and they delivered,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/destroyers-first-deployment-took-unexpected-turn/400083/	2024-10-06T08:19:55-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/06/The_Arleigh_Burke_cl_2500/large.jpg
Iran’s Oct. 1 strike on Israel had several meanings.	Israel and Iran are at war. In truth, the two sides have been fighting for decades, but the conflict has played out largely under the cover of covert and clandestine operations. The recent actions of both sides in this once 'shadow war&rdquo; have changed the nature of the conflict. It is not clear that de-escalation is on the horizon. On Oct 1, 2024, Iran launched a massive, direct attack against Israel notionally in retribution for Israel's dual assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah's chief, Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. It was the second such barrage in six months. By many accounts, the previous Iranian attack against Israel on April 13 &ndash; which consisted of over 300 ballistic and cruise missiles and attack drones &ndash; caused very little damage to Israel. Perhaps because of this, and likely in part due to U.S. encouragement of restraint, Israel's immediate military response then &ndash; an airstrike against a single advanced Iranian air defense system in the Isfahan province &ndash; was somewhat measured. Many onlookers saw the calibrated exchange in April as a possible indication that both sides would prefer to de-escalate rather than engage in ongoing open warfare. But further Israeli military operations since then have prompted escalatory Iranian military responses, forcing the conflict back out of the shadows. With Hamas' capabilities and leadership degraded in the Gaza Strip, Israel's military leaders announced in June that they were 'ready to face&rdquo; Hezbollah &ndash; the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group whose persistent rocket attacks against northern Israel have caused tens of thousands to evacuate the area. Israel's pivot from Gaza toward Lebanon coincided with the July 31, 2024, assassination of Hamas' political bureau chairman, Haniyeh, during his stay in Tehran. The purported Israeli operation was seen as an affront to Iran's sovereignty. It was also an embarrassment that highlighted the vulnerability and permeability of Iran's internal security apparatus. Even though Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei vowed a 'harsh response&rdquo; against Israel, by September Iran had taken no action. Tehran's inaction caused many Middle East analysts to question if the Iranian response would ever materialize &ndash; and by extension, what that would mean for Khamenei's commitment to his proxy forces. If indeed Iran's leadership opted for restraint following the assassination of Hamas' top political leader, the same could not be said for its reaction to Israel's multiphase operation against Hezbollah in mid-September. Israel began with a clandestine operation to sow chaos and confusion in Hezbollah's command and control through the means of sabotaged explosive communications devices. Israel then carried out airstrikes eliminating Hezbollah's top leaders including Nasrallah. The Israeli military then launched what the country's leaders describe as a 'limited [ground] operation&rdquo; into southern Lebanon to remove Hezbollah positions along the northern border. Tehran's Oct 1. attack in response against Israel was, according to many Middle East experts and indeed Iranian military leaders, primarily a retaliation for the two high-profile assassinations against Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. These were certainly key factors. But as an expert on Iran's defense strategy, I argue that Iran's leaders also felt compelled to attack Israel for three equally, if not more important, reasons: to slow Israel's advance in Lebanon, to save face, and to restore deterrence. Iran hopes to slow and potentially reverse Israel's successes against Hezbollah, especially as Israel embarks on ground operations into southern Lebanon. Of course, Israeli ground troops must now deal with what is perhaps the world's most capable guerrilla fighting force &ndash; one that performed quite successfullyduring the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Nevertheless, Israel's ability to achieve a tactical surprise and eliminate Hezbollah's top leaders &ndash; even in the midst of an ongoing localized war, and even after Israel's leaders announced their intention to engage Hezbollah &ndash; reveals a far superior Israeli strategy and operational planning and execution capability than that of Hezbollah. And that presents a huge blow to what is seen in Iran as the Islamic Republic's crown jewel within its 'Axis of Resistance.&rdquo; In this respect, the Oct. 1 retaliatory strike by Iran can be seen as an attempt to afford Hezbollah time to appoint replacement leadership, regroup and organize against Israel's ground invasion. It also serves to help Iran save face, especially in how it's seen by other parts of its external proxy network. Orchestrated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC &ndash; Tehran's primary arm for coordinating external operations &ndash; Iranian money, training, guidance and ideological support enabled and encouraged the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack against Israel &ndash; even, as it has claimed, Iran had no prior warning of the assault. Since then, Hamas fighters have received almost no real-time support from Tehran. This lack of support has no doubt contributed to Hamas being successfully degraded as a threat by Israel, with many of its members either dead or in hiding and unable to mount a coherent offensive campaign, leading Israel's military leaders to claim the group has been effectively defeated. Unsurprisingly, Iran is glad to enable Palestinians to fight Tehran's enemies and absorb the human costs of war, because this arrangement primarily benefits the Islamic Republic. Once the fighting in Gaza started, the IRGC was nowhere to be found. Now that Israel has shifted its attention to Lebanon and scored several initial tactical successes against Hezbollah, Iran cannot afford to stand back and watch for two main reasons. First, a year of fighting in Gaza has demonstrated that Israel is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate threats along its borders &ndash; including a willingness to withstand international political pressure or operate within Iran's borders. And second, Iran's proxy groups elsewhere are watching to see if Tehran will continue supporting them &ndash; or will abandon them, as it seemingly has done with Hamas. Perhaps above all, in Tehran's calculus over how to respond is Iran's need to restore a deterrence. The two defining features of Iran's interrelated external, or 'forward defense,&rdquo; and deterrence strategies is its regional network of militant proxies and its long-range weapons arsenal, which includes a large number of advanced ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and attack-capable drones. These Iranian defense strategies seek to dissuade enemies from attacking Iran proper in two ways: first, by threatening Israel and other regional U.S. allies with punishment via proxy militia or long-range weapon attacks; and second, by offering scapegoat targets against which Iran's enemies can express their rage. In effect, Iran's proxy forces act as proxy targets that pay the costs for Iran's hostile policies. Israel's degradation of Hamas and ongoing operations against Hezbollah threaten to undermine Iran's ability to deter attacks against the homeland. For the Islamic Republic's leaders, this is an unacceptable risk. These interweaving imperatives likely prompted Iran's leaders to launch a second massive, direct missile attack on Oct. 1 against Israel. How effective the strike will be in achieving any of Tehran's aims is unknown. The Islamic Republic claimed that as many as 90% of the ballistic missiles reached their intended targets, while Israel and the United States characterize the attack as having been 'defeated and ineffective,&rdquo; despite unverified cellphone videos showing several ballistic missiles detonating after reaching land in Israel. What is almost certain, however, is that this will not be the last move in the conflict. Israel is unlikely to halt its Lebanon operation until it achieves its border security objectives. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed retaliation against Iran for its latest retaliatory attack. IRGC leaders met this warning with a counterthreat of their own that if Israel responds to the Oct. 1 attack militarily, Iran will again respond with unspecified 'crushing and destructive attacks.&rdquo; Rhetorically, neither side is backing down; militarily this may be true, too. The nature and scope of Israel's next move will dictate how the war with Iran develops &ndash; but make no mistake, it is a war.

The D Brief: Helene recovery; 100 new spy sats; Post-strike asses...	Hurricane Helene's death toll across the southern U.S. has now risen to 215, making it the deadliest storm to hit the mainland since Hurricane Katrina almost 20 years ago. (Hurricane Maria remains the deadliest, with nearly 3,000 who perished in Puerto Rico alone.) Just over a week after landfall, more than 740,000 people across five states are still without power. That includes 500,000 in the Carolinas and 200,000 in Georgia, according to PowerOutage.Us. For the U.S. military, 'More than 6,700 National Guardsmen from 16 states have been spearheading recovery efforts across the Southeast region in support of their governors, providing critical aid to those impacted by this storm's devastation,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Thursday. That includes service members who lost their homes but are still reporting for duty, according to Col. Paul Hollenack of the North Carolina National Guard. (Task & Purpose has more on that.) One thousand active duty troops from Army base Fort Liberty have also been tasked to assist with recovery efforts, Singh said. They'll be working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Volunteer pilots are bringing out their Cessnas to assist as well, with more than 350 flights ferrying supplies throughout the region via North Carolina's Concord-Padgett Regional Airport as of Thursday. 'Another 215 supply flights using helicopters have taken off from Hickory Regional Airport, which is about 60 miles northwest of Concord,&rdquo; NBC News reports.

On this day in 1957, the Soviets became the first to put a satellite into orbit with the successful launch of Sputnik 1, triggering what science historians refer to as the 'space race.&rdquo; Changing times in the spy satellite business: Until recent decades, the National Reconnaissance Office wouldn't acknowledge even one satellite it had in space. Now, the intelligence agency is speaking publicly about launching dozens in the past year and a half, Defense One's Audrey Decker reports. 'From last June to December of this year, we'll have probably launched 100 satellites,&rdquo; Christopher Scolese, director of the NRO, said at an event Thursday in Washington. The agency's first batch of operational satellites in this constellation launched in May, and the agency has since launched two more batches, Decker writes. But officials haven't disclosed the number of satellites in those first launches or how many the constellation will have in total. 'What are they going to be doing? They are part of the proliferated architecture to go off it and get us reasonably high-resolution imagery of the Earth at a high rate of speed,&rdquo; Scolese said. Continue reading, here. New: Despite an abnormality during launch, ULA sent its heavy-lift rocket into space Friday, declaring the second certification flight 'successful&rdquo; even though some material broke off one of its solid rocket boosters. Footage of the flight illustrated the anomaly, which could have changed the trajectory of the vehicle. Company CEO Tory Bruno said they did have 'an observation on SRB number one&rdquo; and will look into the abnormality. Background: ULA's much-anticipated rocket flew for the first time in January, but had to complete a second certification flight before it can start flying missions for the Space Force. The company is on a tight timeline to get Vulcan certified because it has to launch two Space Force missions, USSF-106 and USSF-87, by the end of the year. The problem with the booster could complicate Pentagon certification, depending on the investigation. Official reax: 'We are already starting to review the performance data from this launch, and we look forward to Vulcan meeting the certification requirements for a range of National Security Space missions,&rdquo; Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, Space System Command's Program Executive Officer for Assured Access to Space, and Commander of Space Launch Delta 45, said in a statement. Additional reading: 'Collapse of national security elites' cyber firm [IronNet] leaves bitter wake,&rdquo; the Associated Press reported Friday; 'Marine Corps' newest rotational force arrives in Philippines for 6 months of training,&rdquo; Stars and Stripes reported Friday.

Iranian missile attack, post-strike assessment. While Israeli troops continue attacking alleged militants in southern Lebanon, satellite imagery released Thursday seems to suggest a key Israeli air base was particularly bombarded with Iranian ballistic missiles during Tehran's multi-wave barrage at about 7 p.m. local time Tuesday. AP on Thursday published imagery taken by the commercial firm Planet Labs over Israel the day prior&mdash;roughly 24 hours after the Iranian attack. At least three military and intelligence bases appear to have been hit, according to a Washington Post analysis of satellite imagery published Friday. That includes the southern Nevatim air base; Tel Nof base, in central Israel; and Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters, near Tel Aviv. Expert reax: 'Our first count is that 32 missiles struck Nevatim air base,&rdquo; which hosts Israeli F-35 jets, Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute for Strategic Studies wrote on social media Thursday, illustrating those 32 apparent strikes with yellow pins. 'This should be no surprise,&rdquo; he said, noting, 'there is plenty of video showing the missiles raining down on Nevatim.&rdquo; 'They landed multiple hits in the area of F-35 hangers, with one possible direct hit, but not a lot of damage,&rdquo; said researcher Decker Eveleth. Why the apparent success rate? Hard to know for sure, Lewis notes. But he suggests a few possibilities, including Iran using 'Better missiles (more Fattah-1s instead of Emad).&rdquo; He also points to certain apparently 'exaggerated expectations for [U.S.-made] SM-3 and [Israeli] Arrow-2/3&rdquo; interceptors. 'They're good, but c'mon,&rdquo; Lewis writes. 'I don't think we've seen the maximum scale of [Iranian] attack by any means,&rdquo; another expert, Malcolm Davis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Reuters this week. That's partly due to Iran's maneuverable warheads, as Lewis explained in a bit more detail, here. Also visible in satellite imagery: Apparent Iranian launch points, including from a missile base south of Shiraz, as Decker and researcher Sam Lair pointed out with supporting imagery. Big picture consideration: After recent success against Hezbollah, Israel's military appears to be caught in a 'long game&rdquo; with no clear outcome, the New York Times reported Thursday from Jerusalem, citing the opinion of retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Assaf Orion, now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. For example, with history as a guide, 'After Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, it took [Israel] 18 years to withdraw forces from the Lebanese side of the border,&rdquo; Isabel Kershner of the Times writes. But considering the even longer history of internecine warfare around Palestine, it's anyone's guess how long the present conflict will endure. 'We are still in the middle of the movie,&rdquo; Orion said. More, here.

Lastly this week: We recently learned that after years working at the International Criminal Court in The Hague, a former war crimes lawyer with the United Nations has decided to go an entirely different direction with her life, and has pivoted to the almost impossible business of stand up comedy.

You can’t hide': Spy agency will have 100 new sats on orbit by y...	Until recent decades, the National Reconnaissance Office wouldn't acknowledge even one satellite it had in space. Now, the intelligence agency is speaking publicly about launching dozens in the past year and a half. 'From last June to December of this year, we'll have probably launched 100 satellites. So we are going from the demo phase to the operational phase, where we're really going to be able to start testing all of this stuff out in a more operational way,&rdquo; Christopher Scolese, director of the NRO, said today at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic & International Studies. At least some of those 100 belong to a new network of satellites that will collect information for the Pentagon and intelligence community. The agency's first batch of operational satellites in this constellation launched in May, and the agency has since launched two more batches. But officials haven't disclosed the number of satellites in those first launches or how many the constellation will have in total. The agency has launched demonstration satellites over the last few years 'to verify cost and performance,&rdquo; according to officials, but this year's satellites will start being used for real-time missions. 'What are they going to be doing? They are part of the proliferated architecture to go off it and get us reasonably high-resolution imagery of the Earth at a high rate of speed,&rdquo; Scolese said. [[Related Posts]] Growing this constellation of intel-gathering satellites will enable the United States to keep a persistent gaze on a given point on Earth, Scolese said. 'Now you can't hide because you're constantly being looked at.&rdquo; The agency will continue launching new satellites into various orbits for this architecture through 2028, and aims to eventually quadruple the number of satellites it has in orbit over the next decade. 'The NRO continues to build and fortify the largest government satellite constellation in history which has been enabled by a dynamic 18-month period, ending late this year, where 10+ missions will have launched and delivered more than 100 payloads on orbit. The purpose of this proliferated architecture is to increase revisit rates, enhance NRO's coverage, and capture and deliver&mdash;by orders of magnitude&mdash;more data to our users than ever before,&rdquo; an NRO spokesperson said in an email. But with the influx of satellites on orbit, and the heaps of data coming from those satellites, humans can't keep up, Scolese said, so the agency will need help from artificial intelligence to manage its satellite constellations better. 'Operating a proliferated architecture means that it's no longer possible to go off and for an individual sitting at a control center to say, I know what the satellite is doing. So we have to have the machines to go off and help us there. We need artificial intelligence, machine learning, [and] automated processes to help us do that,&rdquo; he said. Separate from NRO's planned network of satellites, the Space Development Agency has been building out its own proliferated constellation of satellites, called the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, or PWSA, which will start delivering operational capabilities for troops this year.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/you-cant-hide-spy-agency-will-have-100-new-sats-orbit-years-end/400047/	2024-10-03T14:00:05-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/GettyImages_2144495544/large.jpg
Senators want answers from DOD on quantum sensing efforts	Two U.S. senators are working across the aisle to get answers from the Pentagon about its efforts to advance quantum sensing&mdash;whose promises include jam-resistant position-navigation-timing systems&mdash;and whether the U.S. military can keep pace with China in the field. 'China is pursuing advances in quantum information science, some of which outstrip the efforts of the United States in scale and scope,&rdquo; Sens. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., write in an Oct. 3 letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, obtained exclusively by Defense One. 'To ensure that the United States maintains its technological advantage, DOD must have a strategic plan to integrate quantum sensing into our national security efforts.&rdquo; Hassan and Blackburn cite a September report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, or ITIF, that finds 'China leads in quantum communications&hellip;and matches the United States in sensing, excelling in market-ready tech, while the United States dominates high-impact areas.&rdquo; This points to a big contrast in the way the two countries are pursuing quantum technology in general. The United States leads in quantum computing&mdash;but real-world quantum computing applications are years away, in part because of the challenge of building machines to handle large numbers of qubits&mdash;the basic unit of information in the field. For instance, IBM hopes to have three 100,000-qubit computers&mdash;capable of solving some of 'the world's most challenging problems&rdquo;&mdash;but not until 2033. But quantum communication and sensing is closer to real-world applications today. Instead of trying to get subatomic particles to work together to process information, quantum sensing involves the (relatively) simpler observation of them. Because all atoms behave the same way, and all have mass, they can, for instance, create precise measurement data for phenomena like acceleration, allowing for, say, a drone or an aircraft to understand where it is anywhere on earth without receiving a jammable or spoofable GPS signal. The Defense Department and the services have various investments in quantum sensing, including a $55 million effort to lay the groundwork for moving to quantum sensors. But as the ITIF report points out, China has a clear lead in quantum communication and there are some indications that it is leading in quantum sensing as well, due in part, to a focus on these more near-term applications over quantum computing hardware development. 'Overall, China's strategic focus on near-term quantum technologies enables it to lead in technologies that are closer to market readiness.&rdquo; it reads. In their letter, Hassan and Blackburn press Austin for more details about how the Pentagon is coordinating its efforts among various services and offices; how it is coordinating with other federal agencies, some of which are out-spending the Defense Department; and asks simply: does the Defense Department have a strategic plan for quantum science? 'To ensure that the United States maintains its technological advantage, DOD must have a strategic plan to integrate quantum sensing into our national security efforts,&rdquo; the letter reads. Among the questions: 'What emerging threats and areas of concern has DOD identified that quantum sensing may play a role in addressing? How has DOD already worked to use quantum sensing to address these threats?&rdquo; &rdquo;What is the current breakdown of quantum sensing efforts within DOD, including the offices responsible for managing and moving forward overall DOD quantum efforts?&rdquo; 'What does DOD need from Congress to support, sustain, and accelerate quantum sensing technology for national defense?&rdquo; The senators want the answers to the questions by November 15.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/senators-want-answers-dod-quantum-sensing-efforts/400036/	2024-10-03T11:31:18-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/Screenshot_2024_10_03_at_8.30.03AM-1/large.png
DOJ, Microsoft disrupt Russian hackers targeting civil society or...	Microsoft's digital crimes team and the Justice Department seized some 100 website domains belonging to a Russia-backed hacking gang that's built a reputation targeting civil society organizations around the world. A civil action unsealed Thursday afternoon authorized the tech giant's Digital Crimes Unit to take down some 66 websites belonging to the group, dubbed Star Blizzard. Another 41 websites used by the group were seized by the Justice Department, according to a statement issued by Microsoft. Star Blizzard &mdash; also known as Seaborgium and Callisto in the cybersecurity community &mdash; has been a thorn in the side of U.S. cyber officials and international intelligence partners for some time. The group, likely tied to Russia's Federal Security Service, has been launching cyberattacks against governmental orgs, NGOs, academia and other institutions since at least 2019, DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said last year. The group's hacking activities expanded in 2022, targeting U.S. Department of Energy facilities, CISA said at the time. Microsoft said 82 of its customers were targeted by the hackers since January of last year, at a rate of around one attack per week. 'This frequency underscores the group's diligence in identifying high-value targets, crafting personalized phishing emails, and developing the necessary infrastructure for credential theft,&rdquo; said Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for the company's Digital Crimes Unit. 'Their victims, often unaware of the malicious intent, unknowingly engage with these messages leading to the compromise of their credentials.&rdquo; Star Blizzard has been deemed a top antagonist for phishing cyberattacks that target victims through email communications containing links that can siphon sensitive data or load malware onto targets' devices. Specializing in email credential theft, the collective has aimed to exploit NGOs and think tanks supporting government employees, as well as military and intelligence officials, Masada said. Phishing schemes have been particularly harder to identify because generative artificial intelligence tools have allowed attackers to craft more realistic-sounding scam messages in languages not native to their upbringing, researchers say. CISA has previously released guidance for civil society groups, focusing on activists, journalists, human rights workers and others affiliated with organizations that may face cyberthreats.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/doj-microsoft-disrupt-russian-hackers-targeting-civil-society-orgs/400046/	2024-10-03T09:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/100224MicrosoftNG/large.jpg
The D Brief: Russia hacks Taiwan; Diego Garcia shocker; ‘Sunken n...	New: Russian hackers have turned their sights on Taiwan, Dmitri Alperovitch noted Thursday on social media. Targets include Taiwanese companies and government agencies. Why now? Possibly because just last month, Taiwan's new president said that if Chinese Communist Party leaders' dream of annexing Taiwan is (as they allege) about restoring territorial borders from a bygone era, then China should take back land ceded to Russia back in the 19th century 'in the Treaty of Aigun during the Qing Dynasty.&rdquo; 'This clearly shows that the intention to invade Taiwan is not about territorial concerns,&rdquo; Taipei's President Lai Ching-te said. Rhetoric alert: Chinese leader Xi Jinping echoed the arguments of one of the deadliest dictators in history on Monday when he asserted at a state banquet in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, 'Taiwan is China's sacred territory. Blood is thicker than water, and people on both sides of the strait are connected by blood,&rdquo; according to CNN, citing state-run Xinhua news. Former U.S. Navy submariner Tom Shugart pointed out the chilling similarities with Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who wrote in Mein Kampf that the reunification of Germany and Austria 'is a life task to be carried out by all means! German-Austria must be restored to the great German Motherland&hellip; People of the same blood should be in the same REICH.&rdquo; Coverage continues below the fold&hellip; Welcome to this Thursday edition of The D Brief, brought to you by Ben Watson with Bradley Peniston.

On this day in 2015, the crew of a U.S. Air Force AC-130U gunship failed to consult their no-strike list for Kunduz, Afghanistan, and spent 30 minutes attacking a hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders. The early morning attack killed 42 people, including three doctors as well as others who were shot by U.S. gunners as they tried to flee the burning building. Officials later blamed a special operations commander on the ground, the gunship's aircrew, commanders at Bagram airbase, and a poorly-rigged antenna for contributing to the tragedy. Sixteen American troops were disciplined afterward, though none faced criminal charges. Leading U.S. security analyst: 'China Is Ready for War,&rdquo; Seth Jones of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies argued this week in Foreign Affairs. However, he explained, thanks to America's 'crumbling&rdquo; defense industrial base, the U.S. appears to be nowhere nearly as prepared for a conflict with China. The gist: 'Despite the country's current economic challenges, its defense spending is soaring and its defense industry is on a wartime footing,&rdquo; Jones writes. 'China has already caught up to the United States in its ability to produce weapons at mass and scale,&rdquo; and it has 'become the world's largest shipbuilder by far, with a capacity roughly 230 times as large as that of the United States.&rdquo; A few areas the U.S. should improve upon in the months ahead, according to Jones: Its 'anachronistic contracting and acquisitions system that is much better suited for the leisurely pace of peacetime than for the urgency of wartime&rdquo;; U.S.-based production of certain 'solid rocket motors, processor assemblies, castings, forgings, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions&rdquo;; It will also need to shore up its 'advanced battery supply chain,&rdquo; since so many of the components are dominated by China; And U.S. shipyards need to somehow increase their supply of 'engineers, electricians, pipefitters, shipfitters, and metalworkers.&rdquo; Related analysis: 'What reports got wrong about China's &lsquo;sunken nuclear submarine,'&rdquo; via J. Michael Dahm of Blue Path Labs with Peter W. Singer, writing Wednesday in Defense One. For one thing, there's little actual evidence that the sub was nuclear. For another, the discussion of the sub in Chinese-language sources reveals interesting things about the state of the Chinese naval industrial base. Read on, here.

'In looking at the history of US shipbuilding, two major trends stand out,' he writes. 'The first is the high cost of inputs, particularly labor and steel.' But the other factor is cultural, he argues. While some nations have been driven to build ships for trade or survival, the United States 'never appears to have been strongly motivated to make its shipbuilding industry an international success. Historically it has been isolationist, trading much more with itself than it has with other countries.&rdquo; Read the rest, here. From the region: The Brits just announced a major change in how it manages a quietly-influential territorial relic from the colonial era. In a joint statement with Mauritius on Thursday, the two nations announced the Chagos Archipelago is Mauritius's sovereign territory. This includes the strategic Diego Garcia island, which the U.S. military has used to carry out its post-9/11 global war on terrorism. However, 'both our countries are committed to the need, and will agree in the treaty, to ensure the long-term, secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia which plays a vital role in regional and global security,&rdquo; 10 Downing Street said Thursday. Fine print: 'For an initial period of 99 years, the United Kingdom will be authorised to exercise with respect to Diego Garcia the sovereign rights and authorities of Mauritius required to ensure the continued operation of the base well into the next century,&rdquo; the joint statement reads. The legal struggles of locals on Diego Garcia were thoroughly documented in a recent book from international law specialist ​​Philippe Joseph Sands entitled, 'The Last Colony: A Tale of Exile, Justice, and Courage.&rdquo; The Brits forcibly removed some 2,000 people from the island in 1973, diverting them to Mauritius and the Seychelles. Sands' account of that history is short but packed with emotion as he retraced just some of the lives disrupted by the Brits' determination to stay on Diego Garcia against the will of the UN General Assembly. 'The [new] treaty will address wrongs of the past and demonstrate the commitment of both parties to support the welfare of Chagossians,&rdquo; the joint statement reads. What's more, 'Mauritius will now be free to implement a programme of resettlement on the islands of the Chagos Archipelago, other than Diego Garcia, and the UK will capitalise a new trust fund, as well as separately provide other support, for the benefit of Chagossians.&rdquo; New small cruise missile slated for SOCOM gunship test. Leidos tells Defense One's Patrick Tucker that its Black Arrow, a relatively small cruise missile with a designed range of about 400 miles, passed preliminary tests that set it up for an actual test launch out the back of a U.S. Special Forces Command AC-140J gunship sometime this fall. Leidos, which is arguably better known for its weapons components than full-up rounds, exemplifies how digital engineering techniques are enabling the entry of new competitors in the missile market, and even the creation of new product categories.

Lastly today: The CIA is looking for informants from Iran, China and North Korea. The agency posted instructions Wednesday 'on how to securely contact us&rdquo; after it claimed unspecified success with the same approach targeting Russian speakers, Olivia Gazis of CBS News reported. 'We want to make sure individuals in other authoritarian regimes know that we're open for business,&rdquo; an agency spokesman said. According to NBC news, potential informants are advised 'not to use their home or work computer; employ only up-to-date web browsers; use the browser's private browser mode; delete computer searches and browser histories by following the CIA's instructions; use the Tor network or a trusted VPN service not headquartered in Russia, Iran or China or other country hostile to the U.S.; and use a &lsquo;kill switch' feature on the VPN service&rdquo; in case the VPN connection is lost.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-03-2024/400025/	2024-10-03T08:25:53-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/DB_lander/large.png
New small cruise missile slated for SOCOM gunship test	An upcoming test-firing of a small cruise missile is a step toward filling a rising need for U.S. special operators&mdash;and perhaps allies around the globe. Sometime this fall, Leidos aims to launch its under-development Black Arrow missile from an AC-130J furnished by U.S. Special Operations Command, building on hitherto unrevealed captive-carry and safe-separation tests conducted last December, according to a company statement. The effort by Leidos, better known for its weapons components than entire missiles, shows how digital technologies and open, modular design are enabling new entrants to the missile market and clearing a path toward cheaper, easier-to-built weapons. The Black Arrow is designed to answer SOCOM's 2021 call for a small air-to-ground cruise missile that can fly about 400 nautical miles and hit targets even when GPS is down. SOCOM said it needed such a missile because more advanced air defense systems were putting U.S. forces at greater risk in more places. The same can be said of many partner militaries, such as Ukraine. In August, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov invited inventors and companies to help the country develop new missiles. 'What are the next challenges where we need your help?&rdquo; Fedorov said at the GLOBSEC forum in Prague. 'How to invent effective laser guidance, how to develop AI for swarms of drones, how to produce Ukrainian HIMARS, how to develop cheap Ukrainian missiles to shoot down Shaheds?' But creating cruise missiles has generally required more money and time than outfits like SOCOM or Ukraine have to spend. SOCOM hired Leidos through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, that allowed the development process to move unusually quickly, a Leidos official told Defense One. The company spent more of its own money than usual on research and development, while the command furnished a test aircraft, range, and other resources. Leidos trimmed its own costs by using digital engineering techniques such as high-data modeling and digital twinning. 'We're circumventing the normal development time that can take a decade or more by accomplishing a lot of the work under the CRADA, and a key element of that is our reliance and confidence that we have on the digital models,&rdquo; the Leidos official said. 'We use [advanced digital modeling] in our hardware loop facility so that we can run literally hundreds of thousands and millions of trajectories and scenarios to make sure that not only do we fly well at the heart of the envelope that we understand, we've evaluated the corners of the fight envelope as well.&rdquo; But Leidos is not the only new entrant in the small-missile market. In September, Anduril announced its own family of small cruise missiles. And Y Combinator, the startup accelerator known for boosting small digital companies at their earliest stages, announced in August that they were backing Ares, their first cruise missile company. Leidos says they did extra work to ensure that their missile actually functions with the aircraft that the military wants to use. That digital modeling was key not just to designing the missile but also making sure that it could integrate with the NSWC Battle Management System and the AC-130. That's why the captive-carry and safe-separation tests were so important. With that done, they hope to move forward much more quickly with flight tests than is the norm for cruise missiles. 'And now, when we go in the fall, instead of an incremental buildup and test, we will move directly to a control-guided flight test relying on the fidelity and confidence that we have in the digital model,&rdquo; the official said. Digital modeling also makes it easier to modify the missile for more platforms, the official said. For example, a 400-mile cruise missile would give the slow, vulnerable MQ-9 drone more relevance in a high-end fight. 'It's 80 inches long, nine inches in diameter. So you could carry eight of these on an MQ-9, for instance. So now you start thinking about these MQ-9s that are vulnerable to enemy air defenses,&rdquo; said the official. 'It's sort of like a loaf of bread. It has various subsections that&hellip;we could lengthen the missile. We could shorten it. We could put a different front in it, on it. We could alter the body length.&rdquo; That could be a big huge advantage for militaries like Ukraine or other partners that are struggling to obtain and operate advanced fighter jets like F-16s but might be able to get other aircraft. 'You could put this on a C-138 that the Philippines have, all the hundreds of C-130s that our allied partners have, or other transport aircraft like the C-27. So the idea is simple, rapid integration.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-small-cruise-missile-slated-socom-gunship-test/400021/	2024-10-03T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/Screenshot_2024_10_02_at_11.20.27PM/large.png
Air Force taps Leidos to lead digital infrastructure for connect-...	The Air Force picked longtime defense IT contractor Leidos to develop and manage the guts of the service's next-gen command, control, and communications network Defense One has learned. The $303 million contract covers 'planning, analysis, and operations&rdquo; for the digital infrastructure network of the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System&mdash;a key component of the service's contribution to the Pentagon's connect-everything effort, called Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2. The Air Force also recently announced plans to bring more industry partners in to ABMS experiments. The Air Force's program executive office for command, control, communications and battle management runs point on ABMS and has been expanding its use of cloud-based command and control tools as part of its overall digital infrastructure plans for operators to improve battlefield communication. But the contract, which runs for three years with an option for two more, puts Leidos as the lead for stitching technologies together for ABMS' Digital Infrastructure Network. Defense One spoke with Chad Haferbier, who leads Leidos' multi-domain solutions division, to understand more about this largely classified initiative. He said the first order of business is sitting down with Air Force leadership to understand 'what they want to field, and how we can help them do that, and how we want to organize,&rdquo; then hiring more people to work on the solutions. What's the significance of this contract for the Air Force's Battle Network, the service's contribution to JADC2, and ABMS effort, which falls under that? The digital infrastructure is the backbone for the modernization aspects of battle management command and control. How do you start to connect things and share data and process that data? How do you build a network and manage that network and keep that operational and secure [while moving] data from tactical edge to operational, strategic decision makers? And if they're fielding elements of that network, we're going to be their partners to support them to make that vision a reality. What does that look like? This element is more focused on the infrastructure than it would be on the applications. [That means] supporting the Department of the Air Force in terms of where do we need to put this infrastructure to start to expose and share this data and keep it secure? And then move it to those, whether it be a tactical node or operational node or a tech or a strategic code&mdash;and that's all, speculation, I would say&mdash;and move that data to inform decision makers&hellip; in order to make those decisions in a timely manner. The DAF is really set out&mdash;and I'm super proud of that team, because they have actually turned all of these ideas and lightning bolts on PowerPoint charts into programs of record. And they've secured a budget from the Congress to go make investments to realize that connected-network vision. And the digital infrastructure is just a fundamental core element of that. How does this fold into the other work Leidos is doing in the JADC2 space, for the Air Force or elsewhere across the DOD? We're also making [independent research and development, or] IRAD investments in command and control applications, AI/[machine learning]-informed code generation. How do we start to bring in other domains in a meaningful way, and filter that data for the decision maker for what they need&hellip;so that we can be a preferred partner higher on the stack&hellip;as we start to bring all this data together. Have you been able to successfully do anything like this on the scale already? Even if it's in a lab where you're gathering a bunch of information from disparate locations. Proof points on our ability to be the integrator from the digital infrastructure side: The DISA contracts that we have and the Navy contracts. There are examples where we're showing our ability to make sense of all that data. A program that is also part of my team in [the Air Force's Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application, or] C2IMERA would be an example where we are collecting data from multiple sources to help assist base management in a crisis scenario. [During the] withdrawal from Afghanistan, C2IMERA was used pretty heavily to assist in those decision makers' ability to take all that data and make good decisions with the information. Let's say all of this goes well with the Air Force. This is a limited contract. How are you thinking about integrating and feeding into the bigger beast of combined joint all-domain command and control across the entire joint force? Because we're fully dedicated corporately to open architecture, not proprietary frameworks. What you've seen in the past are proprietary boundaries between systems, and so to have an integrator that is fully willing to tie their business strategy to being a trusted partner and deliver that open architecture and backwards compatibility. To me, that's why Leidos is a great selection to help with that. Even if there's open architecture, there can still be policy challenges when trying to link technologies. The recent news that [Maj. Gen.] Cropsey has become the executive agent for the Joint Fires Network in INDOPACOM is a great example of how a single acquisition entity can start to stitch together the services from a single service. You're always going to have to have an acquisition office to manage the procurement and the development with industry partners to realize the capability. And given the steps the Air Force has taken, the confidence that the DOD has now shown to them to give them the [Joint Fires Network] responsibility, I think that's huge in terms of progress towards a joint realization of that connectedness. Anything else? There are ongoing acquisition solicitations for mission partner environment networks that we are very interested in performing. [Such as] how do you use a software solution for [identity, credentialing, and access management, or] ICAM to adjudicate between NATO partners, what data they can see? Because right now, in the NATO environment, everyone has point-to-point networks, and so it's very manually intensive on how you share data. I believe the vision is to, how do you collapse that into a single network and then provide the security through software to rapidly enable allies and partners to to have access to the data that they can. We're investing in [independent research and development] to turn that data into information. We're also very interested in helping close the gap between the [intelligence community] and the DOD to expedite those data movements, and those information movements and decision abilities.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/air-force-taps-leidos-lead-digital-infrastructure-connect-everything-effort/400020/	2024-10-02T17:02:01-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/GettyImages_1661051950/large.jpg
Can ULA clear the final hurdle on Vulcan?	Despite delays, United Launch Alliance says its Vulcan heavy-lift rocket will still fly two missions for the Space Force before the end of the year&mdash;if the rocket's second flight goes smoothly. Vulcan had its maiden flight in January, years behind schedule. But ULA has to complete a second certification flight&mdash;scheduled to take off from Cape Canaveral this Friday&mdash;before the rocket can start flying operational missions for the Pentagon. So far, the second flight is on track to be 'another perfect launch like Cert-1,&rdquo; ULA CEO Tory Bruno told reporters Wednesday ahead of the launch. Bruno said he's confident that Vulcan will be certified in time to launch two Space Force missions, USSF-106 and USSF-87, by the end of the year&mdash;but that's a tight timeline considering that nine months passed between the first and second certification flights. Bruno didn't provide details on the service's certification timeline, but said 'as long as it's a very clean mission, it's a short number of weeks to get it all done.&rdquo; Pentagon officials have previously expressed concern over ULA's ability to ramp up its launch cadence essentially tenfold in the coming years. The company launched three rockets in 2023, but is slated to launch 25 national-security missions by the end of 2027. [[Related Posts]] In June, ULA co-owners Lockheed and Boeing formed an independent review team to keep Vulcan on track. Bruno said the team came up with 'great suggestions&rdquo; and tools for ULA to improve its production planning and management. 'I guess I'll say that everything that they brought to me as recommendations, I thought were great ideas, and I plan to do them,&rdquo; he said. ULA officials once hoped Vulcan would fly for the second time in April. But delays with the intended payload&mdash;Sierra Space's Dream Chaser space plane&mdash;pushed that timeline back. And since the Sierra payload still isn't ready, ULA will launch a dummy payload, plus some 'experiments and demonstrations,&rdquo; on the second certification flight, according to company officials. Since there isn't a customer for this second flight, ULA will eat the entire cost of the launch, which is in the 'high tens of millions of dollars,&rdquo; Bruno said. He admitted it won't be easy to get to 20 launches next year (split roughly half-and-half between the Vulcan and Atlas rockets), but said, 'I know how to do that, it needs to be done, and I'm not daunted at all.&rdquo; Vulcan is the centerpiece of ULA's plan to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which upended the space launch market ULA had dominated for years. SpaceX is also developing its own heavy-lift rocket, Starship. ULA made a huge bet on Vulcan, expecting Pentagon and commercial contracts for years to come, and has invested '$5 to $7 billion&rdquo; on the rocket itself, as well as more than a billion on infrastructure, to support bigger factories, more tooling, and more capacity throughout the supply chain, Bruno said. ULA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin are competing for a slew of launches under the Space Force's new satellite launch competition, called National Security Space Launch Phase 3. The companies will vie for $5.6 billion worth of contracts over the next five years.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/can-ula-clear-final-hurdle-vulcan/400019/	2024-10-02T16:46:20-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/GettyImages_1908310728/large.jpg
The US military must prepare for a second Trump presidency	Nobody's talking about how the rapidly approaching presidential election might affect the state of civil-military relations in this country. But we should be. The military in particular should be hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. The election promises two possible outcomes, each with serious implications for the military, its relationship with the next commander-in-chief, and society as a whole: Either we will elect a commander-in-chief in the traditional mold&mdash;one who unselfishly respects norms and limits, seeks to preserve and protect the Constitution and the institutions of democracy, and exerts responsible civilian control over a professional military dedicated to serving the nation. Or we will usher back into office a commander-in-chief who regularly denigrates those in uniform, seeks to undermine and circumvent the Constitution and the institutions of democracy, and selfishly uses the military for personal and political gain rather than to serve the public or national interest. The former electoral outcome promises to ensure the sustainment of a more-or-less stable equilibrium in civil-military relations in which all parties involved, notwithstanding any differences they might have, honor their constitutional obligations and respect behavioral, political, and ideological boundaries for the greater good. The latter electoral outcome, by contrast, will ensure that self-absorption, self-indulgence, and self-aggrandizement on the part of the commander-in-chief are permanently arrayed against the self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and self-respect of the military, thereby producing a perpetual state of ethical tension and upheaval for those in uniform. Civil-military relations are grounded in a tacit but binding social contract of mutual rights, obligations, and expectations among the parties to the relationship. Perhaps the defining precept of sound civil-military relations is civilian control of the military, the understandable recognition that a profession that considers itself the Profession of Arms&mdash;whose distinguishing area of expertise is the management of violence&mdash;must be directed and overseen by duly elected and appointed civilian officials answerable to the people if it is to have legitimacy. All civilian officials and military officers have sworn an oath to unreservedly support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For those in uniform, that oath is further underlain by their original enlistment oath, which swears them to obey the lawful orders&mdash;not ethical, prudent, or competent, but lawful&mdash;of those appointed over them. The paramount motive force behind these oaths is respect for and adherence to the rule of law. Ironically, civilian control is neither defined nor even mentioned specifically in the Constitution. References to its purported Constitutional roots derive solely from the designation of the President as commander-in-chief in Article II, and, by implication, from the several enumerated military-related powers assigned to Congress in Article I. Civilian control, properly exercised for reasons of state rather than for personal gain, owes its democratic character in large part to two defining principles of the military ethos: obedience to properly constituted authority and political neutrality. A power-hungry, power-driven commander-in-chief, motivated solely by self-interest at the expense of all else, would unreservedly exploit these deeply ingrained military imperatives to his own advantage, thereby reinforcing the steady accretion of power that has otherwise increasingly muscularized the presidency over time. Historian Arthur Schlesinger first awakened us to the imperial nature of the presidency. Others since have embraced the all-encompassing power they believe inheres in the so-called unitary executive. It is more truth than truism that absolute power is likely to produce absolute corruption, and the concentration of power in any person or office is feedstock for tyranny. A thus-empowered commander-in-chief wouldn't hesitate to employ any instrumentality, legal or illegal, ethical or unethical, that best serves his personal interests while disguised as serving the national interest. And he almost assuredly would claim personal ownership of a supplicant military to do his bidding. Until recently, the quintessential vehicle for doing this was the Insurrection Act, which, because it doesn't define what constitutes insurrection and doesn't subject the president to checks by Congress, leaves him free to take unfettered action against political opponents easily labeled clear and present dangers and enemies of the state. Such individuals and groups are obvious targets for a military steeped in dutiful obedience to lawful orders and possessed of a penchant for defending the nation against internal and external threats. The recent Supreme Court decision granting the president immunity from criminal acts in the conduct of official duties takes such presidential license to a whole new level. Since it's almost impossible to conceive of any presidential use of the military as unofficial or private business, the military is left to ask itself whether the unquestioning obedience, compliance, and silence it has tacitly agreed to provide should continue to be unconditional, or whether such limitations and inhibitions should be conditioned on the public and private actions of the commander-in-chief. All of this is to suggest that, depending on the results of the upcoming election, the military should be prepared to 'lawyer up&rdquo; in defense of its honor, integrity, and rights; to concern itself not merely with the legality, but also with the ethicality of the direction it receives; to scrutinize the motive and intent behind all such direction; and to fundamentally rethink its past orientation toward dissent and disobedience. Only by doing so, can the military expect to maintain its dignity and self-respect as an institution, while also preserving the binding social contract of civil-military relations. Gregory D. Foster is a professor at the National Defense University, where he previously has served as J. Carlton Ward Distinguished Professor and Director of Research and as George C. Marshall Professor.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/us-military-must-prepare-second-trump-presidency/400006/	2024-10-02T12:23:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/Republican_president_2500/large.jpg
What reports got wrong about China’s ‘sunken nuclear submarine’	The purported sinking of a Chinese nuclear submarine at a Wuhan shipyard pier is the latest example of Western reporting on military developments in China that overlooks important details and context, or even takes the wrong lessons from the fragments of stories they tell. The incident, which took place in June, drew some mention the following month on social media and even in the defense press, but it went viral after a Sept. 26 report in the Wall Street Journal touched off coverage from Fox News to CBS. What apparently lit up the U.S. media landscape were the assertions, attributed to unnamed U.S. defense officials, that the submarine was nuclear-powered. Many of the subsequent reports suggested that the incident revealed safety concerns about a new class of PLA Navy nuclear submarine and a serious setback for China's military modernization. These are mischaracterizations. Moreover, the reporting actually buried the lead. The shipyard accident tells us very little about the future of PLA naval modernization, but the submarine itself does. The afflicted boat was said to be a 'Type 041 Zhou-class submarine&rdquo; powered by a nuclear reactor. But tracing that claim to its origins reveals the importance of context and of using varied sources. The designation seems to have first publicly appeared in Chinese media sources in late 2023, which identified the 'Type 041&rdquo; as an improved variant of the Type 039C Yuan-class submarine. Two of the submarines were said to be in production at the Wuhan shipyard with advanced air-independent propulsion engines, not nuclear reactors. In spring 2024, rumors began to emerge on the Chinese internet that China was developing a nuclear reactor for a 4,000-ton submarine the size of the Type 039/041. Most of the world's nuclear-powered submarines are significantly larger. The rumors took off when Du Wenlong, a PLA senior colonel-turned-state-television commentator, appeared to drop veiled hints. 'Some people say that China is making a &lsquo;Type 041' small nuclear submarine,&rdquo; Du wrote, going on to argue that the PLA should indeed invest in such technology. Rumors continued to percolate over the summer, even as some Chinese military forums pointed out that China's only known nuclear-capable shipyard is in Huludao, on the northern Bohai Gulf, and that there were no indications that the Wuhan shipyard had received certifications to produce nuclear submarines. While it is possible that the Wuhan shipyard built this 'Type 041&rdquo; submarine only to have its nuclear power plant or fuel installed elsewhere, reactors and fuel rods are not something one just drops into a pressure hull. Installing a nuclear reactor post-assembly would be inefficient and unlikely. Moreover, China's limited experience in building nuclear submarines suggests that it would more likely evolve its designs from conventional to nuclear rather than launch a revolutionary, keel-up nuclear design in Wuhan. Further context comes from a PLA officer who had recently written that China's navy will focus on building more nuclear-powered submarines. The expansion of the Huludao nuclear shipyard over the past several years supports that claim. However, given its relative dearth of nuclear submarine design experience and engineering talent, it would be difficult for China to increase nuclear-submarine production at two shipyards simultaneously. The point is that a preponderance of public sourcing indicates there is far more uncertainty about the ship itself than the headlines would have it. Indeed, there is nothing in the available reporting that indicates an actual nuclear incident. The satellite photos showed four crane barges that may have been deployed to raise a sunken object, but no nuclear-response efforts were detected. This was not Chernobyl. What was missed Even worse, the media reports focusing on the potential nuclear nature of the shipyard accident missed what this submarine actually does tell us about PLA naval modernization. Today's Chinese subs lack a vertical launch system, or VLS, limiting their ability to carry and quickly fire land-attack and anti-ship missiles. The ill-fated submarine, by contrast, had an extended hull with a section that appears to contain a VLS. Chinese language sources indicate it would accommodate long-range YJ-18 anti-ship missiles or CJ-10 land-attack missiles. Nuclear-powered or not, the prospect of numerous, difficult-to-locate submarines that can deliver a vastly larger salvo of weapons against ships or air bases would boost Chinese capability and complicate allied defense plans. This story highlights the risk of both dropping into a topic and relying too much on unnamed U.S. military officials, who bring biases along with perspectives and information. In this case, the source appears to have been happy to highlight a Chinese submarine accident and what the incident may say about PLA capability. Yet U.S. defense officials&mdash;and the subsequent media reports&mdash;have said relatively little about the PLA's announcement that it successfully test-launched an ICBM deep into the Pacific Ocean, the very same week of the reporting about this shipyard incident that happened months ago. This story also underlines a larger problem in Western media reporting on China's military in recent years: too often, it swings between two extremes that portray the PLA as either comically inept or ten feet tall. The ICBM test reminds us of a similar media frenzy sparked by a dubious claim earlier this year. In January, Western media aired claims by unnamed U.S. officials that corrupt PLA officers had filled their missiles with water. The reporting seemed to be unaware that the Chinese term 灌水 (gu&agrave;nshuǐ), which does mean 'to pour water into&rdquo; but also references unscrupulous butchers adding water to meat to increase its weight and price, used metaphorically to refer to corruption. Yes, the PLA Rocket Force has experienced a crisis of corruption. No, they do not fill their missiles with water to cover up that corruption. Media coverage of nuclear issues in particular often suffers from mischaracterization and hyperbole. In July, the North American Aerospace Defense Command issued a statement about a flight of Russian Tu-95s and PLA H-6 bombers near Alaska; they were not, NORAD took pains to point out, seen as a threat. Several media reports, however, heralded Chinese 'nuclear-capable bombers&rdquo; patrolling near the United States. A quick reference check of the H-6 tail numbers clearly visible in the NORAD photos indicates these were H-6K variants, part of the PLA's Eastern Theater Command 10th Air Division, 28th Air Regiment. These aircraft were not the PLA's nuclear-capable H-6Ns. Again, yes, China has nuclear-capable bombers and is building up that capability; no, they did not fly into a U.S. air defense identification zone. The issues in U.S.-China security are of growing domestic interest and political importance, especially during an election season. As such, it is ever more vital that mass media reporting on PLA capabilities avoids the temptation to hunt for 'clicks&rdquo; and 'eyeballs&rdquo; and instead seeks out the details and context necessary to fully understand the implications of China's military modernization.

The D Brief: Iran’s missile attack on Israel; Russia seizes town;...	Shortly after U.S. officials predicted it publicly, Iran launched more than 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, with dozens flying over Jerusalem's Old City, a holy site for Muslims, Christians, and Jewish people around the world. Targets appear to have included Israel's Nevatim airbase (which was also attacked in April); the Tel Nof airbase; and possibly the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, as well as locations around Tel Aviv, Matt Savill of the Royal United Services Institute said. A 38-year-old man from Gaza hit by debris was the only death from Iran's attack. Why it happened: An Israeli airstrike Friday killed Iran-backed terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah along with a top Iranian paramilitary commander (Abbas Nilforoushan) while meeting at an underground facility in southern Beirut. Iranian generals felt some kind of missile attack was necessary in order to save face and appear strong to the world, three Iranian officials told the New York Times. Israel's Arrow and David's Sling air defense systems played the largest role intercepting Tuesday's barrage. Raytheon and Israeli defense firm Rafael teamed up for David's Arrow; Boeing and Israel Aerospace Industries joined forces to develop the Arrow. 'Both systems along with the Iron Dome were utilized during Iran's attack on Israel last April when 99% of the more than 300 drones, ballistic and cruise missiles launched by Iran were intercepted,&rdquo; Luis Martinez of ABC News reports. Also pitching in: Two U.S. Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea launched nearly a dozen interceptors at Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, Pentagon spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday. Those destroyers were the USS Bulkeley and the USS Cole. FWIW: 'The IDF and the U.S. Armed Forces cooperated together in defense several days before, during, and after the Iranian attack,&rdquo; the Israeli military said Wednesday morning, specifically noting Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi's conversations with U.S. Central Command's Michael Erik Kurilla. SecDef: 'I am deeply proud of the skill and the bravery of the U.S. troops who helped to save lives today from Iran's assault and who continue to support Israel's defense and to prevent a widening conflict or escalation,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Tuesday evening. 'Our forces remain postured to protect U.S. troops and partners in the Middle East, and the Department maintains significant capability to defend our people, provide further support for Israel's self-defense, and deter further escalation,&rdquo; Austin added. Israeli reax: 'Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it,&rdquo; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video posted to social media. Next steps: 'Israel will need to continue launching airstrikes further north if it wants to reduce further Hizballah's longer-range precision missile stockpile, or strike new leadership targets,&rdquo; RUSI's Savill says. 'The tempo of operations has already dropped off significantly from the first 48 hours of the Lebanon operation,&rdquo; Savill noted, 'but if it decides to launch a major strike against Iran in the near future, it might reprioritise aircraft away from Lebanon temporarily.&rdquo; Developing: Israeli ground troops are skirmishing with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon, including around the border town of Maroun el-Ras, Reuters reports from Beirut. The fighting has already claimed the life of at least one Israeli team commander and seven others, the IDF announced Wednesday. Israeli jets have also renewed airstrikes against suspected targets inside Beirut. What might lie ahead: Here's a map of Lebanese towns Israel is targeting and has asked residents there to leave, via the New York Times graphics team. Bigger picture consideration: 'Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks,&rdquo; Reuters reports, citing Lebanese government statistics. In addition, 'More than a million people have been forced to flee their homes,&rdquo; the wire service adds. For the latest, the BBC has a robust live blog you can review here. Related reading: 'As Crisis Builds, Lebanon's Government Is Nowhere to Be Found,&rdquo; former Beirut resident Vivian Yee of the NYTs reported Tuesday; And 'Lebanon's rescuers struggle to respond to Israeli offensive while under fire and using old equipment,&rdquo; the Associated Press reported Wednesday from Beirut.

After more than two years of attacks, Russian invasion forces have seized the small Ukrainian city of Vuhledar, a coal-mining town of about 10,000 people (before the war) along Ukraine's eastern front, the Institute for the Study of War reported Tuesday. Capturing the city could make it easier for Russia to advance on other two nearby cities occupying higher ground, Chasiv Yar and Toretsk, the Wall Street Journal reports. 'Over the past few days Ukrainian soldiers had to find their own way out of Vuhledar by foot as it was impossible to evacuate them otherwise,&rdquo; one soldier told the BBC. 'Many were wounded and killed by Russian drones and artillery as they tried to leave, another soldier, Roman, says. Many more are still missing.&rdquo; Meanwhile in Kyiv, nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries sent reps to the Ukrainian capital for the second International Defense Industries Forum, which President Volodymir Zelenskyy is hoping can boost Ukraine's domestic defense production. 'We need foreign expertise, access to supply chains, and technology to continue this growth,&rdquo; he said on social media Wednesday. In attendance: Reps from BAE Systems, KNDS, MBDA, D&M Holding Company, Amentum Services, Inc., AeroVironment, Inc., Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, Romarm, CZ Colt Group, Quantum Systems, Hellenic Defence Systems, and the DI Danish Defence & Security Industries Association, according to Zelenskyy's office. In the first half of 2024, 'Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&rdquo; Zelenskyy told the audience gathered in Kyiv Tuesday. 'We are producing artillery, our &lsquo;Bohdana' howitzers, at a rate of 15 units monthly, and sometimes as many as 20,&rdquo; he continued. And 'The total number of drones we are now capable of producing annually in Ukraine is 4 million,&rdquo; he said. 'While years ago, the Ukrainian defense industry unfortunately looked helpless, today it is an industry that is on its way to leadership, at least in Europe,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. 'There is no state sovereignty without the ability to defend oneself&hellip;we are grateful for everything we can do together today and in the future,&rdquo; he told his audience.

Vance at the debate: 'Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully,&rdquo; he said, omitting Trump's exhortation to 'fight like hell' to stop the certification of the 2020 election results, his repeated false claims of election fraud, and his efforts to stoke the ire of his supporters at a rally that morning. Vance also omitted mention of Trump's refusal to send in the National Guard as hundreds of rioters overwhelmed police and violently forced their way into the Capitol with the aim of stopping the transfer of power.

US destroyers intercept Iranian missiles as Mideast crisis intens...	Two U.S. destroyers fired a dozen interceptors to help Israel ward off a barrage of some 180 Iranian ballistic missiles, about twice as many as Tehran launched in its previously unprecedented April 14 strike, Pentagon officials said Tuesday evening. Unlike April's strike, Tuesday evening's included no drones, and the damage on the ground was minimal, spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. 'You don't launch that many missiles at a target without the intent of hitting something. So absolutely, just like the last time, their intent is to cause destruction,&rdquo; Ryder said. 'Fortunately, you know, Israel has very significant air defense capabilities, and the U.S., of course, played a role in helping on that front as well.&rdquo; Working with Israeli air defenses, the U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers Bulkeley and Cole fired a dozen interceptor missiles during the strike, he said. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that the U.S. and Israel will work to impose 'severe consequences for the attack.&rdquo; 'This is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which no one was killed in this attack in Israel,' Sullivan told reporters during the press conference. The strike happened as Israel launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, following Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah last week. Ryder said Israel told the United States the offensive will be 'limited,&rdquo; and 'focused on dismantling facilities that Hezbollah has built along the border to stage attacks into Israel.&rdquo; Israel says 63,000 of its citizens have been displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire. At the same time, nearly one million Lebanese people have fled their homes to avoid Israeli attacks, the United Nations said yesterday. In discussions between United States and Israeli officials about the ground offensive, the U.S. wants to ensure 'there's an understanding as far as potential mission creep &hellip; as it relates to the broader tensions in the region,&rdquo; Ryder said. Israel media reported Tuesday that the Israeli military plans to conduct 'powerful strikes&rdquo; on targets across the Middle East in response to the Iranian attack. The U.S. is also sending more military assets to the Middle East. On Tuesday, U.S. CENTCOM announced that three additional squadrons of F-15Es, F-16s, and A-10s have already arrived in the region. 'Fighter aircraft can can perform a variety of missions, to include taking down drones, taking down missiles, particular kinds of missiles, as well as, you know, providing ISR electronic warfare and types of capabilities,&rdquo; Ryder said about the additional aircraft squadrons. 'So all of this comes together to provide us with options on how best to respond to any type of attack and to protect our forces.&rdquo; Ryder did not confirm Iranian reports that a Fattah-2 hypersonic missile was used and destroyed an Israeli Arrow battery, saying that the Pentagon is still assessing the strike.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/us-destroyers-fire-dozen-interceptors-against-iranian-missiles-middle-east-crisis-intensifies/399979/	2024-10-01T14:09:05-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/01/bulk_230120_N_TC847_1010/large.jpg
Two years after rollovers, Marines’ ACV is landing on Pacific bea...	The Marine Corps is gingerly introducing its new Amphibious Combat Vehicle to its intended habitat&mdash;the coasts of Asia&mdash;two years after two surf rollovers led the Corps to suspend the vehicle's water operations. One requirement: no big waves. Before using the ACV to land Marines in a combined U.S.-Korean exercise this summer, the Corps ran a 'detailed hydrographic study&rdquo; that assessed the beach, waves, current, and surf, a Marine Corps spokesperson said. After the Marines determined that there was a 'negligible surf zone&rdquo; on the planned beach, the ACV got the thumbs-up for the Aug. 26-Sept. 7 Exercise Ssang Yong 24. That marked the Korean peninsula debut for U.S. ACVs, which are also operated by South Korean forces. The careful use of the ACV, which followed a similar May exercise in the Philippines' Palawan province, was carefully monitored to glean data about how to safely operate the vehicle. The exercises are part of the first ACV's first deployment, with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which also included the vehicle's first overseas ship-to-shore operations. [[Related Posts]] 'Part of this deliberate fielding includes understanding how the ACV responds when operating in its intended environment,&rdquo; the spokesperson said. The use of the ACV in Korea comes nearly two years after the four-year-old vehicle rolled over in two different incidents in the surf zone near Camp Pendleton. While no Marines were injured in either incident, the Corps subsequently restricted operations to land or the Del Mar Boat Basin, which offers protection from waves. Subsequent Corps statements noted mechanical problems with the ACV design and cited a need to retrain crew members familiar with the Corps' previous system, the Amphibious Assault Vehicle. In July 2023, the first class of an improved version of ACV training graduated from their course. The Corps previously used the decades-old Assault Amphibious Vehicle for amphibious landings and operations. In 2020, one AAV sank during a training exercise off the coast of California, killing eight Marines and a sailor. Those Marines were preparing for a previous deployment with the 15th MEU.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/two-years-after-rollovers-marines-acv-landing-pacific-beaches/399962/	2024-10-01T11:41:55-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/01/U.S._Marine_Corps_Am_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: Israeli troops in Lebanon; More Red Sea ship attacks...	Israeli troops have launched additional ground operations inside Lebanon, advancing their gradual escalation northward to push Iran-backed terrorists out of weapons caches and hideouts across southern Lebanon. The Israeli military describes these latest maneuvers as 'limited, localized, targeted operations&rdquo; whose goals include 'dismantling Hamas, bringing our hostages back home and restoring security in northern Israel.&rdquo; Developing: Iran is allegedly preparing another ballistic missile attack on Israel, possibly similar to what it carried out in mid-April, Barak Ravid of Axios reported Tuesday, citing White House officials. 'We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack,&rdquo; the administration official said, and warned, 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.&rdquo; Rewind: Iran's April 13 attack on Israel featured an estimated 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and at least 120 ballistic missiles. After extensive interceptions by Israeli air defense systems&mdash;and by U.S., Saudi and Jordanian assets&mdash;those attacks resulted in no deaths, but more than two dozen people were reportedly injured from shrapnel and debris. Also new: Israeli jets allegedly struck several locations in southern Syria on Tuesday, including the al-Thaala Airbase, and early warning radar site in Tel al-Kharouf, an army base in al-Nahta, an airbase near Maliha al-Atrash, and the Syrian army's 7th Air Defense Brigade near al-Sanamayn, according to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute in Washington. For what it's worth: Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin seems to have given his blessing to Israel's ground raids into southern Lebanon. After a call Monday with his Israeli counterpart, Austin wrote on social media that he 'agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hizballah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel's northern communities.&rdquo; He also 'reiterated the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel,&rdquo; according to his statement. Update: There are now an estimated 43,000 American troops and at least a dozen U.S. ships in or near the Middle East after officials added troops and equipment over the past few days, the Associated Press reported following a tight-lipped briefing Monday at the Pentagon. What's new? 'A certain number of units already deployed to the Middle East&hellip;will be extended, and the forces due to rotate into theater to replace them will now instead augment the in-place forces,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said. 'I won't talk specific timelines or numbers for OpSec reasons, but I can tell you these augmented forces include F-16, F-15E, A-10, F-22 fighter aircraft and associated personnel,&rdquo; she added. Meanwhile near Yemen, a suspected Houthi drone boat attacked another commercial ship in the Red Sea, British maritime authorities reported Tuesday. That attack punctured a 'port ballast tank&rdquo; that helps the vessel to stay afloat and under control. A separate attack in a similar location by a single missile reportedly damaged a second commercial ship. The two vessels attacked: Panamanian-flagged crude tanker Cordelia Moon and Liberian-flagged bulk carrier Minoan Courage, according to industry-watcher Sal Mercogliano. Both vessels were heading north toward the Suez Canal, the Associated Press reports from Dubai. Worth noting: 'CORDELIA MOON is currently empty,&rdquo; which 'makes her MORE explosive&hellip;as well as a more attainable target due to her increased height above sea level,&rdquo; the monitoring account TankerTrackers reported after the strikes Tuesday. FWIW: The Houthis also claim to have shot down another U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, according to allegations aired Monday. The Houthis have in the past shot down several MQ-9s over Yemen; but they've also made several similar claims without releasing any supporting evidence. So far there is no supporting evidence for this latest allegation. The October 7 attacks, one year on: Monday is the one-year anniversary of Hamas terrorists' surprise attack on Israel, which killed more than 1,100 Israelis and helped fan the flames of war that's swept through Gaza and now into southern Lebanon. Several U.S. think tanks are hosting panel discussions this week at least partly in an effort to envision what might lie ahead for the region and for U.S. interests throughout the Middle East. Questions include: What more can be done to prevent wider regional escalation? What is the likely trajectory over the next few months towards a durable ceasefire? What is the future of Israel's military presence in Gaza? Is a Palestinian state in the offing? Events have been planned at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, which invited Dana Stroul, the recently departed U.S. deputy assistant defense secretary for the Middle East, for a conversation that took place this morning. Washington's American Enterprise Institute invited former U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula for a discussion on the afternoon of Oct. 7. And London's Royal United Services Institute is hosting a panel with four of its experts next Monday as well at about 8 a.m. ET. Details and registration here.

On this day 100 years ago, the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter was born in Plains, Georgia. The former Navy submariner is the first U.S. president to live to 100. Replicator 2 effort aims to produce anti-drone defenses. Thirteen months after the Pentagon launched an attempt to buy small drones fast and cheap enough for an actual war, a second phase will try to do the same for anti-drone systems. 'Dubbed Replicator 2, the effort will focus on the threat to installations and 'force concentrations,&rdquo; according to a Sept. 27 memo released on Monday from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Pentagon will ask for money for the effort in the fiscal 2026 budget request now under construction and that deliveries will be expected within 24 months of the budget's passage, reports Defense One's Sam Skove. By the way: The Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit is looking for help building the kind of drones that Replicator 2 aims to down. Read their request, issued Monday. Video: Russian fighter jet nearly sideswipes U.S. F-16. On Monday, U.S. aircraft intercepted Russian warplanes in the Alaskan air defense identification zone, said Gen. Gregory Guillot, who leads U.S. Northern Command. 'The conduct of one Russian Su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all&mdash;not what you'd see in a professional air force,&rdquo; Guillot said in a statement that accompanied cockpit video of the Russian maneuver. Watch, here. The Navy's new missile sub could cost 'hundreds of millions&rdquo; more than the service estimates, the Government Accountability Office says in a blunt report released on Monday. GAO says the Navy and General Dynamics Electric Boat, the prime contractor on the Columbia class, still haven't fixed the problems that drove the cost of the lead boat to an estimated $8.6 billion and put it 12 to 16 months behind schedule&mdash;even as they move into a complicated phase of construction that is likely to bring new challenges. Worse, neither the Navy nor Electric Boat fully understands why the problems happened in the first place, says the report. Don't miss the report's explanation of 'supplier development funding,&rdquo; the billions of dollars that the Navy has spent since 2018 to upgrade suppliers' factories and place advance orders in a bid to prop up the 3,500 companies that make components for submarines. Defense One's Lauren C. Williams reports, here. Can cellphones spot Russian jammers? A U.S. firm that's running experiments in Ukraine has found that phones can be networked together to reveal when one or more is under electronic threat, Sean Gorman, a founder of Zephr, tells Defense One's Patrick Tucker. Read on, here. Developing: More than 5,000 National Guard troops from at least nine different states have teamed up to help with Hurricane Helene relief efforts, the Pentagon said Monday. That includes troops from Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, New York, South Carolina, Florida, and North Carolina. Florida alone has involved nearly 3,500 of its Guardsmen 'along with hundreds of tactical vehicles, and boats, and 11 rotary wing assets,&rdquo; Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has sent personnel to Georgia, as well as dam, levee and bridge inspection specialists to Tennessee and Kentucky while others are working to restore temporary power to North Carolina. 'Helene is already one of the deadliest, costliest storms to hit the US,&rdquo; USA Today reports. So far, more than 100 people have died from the powerful storm as it swept north from the Florida coast. 'Only eight hurricanes have killed more than 100 people since 1950, the last time a storm as deadly as Helene hit the US came in 2017, when Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Houston and was blamed for 103 deaths,&rdquo; USA Today writes. Read more, here. And lastly: NATO finally has a new chief in former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. He took the helm Tuesday after the departure of Norway's Jens Stoltenberg, who at 10 years was the alliance's second-longest serving secretary-general in its seven-and-a-half decade history. Rutte listed three goals for NATO at the outset of his new tenure: 'We must spend more. There is no cost-free alternative if we are to rise to the challenges ahead and keep our one billion people safe,&rdquo; he said; The alliance must 'Step up our support for Ukraine&hellip;because there can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine&rdquo;; And he intends to 'strengthen our partnerships&rdquo; with countries outside the 32-member alliance. 'Rutte has an impressive track record as a consensus-builder and decisive leader,&rdquo; U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement. He also shared his 'deep gratitude to Jens Stoltenberg, who led the Alliance through the most consequential decade for Euro-Atlantic security since World War II.&rdquo; Stoltenberg's parting thoughts: 'We have undergone the biggest transformation of NATO in a generation,&rdquo; rising from 'zero to eight NATO battlegroups, with tens of thousands of combat-ready NATO soldiers on our eastern flank,&rdquo; he said Tuesday in Brussels. 'We have gone from thousands to half a million troops on high readiness, and from three to twenty-three allies spending at least two percent of GDP on defence,&rdquo; he said.

The Navy’s new missile sub could cost ‘hundreds of millions’ extr...	The U.S. Navy's next ballistic-missile submarine is already late and over budget&mdash;and the actual overrun might nearly quintuple the service's projections, a government watchdog agency says. 'Our independent analysis calculated likely cost overruns that are more than six times higher than Electric Boat's estimates and almost five times more than the Navy's. As a result, the government could be responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional construction costs for the lead submarine,&rdquo; the Government Accountability Office wrote in a Sept. 30 report on the Columbia-class submarine program. Why the disparity? GAO says the Navy and General Dynamics Electric Boat, the prime contractor on the Columbia class, still haven't fixed the problems that drove the cost of the lead boat to an estimated $8.6 billion and put it 12 to 16 months behind schedule&mdash;even as they move into a complicated phase of construction that is likely to bring new challenges. Worse, neither the Navy nor Electric Boat fully understands why the problems happened in the first place, says the report, an unclassified version of a sensitive one produced in July. The Navy says Electric Boat 'needs to take swift and significant actions to address the causes of poor construction performance,&rdquo; says GAO, adding bleakly, 'However, the program has tried to mitigate some of these causes&mdash;such as late materials and detailed design products&mdash;for years.&rdquo; Electric Boat remains unjustifiably optimistic, the report says: the company's current estimate for cost and schedule 'assumes significant future improvement that GAO's past work suggests is unrealistic.&rdquo; The Navy has its own analytic problems, GAO says: it is pouring billions of dollars into the submarine industrial base without properly gauging the results. In the decades since the Cold War, the number of U.S. companies that make parts for Navy submarines has dwindled from about 17,000 to some 3,500, reducing competition and making some parts harder to get. Since 2018, the Navy and its shipbuilders have been trying to ensure that these second- and third-tier suppliers&mdash;some of whom are the last remaining source for specific parts&mdash;have the equipment, steady orders, and cash flow needed to preserve their expert workforces and continue to make their specialized products. (Examples include spherical air flasks, hull valves, and items for outfitting missile tubes, GAO writes.) To do this, the Navy and shipbuilders disburse 'supplier development funding,&rdquo; in two categories: 'direct investments in suppliers&rdquo; that pays for equipment, factory upgrades, and workforce development; and 'specialized purchases to signal demand&rdquo;: orders to help keep the companies able and willing to produce even when their products are not immediately needed. Most of this supplier development funding flows through the shipyards. Since last year, the non-profit startup BlueForge Alliance has helped the yards coordinate these disbursements, GAO writes. But the Navy isn't doing what's needed to assess whether it's spending the money wisely, GAO found. 'The Navy has not consistently defined information needed to determine whether investments made in the supplier base have increased supplier production or generated cost savings and how those results support the program's goals,&rdquo; the report says. 'Since 2018, the Navy reported receiving more than $2.6 billion to invest in the submarine supplier base and help achieve Columbia class construction goals. Without identifying consistent information, the Navy is not well positioned to ensure that these investments will effectively spur their intended benefits for the program.&rdquo; The Navy has increased its requests for supplier development and special purchases funding in recent years, from $326 million in fiscal year 2023 to $1.26 billion in fiscal year 2025, according to the report. The watchdog agency issued five recommendations for the Navy, including 'consistently identifying information needed to determine whether production improvements and cost savings from supplier development funding are sufficiently supporting Columbia class construction goals.&rdquo; The Navy agreed with all of GAO's recommendations, including ordering shipbuilders to redo their estimated costs, with analysis, at completion as well as spelling out what data is needed to 'determine whether investments in the supplier base support Columbia class construction goals.&rdquo; In response to the supplier development funding recommendation, the Navy said it would 'ensure supplier development funding contracts continue to require recipients to provide specific targets for cost savings, cost results following project completion to support analysis of return on investment and project impact.&rdquo; There's more at stake than just money; the program is in a race against time. The USS District of Columbia is supposed to enter service by 2027, when the first of the Ohio-class missile boats&mdash;the current bearer of America's undersea nuclear deterrent&mdash;reaches the end of its service life. The $130 billion effort to build one dozen Columbias is the Navy's highest-priority acquisition program.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/price-navys-new-missile-sub-might-skyrocket-gao-warns-scathing-report/399951/	2024-09-30T19:37:47-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/30/sub_DCS24_1_15_Edit/large.jpg
A group in Ukraine is testing the newest weapon against GPS jamme...	An American company working with the Ukrainian military is developing a cheap and easy-to-deploy solution to sophisticated Russian electronic warfare tactics: networks of regular cell phones running specialized software. The software allows the cell phones to locate enemies that are using jamming equipment, and if the experiment is successful, it could help operators on the ground regain at least some advantage against better-armed foes in the era of electromagnetic warfare. From there, it could change the way cell phone network providers ensure their devices can stand up to sophisticated attacks. Russian electronic warfare measures are having a deleterious effect on Ukrainian troops' ability to push out the Kremlin's invading forces&mdash;even if the Ukrainian troops are armed with high-end U.S. weapons. And it can be hard to even detect when drones or other pieces of equipment are failing because of signal jamming, GPS spoofing, or just internal problems. Detecting and finding adversary jamming devices usually requires high-end software-defined radios, the sort of equipment the United States and other well-funded militaries can issue to their troops, but that smaller militaries with constrained budgets, like Ukraine's, struggle to acquire in large numbers. Around Christmas, the Ukrainian military reached out to Sean Gorman and his group at Zephr, a company that specializes in making GPS-signal reception more resilient to interference. The group sent six Android Pixel phones loaded with Zephr's software to Ukraine in early 2024, and in April began conducting field tests near Ukraine's frontlines in Donetsk. 'We strapped those phones to drones. We put them in cars. We set up stationary stands for them and then we've also been doing controlled experiments where they use their own jammer, so we know the location of it,&rdquo; Gorman told Defense One. The first objective: see if regular consumer phones, working together in a network, could reveal the existence of an entity trying to jam GPS location data, even if that location data appeared to be correct on any one of the devices. They measured how well phones that were moving&mdash;strapped to a drone and carried by car&mdash;received GPS signals, compared to phones that were static. The findings: It's possible to detect when specific GPS receivers are experiencing an attack, by contrasting their GPS trace to that of other phones. 'We're basically exploiting the sensors on the phone,&rdquo; Gorman explained. 'The most helpful sensor on the phone is the raw [global navigation satellite system, or GNSS] measurements that the phone provides. So you have AGC, the automatic gain control, you have Doppler [sensor], you have carrier phase, you have code phase,&rdquo; and other data cell phones collect about their distance from satellites, cell towers, and other pieces of network equipment. Manufacturers put these sensors in cell phones so the phone can figure out how to optimize performance, for example by detecting where the nearest cell tower is. But these measurements all play a role in the GPS processing software phones use to tell the consumer where they are. When you can get that data from a wide variety of phones, you can figure out which ones are under attack. 'With the computational AI we're running on the back end, and the sophistication of how we're processing most signals and software, instead of just depending on sensors or really expensive antenna arrays, there's a heck of a lot you can do networking phones together as one big distributed antenna&rdquo; Gorman said. The tests also revealed new insights into Russian electronic warfare efforts. Russia is spoofing GPS signals in the Baltic Sea, causing what NATO officials have described as an unsafe situation for consumer aircraft. Spoofing GPS doesn't just block the signal. It tells the receiver that they are somewhere they are not. Most of the time, when adversaries try to spoof GPS locations for drones, they will tell the drone that it is actually at an airport, as most consumer drones are built to try to land or retreat from restricted airspace. On the frontlines in Donetsk, Ukraine's soldiers often report spoofing attacks aimed at their drones. But Gorman and his team found that much of this 'spoofing&rdquo; activity is actually just high-powered jamming attempts. Because those attempts are occurring in the same frequency bands as GPS or GNSS, they appear like satellite signals, effectively creating phantom or ghost satellites in places where they could not possibly exist and still provide signal, such as beneath the horizon. 'This noise doesn't resemble a typical GNSS signal, but it does contain energy at the frequencies where the receiver is looking for satellite signals. The receiver's signal processing algorithms use correlation techniques to identify and track satellite signals. When a strong jamming signal is present, it can cause false correlations, leading the receiver to &lsquo;think' it's detecting satellites that aren't actually visible,&rdquo; Gorman explained in a write up of the testing provided to Defense One. The group, now working under a contract with the Ukrainian government, is trying to take the research a step further to not just detect jammers but triangulate their positions so the jammer can be avoided (or eliminated). 'The new techniques we are building will estimate the location of signals of interest using three inputs: 1. localization by range inferred from power 2. localization by area of effect and 3. triangulation of jammers based on angle of arrival,&rdquo; Gorman said in an email. 'Each smartphone will detect the interference signal, log the last known position, and timestamp the reception, providing data points across the network. By aggregating and processing these signals centrally, the system will triangulate the jammer's position.&rdquo; The U.S. military is investing heavily in alternatives to GPS, usually referred to as alternative position, navigation, and timing&mdash;or Alt PNT&mdash;to help people, drones, etc. figure out where they are. But investments that haven't shown a great return in many cases. 'None of it works without an initial known position. And it's almost impossible to get an initial known position without having GPS,&rdquo; Gorman said. This networked approach won't replace other more expensive military systems for detecting and finding jammers, he said, but it does present a solution that can be deployed quickly and cheaply for militaries like Ukraine or other groups that could be disrupte by jamming activities, such as first responders. And while it won't replace efforts to develop alternative position, navigation and timing methods, it might make them more effective. 'Maybe there's a radically different way to think about this? Instead of throwing all the resources towards Alt PNT, GNSS resilience, which are all super helpful, maybe we can look at how this is now a reality? How well can we map all of this and understand an area back to where the emitters are so that we can dodge those areas and we can remove the emitters?&rdquo; Gorman said. But, he said, 'There isn't a [silver] bullet.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/group-ukraine-testing-newest-weapon-against-gps-jammers-cell-phones/399952/	2024-09-30T16:54:25-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/30/GettyImages_2153058214/large.jpg
VIDEO: Russian fighter jet nearly sideswipes US F-16	Cockpit footage released by the North American Aerospace Defense Command shows a Russian warplane closely buzzing by a U.S. F-16 fighter jet last week&mdash;a move U.S. officials have publicly called out as dangerous and unsafe. 'On Monday Sept. 23, NORAD aircraft flew a safe and disciplined intercept of Russian military aircraft in the Alaskan [air defense identification zone]. The conduct of one Russian Su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all&mdash;not what you'd see in a professional air force,&rdquo; Gen. Gregory Guillot, head of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, said in a statement Monday. The footage shows the Russian fighter maneuvering into the F-16's path. The Russian fighter jet was one of two Su-35s that were escorting two Russian Tu-95 bombers in Alaska's air defense identification zone, a stretch of international airspace near North America. Russian aircraft fly in this airspace often, but the closeness of this encounter, and video release, is notable. Guillot has recently called for more domain awareness in the Arctic region, after Russian and Chinese aircraft were intercepted this summer in Alaska's ADIZ. NORAD officials said those aircraft came as close as 200 miles from the U.S. coast.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/watch-russian-su-35-nearly-collides-us-fighter-jet/399926/	2024-09-30T11:27:27-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/30/Screenshot_2024_09_30_at_8.14.26AM/large.png
Replicator 2 effort aims to produce anti-drone defenses	A second phase of Replicator&mdash;the Pentagon's year-old, high-profile effort to buy thousands of cheap-ish autonomous weapons&mdash;aims to procure defenses against small drones. Dubbed Replicator 2, the effort will focus on the threat to installations and 'force concentrations,&rdquo; according to a Sept. 27 memo from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The memo, released on Monday, says the Pentagon will ask for money for the effort in the fiscal 2026 budget request now under construction and that deliveries will be expected within 24 months of the budget's passage. The memo directs Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Christopher Grady, 'working with Component heads through the Deputy's Innovation Steering Group,&rdquo; to 'oversee the development of a Replicator 2 plan.&rdquo; Its execution will be led by the Defense Innovation Unit, working with the defense undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, the Pentagon's point person on counter-UAS systems. The service branches will handle development, production, and fielding of systems. The setup mimics the first Replicator effort, whose initial contracts were awarded earlier this year, one Defense Department official told Defense One. 'Most of the work that's already being done has been headed up by the Army and the Marine Corps,&rdquo; the official said. 'Where [the Deputy Defense Secretary and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] are going to be able to help is bring some of the department's capabilities to bear in terms of scaling things up, clearing up some policy issues and authorities issues, especially when it comes to counter-UAS in the United States.&rdquo; The official added, 'We can cut red tape and make things move.&rdquo; A number of offices already pursue anti-drone work, such as the Army-led Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and the Marine Corps' Capabilities Development Directorate. And Austin has made counter-drone defenses a special focus, launching a counter-UAS working group in March. U.S. forces regularly fight off drones in the Middle East. The Army faces drone attacks against its bases there; in February, three Americans were killed and more than 40 wounded by drones in Jordan. The Navy, meanwhile, frequently shoots down drones launched from Yemen. Some of the most powerful drones faced by U.S. forces are variants of Iran's Shahed-136, a large one-way attack drone that can fly at 114 miles per hour and carry 110 pounds of explosives. Such drones are less powerful than cruise and ballistic missiles, which carry hundreds of pounds of explosives or more and fly hundreds of miles an hour. However, with comparable ranges of over 600 miles, the Shahed and its ilk offer U.S. adversaries a way to hit far-off targets on the cheap: a single Shahed can cost under $50,000, a fraction of the multi-million-dollar price of a cruise missile. The Army has said that a layered approach of multiple weapons and sensors is necessary for taking down drones. It has also praised the performance of Raytheon's Coyote counter-drone system, which uses loitering munitions to take out incoming loitering munitions. In its recent unfunded-priorities list, the Army said a $185 million purchase of Coyote anti-drone systems was an item that just barely missed being included in the 2024 budget request. At $125,000 per system, prices will need to come down to match the cost of the Shahed-like drones attacking U.S. forces. One possible option is Ukrainian forces' use of cheap sensors and machine guns. While effective, this low-budget approach allows enemy drones to get so close that friendly forces can get showered with debris. Alternative methods include electronic warfare or even capturing drones, via nets. Both systems have been tried in Ukraine. But if Replicator 2 is aimed at fending off the kind of drones that have threatened U.S. forces in the Middle East, the effort is unlikely to focus on one of the dominant scourges of the Ukrainian battlefield: first-person-view loitering munitions. FPVs are less relevant in the Middle East where U.S. bases are generally hardened, an officer in the 10th Mountain Division, which handles counter-drone operations in Iraq, previously told Defense One. Tools to deal with these threats, by contrast, are typically more affordable than solutions needed for large loitering munitions like Shaheds. Systems used against FPVs and quadcopters include backpack-portable jammers, wearable drone detectors, and even shotguns. Replicator 1 update The memo also said the first stage of Replicator, which focused on fielding cost-effective drones, is 'on track&rdquo; to hit a goal of fielding systems by next summer. The department said AeroEnvironment's Switchblade 600 loitering munition system was part of the program, but did not identify others. The Switchblade 600 costs 'less than a Javelin anti-tank weapon,&rdquo; a company representative said, which costs around $80,000. Many observers of the Defense Department have hailed the Replicator effort as a way to break the Pentagon's general practice of buying complicated, expensive weapons. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks has sought to show the importance of Replicator not just for acquiring new, cheaper, faster-to-build drone tech but reforming the way the Pentagon does all of its building and buying.

The D Brief: Israel kills Hezbollah chief; $600M for Taiwan; DOD’...	After killing Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, in an airstrike in Beirut on Friday, the Israeli military is keeping up its pressure on high-level terrorist leaders in the region, including two commanders from Hamas and Hezbollah targeted in additional airstrikes over the weekend. Allegedly killed: 'Fateh Sherif, Head of the Lebanon Branch in the Hamas terrorist organization,&rdquo; and 'The Commander of Hezbollah's Preventative Security Unit and a member of their Executive Council, Nabil Qaouk,&rdquo; according to the Israeli Defense Forces. 'Sherif was responsible for coordinating Hamas' terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives, as well as Hamas' efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons.&rdquo; As for Qaouk, 'He joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and was regarded as an important source of expertise in his field, having served as the Deputy Commander of the southern region on the Operational Council, Commander of the southern region and Deputy Commander of the Operational Council,&rdquo; the IDF announced on social media Monday and Sunday, respectively. Israel said Monday it also recently killed two Lebanon-based officials from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Nidal Abdel-Aal and Imad Odeh. The IDF said 'Abdel-Aal took part in planning and carrying out terror attacks against Israel and directed terror activities in Judea and Samaria,&rdquo; and he 'directed the bus bombing attack in Beitar Illit on March 9, 2023, and the shooting attack from a passing vehicle at the Huwara Junction on March 25, 2023.&rdquo; Not much is known yet about Odeh. Parallel to this: 'Israeli special forces have been carrying out small, targeted raids into southern Lebanon, gathering intelligence and probing ahead of a possible broader ground incursion that could come as soon as this week,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing former Israeli military officials. Driving this strategy: 'Israel's government is under pressure to create a buffer zone to stop Hezbollah attacks that have forced some 60,000 people from their homes in the north and prevent the sort of cross-border attack that Hamas led against Israel on Oct. 7, which many in the country still fear. Hezbollah has threatened for years to invade parts of northern Israel,&rdquo; the Journal writes. About that Nasrallah strike: It was most likely carried out using '2,000-pound bombs, including the American-manufactured BLU-109 with a JDAM kit,&rdquo; the New York Times reported after analyzing video released by the Israeli military. 'These bombs, a type of munition known as bunker busters, can penetrate underground before detonating,&rdquo; the Times writes. According to Israel, Nasrallah and about 20 of his followers 'were in Hezbollah's central headquarters, located in the heart of Beirut, embedded beneath civilian buildings&rdquo; when they were killed. That building was just 53 meters from a United Nations-run school, the IDF said with an accompanying map.

On this day in 1938, UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned from Nazi Germany to announce a new agreement that he said guaranteed 'peace in our time.&rdquo; Spoiler alert: It did not. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen attacked Israel with a ballistic missile on Saturday. Israel's military confirmed the attack afterward, and said they intercepted it before it could strike the Ben Gurion International Airport. In response, Israeli jets bombed the Houthi port of Hodeida, on Yemen's western coast, on Sunday. The targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil,&rdquo; the Israeli Defense Forces said on social media. The IDF also released video of the strikes Monday. Worth noting: This is not a first for Israel. Their jets attacked alleged Houthi targets at Hodeidah back in July, for example. The Houthis also say they targeted three U.S. Navy vessels in the Red Sea on Friday using 23 missiles and drones. Those would possibly be from the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group. See what other U.S. assets are reportedly in the region via this map from conflict-watcher Ian Ellis. And in case you missed it, Iran is allegedly 'brokering talks to send advanced Russian missiles to Yemen's Houthis,&rdquo; Reuters reported last week. The missiles, known as P-800 Oniks, have a range of about 180 miles. Russia is known to have previously sent them to Hezbollah as well. Amid all the airstrikes and missile attacks, the Pentagon reminded the world Sunday it has the authorization to deploy troops at short notice. The U.S. military 'continues to maintain a significant amount of capability in the region and to dynamically adjust our force posture based on the evolving security situation,&rdquo; Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. POTUS: 'I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war,&rdquo; President Joe Biden said in his own statement Saturday. 'Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means,&rdquo; he added. SecDef Austin has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln to 'remain in the USCENTCOM theater and that the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group / Marine Expeditionary Unit will continue to operate in the Eastern Mediterranean,&rdquo; Ryder said. Next up: 'We will further reinforce our defensive air-support capabilities in the coming days,&rdquo; said Ryder, without elaborating. Elsewhere in the region, U.S. troops in Syria are under attack again from Iran-backed proxies, Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute noted on social media Monday. 'Though the attacks were small in scale, they illustrate a clear escalation that's unlikely to calm,&rdquo; he predicted. And CENTCOM announced Sunday that it killed 37 ISIS and AQ-linked fighters in Syria with targeted airstrikes last week (Sept. 24) and the week prior (on Sept. 16). Those strikes took place in central and northwestern Syria, and are believed to have killed Marwan Bassam 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, a senior leader of the al-Qaeda-linked Hurras al-Din militants. The other strike occurred in the early morning 'on a remote ISIS training camp in central Syria, killing at least 28 ISIS operatives, including at least four [unspecified] senior leaders,&rdquo; CENTCOM said in its statement Sunday.

Is the US military learning enough from Ukraine?	The U.S. military speaks frequently about the lessons they're learning from the war in Ukraine. The Air Force has sought to evaluate the Ukrainian military's methods for detecting drones, while the Army has revamped training, fielded new drones, and re-evaluated its artillery stockpiles based on observations of the nearly three-year-old hot war there. The Army's various analytic outlets have produced report after report by officers, intelligence analysts, and academics on the conflict. But at some of the military's key centers for studying warfare, the services appear to treat the grinding yet tech-forward war with NATO's top potential adversary as just one topic among many. Few analysts are tasked to study the war full-time, according to a Defense One review of service staffing. The Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Lessons Learned Division, which helps spread findings among the services, has no 'working groups or individuals&rdquo; who focus solely on Ukraine, a spokesman said. At the Army's Center for Lessons Learned, or CALL, four analysts on two teams focus on Ukraine, a spokesperson said in July. That's out of the roughly 45 analysts the center employs. A review of the reports on CALL's public-facing website showed few that exclusively cover lessons from Ukraine. At least one report focused on lessons from the command posts gleaned from a Ukrainian military manual. The spokesperson said CALL also interviews Ukrainian soldiers and commanders. Other services appear to devote fewer resources to gleaning lessons from the Ukraine war. The Air Force's Curtis E. LeMay Center, which develops air doctrine, has no single analyst dedicated to Ukraine, a spokesperson said in August. A spokesperson for the center said that 'every member of our organization&rdquo; has worked on assessing lessons from Ukraine, and said the center had worked with other organizations on more than five efforts focused on Ukraine. The Marine Corps likewise does not have a central body for exclusively evaluating lessons learned from Ukraine, a spokesperson said, although there are groups that study the war alongside other topics. The Corps has conducted four research efforts that sought to collect lessons learned from the war and will hold a follow-on study in fiscal year 2025. The spokesperson said that the Corps has not directly interviewed Ukrainian military personnel, relying instead on other services and U.S. allies and partners to gather first-hand information. The picture from the Navy is hazier. The service was not able to describe their approach after queries were sent in July and September. Public affairs officers were not able to provide updates by the time of publication. Answers may yet be forthcoming. In April, the Defense Department's Inspector General announced it would audit the Defense Department's success in studying and applying lessons from the war to 'doctrine, planning, training, and equipping.&rdquo; The announcement of a study is not necessarily evidence that the Defense Department has made a misstep. The Inspector General has not yet released its report. Some Army officers have argued that observations from the war, while useful, are not always relevant to the U.S. military, which expects to fight with multi-service operations backed by highly trained soldiers funded by a military budget many times Ukraine's gross domestic product. 'If you look at the fight that's going on in Ukraine, you've got a large Soviet army fighting a small Soviet army, right? That is defensive-oriented, [artillery]-oriented.&rdquo; said 101st Airborne Division commander Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia in an August interview. 'That's not our fight.&rdquo; Anthony Tingle, formerly a program director at the Air Force Academy's the Institute for Future Conflict and now an independent researcher who has spent time in Ukraine, said he could not say whether the Army's four analysts were sufficient. CALL could be working with other academic institutions to analyze the war, he said. However, any U.S. observations of the war are ultimately limited by the U.S. military's minimal presence in Ukraine, said Tingle. 'How many U.S. government employees have been to Donbass recording the electromagnetic spectrum or sitting down with the drone operators to say, &lsquo;Well, okay, how do they frequency-hop? How do they try to thwart our drones?&rdquo; said Tingle. 'This is all stuff we're gonna have to relearn the first week of a war with anybody.&rdquo; The U.S. has repeatedly said it will not send military advisors to Ukraine, and maintains an even smaller presence in Kyiv than before the war. The Defense Department also maintains travel restrictions within Ukraine that prevent at least some staff from getting within a certain distance of the front line, according to a January report from the Inspector General. The academic community is similarly limited in the analysis it can provide, Tingle added, saying the number of academics with experience on the frontline was in the single digits. Tingle believes the military branches are at least partially writing off the conflict based on assumptions that the U.S. would not struggle with the same types of problems as Ukraine, such as establishing air dominance over Russia. Those assumptions may be true, Tingle said, but that doesn't mean the war has nothing to teach. 'There are lessons about modern warfare in general that we are not getting because of that attitude.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/us-military-learning-enough-ukraine/399893/	2024-09-29T05:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/27/Ukrainian_soldiers_i_2500/large.jpg
Aerojet digging ‘out of this hole’ as it clears rocket backlog, p...	When L3Harris Technologies bought Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.7 billion last year, the rocket-motor-builder was thousands of motors behind schedule. Now, just over a year into the acquisition, Aerojet says it's getting back on track. The company has previously struggled to deliver solid rocket motors for key weapons, frustrating customers like Lockheed Martin and RTX. Although the company reported progress in delivery rates over the past year, RTX officials said this summer that it's still a 'mixed bag&rdquo; when getting on-time deliveries. 'I don't blame the primes for still kind of being in that &lsquo;show me' mode, where they're waiting for us to absolutely demonstrate consistently that we're delivering,&rdquo; Ross Niebergall, president of Aerojet Rocketdyne, said in an interview. The company has made strides to improve delivery times, Niebergall said. Last year, Aerojet was 'thousands of motors behind contract,&rdquo; across 15 to 20 programs, he said. But they've cut that in half, and project a 60-percent reduction by the end of the year. 'On several of those programs that we call &lsquo;red,' the ones that we were behind on, we've actually now achieved multiple months of record deliveries on these programs. So I think we're in a pretty good clip to dig ourselves out of this hole. Obviously, still more work to do, but I think we're on the right track,&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] The challenges facing Aerojet's 'red programs&rdquo; mainly come down to getting components from sub-tier suppliers, like cases, nozzles, igniters, and valves, Niebergall said. They've found single points of failure in the supply chain, he said, so the company has invested over $25 million into smaller companies to boost production. Northrop Grumman, the other main U.S. supplier of solid rocket motors, uses the same sub-tier supplier for many products so 'we're all tapping into that supply chain to a great extent,&rdquo; Niebergall said. Northrop and the L3Harris subsidiary have been the only two companies producing rocket motors in the U.S., but with new entrants breaking into the business, like Ursa Major and X-Bow Systems, and prime contractors hunting for their own supply of SRMs, like the recent teaming agreement between Lockheed and General Dynamics, the competition field may expand in the coming years. Niebergall said Aerojet is bracing for stronger competition by 'making sure that we get back on track&rdquo; and meet its commitments to customers. But he also said it will be a while before any of these new companies will rival his own. 'Overall, I think that we have to recognize that creating one or two solid rocket motors or a low production rate may not be all that challenging, but as you get into very large production, this doesn't happen overnight, and it's going to take a while and ultimately, it's a fairly significant investment as well,&rdquo; he said. Demand for solid rocket motors has skyrocketed over the past two years as wars have depleted many countries' weapons stockpiles. Now that more companies are jumping into the market, it remains to be seen whether demand will be sufficient for the companies to thrive. 'Ultimately, the strong will be the ones who survive and right now, I'm still in a wait-and-see mode on that, quite honestly. There's been a lot of attention to the industry. A lot of new entrants have jumped into it. We'll just have to see how demand plays out. Supplementals, as a result of Ukraine and Israel, have certainly had a short-term impact on the industry. But how does this settle out in the long term, as we continue to pivot to peer threats?&rdquo; Niebergall said. Last year, Aerojet received $216 million from the Defense Department through the Defense Production Act to expand and modernize its facilities in Arkansas, Alabama, and Virginia to increase the production of rocket motors for key weapons systems being sent to Ukraine, like the Javelin, Stinger, and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. With the funding, Aerojet will build additional facilities in Camden, Arkansas, and Orange County, Virginia. The applications for environmental approvals are 'nearing completion,&rdquo; officials said. The Huntsville, Alabama, location is focused on inert production&mdash;that is, cases, nozzles, and other parts that aren't explosive. Aerojet recently leased an additional facility in Huntsville to triple its working space, Niebergall said. Aerojet doesn't have a specific date for when all these new buildings will come online, he said, but added: 'We're already ramping up production as a result of the [Defense Production Act] and I would say that that is going to continue, really, over the next year-plus, as we get completion of that project.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/aerojet-digging-out-hole-it-clears-rocket-backlog-president-says/399905/	2024-09-27T12:32:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/27/GettyImages_1235564512/large.jpg
The D Brief: SECDEF on subs; Shipyard sabotage?; US, Ukraine ‘mis...	SECDEF in London: U.S. is making progress on boosting submarine production. 'What I'm seeing is that we're investing in the right things, and we will be able to expand the capacity going forward and to meet our objectives,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday after meeting his UK and Australian counterparts to discuss the trilateral AUKUS defense-technology pact. Austin was answering a question put to Australian Deputy Defense Prime Minister Richard Marles, who declined to say whether Australia was worried that U.S. shipyards&mdash;already years behind on U.S. orders&mdash;would be able to supply the three Virginia-class attack boats promised to his country under AUKUS. The U.S. has plans to spend up to $17.5 billion over five years to boost sub construction, including up to $4 billion routed through third parties Deloitte and BlueForce Alliance. (As it happens, $17.5 billion is the current estimated price tag for the first Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine; it's also close to one estimate for the Navy's total projected cost overrun for sub-building efforts through 2030.) Australia will make its first payment of $3 billion next year, two-thirds of which the U.S. will put toward the 16,000 American companies that make parts for submarines, a defense official said ahead of the meeting. Defense One's Lauren C. Williams reports from London, here. Shipyard sabotage? A leading U.S. shipyard found faulty welds in submarines and aircraft carriers with 'early indication that some of the welding errors were intentional,&rdquo; USNI News reported Thursday, citing a Tuesday memo from Navy acquisition chief Nickolas Guertin to the Navy secretary and chief of naval operations. Newport News Shipbuilding reported the welds to the Justice Department, which has declined immediate comment. Read on, here. And: a new Chinese sub sank pierside earlier this year. That's the word from 'a senior U.S. defense official,&rdquo; who told reporters that the Zhao, the first of a class of nuclear-powered attack submarines, sank alongside a pier sometime between May and June. Here's a photo of the purported sunk sub at a shipyard near Wuhan, taken by Planet Labs and published by the Wall Street Journal, which has more, here.

And if you're not already subscribed, you can do that here. On this day in 1944, the U.S. Army Air Force suffered its largest loss from a single mission during WWII after a navigational error separated a bomber group from its fighter escort. In a very short period of time, Nazi pilots shot down 31 U.S. B-24 Liberator bombers and one P-51 Mustang, killing 118 Americans. The New Zealand, Australian and Japanese navies transited the Taiwan Strait together on Wednesday and were followed by five Chinese navy vessels in a 'pincer-style maneuver,&rdquo; according to Taiwan's RW News and the BBC. Why it matters: 'For decades the US Pacific fleet was the only foreign navy that regularly transited the strait,&rdquo; the BBC reports. 'But recently, it was joined by Canada and Australia, Britain and France. [And] Two weeks ago Germany sailed two navy ships through the strait for the first time in decades.&rdquo; Taiwan, meanwhile, has seen 84 Chinese aircraft flying around the self-governing island over the past two days. 'This is a very notable increase in activity compared to the previous week,&rdquo; said regional observer Ben Lewis. Sixty-six of those aircraft crossed over the median line, entering Taiwan's northern, central, southwestern, and eastern ADIZ. Update: The Navy's USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier visited Guam recently, as the crew's staff noted in a timelapse video on social media Friday. The Roosevelt, based out of San Diego, had been in the Middle East in support of and in defense of commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea between June and August. ATACMS? U.S. intelligence officials think the risks aren't worth the rewards when it comes to authorizing Ukraine's use of long-range weapons to hit military targets inside Russia, the New York Times reported Thursday. Despite the nearly $8 billion in U.S. support for Ukraine announced Thursday, the two countries are still missing 'consensus on a strategy to end this war on terms favorable to Ukraine,&rdquo; said John Hardie of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington. 'The disagreement over missile strikes in Russia is a symptom of this disconnect,&rdquo; he added. To that end, Ukraine's president says he 'shared the details of the Victory Plan with Vice President Kamala Harris&rdquo; Thursday at the White House, seeming to confirm what Ukrainian officials teased late last week as Zelenskyy was traveling to the U.S. 'It is very important for us to be fully understandable and work in full coordination with the United States,&rdquo; he wrote on social media. By the way: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Zelenskyy's so-called victory plan did not impress White House officials who saw it as 'little more than a repackaged request for more weapons and the lifting of restrictions on long-range missiles.&rdquo; New: Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump in New York City, following days of rumors the meeting might or might not happen. The former U.S. president told reporters afterward he had a 'very good relationship&rdquo; with the Ukrainian leader. He noted quickly afterward, 'I also have a very good relationship with President Putin.&rdquo; According to the Guardian, 'Zelenskyy immediately responded to Trump's comments about his positive relationship with Putin, and said that he hopes that he and Trump have a better relationship than the one between Putin and Trump.&rdquo; Rewind: Trump was impeached in 2020 for withholding aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extort political dirt from Zelenskyy. He was impeached again in 2021 for his role in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. On Thursday, Trump lied about that latter episode on social media, claiming he'd dispatched National Guard troops to respond to the insurrection; he did not in fact dispatch the Guard, according to congressional investigators. This afternoon in Washington: Top Army acquisition official Doug Bush joins Gen. James Rainey of Army Futures Command to discuss the evolving nature of drones in service.

And lastly this week: Recall a naval era long past with this almost-anachronistic video of the recent Thames River transit of Spanish galleon Andaluc&iacute;a beneath London's Tower Bridge on Monday. 'The ship is a replica of the famous 15th century ship that was part of the galleons used by the Spanish to explore America and parts of Asia up until the 18th century,&rdquo; wrote south London's Sutton & Croydon Guardian local newspaper. 'The ship will be docked at St Katharine Docks from September 24 to October 6, with visitors able to go aboard the ship,&rdquo; the paper reports. 'Tickets are priced at &pound;12 for adults, &pound;6 for children and &pound;30 for a family of 5.&rdquo; You can read more from the company responsible for building the vessel, which has been used in several films and commercials.

Is Australia worried about US submarine production? Over to you, ...	LONDON&mdash;When defense chiefs from the U.S., UK and Australia met reporters after their AUKUS meeting here on Thursday, they touted an agreement to share a submarine-hunting torpedo. But when asked whether Australia was concerned about the U.S. ability to produce its promised submarines, Australian Deputy Defense Prime Minister Richard Marles had little to say. Instead, he deferred to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'First of all, in terms of our ability to meet the production objectives, of course we're concerned about that, and that's why we're investing more in the submarine industrial base, so that they can continue to expand capacity and place our efforts on a ramp that ensures that we can meet the objectives,&rdquo; said Austin, who added that he has met with U.S. industry leaders to talk about how they're using new funds intended to boost the submarine industrial base. 'What I'm seeing is that we're investing in the right things, and we will be able to expand the capacity going forward and to meet our objectives.&rdquo; U.S. shipyards are up to three years behind on orders, according to a recent U.S. Navy study, which has cast some doubt on their ability to backfill the U.S. end of an agreement to sell Australia three Virginia-class submarines&mdash;with an option for two more&mdash;in the next decade. The sub purchase is part of the three-year-old U.S.-UK-Australia agreement known as AUKUS, an effort to foster cooperative technology development. Australia has committed to an initial payment of $3 billion&mdash;perhaps one percent of the total it expects to spend to buy, support, and eventually build its own nuclear subs through the 2050s. That $3 billion is expected to start flowing next year into a special U.S. Treasury account, and the U.S. intends to invest two-thirds of it in its submarine industrial base, a senior U.S. military official told reporters ahead of the meeting. The money&mdash;alongside the $17.5 billion the U.S. has committed over five years to improve its submarine production&mdash;won't go to shipbuilders directly. Instead, it will fund six areas that will produce 'maximum return on investment&rdquo; in the 16,000 companies that form the submarine industrial base. 'Things that take a long time in terms of infrastructure, in terms of long-lead items, in terms of vendor uplift, in terms of overall supply base management,&rdquo; the official said. Getting the bulk of those funds upfront will 'allow us to maximize the return on investment such that when we're at the point in the 2030s to where we are selling ships, that we're back at the appropriate cadence. The Australians have helped us re-achieve the appropriate cadence, along with our congressional partnerships that have put a substantial amount of support behind that,&rdquo; the official said. It's not clear that the cadence has been re-achieved just yet. In recent years, U.S. submarine production has failed to meet the demands of its own Navy, largely due to supply chain problems and a dwindling trained workforce. It's a conundrum that has prompted the Navy to back splashy advertising campaigns and free training courses. Unusually, the Pentagon and Navy have committed up to $4 billion to two third-party firms&mdash;the consulting giant Deloitte and the nonprofit startup BlueForge Alliance&mdash;that have been hired to boot sub-building into a higher gear. AUKUS progress On Thursday, the defense chiefs also announced an agreement to equip all three nations' sub-hunting P-8 maritime patrol jets with Sting Ray torpedoes. John Healey, the UK's defense secretary, also said the UK agreed to keep training Australian sailors on how to use and maintain nuclear submarines, and to continue negotiating with Australia on their own bilateral treaty to bolster the AUKUS agreement. 'After the first course of 250 Australians was completed this month, and as part of that work, I can announce that Deputy Prime Minister Marles and I have agreed that negotiations will soon be underway for a new bilateral treaty to bind our AUKUS collaboration into law. This not only reflects our commitment to secure a secure Indo-Pacific region where international rules are respected. It also sends a very strong message that our defense alliance is one that will endure for many decades to come,&rdquo; Healey said. This agreement, if finalized, will foster submarine production plans between Australia and the UK as the two nations work to develop the SSN-AUKUS type submarine. Marles said Australia has already obtained a site for his country's future sub-building yard. 'In South Australia, we have seen land swaps take place with the South Australian government, such that we now have the site on which a production line will be established to build the future nuclear-powered submarines in Australia, the AUKUS variant, a variant that we will operate in tandem with the United Kingdom,&rdquo; he said. Marles also noted last month's work done in Perth on the Virginia-class submarine USS Hawaii, the first time a U.S. nuclear attack sub has been maintained outside the U.S. or an American base, and by non-U.S. citizens. 'All of this is happening under the banner of the AUKUS arrangement,&rdquo; he said. Last year, the U.S. and British defense leaders announced plans to increase deployments of SSNs to Australia starting in 2027, and to embed Australian military and civilian workers in the American and UK industrial bases. Those plans are all on track, Marles said. 'The very first step in what we announced in March of last year was an increased tempo of visits of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. That is happening. The submarine rotational force west, which will take place from 2027, is on track. And we are working very closely with both our partners, along with the Western Australian government, to see that that is happening as well,&rdquo; Marles said. Each of the defense leaders touted the submarine training as a progressing initiative. Australia has sent hundreds of sailors to the UK and U.S. nuclear-power schools to learn about how to operate undersea vessels in the future. The nation is also funding universities to add 4,000 slots for AUKUS-related disciplines, 'to make sure that we are building the skills that are needed to deliver this project,&rdquo; Marles said. Healey stressed the technical complexity that goes into building a submarine, which contributes to how long they take to build&mdash;and makes the early steps each nation takes critical. 'This is the, perhaps the most complex engineering and technologies on the planet, but there is an imperative to see every day counts. Because it's what we do now&mdash;and in the weeks and months ahead now&mdash;that will determine whether or not, to time, towards the end of the 2030s, the first AUKUS submarines are built and put into operation,&rdquo; Healey said. 'And in our discussions, that theme ran throughout: timescales are tough, but they are essential. And that together, we are absolutely determined that we will deliver.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/australia-worried-about-us-submarine-production-over-you-secdef/399882/	2024-09-27T07:05:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/27/A_sailor_aboard_the_2500/large.jpg
The Army wants to roboticize forklifts	Add forklift operator to the list of jobs that might soon fall to machines. The Army Applications Laboratory is working on a way to convert just about any human-driven forklift to autonomous operation. 'When you think about a potential future conflict and the amount of supplies that are going to have to flow from the [United States] and allied partners to places forward, it's going to be immense,&rdquo; Casey Perley, executive director of the Army Applications Laboratory, said this week during a Defense One Genius Machines broadcast. 'One of the things we're looking at is autonomy for forklifts. So essentially, how can they work in pairs where one forklift loads the other; they both go to where you're dropping it off, you drop it off, you go back for more.&rdquo; A few companies sell autonomous forklifts, but Perley said what the Army really needs is a way to convert the ones it already has. 'This type of technology is designed to not be, like, vendor- or model-specific on the forklift; it's designed to work with multiple types of systems. So the idea being: you invest in the AI and the autonomy versus a whole lot of hardware, and then you can just take that AI and autonomy and put it on different systems.&rdquo; The lab has hired a company called TracksNA to develop the self-operating forklift software. In late October, soldiers and engineers will get together to run forklifts through their paces. Such 'touchpoints&rdquo; are critical to building the brains for robotic forklifts, she said. It's not like autonomous vehicles on streets which can all access similar data repositories. The training of robot forklifts requires a lot of interaction with human operators. 'The more of these [touchpoint opportunities] you get in the Army, and the more [repetitions] that our soldiers can get with them, the more we're going to learn the types of experiences we are going to need to train these forklifts, the type of data that we're going to need to ensure is fed into the models. So that is why soldier touchpoints are so critically important, is it really teaches us the type of stuff we're going to need to teach the vehicles.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/army-wants-roboticize-forklifts/399879/	2024-09-26T16:35:46-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/GettyImages_2150166810/large.jpg
Increased efforts, lower goal help Army end recruiting slump	The Army beat its recruiting goal this year through a combination of lowered targets and increased efforts, after failing to hit higher goals in 2022 and 2023. The service recruited 55,300 soldiers against a goal of 55,000 in fiscal 2024, the service said Thursday. The service also saw 11,000 people commit to enlist in fiscal year 2025 under the Delayed Entry Program, more than double last year's total. The service also enlisted 6,000 more soldiers in specialties it deems critical this year compared to last, said U.S. Army Recruiting Command chief, Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, speaking at a Thursday media roundtable. Last year&mdash;fiscal 2023&mdash;the service recruited 50,181 soldiers against a 'stretch goal&rdquo; of 65,000, as Army Secretary Christine Wormuth put it, with 4,611 signing up for deferred entry. At the time, the Army presented the Delayed Entry Program numbers as part of its overall recruiting contracts, leading to reporting that the Army had hit 55,000 contracts. In 2022, the Army recruited 44,901 new members, well short of its goal of 60,000. The Army's press release did not say why the service sought 55,000 recruits in 2024 after seeking 60,000 and 65,000 in previous years. But the lowered target comes as the service works to consolidate undermanned formations created by past recruiting shortfalls. The Army has blamed poor recruiting numbers in part on the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as more prosaic issues like obesity, a strong U.S. economy, and the failure to meet the Army's drug policy. One major contributor to this year's success was the Army's 'Future Soldier Preparatory Course,&rdquo; a two-year-old initiative to prepare prospective soldiers for the Army's required physical and academic tests. In fiscal year 2024, 13,206 soldiers passed from the course to basic training. The course has taken over 28,000 recruits since it was launched, with over 90 percent of those recruits graduating, said Brig. Gen. Jennifer Walkawicz of Army Training and Doctrine Command. The Army expanded the course earlier this year, adding a total of four training companies. Other measures included a major new recruiting campaign that revived an 80's-era slogan, 'Be All You Can Be,&rdquo; which launched in March 2023. The Army also temporarily increased medical personnel at intake centers to make the onboarding process more efficient, according to an Army press release. The Army announced structural reforms to recruiting last October. New initiatives include establishing recruiting as a separate military occupational specialty, creating a recruitment experimentation group, and setting a goal to rely less on high-school recruiting. In August, the Army graduated its first class of recruiters under the new specialty. The service also launched an AI program in the last two months to identify potential recruits. Army leaders were cautious about declaring an end to their recruiting struggles, though. 'We're going to have to kind of keep fighting hard for our new recruits,&rdquo; said Wormuth, citing low employment and an expected decrease in the population as factors working against Army recruiters.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/increased-efforts-lower-goal-help-army-end-recruiting-slump/399870/	2024-09-26T13:16:07-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/U.S._Army_soldiers_w_2500/large.jpg
Companies that left Russia after 2022 invasion saw reputation boo...	Western companies that pulled out of Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022&mdash;even ones that hesitated&mdash;have generally seen their reputations rise, according to a new study that suggests that firms can use geopolitical crises to burnish their brands. Firms with strong environmental, social, and governance reputations saw more pronounced net buzz, according to Shankar Ganesan from the University of Notre Dame and Girish Mallapragada from Indiana University, whose paper went online in March and will appear in the forthcoming edition of the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing. The authors conclude that companies known for ethical governance were rewarded more when they aligned their actions with those values. Interestingly, the study also uncovered that companies who hesitated, then pulled out after public pressure weren't penalized for their cold feet. Firms that withdrew from Russia after their peers also saw increases in net buzz, meaning that the decision to exit later&mdash;rather than being seen as reactive or reluctant&mdash;helped them maintain or even boost public support. In short, it always pays to do the right thing even if it seems frightening at first. The concept of 'doing the right thing&rdquo; also ties into national security. In an era of great state competition, as outlined in the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy, the global reputation of U.S. firms is linked to perceptions of American leadership and values. Companies looking to sell dual-use technologies to the government and consumer, for example, may find that their standing with both the public and government stakeholders depends on how their corporate actions align with ethical governance&mdash;particularly in regions where political conflict and public scrutiny are high. 'Our findings highlight that corporate decisions made in response to geopolitical crises, such as withdrawing from Russia, do not occur in isolation,&rdquo; Ganesan told Defense One in an email. 'As U.S. companies face growing competition from Chinese firms, which may not adhere to the same geopolitical or ethical standards, the reputational benefits of socially responsible actions become even more pronounced. While firms from China and Russia may prioritize short-term economic gains, U.S. companies that align with stakeholder values, especially in the context of ESG, are likely to enjoy longer-term consumer loyalty and trust. This differentiation not only strengthens U.S. corporate positioning but also reinforces the country's broader strategic objectives of promoting democracy, human rights, and global stability in competition with non-democratic regimes.' Another conclusion is that these sorts of moves pay off much more in situations where the conflict is broadly known and understood by the public. As the authors note in their paper, 'If a conflict garners significant international attention, like the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war, the impact on brand buzz and consumer perceptions could follow patterns observed in this study. Second, the severity and scale of conflict could also matter. Firms' actions might elicit strong consumer reactions in situations as severe and impactful as the Russia&ndash;Ukraine conflict. However, the reactions may be less intense or clear-cut in less pronounced conflicts.&rdquo; This is where the Biden administration's response to the Ukraine conflict becomes significant. By declassifying intelligence and publicly revealing Russia's invasion plans, the U.S. government helped shape global public opinion and build a coalition of democratic allies to support Ukraine.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/companies-left-russia-after-2022-invasion-saw-reputation-boost-study-shows/399865/	2024-09-26T12:07:22-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: New bomb for Ukraine; Congress averts shutdown; Army...	White House's race against the clock on Ukraine aid: President Joe Biden says he's routing some $7.9 billion in military support to Ukraine, including $5.5 billion in congressionally-authorized funds that are set to expire if not accessed by the end of the month. That also includes a $2.4 billion commitment to buy weapons from American manufacturers (instead of reducing U.S. military stockpiles) as well as money to help build up Ukraine's defense industrial base, the president said in a statement Thursday. And in a new first, Biden authorized Ukraine's use of the Joint Standoff Weapon long-range munition as part of a $375 million arms package announced Wednesday by the Defense Department. The JSOW weapons are also known as glide bombs. They have a range of around 75 miles, and can be launched from the F-16s now flown by some of Ukraine's pilots, ABC News reported Wednesday. He also wants to send Ukraine another Patriot air defense battery, which Biden said 'builds on my decision earlier this year to divert U.S. air defense exports to Ukraine&rdquo; ahead of other customers around the world. And Biden authorized expanded training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, adding 18 training slots for 2025. 'My message is clear: The United States will provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war,&rdquo; the president said. One catch for that nearly $6 billion set to expire on Monday: 'The U.S. won't be allowed to introduce new types of equipment that haven't been in previous shipments,&rdquo; Politico reported Wednesday with the fine print. Not included in these new announcements: Permission to attack targets inside Russia using U.S.-provided weapons, which Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy has been requesting for several months as his troops occupy a small foothold in Russia's western Kursk region. Zelenskyy thanked Biden and 'both parties, Republicans and Democrats, as well as the entire American people&hellip;for finding a way to allocate the remaining security assistance to Ukraine and ensure that the Presidential authority is not expired by the end of the US financial year,&rdquo; he wrote on social media Thursday. Additional reading: 'Meet Bradley, the U.S. Army Veteran Ukrainian Soldiers Love,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday; 'UK weapon stockpiles &lsquo;threadbare' after arming Ukraine,&rdquo; the British Times reported Wednesday. Elsewhere in Washington: GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson told Zelenskyy to 'immediately fire&rdquo; his U.S. ambassador because the Ukrainian president visited an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Sunday. The House Speaker made his demand in a Wednesday letter to Zelenskyy, arguing that the visit 'in a politically contested battleground state&rdquo; was 'clearly election interference.&rdquo; The GOP-led House Oversight Committee also said it's opened an investigation into the Scranton trip. The visit 'was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican,&rdquo; Johnson said in his letter. 'Additionally, as I have clearly stated in the past, all foreign nations should avoid opining on or interfering in American domestic politics,&rdquo; the House Speaker wrote. Worth noting: Zelenskyy visited Utah's Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in July. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited former President Trump at his resort in Mar-a-Lago in late July and Johnson similarly had no objections. Nor did Johnson object when Hungary's far-right Viktor Orban visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago immediately after the NATO summit in mid-July. Meanwhile, Trump said Wednesday the Ukrainian people are 'dead&rdquo; and the country is 'demolished&rdquo; as he addressed voters at a campaign stop in North Carolina. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,&rdquo; GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said, according to the Associated Press. 'If they made a bad deal [that is, not fighting back] it would've been much better,&rdquo; he said. 'They would've given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years,&rdquo; Trump said, and claimed, 'What deal can we make? It's demolished. The people are dead. The country is in rubble.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Republicans follow Trump's lead of icing out Zelensky,&rdquo; CNN reported Wednesday; 'Anti-U.S. axis divided over Trump vs. Harris,&rdquo; Axios reported Thursday; 'How Russia's RT went from a cable news clone to covert operator,&rdquo; NPR reported Thursday; 'Russian Missiles Strike Kyiv for 5 Hours Hitting Ukraine's Power Grid,&rdquo; Newsweek reported Thursday; And 'Putin proposes new rules for using nuclear weapons,&rdquo; the BBC reported Thursday; for some clear-eyed expert reax, try nuclear policy researcher Fabian Hoffmann.

On this day in 1931, the keel of USS Ranger (CV-4), the first American purpose-built aircraft carrier, was laid down in Newport News, Virginia. Lawmakers avert a shutdown, for now. The U.S. government will now stay open at least through Dec. 20 under the stopgap funding bill passed Wednesday in both the House and the Senate, which gives Congress until then to pass funding bills for the 2025 fiscal year that begins in five days. Also included: $231 million for the Secret Service following the two recent assassination attempts on Trump. The bill passed the lower chamber in a 341-82 vote, with Speaker Johnson needing the support of 209 Democrats with 132 Republicans to advance the measure. It then advanced through the upper chamber in a 78-18 vote. Additional reading: 'How every senator voted on the stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown,&rdquo; via the Washington Post. New: The U.S. Army finally reached its yearly recruiting goal, officials announced Thursday in a razor-thin confirmation of what Army leaders said they were anticipating in April. The service added 55,300 new soldiers during the current fiscal year, which ends in just five days; that's 300 above the Army's target for FY24. That total includes 12,000 soldiers processed through a preparatory course designed to assist volunteers who do not initially meet all the requirements to enlist. Reminder: The Army failed to meet its recruiting goals for the last two years as the service (and the world) gradually emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. (The Navy and Air Force also fell short in 2023.) Trendspotting: 'We're seeing an increase in the enlistment age,&rdquo; one official said Thursday. That shows how the service has looked beyond the typical high school graduate to Americans working in the private sector. That includes outreach to digital job boards, for example, and emphasizing benefits like the G.I. Bill, officials said. ICYMI: The Army is advancing its ground robot plans after awarding Rheinmetall and HDT a contract to make a robotic transport vehicle for small units on Tuesday. Breaking Defense has more.

A collaborative, AI-powered effort to hunt enemy submarines shows that AUKUS is working, U.S. defense officials said ahead of a meeting of the U.S., UK, and Australian defense chiefs in London. 'It's a change in how we do things and how we're doing it with allies and partners,&rdquo; a defense official said Tuesday at the Pentagon. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in London for a Thursday meeting with his counterparts to review progress and planning for various tech-development projects, just days after the three-year anniversary of the trilateral defense-cooperation pact.

LONDON&mdash;A collaborative, AI-powered effort to hunt enemy submarines shows that AUKUS is working, U.S. defense officials said ahead of a meeting of the U.S., UK, and Australian defense chiefs here. 'It's a change in how we do things and how we're doing it with allies and partners,&rdquo; a defense official said Tuesday at the Pentagon. Just days after the three-year anniversary of the trilateral defense-cooperation pact, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in London for a Thursday meeting with his counterparts to review progress and planning for various tech-development projects. The defense official touted the three militaries' efforts to enable their various sub-hunting aircraft to ingest data from each others' sonobuoys, then to process it with cooperatively developed, AI-powered algorithms. 'We have results in hand, there's shared algorithms, there's hardware deployed, but this type of work is continuously improving. So it's not&mdash;it wasn't one and done. It was&hellip;get some common gear in place, move the algorithm, be able to share algorithms and move the data. And now you're in continuous-improvement mode,&rdquo; the defense official said. [[Related Posts]] Officials touted the sub-hunting experiments as a banner display of how AUKUS has produced technological advancement through collaboration&mdash;instead of the U.S., typically companies, developing solutions and then selling them to other nations. 'It is one of the ways that we're increasing our own ability to leverage each other's assets to rapidly process information, to have increased maritime domain awareness, to provide advantage to our warfighters by gaining that insight through collaboration and leveraging the most advanced technologies as in the algorithms that we've trained that allow us to do that processing,&rdquo; a defense official said. 'That's, to me, what's different here: even if you're not seeing some big project that everybody can point to. It's a change in how we do things and how we're doing it with allies and partners.&rdquo; The White House recently announced that Japan would join work on maritime autonomy under AUKUS Pillar 2, and that Canada, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand might as well. Officials also hailed proposed reforms to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that could ease cooperation. 'The Australians and UK are two of our closest partners and so there are challenges, but we're working through those at pace and with a degree of commitment to break down those stovepipes and those barriers that might exist such as IT barriers to make sure that we can do what we need to do,&rdquo; a defense official said. This is particularly important when it comes to Pillar 2 developments in cyber and electronic warfare. 'We have many platforms in common when it comes to [electronic warfare], which helps. And we also have agreements in place to share information at the appropriate levels as well, which helps,&rdquo; another official said. And when it comes to cyber, 'information sharing is a standard thing and you see it here too just inside the US system. There are certain tools you need to have in place for convenience of use, trading against surety of protecting that information,&rdquo; the official said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/officials-tout-ai-powered-sub-hunting-aukus-defense-chiefs-converge/399836/	2024-09-25T15:50:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/Screenshot_2024_09_25_at_12.31.39PM/large.png
‘Every lever of statecraft’ needed to overcome Pacific threats, c...	KONA, Hawaii&mdash;The U.S. military services are 'doing everything that's possible within the laws of physics&rdquo; in the Indo-Pacific right now, but the region's challenges require 'every lever of statecraft, not just the military lever,&rdquo; Adm. Samuel Paparo told Defense One in an interview. On a balcony overlooking the ocean at the Indo-Pacific Chiefs of Defense Conference, the leader of Indo-Pacific Command called the region 'the key strategic problem to the United States,&rdquo; and said all-domain operations 'are a requirement&rdquo; in the theater. 'This is a time for agnosticism in all-domain operations. Every formation is applicable in every domain. So, you know, we are open to every formation that can operate in every domain&hellip; and all units are required to operate in all domains. Not encouraged&mdash;required,&rdquo; Paparo said. Paparo met with senior military leaders from 23 countries and NATO at the conference, whose theme was 'The future Indo-Pacific: Building a resilient and interconnected region.&rdquo; Among them was Gen. Wu Yanan, who leads the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command. Their in-person meeting continued a conversation begun in a Sept. 9 video call between the U.S. and Chinese commanders. [[Related Posts]] Only 'time will tell&rdquo; whether the communication will continue, Paparo said, but the video call 'was a professional and courteous exchange of information, where I began by urging safe and professional conduct of forces, by pointing out a number of occasions where the [People's Republic of China] hazarded U.S. and allied and partner forces throughout the theater.&rdquo; Wu 'then made expressions of [China's] own policy, none of which were a surprise,&rdquo; Paparo said, after which he suggested that the two 'could have a channel of communication unaffected by policy&hellip;where he and I could ensure that there were no miscalculations.&rdquo; Wu was 'positive, but non-committal&rdquo; on the idea of a regular communication channel, Paparo said, adding that his attendance at the conference 'was a very positive sign.&rdquo; A press release issued by INDOPACOM after the conference noted that Paparo 'underscored the importance of sustained lines of communication between the U.S. military and the PLA&rdquo; in the in-person meeting. China, of late, has been having fewer run-ins with the U.S., but more with allies, which is 'why this channel is so important,&rdquo; Paparo said. Many of the recent aggressions have targeted Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, including a June attack by the Chinese coast guard on a Filipino naval craft involving an ax. 'This is how the gray zone is defined&hellip;actions by a state actor, where they use aggression in such a way&hellip;that achieves ends with violence, in a way that minimizes the risk of open, acknowledged armed conflict. There's always a risk of employing gray zone operation, but an &lsquo;armed attack' is amorphously defined,&rdquo; Paparo said. 'An ax is a dangerous weapon. And it's, there's a Philippine sailor minus a thumb. His name's Jeffrey. There's a human side to this. And that human side, it also includes the Philippine fisher folk, who are poor, whose livelihood depends on fishing these waters.&rdquo; Amid the escalating tensions, Paparo said in August that the U.S. is open to the idea of the U.S. escorting Philippine ships in the region. But, he clarified to Defense One, he was merely saying INDOPACOM is prepared to do so if asked. 'That's my duty as a commander, and it's my duty to have options prepared to cross the range of military operations,&rdquo; he said. Tensions have also escalated on the Korean peninsula, with North Korea launching multiple short-range ballistic weapons last week. North Korea's actions 'bear watching,&rdquo; Paparo said. 'We're deeply concerned with the growing numbers of deepening partnerships among North Korea-Russia, PRC-Russia.&rdquo; He added, 'While we remain concerned, we also remain confident in our ability to deter and respond to aggression in the north.&rdquo; China and Russia 'are demonstrating their ability to cooperate, and they're demonstrating their, quote, no limits partnership,&rdquo; he said. &hellip;'Having foreseen this, we have a significant, significant deterrent and response posture partnership ongoing with Indo-PACOM and NORTHCOM ongoing presently that's ready to intercept, ID, escort forces, and respond to forces&hellip;to ensure there's no seams.&rdquo; For the conference, Paparo said the greatest possible outcome could be that 'we come out of it with a common understanding of the environment, and we leave with a greater trust, so that when a problem arises, you have a baseline of trust, so that you can pick up the phone immediately and you can solve problems. And that's the greatest currency there is: Trust.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/every-lever-statecraft-needed-overcome-pacific-threats-commander-says/399830/	2024-09-25T13:34:56-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/Paparo_CHODs/large.jpg
Can AI predict if a Marine will quit? Corps wants to know	The U.S. Marine Corps isn't for everyone, but there's no real process for weeding out folks who sign the enlistment paperwork but are unlikely to make it through their four-year contract. A new experiential initiative uses artificial intelligence to predict whether a Marine recruit will complete their full term and, more importantly, pinpoint the factors that might get in the way of that goal, said the AI lead for the U.S. Marine Corps. 'We are using artificial intelligence to look at how we can recruit Marines, and we're looking at how we can retain them specifically,&rdquo; Capt. Chris Clark said during a Defense One Genius Machines event that aired Tuesday. 'We can assess what attributes might&hellip;first predict whether that Marine will complete that four-year term or not, and then go back and look at what attributes might be impacting that prediction. So then we can inform the recruiters. And they can use that to better prepare these Marines in different ways so that they can go out into the Marine Corps, do&hellip;great and amazing things, complete their four-year term, and then decide if they want to stay in or if they want to go on and do something else.&rdquo; The Marine Corps doesn't regularly publish figures for Marines who leave the service before their contract is up. But in 2017, the number was 5 percent of the entire active component, comprising 27 percent of all departures. The Corps has started offering new incentives to retain their people, particularly after their contract ends. But there are a lot of other factors that can contribute to quitting&mdash;things like fitness, exhaustion, personal or family stress, and other factors that wouldn't be affected by the promise of a bonus check. It's data the Marines can start to collect during recruitment, to predict the likelihood of recruits finishing a four-year tour. 'How can we understand a Marine when they're a poolee, so before they go to boot camp and become a Marine, how can we use different factors to be able to understand if they're going to complete their first fully four-year term, right?&rdquo; The 'retention prediction network,&rdquo; as Clark calls it, is still in an experimental phase. The use of artificial intelligence in employee recruitment and employee management is a controversial area, ripe with potential for lawsuits. But officials in the military and national security space have had the opportunity to experiment with AI for management for years to detect or predict emerging insider threat issues that could affect national security. A 2019 experimental program from the Defense Security Service sought to help managers better predict when an employee might be facing problems&mdash;not to push people out of the service, but to better anticipate when an employee is having challenges that affect their performance, so that a conversation could occur early, before the resignation letter. The value of the Marines' prediction network is similar, Clark said. It's not a replacement for human judgment, but a possible tool to allow recruiters or trainers to see something they might be missing. 'You know, a prediction is a prediction. It's not always right, but what it does is it gives us information that we can then use to inform those recruiters where they, you know, currently, don't have a lot to go on,&rdquo; he said. The Marines are using a similar tool to better plan exercises and operations&mdash; a large language model specifically applied to the vast repository of text the Marine Corps has amassed on various engagements over the years. The hope is to create a tool that can provide 'critical information for Marines to make decisions on how to plan that next exercise, operation, deployment, whatever it is that they're doing. They're able to take that data and do a lot with it, whether it's summarizing decades of information into a concise report, or just find key pieces of information and trends within that data,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/marine-corps-exploring-ai-predict-when-recruits-might-quit/399817/	2024-09-25T12:12:39-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/GettyImages_2157425285/large.jpg
FBI’s Carahsoft raid comes amid allegations of price-fixing	Editor's note: This story has been updated to affirm that it is unknown whether the raid was related to the ongoing civil court case. The FBI and Defense Criminal Investigative Service launched a joint raid Tuesday morning at Carahsoft's Reston, Va. headquarters. Law enforcement officials confirmed the raid but have yet to share details on what prompted the seizure of company records. 'We can confirm that DCIS executed a joint search warrant operation with the FBI in northern Virginia yesterday morning. We have nothing further to add, as this is an open investigation,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the Defense Department's audit office said in a statement. Richard Conway, an attorney for Carahsoft, did not return a request for comment. A company spokesperson also did not comment on the new details of the raid. News of the raid prompted speculation about possible &mdash; but thus far unsubstantiated &mdash; links to an ongoing court case that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland last year and involved efforts to defraud government agencies. The names of the vendors allegedly involved in the scheme were redacted. A report in Bloomberg, citing an unredacted filing, named SAP and noted that prosecutors were also examining other resellers and a unit of Accenture. Both companies issued statements to Nextgov/FCW indicating they were cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice in a civil investigation. Carahsoft employees were told Tuesday the raid was 'part of an investigation into a company with which Carahsoft has done business in the past&rdquo; and that the company is fully cooperating and 'operating business as usual,&rdquo; according to an email sent by Carahsoft President Craig Abod and obtained by Nextgov/FCW. Carahsoft is a leading IT vendor and reseller of technology products and services to public sector organizations, with prime spots on key federal governmentwide acquisition contracts such as NASA's Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement and the General Services Administration's Multiple Award Schedule. The raid occurred during the busiest time of the year for federal contractors. The U.S. government's fiscal year ends Sept. 30, where agencies have to finalize budgets, allocate remaining funds and push through last-minute contracts before the deadline. A Carahsoft employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said that account representatives handling client relationships were directed by team leads to calm down vendors and assure them that there was nothing to fear. The ongoing civil case Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland last year indicate that the U.S. is looking into 'whether Carahsoft conspired with other companies to rig bids, inflate prices, overcharge, and defraud the Department of Defense (DoD), among other federal government agencies&rdquo; when it resold the products. The specific companies in question were redacted in the documents that Nextgov/FCW had retrieved. For a year, Carahsoft 'had not produced the full set of transaction records (including but not limited to the communications, solicitations, proposals, quotes, bids, award notices, orders, purchase orders, and invoices) for even a single project&rdquo; for the Justice Department and others involved. For months, frustration had mounted among DOJ lawyers, who claimed in court proceedings that the government's document requests and inquiries appeared to be delayed or unfulfilled by Carahsoft. 'We have offered to rewrite the question, but the response we've gotten from Carahsoft is saying that they don't want to answer the question,&rdquo; Justice Department trial attorney Samson Asiyanbi said. 'And it seems to us that they just don't want to answer it. And rather &mdash; because they don't want to answer it, they are coming up with all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't be required to do so.&rdquo; Carahsoft paid a $75 million fine to the government in 2015 to settle claims that the company and partner firm VMWare overcharged the government and concealed commercial pricing arrangements. Carahsoft did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement. GovExec's Frank Konkel and Washington Technology's Nick Wakeman and Ross Wilkers contributed to this report.

FBI’s Carahsoft raid tied to price-fixing allegations	Yesterday's FBI raid of Carahsoft was linked to allegations that the Pentagon contractor had for years worked with ostensible competitors to illegally fix prices for their services, according to documents filed in federal court. SAP, Accenture, and other firms are also under investigation for alleged violations of the False Claims Act that involved efforts to defraud government agencies, Bloomberg News reported. On Tuesday morning, the FBI and Defense Criminal Investigative Service launched a joint raid on the company's Reston, Va., headquarters, Nextgov/FCW first reported. Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland last year indicate that the U.S. is looking into 'whether Carahsoft conspired with other companies to rig bids, inflate prices, overcharge, and defraud the Department of Defense (DoD), among other federal government agencies&rdquo; when it resold the products. The specific companies in question were redacted in the documents that Nextgov/FCW retrieved; Bloomberg cited an unredacted version. For a year, the documents said, Carahsoft 'had not produced the full set of transaction records (including but not limited to the communications, solicitations, proposals, quotes, bids, award notices, orders, purchase orders, and invoices) for even a single project&rdquo; for the Justice Department and others involved, which could have prompted the raid. 'We can confirm that DCIS executed a joint search warrant operation with the FBI in northern Virginia yesterday morning. We have nothing further to add, as this is an open investigation,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the Defense Department's audit office said in a statement. Richard Conway, an attorney for Carahsoft, did not return a request for comment. A company spokesperson also did not comment on the new details of the raid. 'All we can say is that there has been a civil investigation by the DOJ, and SAP has been cooperating with the investigation since the beginning,&rdquo; an SAP spokesperson told Nextgov/FCW via email. An Accenture spokesperson said, 'Accenture Federal Services is responding to an administrative subpoena and is cooperating with the DOJ.&rdquo; Carahsoft employees were told Tuesday the raid was 'part of an investigation into a company with which Carahsoft has done business in the past&rdquo; and that the company is fully cooperating and 'operating business as usual,&rdquo; according to an email sent by Carahsoft President Craig Abod and obtained by Nextgov/FCW.

'And it seems to us that they just don't want to answer it. And rather &mdash; because they don't want to answer it, they are coming up with all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't be required to do so.&rdquo; The Justice Department may have reached a tipping point in its investigation and decided the best course of action was to raid the company in order to preserve evidence, said Jay Holland, a principal attorney at Joseph, Greenwald & Laake, a law firm based in Maryland. False Claims Act investigations vary by case, but if a raid was launched, it likely reflects earlier investigative work, Holland said. 'They're not going to start out by raiding companies' headquarters,&rdquo; he said in a phone interview. The DOJ 'would have done a significant amount of investigation&hellip;and determined that the gravity of the case warranted it.&rdquo; Carahsoft is a leading IT vendor and reseller of technology products and services to public-sector organizations, with prime spots on key federal governmentwide acquisition contracts such as NASA's Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement and the General Services Administration's Multiple Award Schedule. The raid occurred during the busiest time of the year for federal contractors. The U.S. government's fiscal year ends Sept. 30, when agencies have to finalize budgets, allocate remaining funds and push through last-minute contracts before the deadline. A Carahsoft employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said that account representatives handling client relationships were directed by team leads to calm down vendors and assure them that there was nothing to fear. Carahsoft paid a $75 million fine to the government in 2015 to settle claims that the company and partner firm VMWare overcharged the government and concealed commercial pricing arrangements. Carahsoft did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement. GovExec's Frank Konkel and Washington Technology's Nick Wakeman and Ross Wilkers contributed to this report.

The D Brief: Pleas at the UN; Russia-China drone project?; China ...	Zelenskyy at the United Nations: 'Russia's war against Ukraine will end because the UN Charter will work. It must work. Our Ukrainian right to self-defense must prevail,&rdquo; Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy told the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. He also asked the international community not to 'tire&rdquo; of Russia's war on his country, nor to imagine that 'peace talks&rdquo; would bring peace. 'From the very first second of this war, Russia has been doing things that cannot possibly be justified under the UN Charter. Every destroyed Ukrainian city, every burned village, and there are already hundreds and hundreds, serves as proof that Russia is committing an international crime. And that's why this war can't simply &lsquo;fade away.' That's why this war can't be calmed by talks,&rdquo; he said. Notable: Zelenskyy's speech was a tentpole of his multi-day visit to the United States. The other will be a White House meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in which the Ukrainian is slated to formally present a plan for stepped-up action and ultimately victory. Biden's final UNGA address. The U.S. president sounded a hopeful note and reiterated many of his administration's foreign-policy themes, including continued support for Ukraine and strengthening alliances in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. He said China has restarted its cooperation on stemming the global flow of deadly synthetic narcotics, and said the U.S. will continue to oppose unfair economic competition and coercion in the South China Sea. He also urged Israel and Hamas to finalize the ceasefire-and hostage deal put forth by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. Here's a transcript from the White House. Speaking of the UN, Taiwan wants in. In a Defense One oped, Foreign Minister Lin Chia-Lung says his country and its citizens are unjustly excluded from UN activities, in part because of Beijing's misportrayal of the assembly's 1972 resolution recognizing the People's Republic of China. The false claim is 'one of the key elements in a campaign to establish the legal basis for justifying a future armed invasion of Taiwan,&rdquo; Lin writes, arguing that now is the time for the UN to push back.

New: Russia is allegedly operating a 'secret war drones project&rdquo; inside China, two European intelligence sources tell Reuters. Using apparent copies of two invoices from a Russian intermediary, the sources say Moscow's state-run arms firm Almaz-Antey is working with a subsidiary named IEMZ Kupol to test a Chinese-made drone with a range of over 1,200 miles known as Garpiya-3, or G3. Kupol has been under U.S. sanctions since last December. At least two of those G3 drones were delivered to Russia at unspecified dates, according to the invoices, which themselves were created over the summer. Five other 'military drones&rdquo; made in China were also delivered, but it's unclear what those five were. Why it matters: 'The two intelligence sources said the delivery of the sample drones to Kupol was the first concrete evidence their agency had found of whole UAVs manufactured in China being delivered to Russia since the Ukraine war began in February 2022,&rdquo; Reuters writes. Worth noting: Reuters says it was 'unable to determine whether the [Russian] defence ministry gave the company the green light to proceed with the serial production proposed.&rdquo; Expert reax: I would like a lot more information before jumping to any conclusions, researcher Sam Bendett of CNA said. That's at least partly because it's not clear why China would risk such an arrangement, he explained. 'For a factory to exist officially that builds UAVs for the Russians exposes China to some of the more severe effects of the sanctions, so it's not clear the extent to which China would be willing to expose itself.&rdquo; But that's not all: Another document lays out plans for 'a joint Russian-Chinese drone research and production centre in the Kashgar special economic zone in China's Xinjiang province,&rdquo; Reuters reports. Read more, including allegations China is building a drone similar to the U.S.-made Reaper, here. Meanwhile in the Russian motherland, authorities just released a postage stamp in an effort 'to popularize drones and UAVs across the country,&rdquo; Sam Bendett noticed and shared on social media Tuesday. Back in the U.S. on the campaign trail, former President Trump praised Russia's military as he argued Tuesday against giving Ukraine more military aid, the Associated Press reported from Savannah, Georgia. 'What happens if [the Russians] win? That's what they do, is they fight wars,&rdquo; Trump told his audience. 'As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That's what they do. They fight. And it's not pleasant.&rdquo; Trump also mocked Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth,&rdquo; and lied about the amount of U.S. aid given to Ukraine. In a correction to his remarks, AP noted, 'The U.S. has provided more than $56 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in 2022,&rdquo; citing State Department figures. New: China's military says it just launched an unarmed ICBM in what the BBC reports would be the first time since 1980. According to Beijing's Defense Ministry: 'The PLA Rocket Force launched an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) carrying a dummy warhead to the high seas in the Pacific Ocean at 08:44 on September 25th, and the missile fell into expected sea areas. This test launch is a routine arrangement in our annual training plan. It is in line with international law and international practice and is not directed against any country or target.&rdquo; Pertinent info: 'From Navigational Warnings and NOTAM's, it was fired from Hainan with a ~11 700 km range and RV impact near 10.4 S, 146.5 W,&rdquo; astronomer Marco Langbroek reports with supporting imagery and approximate 3D flight path. 'The Rv impact area was some 700 km from Nuku Hiva in French Polynesia, and some 875 km from Bora Bora,&rdquo; he writes. Expert reax: 'This launch is a powerful signal intended to intimidate everyone,&rdquo; said former Pentagon official Drew Thompson, now a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. 'China chose to launch an ICBM during the United Nations General Assembly,&rdquo; Thompon noted, adding, 'This is not just a signal to the U.S., Japan, Philippines and Taiwan.&rdquo; New: The Philippines' military chief says he wants to host America's mid-range Typhon missile system 'forever,&rdquo; Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner Jr. said Wednesday at the 5th Asian Defense, Security, and Crisis Management Exhibition and Conference in Manila. Background: The U.S. brought the system to the Philippines in April for exercises, but it will now remain 'indefinitely,&rdquo; AP reported Wednesday, citing two Filipino officials. Worth noting: China's Foreign Ministry has protested the system for months, accusing the U.S. of undermining regional security. That's partly because the U.S. system can launch Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of 1,000 or so miles&mdash;putting China within reach. 'Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. said at the conference. 'Why don't they lead by example?&rdquo; he said. 'Destroy their nuclear arsenal, remove all their ballistic missile capabilities, get out of the West Philippines Sea and get out of Mischief Reef.&rdquo; Read more, here.

The medic spent 30 hours on the beach treating wounded troops, initially under heavy German fire that wounded him as well. Woodson, who was soon awarded the Bronze Star, died in 2005. But his family campaigned for greater recognition, and on Tuesday accepted his posthumous Distinguished Service Medal.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-25-2024/399811/	2024-09-25T08:47:12-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/DB_lander-1/large.png
China's satellites are dodging US eyes in space	The Pentagon has long been closed-mouthed about a family of U.S. spy satellites that since 2014 have kept an eye on foreign spacecraft in geosynchronous orbits. That hasn't stopped Chinese satellites from dodging them. U.S. officials declassified the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program a decade ago to show that they had eyes on high-Earth orbit, but they have rarely discussed the the six GSSAP satellites themselves, and they do not publish the standard location data meant to reduce collisions. Now, a new paper from the U.S. Air Force's China Aerospace Studies Institute explores what the Chinese know about GSSAP&mdash;and what they're doing about it. 'GSSAP's mission and the orbital elements of its current location are not classified; U.S. government and Western experts just don't often talk about it,&rdquo; wrote Kristin Burke, the institute's senior space and counterspace researcher. 'Consequently, the Chinese and others are filling the vacuum.&rdquo; U.S. military space leaders have said the GSSAP satellites perform rendezvous and proximity maneuvers to allow close-up looks at spacecraft in geosynchronous orbits, some 36,000 kilometers above Earth's surface. They've described the mission as a kind of 'neighborhood watch.&rdquo; In a Sept. 7 paper titled 'China Can Track GSSAP,&rdquo; Burke said that while U.S. officials may not want to discuss GSSAP, Chinese astronomers are carefully parsing data about where it flies and assembling a dossier on the GSSAP satellites' patterns. That means they know where to look and what to expect from the satellite. It also means, she wrote, that China is likely working on ways 'to autonomously detect and command [a Chinese] satellite to maneuver when its sensors notice anything similar to GSSAP's historical approaches.&rdquo; In other words, to scatter before the U.S. gets a closer look at it. 'We have seen Chinese satellites maneuvering and very clearly demonstrating that they know what the GSSAP is, what it's doing, changing their orbital trajectories, either to put them into position to keep an eye on them, or to make it harder for us to keep an eye on [a Chinese satellite],&rdquo; said Brendan Mulvaney, the director of the China Aerospace Studies Institute. 'China is out there developing the techniques, tactics, the procedures to be able to do orbital warfare. They're practicing.&rdquo; All of this creates a game of cat-and-mouse. In the paper, Burke points to an instance in February 2022 when two Chinese satellites predicted the third GSSAP satellite was approaching. As a result, one of the Chinese satellites repositioned itself and likely took a picture of the U.S. satellite in more favorable lighting conditions. In addition, Burke wrote that by using data from the International Scientific Optical Network, research organizations associated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Academy of Space Technology had determined which satellites GSSAP was scouting. The list included a 2017 approach of Russia's Luch satellite, which had frustrated commercial and government leaders with its own close approaches. Burke, who speaks and reads Mandarin, also offers further details about GSSAP's movements in the paper. For example, she explained that a Chinese military report in 2021 showed that a year earlier a GSSAP-2 satellite moved within 8.71 kilometers of another satellite. For perspective, a CSIS study found that the median distance between satellites in geosynchronous orbit is 207 kilometers. 'There's not a whole lot of reason to get that close other than to demonstrate, &lsquo;I'm going to get this close and you're not going to do anything about it,'&rdquo; Mulvaney said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/one-way-learn-about-us-spy-satellites-china/399816/	2024-09-25T08:14:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/In_August_2016_a_De_2500-1/large.jpg
Can AI predict if a Marine will quit? Corps wants to know	The U.S. Marine Corps isn't for everyone, but there's no real process for weeding out folks who sign the enlistment paperwork but are unlikely to make it through their four-year contract. A new experiential initiative uses artificial intelligence to predict whether a Marine recruit will complete their full term and, more importantly, to pinpoint the factors that might get in the way of that goal, the Corps' AI lead says. 'We are using artificial intelligence to look at how we can recruit Marines, and we're looking at how we can retain them specifically,&rdquo; Capt. Chris Clark said during a Defense One Genius Machines event that aired Tuesday. 'We can assess what attributes might&hellip;first predict whether that Marine will complete that four-year term or not, and then go back and look at what attributes might be impacting that prediction. So then we can inform the recruiters. And they can use that to better prepare these Marines in different ways so that they can go out into the Marine Corps, do&hellip;great and amazing things, complete their four-year term, and then decide if they want to stay in or if they want to go on and do something else.&rdquo; The serivce doesn't regularly say what percentage of Marines leave before their first contract is up. But in 2017, the number was 5 percent of the active component, comprising 27 percent of all departures. The Corps has started offering new incentives to retain their people, particularly after their contract ends. But there are a lot of other factors that can contribute to quitting&mdash;things like fitness, exhaustion, personal or family stress, and other factors that wouldn't be affected by the promise of a bonus check. It's data the Marines can start to collect during recruitment, to predict the likelihood of recruits finishing a four-year tour. 'How can we understand a Marine when they're a poolee, so before they go to boot camp and become a Marine, how can we use different factors to be able to understand if they're going to complete their first fully four-year term, right?&rdquo; The 'retention prediction network,&rdquo; as Clark calls it, is still in an experimental phase. The use of artificial intelligence in employee recruitment and employee management is a controversial area, ripe with potential for lawsuits. But officials in the military and national security space have had the opportunity to experiment with AI for management for years to detect or predict emerging insider threat issues that could affect national security. A 2019 experimental program from the Defense Security Service sought to help managers better predict when an employee might be facing problems&mdash;not to push people out of the service, but to better anticipate when an employee is having challenges that affect their performance, so that a conversation could occur early, before the resignation letter. The value of the Marines' prediction network is similar, Clark said. It's not a replacement for human judgment, but a possible tool to allow recruiters or trainers to see something they might be missing. 'You know, a prediction is a prediction. It's not always right, but what it does is it gives us information that we can then use to inform those recruiters where they, you know, currently, don't have a lot to go on,&rdquo; he said. The Marines are using a similar tool to better plan exercises and operations&mdash; a large language model specifically applied to the vast repository of text that the Marine Corps has amassed on various engagements over the years. The hope is to create a tool that can provide 'critical information for Marines to make decisions on how to plan that next exercise, operation, deployment, whatever it is that they're doing. They're able to take that data and do a lot with it, whether it's summarizing decades of information into a concise report, or just find key pieces of information and trends within that data,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/marine-corps-exploring-ai-predict-when-recruits-might-quit/399798/	2024-09-24T16:25:10-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/GettyImages_2157425285-4/large.jpg
Mission systems sold separately: Air Force debuts ‘next-gen acqui...	The Air Force, long accustomed to buying its aircraft with everything included, is moving toward ordering the mission systems separately. An 'element of our next-generation acquisition model is having direct relationships, where it makes sense and where we can, with our mission system providers, and not simply working through a prime on individual platforms,&rdquo; said Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief. 'The reason why is: your mission systems have to integrate across a broad swath of our force in order to accomplish the missions that we have to do, the complex mission threads that go into high-intensity conflict with a peer competitor.&rdquo; The Air Force is using this approach for its next-generation tanker, called Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System, or NGAS, Hunter said, pointing to a recent call to industry for information on the new plane's mission systems. 'We want to engage industry early [and] have them help us inform our requirements-generation process and do it in an iterative fashion. We don't want to do it with just one part of industry,&rdquo; Hunter told reporters last week at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. By year's end, the service aims to wrap up an analysis of alternatives that should give officials a better sense of future refueling needs and when the NGAS plane might arrive. If the next tanker takes longer than expected to be fielded, the service will need to buy more near-term refueling aircraft to serve the fleet. Hunter has previously said that interim buy will likely, but not definitely, be the Boeing KC-46. 'We're going to need to buy something to cover down continued tanker production. That construct is still the case, but it's critically dependent on getting after NGAS and how quickly we can get to NGAS,&rdquo; Hunter said last week. The Air Force is trying to measure-twice-cut-once for both NGAS and its Next-Generation Air Dominance program, which has been paused as the service mulls the cost and design of the sixth-generation fighter. These future programs are intertwined, officials say, as previous concepts of air dominance have evolved. 'We are looking at not just the NGAD platform. We're also looking at NGAS, using the AOA as a big input on that, and also the work we've been doing on [collaborative combat aircraft] increment two, so those are all kind of coming together. We're going to have, hopefully, decisions on what that package of capability is going to look like. Then, by the way, we've got to figure out how we pay for it, which I think may, at the end of the day, be our biggest problem,&rdquo; Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said last week.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/mission-systems-sold-separately-air-force-debuts-next-gen-acquisition-model/399783/	2024-09-24T13:13:19-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/mission_systems_160519_F_OE991_102/large.jpg
Armored unit adapts old tech to lessons from Ukraine	Even as the U.S. Army works to modernize its light infantry brigades, one armored brigade is also pushing to adapt&mdash;with the tech they already have on hand, service officers said this month. 'We've been transforming both in how we approach training and then how we're innovating in the realm of [unmanned aerial systems], counter [drone], and electromagnetic [warfare],&rdquo; Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, 3rd Infantry Division commander, said at a media roundtable Friday. 'Much of what we're doing right now is just using what we have better.&rdquo; In July, the division's 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team got to test out these new tactics, some drawn from observations of Ukraine, at a rotation through the Army's National Training Center. The center, located at Fort Irwin, California, pits incoming brigades against the highly trained Blackhorse unit in hyper-realistic simulations of actual combat. Before going to the training center, electronic warfare soldiers first spent time monitoring the 1st Brigade's command posts and then briefed commanders on what their electronic signature looked like, said Col. Jim Armstrong, the brigade's commander. 'Every time the battalion [tactical operations center] or the brigade [tactical operations center] went out for training, our [electronic warfare] platoon went out there and mapped them in the spectrum,&rdquo; he said, speaking at the Fort Moore Maneuver Conference earlier in September. The electronic warfare platoon was also given commercially available direction-finding equipment to locate enemy positions, and they trained with the unit's reconnaissance squadron, Armstrong added. [[Related Posts]] The desert environment of NTC gave the unit no room to hide&mdash;if the soldiers who play the enemy saw a cellphone signal, there'd be little doubt it belonged to someone in the 3rd Infantry Division. So Armstrong brought in fake devices that he hoped would deceive any watchful observers. 'Instead of hiding in the clutter, we knew we would have to bring our own clutter to hide in,&rdquo; he said. As part of this effort, the unit used the knowledge they'd gained from monitoring the brigade's command post to set up a decoy command post, complete with tents and their actual satellite trailer. The unit was able to stock the site with its own gear because the soldiers were running their real command post over new Starlink satellite terminals that offer better speeds. The soldiers then keyed the fake command post's communications network to emit transmissions as though it was a real command post. The unit also placed cell phones and WiFi pucks in the fake post. The trick worked: the soldiers who play the enemy jammed the fake command post and also hit the fake site with simulated indirect fire, exposing their own position, Armstrong said. Still, the experience revealed challenges with the concept, including how to make a fake command post appear to have realistic signs of life. Having soldiers move back and forth across the site would be more realistic, but would open those soldiers up to enemy attack. 'How do you create a footprint out of that without having a soldier there?&rdquo; Armstrong said. The unit also struggled to maintain deception planning as the exercise went on, he said. The unit brought 90 drones to the exercise, Norrie said during the media roundtable. While 70 of these drones were small Black Hornets, used by infantry squads, the remaining 20 drones were larger quadcopters or tethered drones, which can fly longer because of their connection to electricity. The brigade found the drones useful for artillery target correction and reconnaissance, Armstrong said, as well as helping to monitor the amount of smoke needed to obscure large armored vehicles as they prepared to assault enemy positions. The unit organized some of its drones into a drone team, said Armstrong, who compared the practice to how the 101st Airborne's 2nd brigade manages its drones. 'We're in close coordination with folks like the [2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division],' said Armstrong, speaking at the media roundtable. The 101st's 2nd Brigade is one of three light infantry brigades that are testing new equipment and developing new tactics as part of an Army modernization effort called 'transforming in contact.&rdquo; Rather than try to constantly deconflict airspace for drones and helicopters, the unit also established that drones could fly any time, as long as they were under 150 feet, Armstrong said during his presentation at the Maneuver Conference. One-way attack drones should be thought of as munitions for airspace-deconfliction purposes, Armstrong said. 'If you're going to fire a 203 grenade round, you don't call the brigade aviation element&rdquo; for airspace deconfliction&hellip;It's a mortar round with a camera that can fly.&rdquo; In addition to drone operations, the brigade also practiced counter-drone procedures ahead of their training, said Command Sgt. Maj. Ryan Roush. The drills teach a simple lesson, Armstrong said: 'If you're sitting in the open, you're dying,&rdquo; Amid all the adaptation, soldiers also grappled with how the elements could quickly negate their tech. As daytime temperatures hit 110 degrees, the brigade's vehicles got so hot that their artillery coordination software slowed to a crawl for hours. 'The only variant of the [Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle] that has any climate control is the medical variant,&rdquo; Armstrong said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/armored-unit-adapts-old-tech-lessons-ukraine/399785/	2024-09-24T11:32:58-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/Screenshot_2024_09_24_at_8.32.13AM/large.png
FBI raids defense contractor Carahsoft	The FBI has raided the headquarters of Carahsoft Technology Corp., a provider of IT, software, and cybersecurity services to the Pentagon and others, according to two people familiar with the matter. The raid was conducted in Reston, Virginia, sometime Tuesday morning, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified due to the matter's sensitivity. 'We can confirm that the FBI conducted court-authorized law enforcement activity on Sunset Hills Road this morning. We decline to comment further,&rdquo; an FBI spokesperson said in a statement. Carahsoft is a privately held provider of IT services and software to the Pentagon and other public-sector clients. It has secured billions of dollars in contracts with agencies like the Social Security Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Treasury, according to GovTribe, a federal market intelligence platform owned by Nextgov/FCW parent company GovExec. Carahsoft CEO Craig Abod and a company spokesperson did not immediately return requests for comment. Several notes and images of what appeared to be the raid were posted in a Reddit channel purportedly used by company employees. Nextgov/FCW could not immediately verify the contents of the images, though one appeared to show a group of FBI agents dressed in uniform walking through the office. Another image obtained separately by Nextgov/FCW showed a trio of FBI agents dressed in uniform walking into a building entrance.

Want peace in the Pacific? Bring Taiwan into the UN system	Large parts of the world&mdash;and billions of people&mdash;have enjoyed great prosperity thanks to the peace and stability that prevail across the 97-mile strait separating China from Taiwan. Our island is an indispensable partner in global supply chains, producing more than 90 percent of the world's high-end semiconductors, including many of the advanced chips that are driving the AI revolution. And half of the world's seaborne trade passes through the Taiwan Strait, making it a key international waterway. All this is threatened by Beijing's attempts to change the status quo across the strait and to expand authoritarianism throughout the Indo-Pacific region. In recent years, global leaders have used bilateral and multilateral occasions&mdash;including G7, EU, NATO, and ASEAN meetings&mdash;to highlight the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the strait. Now is the time for the largest international organization of all, the United Nations, to rethink unjustified policies that exclude Taiwan. The UN should begin by resisting PRC pressure to distort UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, the 1971 decision 'to recognize the representatives of [the PRC] Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.&rdquo; China has since willfully misrepresented Resolution 2758, citing it in assertions that Taiwan is part of the PRC and has no legitimate right to meaningfully participate in the UN and its specialized agencies. This misrepresentation has far-reaching consequences beyond denying Taiwanese citizens and journalists access to UN premises and preventing them from visiting, attending meetings, and engaging in newsgathering. Beijing's weaponization of Resolution 2758 is one of the key elements in a campaign to establish the legal basis for justifying a future armed invasion of Taiwan. But in fact, Resolution 2758 addresses only China's representation in the UN. It does not mention Taiwan. It neither states that Taiwan is part of the PRC nor ascribes to the PRC any right to represent Taiwan in the UN system. In other words, the resolution has nothing to do with Taiwan. This case is illustrative of the PRC's growing assertiveness in imposing its will on the international stage. If left unchallenged and uncorrected, Beijing will alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, jeopardize peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, and threaten the rules-based international order. Thankfully, in recent months, several senior U.S. officials have criticized the PRC's distortion of Resolution 2758 to justify its spurious claim over Taiwan. Furthermore, on July 30, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international organization comprising over 250 lawmakers from 38 countries and the EU, demonstrated their support for Taiwan by passing a model resolution on Resolution 2758. The UN should follow suit. The PRC's expansionism will not stop at Taiwan. Other efforts to chip away at long-settled international claims include, for example, the recent regulations introduced by the China Coast Guard. By introducing rules that justify the boarding and detaining of vessels and allow individuals to enter disputed maritime areas, Beijing aims to assert control over international waters and challenge global norms and claims. History has shown that democratic resolve must be demonstrated ahead of time&mdash;before it is too late. As the world's foremost forum for international cooperation, the UN system is ideally positioned to address regional security challenges and support global economic stability. The ongoing 79th UNGA and its upcoming Summit of the Future present a timely opportunity to address key security concerns while advancing the broader goals of global sustainable development and building a more resilient global community for current and future generations. Over many decades, Taiwan has proven to be a responsible and reliable partner to those it has worked with. More recently, we have also made significant contributions to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Embracing Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system would be the UN's best option for heading off regional crises, maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and spurring global prosperity.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/09/want-peace-pacific-bring-taiwan-un-system/399772/	2024-09-24T09:28:33-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: US troops to Mideast; Navy oiler aground; US sets da...	Developing: The U.S. is sending a 'small number&rdquo; of additional troops to the Middle East, the Pentagon said in a short statement Monday, capping a weekend of Israeli-Hezbollah attacks that resulted in Lebanon's largest one-day death toll in more than 30 years, with more than 550 people killed from Israeli strikes, according to the BBC. Several U.S. warships departed their home port in Norfolk on Monday, including the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, two destroyers (DDG-55 and DDG-109) and a cruiser (CG-64). First Ike, now Truman. Truman is set to join the USS Abraham Lincoln (out of San Diego), which was diverted from its Pacific mission to the Middle East to support Israel and U.S. forces nearby. It arrived last month to relieve the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier (also from San Diego), which had been in the region since June. Roosevelt had replaced the Norfolk-based USS Dwight D. Eisenhower after its 'unprecedented&rdquo; eight-month mission that began immediately after Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks that killed more than 1,000 Israelis and triggered supporting attacks by other militants in the region: the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, Iranian proxies in Iraq and eastern Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iran itself in mid-April. By the way: U.S. Navy replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn 'ran aground&rdquo; and is now 'partially flooded off the coast of Oman,&rdquo; according to industry watcher gCaptain. The situation now leaves the Lincoln carrier group 'without its primary fuel source.&rdquo; Why it matters: 'The Big Horn is the only oiler the Navy has in the Middle East,&rdquo; gCaptain reports. See leaked video and photos seeming to illustrate a damaged rudder post as well as flooding in a mechanical space here and here, respectively. Q. Does the Pentagon view the latest Israeli-Hezbollah exchanges as a spreading war? 'No, I don't think we've gotten to that point,&rdquo; Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday. 'I mean, what you don't see is multiple nations conducting operations against one another in the region and you know, in protracted, sustained operations,&rdquo; Ryder explained, in what sounded just a bit like a straw-man rebuttal. In video: 60 seconds of Israel's Iron Dome intercepting missiles fired from Lebanon over Haifa on Monday, via the Associated Press. An Israeli strike on a purported Hezbollah weapons cache in southern Lebanon. The 3:50 mark of this video shows the immediate aftermath of an Israeli strike on an apparently ordinary home, which appears to have set off dozens of secondary explosions you can see in an extended clip here. Israeli PM Netanyahu's warning: 'Anyone who has a missile in their living room and a rocket in their garage will not have a home,&rdquo; the prime minister said in a video posted to social media on Tuesday. New today: Israel says it killed Hezbollah's missile chief, a man named Ibrahim Muhammad al-Qubasi, in a targeted strike inside southern Beirut on Tuesday. 'Al-Qubaysi was responsible for Hezbollah's various missile units, including precision-guided missile units,&rdquo; Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said. 'At the time of the raid, al-Qubaisi was accompanied by a number of senior Hezbollah missile system commanders,&rdquo; he said without elaborating.

Developing: U.S. and Iraqi officials appear to have agreed to a new timeline for the exit of most American forces, U.S. defense officials said over the weekend while being careful to avoid pretty much any specifics yet again. 'This month marks the 10th anniversary of the formation of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and after a decade of that coalition, and particularly the defeat of the territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria, there have been discussions going on really over the last year about the evolution of the coalition and the mission,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters Friday. 'We will be transitioning away from the coalition military mission in Iraq more to enduring bilateral security partnerships,&rdquo; the official said while adding moments later, 'we haven't reached any final conclusions.&rdquo; U.S. defense officials are eyeing the end of 2026 to withdraw most coalition troops from Iraq, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. But 'Even after 2026, a small U.S. force is likely to remain in an advisory capacity and for logistical support for American troops based in Syria under a new bilateral security agreement with Iraq.&rdquo; That agreement is expected to be announced as soon as this week, just ahead of the next counter-ISIS coalition meeting on September 30. For what it's worth: State Secretary Antony Blinken met with Iraqi PM Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani Monday in New York on the sidelines of this week's United Nations General Assembly. The two officials 'reaffirmed our enduring bilateral security partnership to ensure regional stability, the defeat of ISIS, and ongoing efforts to advance a secure and sovereign Iraq,&rdquo; according to Blinken's spokesman. Also from the region: The Houthi takeover of Yemen's capital of Sana'a is now 10 years old, Mike Knights of the Washington Institute wrote last week in an extended note of caution. After enumerating policy stumbles from Washington and London, he warns, 'Removing the Houthis from power will now require a new multi-year, or even multi-decade effort, including a probable return to war inside Yemen.&rdquo; Read more, here. Lastly: Dueling robot wingmen took the stage at last week's AFA conference. But questions of survivability, missions, and sustainment of the Air Force's planned collaborative combat aircraft still linger. Last week, Anduril Industries and General Atomics carefully wheeled their drones into a Maryland convention center for the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference, where industry executives and military officials eagerly discussed how these collaborative combat aircraft might shape the future of air superiority, what missions and roles they might fill, and how they will balance survivability and affordability. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-24-2024/399769/	2024-09-24T08:30:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/DB_lander/large.png
Dueling robot wingmen take the stage	Two years ago, autonomous drones designed to fly and fight alongside fighter jets were just a gleam in Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall's eye. Now, full-scale mock-ups of the robot wingmen are here&mdash;and made a splashy appearance at the service's mainstay conference. Last week, Anduril Industries and General Atomics carefully wheeled their drones into a Maryland convention center for the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference, where industry executives and military officials eagerly discussed how these collaborative combat aircraft might shape the future of air superiority, what missions and roles they might fill, and how they will balance survivability and affordability. The two companies beat out three defense giants earlier this year&mdash;Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing&mdash;to win development contracts for their CCAs. Service leaders want to see flying versions next year, and plan to decide in 2026 whether to build one or both of the companies' offerings as 'increment one,&rdquo; the first tranche of CCAs. The seven-year-old Anduril is pitching its Fury drone, which the company absorbed with its 2023 purchase of autonomous drone maker Blue Force Technologies. General Atomics is offering a version of its Gambit family of aircraft. In addition to the full-scale CCA mockup, the venerable dronemaker also showed off the XQ-67 aircraft, which officials described as a potential 'sensor&rdquo; to the CCA's 'shooter.&rdquo; The XQ-67, which first flew in February, was developed through the Air Force's secretive Off-Board Sensing Station program and helped shape the company's armed CCA concept. The Fury mock-up on the show floor was slightly smaller than General Atomics' offering, and showed external weapons storage, which could make it the less stealthy of the two. (Both may be less stealthy than the tailless UCAVs that China is developing.) The increment-one CCAs will essentially act as missile trucks that haul air-to-air missiles for manned fighters. Increment two will kick off next year, and while requirements are still being worked out, are slated to add mission sets like electronic attack, resilient sensing, and different types of weapons, said Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, Air Force director of force design, integration and wargaming. Future versions could also feature different styles of sustainment and takeoff and landing, Kunkel said, perhaps runaway-independent drones. A key consideration while industry develops their CCA offerings is how survivable the drones should be, given the Air Force's desire to keep the new drones' price tags under $30 million&mdash;roughly, one-third as much as an F-35. The CCAs need to be survivable enough to reach their weapons launch point, but cheap enough to be procured in mass, officials say. 'Obviously, you don't want to have these aircraft get out there and just all get shot down, and obviously, you don't want them to be silver bullets where they cost so much that you can't afford to lose them,&rdquo; said Dave Alexander, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. Alexander said his company's offering hits a price/survivability 'sweet spot,&rdquo; in part because it can carry defensive systems he did not name. But officials with Lockheed Martin, whose design wasn't selected for the first tranche of CCAs, say the notion of a non-stealthy sweet spot was illusory. The company's operational analysis indicates that unstealthy robot wingmen are very unlikely to return from combat, and at $15 or $20 million a pop, that is a 'losing proposition,&rdquo; said John Clark, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division. With that analysis in hand, Clark said, Lockheed had submitted a stealthier design than its rivals. 'I think, hindsight 20/20, we could certainly armchair quarterback and say, well, the Air Force isn't valuing survivability right now, so we gold-plated something that they didn't need gold-plating,&rdquo; he said. Clark said Lockheed is changing its approach for increment two: The company will offer a more expendable design 'at a much, much lower cost point,&rdquo; he said. The Air Force's Kunkel dismissed such concerns, saying that the service has a 'very solid understanding&rdquo; of how survivable it needs its CCAs to be. What it doesn't yet understand is how to keep them flying without an 8,000-mile supply chain. 'We've got to build in these systems, the ability to have a limited signature, to be small enough, to be mobile enough, to have a sustainment pipeline that doesn't go all the way back to Marietta, Georgia. You've got to be able to sustain these things in the combat zone, to frankly, put them in multiple places that creates multiple dilemmas for our adversary when they're on the ground,&rdquo; Kunkel said. The Air Force is already gearing up for the first delivery of these aircraft, and are virtually testing how these drones will pair with manned fighters. The service is setting up an experimental operations unit to test CCA concepts at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, and is plugging the CCAs into the Joint Simulation Environment, a next-gen flight simulator that holds virtual F-35 and F-22 cockpits, Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, commander of Air Combat Command, said during the conference. The first CCAs will go to Creech Air Force Base for testing, Wilsbach said, a base known for its drone operations. 'We're starting to learn more in the virtual environment on how we might use these and then ultimately we'll have iron on the ramp at Creech Air Force Base. We have a team of people already at Nellis starting to work,&rdquo; Wilsbach said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/dueling-robot-wingmen-take-stage/399746/	2024-09-23T14:28:11-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/23/cca_tilt2/large.jpg
The Space Force issued thousands of smartwatches to replace PT te...	The Space Force is halfway through its two-year experiment of monitoring fitness via smartwatches instead of physical fitness tests. The service's top enlisted leader recently shared his experience with the program&mdash;and how he envisions health data intersecting with troop readiness. Air Force Research Laboratory began the two-year, all-volunteer study in May 2023 as part of its Holistic Health Approach. Volunteers must wear their Garmin smartwatches when exercising and fill out questionnaires that are submitted to AFRL's 711th Human Performance Wing. 'Right now, we're in a study period with [the] Air Force Research Lab. So because we're in a study period, I'm a little limited on not only the information that I have access to, what I'm able to talk about, so I can share with you my personal journey,&rdquo; Space Force Chief Master Sgt. John Bentivegna, told reporters during the annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Last year, the Space Force got about 6,000 Garmin smartwatches to dole out to participants in the experiment, which tracks cardio fitness and physical activity. [[Related Posts]] Bentivegna's exercise goal is to hit '150 intensity minutes a week,&rdquo; and he posts updates and his workouts to his personal social media account for additional accountability. The program lets guardians choose their favorite activities. 'I prefer biking, it's what I like to do,&rdquo; he said. 'But it gives flexibility to the [service member] to do the exercise that suits them&hellip;and it's trackable.&rdquo; Exercising regularly and providing feedback through the questionnaires are mandatory for study participants, Air & Space Forces Magazine previously reported. Failure to do either could get participants dismissed from the program, which would mean they'd have to go back to taking regular physical fitness tests. But if the program is broadly adopted, it could be used to improve human performance, or the data could be used in conjunction with other fitness data the military collects, such as the Air Force's mandatory waist-to-height measurement for body composition, to see how it correlates. 'We have individuals who are doing all their intensity minutes, but what's your body composition? Are they aligned, right? Is this working out the right way?&rdquo; Bentivegna said. Study volunteers' data isn't shared with senior leaders. But Bentivegna, as the Space Force's top enlisted leader, said he could envision the program eventually giving leaders better insights into troops' overall wellness. 'So if I have a guardian who's constantly exercising, and has healthy lifestyles, making healthy choices. And I pull up my dashboard and I see that someone has a change in their behavior, a change in their routine, I have an opportunity to engage early. Is everything OK? Are you hurt, or am I working you too hard that you don't have the time now that you need to dedicate to yourself for your fitness and your health, right?&rdquo; he said. 'I like it, because in the long run&mdash;and this is my vision as a leader&mdash;I want to be able to collect the data, because I want it to be a leading indicator to understand the health of the force.&rdquo; But the watches do have a downside: even though they're cleared to go in secure locations, they can't go overseas, Bentivegna said. 'If it's a Department of the Air Force accredited SCIF, I can bring it in, as long as I don't bring it overseas. And like three days after I became chief master sergeant of the Space Force, I traveled to Japan with Gen. [B. Chance] Saltzman, and I brought my watch with me so I was no longer accredited, so I couldn't wear it to work all the time,&rdquo; he said. 'There are some guardians that can wear them to work, others that can't. So, we're working through some of that. But again, it's a study. We're collecting data.&rdquo; AFRL didn't return requests for comment before publication.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/space-force-issued-thousands-smartwatches-replace-pt-tests/399762/	2024-09-23T13:44:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/23/Screenshot_2024_09_23_at_10.43.15AM/large.png
