What the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire means for the region—and US i...	Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah entered a 60-day ceasefire on Nov. 26, 2024, a move aimed at reducing tensions in the region more than a year into a multifront conflict. Under the terms of the deal, Israel would gradually withdraw its forces from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would fully withdraw north of the Litani River. Meanwhile, the Lebanese Army would 'deploy and take control over their own territory,&rdquo; U.S. President Joe Biden said, adding that the United States, France and other allies have pledged to support the deal. But what does the deal mean for the parties involved and future prospects for a more permanent cessation of hostilities? The Conversation U.S. turned to Asher Kaufman, an expert of Lebanon and border conflicts in the Middle East, to explain why they reached a ceasefire now and what it means going forward. Why is the ceasefire deal happening now? The timing of this ceasefire is the result of a convergence of interests among the government in Israel, Hezbollah itself and that of its chief sponsor, Iran&mdash;but all for different reasons. For the Israeli government, domestic issues are at play. First off, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are exhausted after more than a year of war. This is particularly true for Israeli reservists, a growing number of whom are not turning up for duty. The Israeli general public, too, is tired of conflict, and a majority favors a ceasefire with Hezbollah. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also has internal issues in his government to contend with. He is facing pressure from the ruling coalition's ultra-Orthodox partners to draw up laws exempting ultra-Orthodox Jews from the military draft. [[Related Posts]] Reducing the need for active personnel by quieting the front with Lebanon will help in that regard. The secular and national-religious sectors of the society who do serve in the IDF and who are upset with the possibility of a formal draft-exemption law for ultra-Orthodox men may be more inclined to swallow this pill if the war with Hezbollah is over. From the Israeli army's perspective, the war in Lebanon is coming to a point of diminishing returns. It has succeeded in weakening Hezbollah's military standingbut has been unable to wipe the militant group out entirely. This also factors into Hezbollah's thinking. The group has been seriously debilitated in Lebanon; the war has eroded its military capabilities. Unlike its previous position&mdash;reiterated time and again over the past year by its now-dead leader, Hassan Nasrallah&mdash;that a ceasefire would only be possible if first it is reached between Hamas and Israel in Gaza, Hezbollah and, by extension, Iran are now willing to delink the two fronts. This leaves Hamas in a far weaker position as they are now left without the support of Iran's main proxy 'axis of resistance&rdquo; group. Drawing Hezbollah, and other aligned groups in the region, into direct confrontation with Israel had been Hamas' hope when it launched its attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Hezbollah and Lebanon's other political factions also have strong domestic pressures to contend with. Lebanon has more than 1 million refugees as a result of the conflict&mdash;the vast majority of them Shia, the branch of Islam that Hezbollah is drawn from. The conditions in Lebanon have increased the risk of sectarian fighting between Shia and others factions in the country. For Hezbollah leaders, the time may seem right to cut their losses and prepare to regroup as a political and military body. Iran, too, is seeking to rehabilitate Hezbollah's standing in Lebanon as soon as possible. The deal comes as Tehran is bracing for a U.S. administration that could have a more hawkish position on Iran and its proxies in the region, of which Hezbollah is the most significant. With a new Iranian president, and a new U.S. administration, a ceasefire between Iran's main proxy and Israel may be a first step to Tehran building a constructive dialogue with a Trump White House. What is the role of the US in the ceasefire? What is interesting for me is that despite the very clear position of the U.S. in favoring Israel during the past year of conflict, it still functions as an effective mediator. It is thanks to the U.S. that there is a ceasefire&mdash;and it comes despite the fact that Washington is far from neutral in this conflict, being a chief ally of Israel and its main provider of weapons. But the Lebanese government and Hezbollah see a U.S. role, too. And this is not new. The United States was the mediator in the 2022 landmark agreement that, for the first time, set out the maritime boundaries between Israel and Lebanon. The ceasefire deal benefits both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations. For President Joe Biden, it would represent a diplomatic success after a year in which the U.S. has failed to mediate any breakthrough in the conflict in Gaza, and it is an opportunity for Biden to finish his presidency on a positive foreign policy note. From the perspective of Trump, the ceasefire in Lebanon will represent one less problem for him to face. What might be the consequences for Lebanon and Israel? Lebanon has the most at stake in this ceasefire holding. The country was already in a perilous economic situation before the war, and months of fighting has only worsened the structural, economic and political crises in the country. It is as dire as it can get. Further, the war has reignited sectarian tension in Lebanon&mdash;talk of a return to civil war in the country is not far-fetched. But there is uncertainty over how the ceasefire will affect the various rival factions in Lebanese society. Hezbollah has been weakened and may well now look for a way to reassert its strength in Lebanon's politics. The main question is how the other factions and parties respond to that. With a weak Hezbollah, other factions may challenge the militant organization in ways they haven't before. Before being decimated by Israel, there were no rival groups in a position to challenge Hezbollah in Lebanon. But that has all changed: Hezbollah's military power has been degraded and Nasrallah, the group's leader, killed. And Nasrallah was not just the face and brains of Hezbollah, he was also the group's most important link to Iran. There is concern among some Lebanon experts that the gap left by a weakened Hezbollah may see a struggle for power and further strife in the country. And I believe there should be no illusions that Hezbollah will try to reassert itself as a domestic force. Complicating matters is the fact that any realignment of political forces in Lebanon comes amid a political vacuum. There has been a caretaker government&mdash;and no president&mdash;for two years now since Hezbollah conditioned the appointment of a new president with the candidate being an ally of the group. Now, Lebanese politicians would need to agree on a new president who in turn would appoint a new prime minister and government. It remains to be seen how this will unfold with a weakened Hezbollah. For Israel, the ceasefire will provide an opportunity to reconstruct parts of the north that have been devastated by Hezbollah missiles and a possible return of the 60,000 Israelis who fled northern areas close to the Lebanon border. It will also allow the Israel Defense Forces to regroup, refresh and focus their resources in Gaza, rather than fighting on two fronts. I don't see any permanent peace deal on the horizon, given the fact that the fundamental political goals of Israel, Hezbollah and Iran have not changed and that the Israel-Palestine conflict continues to fester. But I am hopeful that the ceasefire could lead to calm and stability between Israel and Lebanon for the foreseeable future. The details of the ceasefire agreement are not very different from U.N. Resolution 1701 that ended the last major war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006. That agreement brought relative calm to the region for 18 years, even if Hezbollah, supported by Iran, used these years to build up its military capability and prepare for a potential ground invasion of northern Israel. In my view, there is a possibility for greater stability this time around given the fact that the ceasefire agreement also stipulates that, if and when it becomes permanent, the deal would serve as a basis for negotiations over the demarcation of the Israel-Lebanon territorial boundary. This would not be an easy task, particularly in the area of Shebaa Farms and the village of Ghajar. But with goodwill and good intentions, even difficult border disputes could be resolved.

The D Brief: Ceasefire pact in Lebanon; US strike in Syria; New S...	Ceasefire pact for Israel, Lebanon Israel and Lebanon agreed to a U.S.- and France-brokered ceasefire with the Iran-backed terrorist group Hezbollah on Tuesday, raising hopes that civilians can return safely to their homes across southern Lebanon. The ceasefire began at 4 a.m. local time Wednesday. But Israel and the terrorist group Hamas are still a long way away from a cessation of hostilities, the New York Times reported Wednesday from Jerusalem. According to the terms of the deal, Israel must remove military elements from Lebanon by January 26, while the Lebanese military secures territories that were under Hezbollah control, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports. As part of the agreement, The U.S. will also chair a newly-formed UN mechanism to monitor for ceasefire violations, and the U.S. will work with the Lebanese Armed Fores to make sure they can respond to violations and deter future ones. But President Joe Biden on Tuesday emphasized that no U.S. troops will be on the ground in Lebanon. Why now? Israel's war on Hezbollah, and particularly its targeted assassination of Hezbollah leaders, has severely hampered the organization, which is one of the reasons White House officials said Tuesday they think this ceasefire will be permanent. 'If it holds, the ceasefire would bring an end to nearly 14 months of fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, which escalated in mid-September into all-out war and threatened to pull Hezbollah's patron, Iran, and Israel's closest ally, the United States, into a broader conflagration,&rdquo; the Associated Press reports. Expert reax: 'This ceasefire and its terms are tantamount to a Hezbollah defeat,&rdquo; analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote Tuesday afternoon. However, 'The ceasefire contains several elements that will prove difficult to implement,&rdquo; ISW adds. That includes the involvement of Lebanon's military, which has 'been in southern Lebanon since 2006, but ha[s] failed to prevent Hezbollah from using the area to attack Israel.&rdquo; For what it's worth: Ceasefire violations have already been observed allegedly by both Israel and Hezbollah, according to PBS Newshour's Leila Molana-Allen. 'Both parties have 60 days to fully comply,&rdquo; she adds. The BBC has the latest. Welcome to this Wednesday edition of The D Brief, brought to you by Ben Watson and Bradley Peniston.

On this day in 2020, Iran's top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was assassinated while traveling on a rural road outside of Tehran. Mideast developments New: U.S. forces attacked a weapons depot at an undisclosed location inside Syria on Tuesday, officials at Central Command announced afterward. 'The strike is in response to an Iranian-aligned attack against U.S. forces in Syria [Monday],&rdquo; CENTCOM said. By the way: President-elect Donald Trump again wants to remove all U.S. troops from Syria, as he did five years ago when the declared American presence fell to 900 from 2,500 troops. But that would be a mistake, Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute argued Friday. 'While ISIS has conducted just 53 attacks in Iraq so far in 2024, it has been behind more than 600 next door, in Syria,&rdquo; Lister writes. Relatedly, 'ISIS is doubling its attack tempo across Syria compared to 2023, while tripling it in northeast Syria, where US forces operate alongside our Syrian Democratic Forces partners.&rdquo; ISIS has reconstituted itself in regime-held areas of Syria, but Central Command has responded more directly in recent weeks, 'launching three rounds of heavy strikes on ISIS training camps that, until then, had been left alone by Assad, Russia, and Iran,&rdquo; Lister says. Why bring it up: 'Given the chaos that prevails across Syria and the regime's inability to deal with the terrorist group, US troops are the glue holding together the only meaningful challenge to an ISIS resurgence,&rdquo; Lister argues. And that glue is a bargain for the money, he says. The Syria mission accounts for just 0.2% of the total U.S. defense budget, Lister estimates. And 'The counter-ISIS mission in Syria and Iraq has also grown more cost efficient, with today's overall budget being 60% less than in 2019.&rdquo; That means, 'For a US taxpayer, the Syria mission currently costs approximately $8 per year, or 67 cents a month,&rdquo; says Lister. And as such, 'Syria offers a case study of extraordinary success achieved at record low levels of expense and risk,&rdquo; he writes. But perhaps most importantly, 'To abandon the mission now would bring no meaningful benefit to the US, but it would swiftly and significantly empower America's adversaries, like ISIS, Iran, Russia, and Assad's regime.&rdquo; Read the rest, here. Elsewhere in Syria, an alliance of militants and terrorists renewed their fight against the Assad regime and Russian troops. The latest flareup appears to have occurred in northwestern Syria around Aleppo, and its the first of its kind in four years, Lister reported separately Wednesday. That impromptu offensive 'appears to have overrun a Russia special forces position, as Assad regime forces collapsed,&rdquo; Lister said, with supporting open-source imagery. 'Make no mistake, this is a potentially transformative moment in Syria's &lsquo;frozen conflict,' which truthfully has never really been frozen,&rdquo; he wrote. Trendspotting: Iraqi militias have been quietly reducing their attacks against Israel for the past several weeks, analyst Mike Knights of the Washington Institute noted on social media Tuesday. Overall there have been 'fewer claims and less solid-looking claims,&rdquo; as well as 'more exaggeration,&rdquo; he writes alongside a chart illustrating these metrics. One big change seems to have occurred nine days ago, 'when Israel openly warned Iraq to stop the militia drone attacks,&rdquo; said Knights. 'And right after, a downward slop[e] becomes a cliff: attacks all but stop,&rdquo; and the remaining '7x claims are somewhat dubious,&rdquo; he added. As his colleague Hamdi Malik observed the day after Israel's warning, 'the militias don't seem to know how to react publicly to Israel's warning: they want to sound tough, but they don't want to be targeted.&rdquo; On the bright side, 'They like drinking coffee in hotels and being playboys: they're mostly not real resistance men,&rdquo; said Knights. What's more, 'Iran doesn't want them wrecked either.&rdquo; And 'That all adds up to good prospects for de-escalation,&rdquo; he argued Tuesday. Trump 2.0 Transition teams cleared to enter Pentagon, other federal agencies. Seven weeks after the recommended date, President-elect Trump has reached an agreement with the Biden administration that will allow staffers to meet with assigned career senior executive staff, receive briefings on agency activities, and exchange information about existing projects and future priorities, reports GovExec's Eric Katz. Still missing: related agreements. Trump has signed no agreement with the General Services Administration, so his transition team lacks access to government office space and to IT services such as official .gov email addresses. Nor has signed the customary agreement that enables the Justice Department to conduct background checks on staff and appointees. Read on, here. For SecNav, Trump picks a donor with no naval or government experience. It's John Phelan, a private-equity investor who once managed the fortune of the Dell Technologies founder. Navy Times: 'If confirmed, Phelan would be the first permanent Navy secretary without military experience since 2009, when Donald Winter finished up his three-year term in the role. Unlike Winter, who previously had worked within the Pentagon and on Navy contracts at major defense firms, Phelan has little public connection to the sea service. Of the 26 men to be confirmed as Navy secretary over the last 70 years, all but six have been veterans.&rdquo; Commentary: Will Musk's &lsquo;Algorithm' reduce military inefficiency&mdash;or increase risk?

The business of space If NATO's European members want to fully harness commercial-space offerings, the alliance must lower an assortment of bureaucratic and financial barriers, industry executives told Defense One's Audrey Decker this week. She spoke to the execs about the findings of a recent survey by NATO's Industrial Advisory Group, which sought input from industry to inform the alliance's effort to develop a commercial-space strategy in time for the alliance's next summit in June. What kind of barriers? Allegedly 'Cumbersome procurement processes, overclassification of information, financial uncertainty and long timelines for contracts, and a lack of protection or insurance if their systems get attacked by adversaries,&rdquo; Decker reports. Why it matters: NATO has no orbital assets of its own, and relies on contributions from member nations, particularly the United States, as well as the commercial industry. But if an Indo-Pacific conflict diverts U.S. capacity, NATO could be left in the lurch&mdash;a prospect that's pushing European nations to figure out how to buy from commercial space companies.

After ceasefire, Biden signals optimism for broader Middle East p...	Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon have agreed to a ceasefire, the White House announced Tuesday. U.S. President Joe Biden heralded the breakthrough as critical to pressuring Hamas to surrender Israeli hostages and agree to a ceasefire in the conflict that began on October 7, 2023, to an end and reshaping the future of the Middle East. But significant challenges remain. 'Under the deal reached today, effective at 4 a.m. tomorrow, local time, the fighting across the Lebanese-Israeli border will end. Will end,&rdquo; Biden said. 'This is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.&rdquo; The deal means Israel must remove military elements from Lebanon over the next 60 days, while the Lebanese military secures territories that were under Hezbollah control. Biden said the military collapse of Hezbollah will put pressure on Hamas to return Israeli hostages, and to reach their own ceasefire agreement with Israel&mdash;potentially opening the door for a long-term peace and a Palestinian State. Capitulation by Hamas, which the White House says is more likely without military support from Hezbollah, would 'bring an end to the fighting, which would make possible a surge of humanitarian relief. Over the coming days, the United States will make another push for Turkey, Egypt, Qatar, Israel, and others to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza, for the hostage release, and the end of the war without Hamas in power.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] As part of the agreement, the United States will play a role in monitoring the ceasefire for violations and bolstering the Lebanese military. But Biden emphasized that no U.S. troops will be on the ground in Lebanon. 'This is all in security assistance and other kinds of related activities,&rdquo; and that it would primarily be done out of embassies, A senior White House official told reporters. 'We don't expect anybody to engage in any kind of combat operations of any kind.&rdquo; Pentagon spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters, 'We're, of course, strongly supportive of a ceasefire. We're consulting closely with our interagency partners in terms of what potential contributions the DOD can make.&rdquo; Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., the Chairman of the Select Committee on Intelligence, said in a statement: 'This agreement to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon, which has killed thousands of people, is a welcome development for the region and should increase pressure on Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement to end the fighting and destruction in the Gaza Strip, which has already claimed so many innocent lives.&rdquo; It's not the first time Hezbollah and Israel have agreed to a ceasefire&mdash;and both sides still claim victory in the 2006 agreement. But Hezbollah remained in Lebanon as a powerful political and military force, even preventing the Lebanese parliament from selecting a president who wasn't aligned with the militant group. But Israel's war on Hezbollah, and particularly its targeted assassination of Hezbollah leaders, has decimated the organization&mdash;one of the reasons the White House thinks this ceasefire will be permanent. Lebanese forces will move into former Hezbollah territory, the White House senior official said, and will 'also be patrolling the area and ensuring that if there's any remaining infrastructure or remaining weaponry, that it is removed and that no such infrastructure can be rebuilt again in that area.&rdquo; It's a new era for the Lebanese government, the official said: 'The opportunity that presents itself today in Lebanon with this ceasefire is for the government to assert its control across a territory and functions that, frankly, they haven't done in 50 years.&rdquo; The United States will chair a newly-formed UN mechanism to monitor for ceasefire violations. 'The United States, both through diplomats and military personnel, are going to be receiving any complaints by either side of any potential violations,&rdquo; the official said. And the United States will work with the Lebanese Armed Fores to make sure they can respond to violations and deter future ones. But, Biden said in his remarks, 'if Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self defense consistent with international law.&rdquo; The official did not address the possibility of Israel breaking the deal. Given Israel's practice of killing leaders of groups it is in negotiations with, that remains a possibility. But, the official said, any claims of a violation by either side would be dealt with promptly&mdash;another departure from the way the United Nations managed previous ceasefires. 'What we're committing to is that, one that's not [a ceasefire complaint that goes to] a mailbox anymore. But rather we will [make] sure that whenever there is a view of a violation, specifically a serious violation, it is addressed immediately.&rdquo; Biden said the agreement is another step toward normalizing relations across the Middle East, and eventually achieving a two-state solution wherein Palestinians gain long-sought political autonomy. 'Today's announcement brings us closer to realizing the affirmative agenda that I've been pushing forward during my entire presidency, A vision for the future of the Middle East&hellip;a future where Palestinians have a state of their own, one that fulfills this people's legitimate aspirations,&rdquo; he said. Still, that last aspiration seems unlikely at best. Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long publicly opposed the two-state solution, even under pressure from the Biden administration to accept it. While Hamas accepted the concept of a separate state along the 1967 borders, the idea is not even popular among the Palestinians. An October poll from last year found that only 24 percent of Palestinians support the plan, 'down from 59% in 2012.&rdquo; Young Palestinians in particular were opposed, with only 15 percent of those aged 15-25 in favor. In February 2020, President Donald Trump proposed a different plan to achieve a two-state solution, one that heavily disadvantaged the Palestinians. That plan would shrink the size of a potential Palestinian state and leave Israel essentially in charge of security, as well as set the timeline for Israeli withdrawal from (now smaller and non-contiguous) Palestinian territories. The Times of Israel in October reported that Trump gave Netanyahu a timeline to end the war in Lebanon before Trump takes office in January.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/after-ceasefire-biden-signals-optimism-broader-middle-east-peace/401338/	2024-11-26T17:07:40-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/26/GettyImages_2187028141/large.jpg

If NATO's European members are to fully harness commercial-space offerings, the alliance must lower bureaucratic and financial barriers, industry executives say. Several execs spoke to Defense One about the findings of a recent survey by NATO's Industrial Advisory Group, which sought input from industry to inform the alliance's effort to develop a commercial-space strategy by next June's summit. Commercial companies face several hurdles while trying to work with NATO, they said, including cumbersome procurement processes, overclassification of information, financial uncertainty and long timelines for contracts, and a lack of protection or insurance if their systems get attacked by adversaries. The alliance, which has no orbital assets of its own, relies on contributions from member nations, particularly the United States, and on commercial industry. But if an Indo-Pacific conflict diverts U.S. capacity, NATO could be left in the lurch&mdash;a prospect that's pushing European nations to figure out how to buy from commercial space companies. The possibility of increased defense budgets and a new, more protectionist U.S. administration is also driving NATO to bolster its own space capabilities. NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte recently said that alliance members need to spend more on defense, praising President-elect Donald Trump's push to get European nations to increase their military budgets. [[Related Posts]] Ville Meskus, who leads defense-business development at satellite communications firm ReOrbit, is deputy chair of SPACENET, the NATO entity that performed the industry survey. 'Given what's going on geopolitically, I think industry understands that the funding for defense is not going to come down anytime soon. So having this commercial space strategy now&mdash;soon to be in place&mdash;it's very timely. How can we actually make as much benefit from this situation from that perspective as possible?&rdquo; Meskus said. But Meskus said it isn't just about the money; it's about NATO putting the mechanisms and processes in place to fund and award contracts quickly, especially to startups. Many of the recommendations in SPACENET's report urge NATO to be more flexible. That includes suggestions to build new contract mechanisms that can be tailored to meet the needs of a diverse group of companies, and create financing models that help smaller companies. SPACENET's chair is Philippe Glaesener, senior vice president of space & defence at SES Satellites. He said start-ups know that NATO's contracting process is so cumbersome it might take a year or two before they see the money, which is way too long for a smaller company to wait. To fix this, the report said, NATO needs more highways to give out money faster, and should create a centralized access gate for space opportunities. Industry respondents told SPACENET that NATO should have something like the states' Front Door program to onboard companies and deliver contracts faster, said Andy Lincoln, vice president and chief engineer at ViaSat's global space networks team, secretary of SPACENET. Glaesener said another main concern for companies is the possibility of their systems being damaged by a cyber or kinetic attack. Commercial insurance doesn't cover wartime damage, so industry needs assurances that an attack won't knock them out of business. NATO's forthcoming commercial strategy will likely shed some light on how exactly the alliance plans to protect commercial systems. Those discussions are ongoing, Glaesener said, but the lack of safeguards keeps some industry companies away from doing business with NATO. The Pentagon also had to deal with the issue of protection in its commercial space strategy, which was released this year. In that document, the U.S. opened the door to using military force to protect commercial satellites, and also said the DOD can provide financial help to companies. SPACENET's report recommends that NATO establish insurance for losses caused by military action, define when NATO would step in and defend commercial systems, and determine the types of defensive capabilities that companies should use to protect themselves. Generally, the space industry group says NATO needs to develop a hybrid architecture of military and commercial systems so if one system is taken down, NATO can jump to another constellation. The U.S. Space Force has also emphasized the importance of resilience, and started its own program to launch a large number of small satellites into space to distribute capability. If NATO fixes its relationship with the commercial industry, it could achieve this multi-constellation network within one or two years, Glaesener said, because recent conflict has created some urgency in the alliance. 'The geopolitical situation right now, we see that, or industry sees member nations and NATO being very willing to engage very quickly, to actually increase very quickly, I would say, the effectiveness of NATO and member nations to engage and work with commercial actors,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/europe-contemplates-military-buildup-space-companies-beg-nato-change/401336/	2024-11-26T15:24:28-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/26/GettyImages_2184847482/large.jpg
Agreement clears Trump transition teams to meet with Defense, oth...	President-elect Trump has reached an agreement with the Biden administration that will allow his teams to deploy throughout federal government, ending a standoff that had blocked official presidential transition efforts taking place. Transition staff assigned to each agency, known as landing teams or agency review teams, will now physically enter headquarters offices throughout government. Once there, they will meet with assigned career senior executive staff, receive already drafted briefings on agency activities and begin the process of exchanging information about existing projects and future priorities. By statute, each presidential candidate is urged to sign agreements with the General Services Administration&mdash;the agency that manages transition efforts&mdash;by Sept. 1 and with the White House by Oct. 1. Trump opted out of both of those memoranda of understanding until Tuesday, when he announced he had reached an agreement with the White House. Trump is notably still refusing to sign an MOU with GSA, meaning his transition team will not have government office space in which it will be based and will not have access to IT services such as official .gov email addresses. 'After completing the selection process of his incoming cabinet, President-elect Trump is entering the next phase of his administration's transition by executing a memorandum of understanding with President Joe Biden's White House,&rdquo; Trump's White House Chief of Staff-designate Susie Wiles said. 'This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power.&rdquo; Lawmakers and good government groups like the Partnership for Public Service's Center for Presidential Transition have maintained pressure on Trump to engage in official transition activities, warning of dire consequences of refusing to do so. Without establishing relationships at agencies and understanding what their offices were working on, they said, the Trump administration will not be ready to govern on day one upon taking office. [[Related Posts]] This year now marks the third consecutive presidential election cycle in which transition activities were delayed: in 2016, Trump's efforts got off to a slow start because his team abandoned its pre-election transition planning efforts. In 2020, Biden's efforts were delayed because Trump refused to concede the election. Agencies throughout government are prepared and waiting for Trump's teams, having completed their briefing materials before the election and designated career staff to aid the landing teams. In his announcement, Trump's transition team noted it will not utilize the taxpayer funds set aside for transition activities. It is also skipping many steps embedded in transition law. His team will forgo an ethics agreement with GSA, instead relying on agreements it set up internally that will now be posted to GSA's website. The president-elect's team will utilize 'existing security and information protections,&rdquo; which it said would eliminate the need for 'additional government and bureaucratic oversight.&rdquo; Transition teams typically sign an additional MOU with the Justice Department so the FBI can conduct background checks on potential nominees. Trump has so far sidestepped that process as well. Wyn Hornbuckle, a DOJ spokesperson, said discussions are ongoing regarding that agreement. 'The transition landing teams will quickly integrate directly into federal agencies and departments with access to documents and policy sharing,&rdquo; the Trump-Vance transition said. It added it would disclose the landing teams to the Biden administration, but did not say whether it would announce those names publicly.

Will Musk’s ‘Algorithm’ reduce military inefficiency—or increase ...	Following through on a campaign promise, president-elect Donald Trump recently appointed Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead an effort they are calling the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. While it is not actually a government department, the entity is likely to prove influential within the Trump administration and the Republican-led Congress&mdash;at least initially. Its mandate is to cut federal spending, and Musk and Ramaswamy have made clear that the Pentagon is in their sights. 'The Pentagon recently failed its seventh consecutive audit,&rdquo; the co-leaders wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed, 'suggesting that the agency's leadership has little idea how its annual budget of more than $800 billion is spent.&rdquo; Previous DoD efficiency initiatives have tried, and largely failed, to trim spending. This time will be different, one could argue, because Elon Musk is involved. He has done things in industry, such as revolutionizing space launch and electric vehicles, that many thought were impossible. To achieve these unlikely feats, Musk developed a ruthless approach that he calls 'The Algorithm.&rdquo; As recounted in Walter Isaacson's biography, the Algorithm consists of five sequential steps: 1) question every requirement; 2) delete any part or process you can; 3) simplify and optimize; 4) accelerate cycle time; 5) automate. As Musk tries his hand at public policy, can this approach work? Musk's Algorithm has largely, and perhaps exclusively, been applied to high-technology and manufacturing-intensive sectors of industry. While the arm of DOD that develops and procures weapons fits this mold, acquisition consumes only about one-third of the defense budget in any given year. The other two-thirds of the budget go toward labor (military and civilian employees) and operations (training, military exercises, routine peacetime operations, housing, and military construction). The first step of the algorithm&mdash;question every requirement&mdash;would be helpful across all parts of the military, from the weapons it acquires to the processes it uses to evaluate people for promotions. Too often, military requirements are passed from generation to generation without re-examining the assumptions behind why things are done the way they are. One of Musk's trademark moves is to assign a name to every requirement&mdash;the specific individual behind it, not a group or department (such as 'legal&rdquo;). In the case of DOD, if the requirement was approved through the joint requirements oversight council, the chair of the JROC or a delegated representative should be the one who defends it. If the requirement is from a combatant command or military service, they should provide a representative to defend it. One of the challenges for DOD is that many of its requirements are external&mdash;that is, dictated by Congress or some other part of government, such as the Office of Personnel Management. For such requirements, the lawyer or other individual responsible for interpreting how the requirement applies to DOD should be the one to defend it. [[Related Posts]] The second step is to delete the parts and processes associated with unnecessary requirements. This sets up a somewhat adversarial environment that can be uncomfortable to many but ultimately productive in the end. Former Army Secretary (and later Defense Secretary) Mark Esper used something along these lines that became known within the Army as 'Night Court.&rdquo; This step is a massive undertaking because inefficiencies in the Defense Department are not always large programs or big pots of funding that can be easily identified and eliminated. (Sorry, there is no billion-dollar budget for diversity programs.) The real inefficiencies are spread thin and wide across a vast bureaucracy, and making the tough calls of what to delete and what to keep will require the active involvement of the next Defense Secretary. This is not something that can be delegated to lower levels if you want decisions to stick. The main risk with step two is that the effects of deleting a requirement can be complex, opaque (especially for old requirements), and non-linear. A requirement that seems outdated or wasteful may have enormous consequences under certain circumstances. The practitioners of the Musk Algorithm should understand that some inefficiencies in the military are by design: they are strategic choices that maintain options in unlikely but highly consequential scenarios. Musk admits that he errs on the side of deleting too many requirements, arguing that 'if you do not end up adding back at least 10 percent of them, then you didn't delete enough.&rdquo; How do you know what needs to be added back when failure is not an option? In the military, every deletion could put lives at risk. The third step is to simplify and optimize, which is where the algorithm starts to break down as it applies to the military. To optimize, one needs an objective function: a metric by which the relative value of different alternatives can be compared. In industry, the objective function could be the time it takes to build each item on a production line, the unit cost of an item, total profit, total revenue, or some other quantifiable outcome that the optimization is intended to improve. Importantly, the validity of an optimum solution is subject to testing&mdash;you can try it out and see if it works before committing. The military is different because its ultimate purpose&mdash;to protect the nation&mdash;is based on value judgements about threats, risks, and sufficiency. How secure does the nation want to be and against what types of threats depends on who you ask and what they value. And while the military can test some changes in operations and processes on a small scale, it has little ability to test major initiatives, such as an alternative strategy, without causing irreversible change. For example, one cannot 'test&rdquo; what pulling back from NATO means for national security without undermining our credibility with allies, which may take years or decades to restore. Even decisions like delaying a weapon system or temporarily reducing peacetime presence missions can have irreversible effects because they create a window of opportunity an adversary can exploit. Practitioners of Musk's Algorithm should again be mindful that many inefficiencies in DOD&mdash;especially the ones that are government waste at its finest&mdash;are often there by design because it creates something else people value. Inefficiencies maintain jobs in someone's congressional district, which is why they persist and are so difficult to eliminate. Even if a solution can be negotiated among stakeholders to reduce the most egregious inefficiencies, the system does not stay optimized for long because the military operates as a dynamic open system subject to innumerate external factors, including the actions of adversaries and allies and the whims of domestic politics. Steps four and five of the Algorithm&mdash;accelerate cycle time and automate&mdash;are highly relevant to the military, but they depend on having simplified and optimized in step three. Otherwise, you will be accelerating and automating processes that remain inefficient. While this may still be a marginal efficiency improvement over the status quo, it could further entrench and legitimize unnecessary processes, making them even more difficult to reform in the future. Where step three can be accomplished using value judgments negotiated across competing political interests, steps four and five can create important military advantages. The military desperately needs to accelerate the pace of innovation in its weapons programs and the time it takes to make policy, administrative, operational, and tactical decisions. Moreover, the ability to automate processes in the back-office functions of the Pentagon (e.g., filing and reviewing expense reports) and at the tactical edge (e.g., sorting through terabytes of sensor data in real time) frees up people to focus on the cognitive and value judgement elements of warfighting and planning&mdash;areas where humans are most valuable. Automation is not a replacement for humans or human judgement; it is an enabling tool that allows humans to be more effective and efficient. Nearly everyone in Washington recognizes that the Pentagon is in dire need of reform, including many of the people that lead or have led the Pentagon. Defense reform is not and should not be a partisan issue, but it cannot help being a political issue because politics is about the allocation of resources within society: who gets what. The budget is a key tool for reforming defense, but reformers should remember that the budget is ultimately an expression of political values. How much security and what kind of security the nation wants is a value judgement made by elected and appointed leaders that represent the people. If the people elect politicians who talk about peace through strength and eliminating waste and inefficiency but then act in ways that are contrary to these ideas, one can only conclude that the people must not really value these things. In a democracy, the people get the government they deserve, as ineffective and wasteful as that may be.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/11/will-musks-algorithm-reduce-military-inefficiencyor-increase-risk/401327/	2024-11-26T13:34:15-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/26/GettyImages_2185632401/large.jpg

How might Trump 2.0 approach Sub-Saharan Africa policy?	What will the incoming Trump administration mean for U.S. foreign policy in sub-Saharan Africa? During his first term, Donald Trump derided so-called 'shithole countries&rdquo; on the continent and throughout the broader Global South. Yet his administration's policies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, rarely matched his isolationist and xenophobic rhetoric, as seen in the construction of a drone base in Niger costing over $100 million. However, today, with the rise of the jihadism crisis in the Sahel, the arrival of the Wagner Group and other foreign military contractors, and a wave of military juntas across the continent, a new Trump administration may have some radical ideas for Africa. Through his first presidency and on the campaign trail in 2024, Trump exhibited skepticism about customary U.S. investment in partners and allies. For example, he criticized NATO countries for not paying enough and questioned the need to keep U.S. troops deployed in Germany and South Korea. He can be expected to apply this same approach to Africa in his second stint in office. This could entail a securitization-focused approach to Africa that relies on the U.S. military-industrial base, including drone sales, weapons and equipment, and contractors. With several China hawks joining Trump's cabinet, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, his administration will continue to look at foreign policy through the zero-sum lens of great power competition. In Africa, this means strategic competition with China and Russia. Both Beijing and Moscow remain highly active on the continent, in addition to second-tier or middle powers such as Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia. These competitors have taken advantage of internal civil wars in Sudan and Somalia or growing jihadist threats in the Sahel to increase arms sales. The delivery of unmanned aerial systems, or drones, has led the way, while countries have also purchased equipment such as mine-resistant vehicles, missiles, and even satellites. These deals also provide a bridgehead for mining and resource-extraction deals, such as Turkey's with Niger. An American approach focused on weapons and equipment sales would provide a cheap and clear signal of the administration's commitment to transactional relationships abroad while maintaining support from domestic companies producing these systems within the United States. [[Related Posts]] The exact way in which the Trump administration will approach its interactions with junta regimes remains unclear. It would be unsurprising to see President Trump, with the support of a Republican congress, jettison the Section 7008 restrictions that prevent direct economic and military assistance, including training, from being provided to junta regimes. On numerous occasions, Trump has demonstrated an interest in aligning with autocrats such as Hungary's Victor Orban, so it wouldn't be a stretch for him to favor aligning with African junta leaders. The administration could either withdraw these restrictions entirely or circumvent them by placing Sahelian leaders into the same category as Egypt's government&mdash;a regime that came to power through a coup, though one that the United States has avoided labeling as such. Still, such an approach could run counter to Trump's other priorities, particularly the president-elect's commitment to isolationism, demonstrating the internal contradictions within the nascent foreign policy of Trump 2.0. Trump has also highlighted the importance of transactional relationships, which would argue against the extension of aid to some junta states. Peter Pham, who was a special envoy to the African Great Lakes during Trump's first term and may receive an appointment in his second, noted that 'there was a higher chance assistance would be cut off if a country was perceived to be acting against U.S. interests. &lsquo;We have to be more intentional about that, and that means capable partners and accountability.'&rdquo; Thus, junta regimes that have potentially aligned themselves with Russia, or ones that might align with China in the future, may be removed from potential aid programs. Given this confluence of factors, it's hard to determine how the new administration will handle America's delicate relationships with Africa's crop of junta governments, but there could be a return to a more realpolitik approach than was the case during the Biden administration. On its face, this is not necessarily a bad thing, although it could raise concerns within the U.S. State Department and among human rights groups and civil society organizations. One approach, with significant implications, could be to mimic the Wagner Group's role as a security-assistance provider. Such an approach would essentially look like Wagner-lite, the reintroduction of Blackwater-type organizations in a more offensive role. In this scenario, the Trump administration would give mercenary organizations the legal right to operate in offensive roles abroad. While this would be a first for the United States, other Western countries have funded offensive mercenary activities in Africa in the past. French and British mercenaries fought in Cote d'Ivoire in 2003, including as helicopter pilots. UK-based Aegis Defence Services allegedly employed child soldiers from Sierra Leone as mercenaries in Iraq during the 2010s. Trump is no stranger to mercenary organizations. During his last administration, he pardoned four Blackwater contractors who shot into a crowd in Iraq in 2007. Trump also has close connections with former Blackwater CEO Erik Prince, who has led a variety of mercenary operations. A mercenary-led approach in Africa could satisfy the administration's need for transactional policy, particularly if mercenary activities followed the Wagner Group model of exchanging security for resource extraction agreements. Further, these activities could fulfill other U.S. policy goals, including countering terrorism and great power competition. It would also go hand-in-hand with increased weapons sales, particularly as contractors might be needed to train local military on new systems, operate drones, etc. However, this type of activity could leave companies, let alone the administration, open to blowback if civilians, etc, are attacked, as Wagner has done in Mali, Central African Republic, and elsewhere. The Trump administration may take a different approach to the battle for control of rare earth elements, particularly in the Democratic Republic of Congo, or DRC, against China. Critical earth minerals such as cobalt and lithium are essential for both green technologies and the microprocessors that power batteries from cars to cell phones. Despite President Trump's distaste for green energy, he will need to compete in this sector to prevent the United States from falling further behind China in its access to these materials. The Biden administration's Lobito Corridor is a jumping-off point, a deal with Angola to create a pipeline for minerals from DRC and Zambia to flow to Angola's Atlantic ports. However, the Trump administration could provide diplomatic and military muscle to back U.S. companies in DRC, many of whom have been discouraged by the difficult operating environment in the country. This approach could reflect broader Trump policies that involve competition with China and could provide a key resource in case of a trade war with China. However, increased U.S. involvement in DRC could inflame local tensions by undermining the fragile balance of power in the region. Eastern DRC already has weapons and foreign militaries pouring in, including Rwandans, Burundians, and a variety of international mercenary companies. American money, to say nothing of potential mercenary support, could further inflame local tensions among various parties interested in protecting their profitable fiefdoms. Whether the Trump administration cares about the international consequences rather than America's bottom line in the latest scramble for natural resources appears to be a question easily answered. The United States might also find itself more active diplomatically in regional disputes, such as the ongoing struggle over Somaliland, which is a former British protectorate along the southern coast of the Gulf of Aden and bordered by Ethiopia to its south and west. The territory seceded from Somalia in 1991 but remains unrecognized as an independent state. A lucrative and geopolitically advantageous port deal between Somaliland, backed by Ethiopia and UAE, put it at odds with Mogadishu and its backers, Egypt and T&uuml;rkiye. If the Trump administration does decide to exert Washington's influence more forcefully on the continent, in an effort to engage in more robust strategic competition with Beijing and Moscow, it could find itself working through regional disputes and picking sides based on which configurations present the United States with the most advantageous arrangement toward its adversaries and competitors.

Musk's government roles create 'clear avenues for serious conflic...	As a SpaceX Starship rocket steered its way back to Earth Nov. 19 before ultimately landing in the Gulf of Mexico, President-elect Donald Trump watched from Texas alongside Elon Musk. Musk is the founder of SpaceX, the space company that handles launches for NASA, the U.S. Space Force and the National Reconnaissance Office. Following Trump's election he is also the co-chair of the cheekily named commission, Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which is a dog-themed cryptocurrency. And Musk is once again a central figure, if not the central figure, at the hub of a web of complicated, sometimes contradictory, positions surrounding the U.S. government's spending and policy on space. He leads a company that has more than $10 billion in government contracts, and is also the face of a new body aimed at getting rid of government waste. He wants to win new space launch and satellite contracts with the U.S. Space Force and intelligence community, but his reported calls to Russian President Vladimir Putin according to the Wall Street Journal, have raised questions about national security. And his company is now accused of having a near monopoly on some space technologies, a charge he levied against United Launch Alliance a decade ago when he was trying to break into the market to launch national security satellites. All of this comes as he's sparred with government agencies, such as the Federal Communication Commission and the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Labor Relations Board. Two defense analysts contacted by The Space Project said it was still unclear how Musk's relationships and new role with the Trump administration may play out. (Musk has made a practice of not following convention. Gen. William Shelton, the former head of Air Force Space Command, once said of Musk, 'Generally, the person you are doing business with, you don't sue.&rdquo;) On Nov. 13, the nonprofit Project for Government Oversight, used the Musk-owned social media outlet X to tweet: 'If Elon Musk is running a Dept. of Government Efficiency AND his own companies&mdash;especially ones that work with the gov't&mdash;there are clear avenues for serious conflicts of interest. Public servants need to be dedicated to serving the public above all else.&rdquo; On Nov. 15, two Democratic Senate leaders, Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island asked the Department of Defense's Inspector General and Attorney General to review whether Musk's security clearance was at risk following reports of calls to Putin. In a separate letter, they also asked the Secretary of the Air Force, Frank Kendall, about concerns of overreliance on SpaceX as a single provider for global broadband connectivity in low Earth orbit. 'Mr. Musk's reported behavior could pose serious risks to national security, and as CEO of a company with billions of dollars in sensitive defense and intelligence contracts, warrant reconsideration of SpaceX's outsized role in DoD's commercial space integration,&rdquo; the letter to Kendall read. The senators asked for a response and briefing no later than Dec. 1. Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said from a contract perspective he did not expect much to change. He pointed to SpaceX's record of 'outperforming&rdquo; other launch companies and said the company's advantage 'is so great that I don't think any kind of political favoritism would come close to what they've won fair and square.&rdquo; Where there may be an advantage for Musk, Harrison said, is if Trump were to push for a human mission to Mars around fiscal year 2027. 'They're in the best position to compete for that, not because of political favoritism, but just because of how they've innovated in their company,&rdquo; he said. However, he suggested 'we could see a complete revamp and reorientation of NASA's budget, slashing a lot of Earth science missions, slashing a lot of education-related funding, and reinvesting all of that and making sure we get back to the moon during Trump's second term. But changes at the FAA and the FCC for SpaceX's launch licensing process and environmental review are already underway during the Biden administration, Harrison noted, as is a long-standing shift to fixed-price commercial contracts. 'Elon is going to push for that, but he's pushing on an open door,&rdquo; Harrison said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/musks-new-role-spacex-gets-extra-attention/401284/	2024-11-25T11:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/25/GettyImages_2185632399_1/large.jpg
The D Brief: Invasion gains pace; Plane crash in Lithuania; New P...	Putin's Ukraine invasion is gaining pace Russia's invasion forces are 'advancing at a significantly quicker rate than they did in the entirety of 2023,&rdquo; especially around Vuhledar and Velyka Novosilka in Donetsk Oblast, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War reported in their Sunday afternoon assessment. In perspective: Russian forces 'gained at least 1,103 square kilometers&rdquo; since September 1&mdash;compared to just 387 square kilometers in all of 2023, ISW writes. What might lie ahead: A probable Russian 'advance into the southeasternmost part of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast in support of Russia's longstanding objective to seize all of Donetsk Oblast,&rdquo; ISW forecasts. Developing: Russia's military may be trying to split Ukraine into at least three different parts, according to an alleged Russian document reviewed by Ukrainian intelligence. Those three parts, according to ISW, include: 'one acknowledging the full Russian annexation of occupied Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhia, and Kherson oblasts and occupied Crimea&rdquo;; 'another establishing a pro-Russian puppet state centered in Kyiv under Russian military occupation&rdquo;; 'and a third part designating Ukraine's western regions as &lsquo;disputed territories' to be divided among Ukraine's westernmost neighboring countries.&rdquo; New: Russia lured 'hundreds&rdquo; of men from Yemen to fight in Ukraine, the Financial Times reported Sunday. 'When they arrived with the help of a Houthi-linked company, they were then forcibly inducted into the Russian army and sent to the front lines in Ukraine.&rdquo; The men were reportedly promised jobs in 'security&rdquo; and 'engineering,&rdquo; with the first known transfers occurring this past July. That means Russia has now employed North Koreans, Yemenis, as well as 'mercenaries from&thinsp;Nepal and India&rdquo; for its invasion of Ukraine, FT writes. 'Yemen is a pretty easy place to recruit. It is a very poor country,&rdquo; one regional expert said. One of the Yemeni men reportedly 'said he was promised a $10,000 bonus and $2,000 per month, plus eventual Russian citizenship, to work in Russia manufacturing drones.&rdquo; More, here. More than 140 Russian drones and missiles targeted cities across Ukraine in the early morning hours Monday, President Volodymir Zelenskyy said on social media. 'So far, we know of 19 casualties&rdquo; in Kharkiv, he said. Ten different regions were targeted, Zelenskyy said. 'Combat operations are still ongoing against aerial targets that remain in the air,&rdquo; he added at about noon local time. Developing: Officials in London and Paris are allegedly considering sending troops to Ukraine, Le Monde reports, citing contingency talks for how to deal with the incoming Trump administration in Washington. Former BBC journalist Mark Urban offered his interpretation for how those troops could find their way to Ukraine, writing on social media Monday morning, here. Also: A top military official at NATO warned Europe's 'businesses need to be prepared for a wartime scenario and adjust their production and distribution lines accordingly,&rdquo; NATO Military Committee Chief Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer said Monday in Brussels. 'While it may be the military who wins battles, it's the economies that win wars,&rdquo; he said. 'If we can make sure that all crucial services and goods can be delivered no matter what, then that is a key part of our deterrence,&rdquo; Bauer said. Referring to China and Russia, 'Business leaders in Europe and America need to realise that the commercial decisions they make have strategic consequences for the security of their nation,&rdquo; the admiral said.

Unease in Vilnius A Boeing 737-400 DHL cargo plane crashed upon landing in Lithuania, killing one Spanish crew member and injuring three others on board, authorities in Vilnius said Monday. The crash is particularly notable as it occurred three weeks after European authorities publicly alleged Russian operatives appear to have been behind at least two apparent bomb plots this summer targeting DHL cargo planes flying to the U.S. and Canada. 'A surveillance video showed the plane descending normally as it approached the airport before sunrise, and then exploding into a huge ball of fire behind a building,&rdquo; the Associated Press reports. The plane had departed Leipzig, Germany, for a 5:30 a.m. arrival Monday morning. Leipzig is also one of the locations where an incendiary device exploded over the summer, raising suspicion among European and U.S. authorities. Lithuania's intelligence chief: 'For now, we really cannot make any attributions or point fingers at anyone&rdquo; because an investigation has just begun, Darius Jauni&scaron;kis told reporters Monday. Also notable: 'The pilots until the very last second did not tell the tower of any extraordinary event,&rdquo; said Marius Baranauskas, the chief of Lithuania's National Aviation Authority. One witness told Reuters, 'The right wing of the plane turned down before it crashed, as if it was trying to turn,&rdquo; and 'There was something shiny coming out of the right side of the plane, like sparks or a flame, before it hit the ground.&rdquo; Pacific Developing: American soldiers and Marines are planning to 'set up temporary bases along Japan's southwestern Nansei island chain and the Philippines to deploy missile units in the event of a Taiwan contingency,&rdquo; Kyodo News reported Sunday. The Marines would reportedly bring High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems with them, posing an additional challenge to possible Chinese forces in the region. The Army would task its Multi-Domain Task Force and their 'long-range fire units,&rdquo; Kyodo reports. Read more, here.

Russian submarine tech could help China out-pace the US, says IND...	Russia will most likely provide the technology to help China build new and better submarines, the head of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said Saturday. 'That has the potential of closing American undersea dominance to the PRC,&rdquo; Adm. Sam Paparo said during the Halifax Security Forum. The growing partnership between China, Russia, North Korea, and Iran is making each of them more dangerous, he said. While Russia is receiving cash from China in exchange for oil, the two are also exchanging technology. The 'PRC has rebuilt, helped to rebuild Russia's war machine, with 90% of its semiconductors and 70% of the machine tools that have rebuilt that war machine,&rdquo; Paparo said. While China boasts a larger navy than the United States, the U.S. Navy is generally considered to be more advanced when it comes to submarines. The reason: The entire U.S. submarine fleet is nuclear powered, whereas China's sub fleet is primarily diesel, which is less safe and requires more regular refueling. But China is moving ahead quickly with the production of more nuclear-powered submarines, though it has seen some notable mishaps, including the sinking of one of those nuclear submarines earlier this year. 'This is a dangerous environment, and this is adding complexity to the environment itself,&rdquo; Paparo said. South Korean defense officials said in October that they also anticipate that Russia will exchange missile technology with North Korea. Paparo reiterated those concerns Saturday, saying he expects 'Russia to provide missile technology and submarine technology to North Korea.&rdquo; The United States is responding to that possibility by deepening its relationship with partners in the region via joint efforts and intelligence sharing, he said, and encouraging those partners&mdash;such as Japan and South Korea&mdash;to collaborate more with one another as well.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russian-submarine-tech-could-help-china-out-pace-us-says-indopacom-chief/401270/	2024-11-23T18:24:20-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/23/GettyImages_2147947230/large.jpg
In Fiji, defense diplomacy and rain-soaked rugby	BLACK ROCK CAMP, Fiji&mdash;Fijian and U.S. officials cemented one defense agreement and opened talks on another&mdash;but first, there was roast pig and rugby in the rain. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived on this South Pacific island on Friday, the final stop on a nine-day journey that has taken him to Australia, the Philippines, and Laos. 'The goal really here is to not just regularize, but to make more frequent our engagement&rdquo; with Fiji and the Pacific island region, a senior defense official said ahead of Austin's arrival. Austin's visit here is the first by a U.S. defense secretary, but among a handful in recent years by various cabinet-level officials. Fiji is a leader in the region and one of three Pacific-island countries that maintains a standing professional military. It also controls a wide swath of waters and resources in its exclusive economic zone. 'People call them &lsquo;small island nations,' but really should call them &lsquo;large oceanic states,'&rdquo; one U.S. official said. On Austin's to-do list: wrap up 10 years of U.S. work on an acquisition and cross-servicing agreement, or ACSA, a bilateral pact intended to smooth the way for joint U.S-Fijian military logistics. 'From fuel to medical supplies to the use of maintenance facilities,&rdquo; the senior defense official said. 'When things happen, they happen fast. So to be able to say that we're able to do that, to offer that kind of logistical support, it's critical.&rdquo; More than 120 countries have ACSA agreements with the United States. Some, such as Japan and South Korea, have copied the idea and signed their own ACSA-type deals with others. Such agreements do not commit signatories to military action in any way. Austin also came to launch talks on a status-of-forces agreement, another document that deepens a bilateral defense relationship. SOFAs lay out the legal status of U.S. troops and dependents in a foreign country, including civil and criminal jurisdiction. Basing arrangements, if any, are typically negotiated separately. 'The SOFA will enable us to deploy and redeploy forces in support of Fiji and help us train with the Fijians on a very routine basis,&rdquo; Austin said Saturday at a press conference at a nearby hotel and conference center. 'I look for routine rotations, training rotations, where possible, to be conducted,&rdquo; plus continued work with the Nevada National Guard. Austin said 'there is no notion&rdquo; of permanently basing U.S. troops in Fiji. 'We did not have any discussions like that.&rdquo; If SOFA negotiations are concluded as expected next year, Fiji will join several dozen nations that already have such agreements with the United States. Austin also said the U.S. would soon deliver several rigid-hull inflatable boats and a boat ramp to help Fiji patrol its waters, and announced plans for $4.9 million in foreign military financing, pending congressional approval. The senior defense official said Fiji would put the new funds toward small arms. 'Again, building military capacity, right? Professionalization of the military. This will go really straight to what they're asking for, what the needs are,&rdquo; they said. At the press conference, a local reporter asked Austin what to expect from the incoming administration of Donald Trump. 'Fiji has always considered climate change a national-security threat,&rdquo; the reporter said. 'And we have President-elect Trump who considers climate change a hoax and who has also in the past pulled out of the Paris Accord.&rdquo; What, he asked, should the Pacific expect in the way of U.S. leadership? 'I can't tell you what the next administration will do in terms of policy adjustments or things of that nature,&rdquo; Austin responded. 'What I can tell you is that I'm absolutely proud of the work that we've done. We've advanced things in a number of areas and we've strengthened our relationship. 'And I truly believe that the strength of those relationships will endure far beyond the transition of administrations. I think the United States enjoys the strongest network of allies and partners in the world. We have the largest network of allies and partners in the world. And our relationship with allies and partners around the globe has enabled us to sustain our efforts and to endure a number of challenges globally. And I'm confident that our strong relationship that we have now will continue to blossom.&rdquo; Austin's visit began with an elaborate welcoming ceremony at Black Rock Camp that included drums, dancing, and the presentation of a roast pig so large it took six grass-skirted Fijian troops to lay it before the visiting secretary. The rain-dampened proceedings continued with a 15-minute rugby game between the base's team and a local village club. At the Saturday press conference, Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka recalled that Austin had played rugby at West Point. 'If he'd come when he was younger, we'd have tried to recruit him for our rugby team,&rdquo; Rabuka said. 'You have some pretty good players,&rdquo; Austin replied.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/fiji-defense-diplomacy-and-rain-soaked-rugby/401269/	2024-11-22T16:08:16-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/22/DSC_6966_1/large.jpg
NIST sets up new task force on AI and national security	The National Institute of Standards and Technology has set up a new task force within its existing Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute focusing on evaluating the myriad security implications of artificial intelligence models with inter-agency participation. Dubbed the Testing Risks of AI for National Security Taskforce, or TRAINS, the group consists of members from the Department of Defense&mdash;including its Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office and the National Security Agency&mdash;the Department of Energy and its national labs; the Department of Homeland Security and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; and the National Institutes of Health within the Department of Health and Human Services. Members from these entities will assist in measuring and evaluating AI models based on their areas of expertise, including national security, radiological and nuclear security, cybersecurity, critical infrastructure and more. 'Enabling safe, secure and trustworthy AI innovation is not just an economic priority &mdash; it's a public safety and national security imperative,&rdquo; U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a press release. 'The U.S. AI Safety Institute will continue to lead by centralizing the top-notch national security and AI expertise that exists across government in order to harness the benefits of AI for the betterment of the American people and American business.&rdquo; The establishment of the new task force follows uncertainty ahead of the incoming Trump administration and its plans for AI policy. The AISI was stood up as part of President Joe Biden's landmark executive order on AI and established a consortium of academic, industry and civic partners to encourage responsible AI policy development and usage. With incoming President Donald Trump's aim to repeal Biden's executive order, doubt surrounds the future of the AISI and other federal AI policy initiatives.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/nist-sets-new-task-force-ai-and-national-security/401266/	2024-11-22T09:25:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/22/112124AING/large.jpg
ULA’s Vulcan won’t launch any Space Force missions this year	United Launch Alliance's new Vulcan rocket won't send any Space Force payloads to space this year, company officials confirmed late Thursday evening, delaying the planned national security launches to next year. Space Force officials hinted about ULA's trouble launching national security missions on Thursday: 'I will say, with only six weeks left to go in the calendar year, that we are getting challenged to be able to launch this year,&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander of Space Systems Command, told reporters at a Defense Writers Group event. ULA's Vulcan was supposed to fly two Space Force missions, USSF-106 and USSF-87, by the end of 2024, but the new rocket hasn't been certified after completing its second flight in October. The Space Force is still investigating an abnormality that occurred during that flight where material broke off one of the solid rocket boosters. Garrant said he's confident Vulcan will get certified&mdash;it's just a matter of when. 'If they are not launching by the end of the year, we would delay those [Space Force] launches,&rdquo; Garrant said. Vulcan is the centerpiece of ULA's plan to compete against Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has dominated the launch market in recent years. The Space Force is trying to bring in more launch providers through an effort called the National Space Security Launch program, and has tapped SpaceX, ULA, and Blue Origin to provide the first NSSL Phase 3 launches in 'Lane 1,&rdquo; which is intended for less risky missions. But awards in 'Lane 2,&rdquo; the more challenging heavy-lift missions, are on hold until Congress passes a budget, Garrant said. SpaceX is the only company that's certified for Lane 2 missions, Garrant said, but ULA and Blue Origin, which plans to launch its New Glenn rocket for the first time before the end of the year, are working toward certification. Meanwhile, SpaceX is continuing to develop its reusable mega-rocket Starship, which will likely upend space operations with its massive payload capacity. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman visited SpaceX facilities in Texas this week to watch Starship's sixth flight test, alongside President-elect Donald Trump. SpaceX made history in October when it caught a Starship rocket for the first time. While the company has not approached the Space Force about certifying Starship yet, 'they are doing many, many flights, which is a means to certification&hellip;we are absolutely watching them very carefully. It's a phenomenal capability to [low Earth orbit], large, large numbers of satellites. It'll be a gamechanger. We are thinking about how we might use it,&rdquo; Garrant said. 'We think the first, most logical, given the payload volume, and I was at Boca Chica two weeks ago and got a chance to see it firsthand, would be like some type of rocket cargo delivery mechanism, but absolutely interested in the potential military utility and definitely following their progress,&rdquo; he said. The Air Force Research Laboratory has been working on this concept through the Rocket Cargo program, which awarded SpaceX a $102 million contract in 2022 to explore using its space launch vehicles for cargo transport. That program became a new start in the Space Force's 2025 budget request under a different name, 'Point to Point Delivery.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/ulas-vulcan-wont-launch-any-space-force-missions-year/401255/	2024-11-22T08:32:28-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/22/GettyImages_2175785842/large.jpg
The D Brief: Russia’s MIRV missile; Space Force’s naughty list; M...	Update: Beware the 'Oreshnik.&rdquo; The experimental missile that Russia fired at Ukraine's Dnipro region this week was based on their RS-26 Rubezh design, according to the Pentagon. Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said that the United States had received advanced warning from Russia about the launch. Expert reax: Tom Karako from CSIS said that the missile appeared to have multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, or MIRV. 'That's going to be a wicked hard problem to hit multiple things.&rdquo; That's also going to be hard problem for allies looking to bolster their missile defenses. Defense One's Patrick Tucker has more. Panning out:'Neither the Oreshnik ballistic missile strike nor Putin's November 21 statement represent a significant inflection in Russian strike capabilities or likeliness to use a nuclear weapon,&rdquo; analysts at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in their Thursday assessment. 'The West maintains credible deterrence options and Putin's nuclear saber-rattling should not constrain Western officials from choosing to further aid Ukraine,&rdquo; they added. By the way: The U.S. military says it's adjusting its Nuclear Deterrence Strategy. In light of new nuclear saber rattling from Russia and gathering threats from China and Iran, 'adjustments to the 2022 Nuclear Posture Review may be required to sustain the ability to achieve nuclear deterrence, in light of enhanced nuclear capabilities&rdquo; according to DOD News who spoke to Richard Johnson, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Nuclear and Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Policy. What's that mean? It's not yet clear; but speaking to an audience earlier this week, Gen. Anthony Cotton, the head of U.S. STRATCOM, said 'I think the days are gone in respect to just seeing things from a global combatant command perspective,&rdquo; meaning that responding to nuclear threats in the future would require more collaboration across all the aspects of the military across all locations. New: Russian sabotage campaign targets U.S. defense industrial base. The warning comes from the National Counterintelligence and Security Center, which advised U.S. companies to watch out for possible surveillance activity near their facilities and staff, as reported by The New York Times. European and U.S. officials have been warning for months of increased hybrid warfare attacks including a German arms executive for assassination, a plot uncovered in July.

Around the Defense Department New: The Space Force has put a defense contractor on a blacklist intended to hold companies accountable for poor performance and program delays, Space Systems Command's Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant told reporters at an event Thursday in Washington. It's known as the Contractor Responsibility Watch List, and it was created in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act to give Space Systems Command the power to stop underperforming contractors from getting new contracts, Defense One's Audrey Decker reports. Until Thursday, the Space Force had not confirmed if it even used that list. 'There is a company on the watch list today. I won't say who it is,&rdquo; Garrant said. He did, however, say the contractor works on high-priority space programs. Big picture: Air Force space acquisition chief Frank Calvelli has been trying to address long-delayed 'problem children&rdquo; programs in the Space Force, Decker writes. Those 'problem children&rdquo; include an RTX program called GPS Next Generation Operational Control Segment, or OCX, which are ground stations that will control the Pentagon's constellation of GPS satellites, as well as an L3Harris space command-and-control system called Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System, or ATLAS. The Space Force also recently booted RTX from a contract to develop new missile warning and tracking satellites due to cost overruns and schedule problems&mdash;an example of how the service is keeping contractors accountable, Garrant told reporters.

'At this critical moment, a new Senate Republican majority has a responsibility to secure the future of U.S. leadership and primacy.&rdquo; McConnell has two years left in his senate term. He hasn't yet announced whether he will run for reelection. Opinion: It's harder to get into the military than it is to stay there, thanks in part to different medical standards across the Defense Department. But by making them match, the Pentagon could widen its recruiting pool without undermining the force, argue Air Force Lt. Col. Kareen Hart and Taren Sylvester of the Center for a New American Security, writing Thursday in Defense One. Reminder: Only 23 percent of youth 17 to 24 years old are qualified to serve in the military without a waiver. Just 10 percent express any interest in actually serving. Relatedly, 'Many of the assumptions that undergird the recruiting standards are outdated or simply wrong,&rdquo; Hart and Sylvester write. For example, 'Asthma can disqualify a potential military recruit, yet a recent study reported that 16.5 percent of Olympic athletes have asthma. Champion sprinter Noah Lyles proves that even major respiratory conditions do not preclude athletic success.&rdquo; Another thing: The authors are hardly the first to call for such reforms. 'The lawmakers who drew up the FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a review of the current medical standards, screening processes, and waivers for accessions as a means of addressing recruitment shortfalls,&rdquo; they write.

Trump 2.0 Meet Pam Bondi, Trump's new attorney general nominee: With eight years as Florida's top prosecutor, she seems better qualified than Matt Gaetz, who withdrew from the nomination process under a cloud of controversy. But as historian Heather Cox Richardson reminded her readers Friday, Bondi comes with her own questionable baggage. For example, 'In March 2016, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington found that the Trump Foundation illegally donated $25,000 to support Bondi at a time when she was considering joining a lawsuit against Trump University. Her office ultimately decided not to join the lawsuit.&rdquo; Bondi is also a registered lobbyist for Qatar, and falsely claimed Trump won the 2020 presidential election. Bondi is a noted Trump loyalist, evident in her experience as a member of Trump's first impeachment defense team, and her public support for Trump 'at his New York hush money criminal trial that ended in May with a conviction on 34 felony counts,&rdquo; as The Hill points out.

The attacks even targted the Donald Trump, his running-mate J.D. Vance and Kamala Harris. And lastly: Israel's Netanyahu is now a wanted man, after an announcement this week from the International Criminal Court. The court issued arrest warrants for both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former military chief Yoav Gallant for alleged crimes against humanity.

To improve recruiting, make medical standards match retention one...	It's harder to get into the military than stay there&mdash;at least by the different medical standards set by the Defense Department. By making them match, the Pentagon could widen its recruiting pool without undermining the force. Here's an example. In 2022, following advancements in medicine and treatment, defense leaders decided that current servicemembers would no longer be automatically discharged due to HIV status. Yet potential recruits living with asymptomatic HIV were disqualified from joining the military until August, when a U.S. District Court judge in Virginia ended that ban. That's far from the only difference in the medical standards that govern who can join and who can stay. Moreover, some of these conditions are increasing in the general population, meaning that they are reducing the pool of candidates eligible to join the military. Take depression and anxiety, which are reason to dismiss current servicemembers only if they become unable to complete their duties. But the conditions are disqualifying for potential recruits who have sought treatment in the past 36 months, have seen a counselor or therapist for more than a year, or have ever had a reoccurrence of symptoms. That covers a growing segment of the population. Diagnoses of depression and anxiety in children aged 6-17 have almost doubled since 2003, due in part to increased acceptance of and access to mental health treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated this trend, especially among youth. To be sure, potential recruits can request a waiver to get around some of the disqualifying conditions, and they do so increasingly frequently. The number of waivers requested by recruits jumped 70 percent from 2018 to 2022. In the latter year, the Navy approved nearly two-thirds of their waivers, of which nearly 90 percent were medical. [[Related Posts]] But heavy reliance on waivers is hardly a cure-all. For one thing, not everyone is told that requesting a waiver is even possible. For another, waivers are taking longer to process, thanks to lack of sufficient medical personnel at Military Entrance Processing Stations and the increased availability of comprehensive medical records through Military Health System GENESIS. If the standards for recruiting and retention were made to match, it could reduce the requirement for waivers for up to 3.6 million candidates annually, as 7% (or 2.3 million) of all potential candidates are currently disqualified for a single medical or physical issue, and another 4% (or 1.3 million) for mental health. That would make a big difference to the military's recruiters, who have been targeting a shrinking pool. Only 23 percent of youth 17 to 24 years old are qualified to serve without a waiver. Just 10 percent express interest in military service. Some might argue that aligning the standards would mean lowering the recruiting bar. But many of the assumptions that undergird the recruiting standards are outdated or simply wrong. Asthma can disqualify a potential military recruit, yet a recent study reported that 16.5 percent of Olympic athletes have asthma. Champion sprinter Noah Lyles proves that even major respiratory conditions do not preclude athletic success. Neurodivergence is another area where reality belies the military's assumptions. A potential recruit with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will find it difficult to obtain a waiver; autism spectrum disorder is automatically disqualifying. Yet neither appears in the retention standards at all. Moreover, traits common among neurodivergent individuals like attention to detail and rules-based logic make them heavily sought out in STEM and intelligence fields. A 2023 RAND report highlighted how the Israeli, Australian, and British armed services actively recruit neurodivergent individuals. Standards exist for a reason, but excluding people who could thrive in the military unnecessarily impairs readiness. As warfighting becomes more technological and the military requires more people with non-traditional combat skills, a broader base of qualified recruits may benefit the services. Further, not every service member is expected to serve on the front lines. Many units and career fields are either 'deployed in place&rdquo; from the continental U.S. or serve in combat support roles. The authors are hardly the first to call for such reforms. The lawmakers who drew up the FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated a review of the current medical standards, screening processes, and waivers for accessions as a means of addressing recruitment shortfalls. It is fully within the control of the services to correct these issues by ensuring parity of medical standards. Among the concrete steps that could be taken promptly: Waivers should not be required for conditions like anxiety or depression unless the condition was diagnosed with the last year or is considered uncontrolled by the recruit's medical provider. Streamlined waivers should be available for recruits with diagnoses such as HIV, ADHD, or respiratory/skin disorders who can demonstrate that they are asymptomatic or well controlled with medication for at least a year. Doing so would foster good will with critical Congressional stakeholders&mdash;and more importantly, improve the U.S. military's ability to make use of America's best and brightest. Lt. Col.

What does Russia’s launch of an ‘experimental’ weapon at Ukraine ...	Russian forces on Thursday fired what U.S. officials called an 'experimental intermediate-range ballistic missile against Ukraine,&rdquo; which has characteristics of an inter-continental ballistic missile but did not carry a nuclear warhead. The test has some Russia watchers worried about what that launch might signal. In response to the launch, the United States is 'providing Ukraine with hundreds of additional [Raytheon-built] Patriot and AMRAAM missiles to strengthen its air defense,&rdquo; the White House announced Thursday. 'Many of these are air defense missiles [that] have been delivered already as a consequence of the president's decisions to divert air defense exports to Ukraine, and deliveries of additional air defense missiles to Ukraine are ongoing.&rdquo; Russian officials did not specify the exact type of missile it shot at the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, but Middlebury professor and missile expert Jeff Lewis believes it was 'a variant of the long-gestating RS-26 Rubezh IRBM, he wrote on X. His reasons for that are twofold, he wrote: ' (1) Russia hinted that it resumed development of the RS-26 this summer and (2) that's what the Ukrainians predicated a day ago, down to the launch site.&rdquo; However, Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at CSIS, told Defense One that new details suggest it is 'probably not&rdquo; an RS-26, 'so it's unclear what it is.&rdquo; Footage of the blast indicates that the new weapon probably features a multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle, or MIRV, payload, Karako said, based on the secondary rockets that fired off the original missile. 'If it is indeed a MIRV, that's going to be a wicked hard problem to hit multiple things, if it's coming in super fast, especially if it's an [intermediate-range ballistic missile] on a lofted trajectory,&rdquo; he said. The attack comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin escalated his threats against Western nations for their support of Ukraine, particularly the recent decision by the United States to allow Ukraine to strike targets in Russia using U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles, and the decision by the U.K. permitting Ukraine to use Storm Shadow missiles, which have a range of 155 miles. Ukraine has already launched both. Putin took to Russian television Thursday to boast about the weapon and link the launch directly to the recent decisions by the U.S. and the U.K. 'The tests were successful,&rdquo; Putin said, noting they took place 'in combat conditions.&rdquo; Additionally, he said, 'Modern air defense systems that exist in the world and anti-missile defenses created by the Americans in Europe can't intercept such missiles.&rdquo; Ukraine has previously intercepted very new hypersonic missiles that Russia had called invincible. Regarding the newest missile, Karako said if the multiple warheads 'are maneuverable, then that's going to complicate the job of the defender&hellip;It would certainly be a hard thing to defend against.&rdquo; But he cautioned against taking the wrong lessons from the Russian display of aggression. 'I don't think we should fall for it&hellip;The response ought to be to not merely give Ukraine the ability to shoot back with ATACMS, but also other things that they need in a broad combined arms effort to, no-kidding, have a winning strategy and put them in a better position to negotiate for a position of strength.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/what-does-russias-launch-experimental-weapon-ukraine-mean-allies/401235/	2024-11-21T15:47:26-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/21/GettyImages_2185221856-1/large.jpg
One contractor is on the Space Force’s naughty list	The Space Force has put a defense contractor on a blacklist intended to hold companies accountable for poor performance and program delays. 'There is a company on the watch list today. I won't say who it is,&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander of Space Systems Command, told reporters at a Defense Writers Group event. The Contractor Responsibility Watch List, or CRWL, was created in the 2018 National Defense Authorization Act to give Space Systems Command the power to stop underperforming contractors from getting new contracts. Until today, the service has never confirmed if it has used the list. The list 'has absolutely worked as intended. We've seen significant improvement in performance and attention at the most senior levels of the corporation,&rdquo; Garrant said. While Garrant didn't name the company, he said the contractor works on high-priority space programs. The service wants to expand the tool in the 2025 NDAA and move the authority to blacklist contractors to Air Force space acquisition chief Frank Calvelli. Calvelli has been known to publicly call out defense contractors for schedule delays, and has emphasized the need to hold industry accountable. [[Related Posts]] Once the authority is moved, Calvelli will likely use it 'more frequently,&rdquo; Garrant said. Calvelli has been trying to address long-delayed 'problem children&rdquo; programs in the Space Force, including an RTX program called GPS Next Generation Operational Control Segment, or OCX, which are ground stations that will control the Pentagon's constellation of GPS satellites, as well as an L3Harris space command-and-control system called Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System, or ATLAS. The Space Force recently booted RTX from a contract to develop new missile warning and tracking satellites due to cost overruns and schedule problems&mdash;an example of how the service is keeping contractors accountable, Garrant said. '[Calvelli] has talked a lot about holding people accountable, whether they're in the government or in industry. Without particulars, in my tenure, we have relieved program managers that work for me, holding them accountable. I would offer that removing one of the industry partners was holding them accountable to what they proposed to us from a cost, schedule, performance perspective. That's the indication,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/one-contractor-space-forces-naughty-list/401227/	2024-11-21T12:56:17-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/21/8276293/large.jpg
The D Brief: DOD’s Replicator program advances; Nuclear forensics...	New: Russia fired a large ballistic missile at Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force claims it was an intercontinental ballistic missile targeting the city of Dnipro early Thursday, which&mdash;if true&mdash;would be a first. Claim: 'An intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from the Astrakhan region of the Russian Federation,&rdquo; Kyiv's air force said on Telegram. Russia also allegedly launched one of its hypersonic Kh-47M2 'Kinzhal&rdquo; missiles at Dnipro from a MiG-31K fighter jet flying over Russia's Tambov region. An additional 'seven Kh-101 cruise missiles were fired from Tu-95MS strategic bombers,&rdquo; the air force said Thursday morning. The allegedly large missile's 'speed and altitude suggest intercontinental ballistic capabilities,&rdquo; Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy said on social media Thursday. 'Investigations are ongoing,&rdquo; he added. Others aren't so sure. The U.S. is still assessing the situation, but the missile was not of intercontinental range, a Western official told reporters on the sidelines of the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus in Vientiane, Laos. Initial damage assessment: The salvo reportedly hit a medical rehabilitation center, Ukraine's regional governor for Dnipro said on Telegram. 'The biggest destruction is in the boiler room,&rdquo; but 'Miraculously, no one was hurt in the institution&rdquo; as 'staff and patients who were there managed to get to the shelter.&rdquo; Reuters also reported 'emergency power cuts in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions following the air alert.&rdquo; Additional reading: 'Biden administration moves to forgive $4.7 billion of loans to Ukraine,&rdquo; Reuters reported Wednesday; 'Russia threatens Poland over NATO's missile defense base expansion,&rdquo; RBC Ukraine reported Thursday; Reuters has similar coverage.

On this day in 1970, the U.S. military carried out a dangerous and secretive mission to rescue prisoners of war from a camp in North Vietnam. Poor intelligence, however, informed the mission's planners, who were unaware that the prisoners had been moved to a different camp closer to Hanoi more than four months prior. Around the Defense Department Pentagon orders linchpin software for Replicator drones. The Defense Innovation Unit picked Anduril Industries, L3Harris Technologies, and Swarm Aero to build prototype software needed to automate and control swarms of potentially thousands of drones, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Wednesday. Background: Replicator news thus far has largely centered on buying the drones themselves. But making sure the software component can be seamlessly integrated and upgraded is equally important&mdash;and challenging, Aditi Kumar, the deputy director of strategy for Defense Innovation Unit, told Tucker. 'We are buying this capability independently of the hardware systems, and so we need to be able to have open architectures, government-owned architectures, to ensure that the software that we're bringing in is one being upgraded and then integrated into all manner of hardware systems, which may then require their own hardware fixes to enable that,&rdquo; Kumar said. 'We are going to demonstrate their integration with the other systems in the Replicator portfolio across multiple domains, and we'll be able to test that out.&rdquo; Read more here.

Johnson, senior adviser to the Department of Energy's NNSA Ukraine Task Force. 'Until two years ago Ukraine had no capability of this kind.&rdquo; Paul Menser and Corinne Dionisio explain the program in greater detail at Defense One. SecDef Austin defends women in combat Asked about Pete Hegseth's resistance to women in combat roles, Pentagon chief and retired Gen. Lloyd Austin rejected the view espoused by the former Army major who is Donald Trump's announced pick for defense secretary. 'You know, I see things differently, and I see that because of my experience, and that experience is extensive,&rdquo; said Austin, who has commanded troops in combat as a one-, two-, three-, and four-star general. Speaking Wednesday at a press conference in Vientiane, Laos, Austin recalled his service as the 3rd Infantry Division's deputy commander for maneuver when it led the seizure of Baghdad during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 'I was at the front edge of the battle,&rdquo; he said. 'In my command post were several very courageous and very proficient women who did amazing things to support our effort and support their colleagues. And in my three tours&mdash;three long tours to Iraq and then one tour in Afghanistan&mdash;every place I went, there were women doing incredible things, and they were adding value to the overall effort, whether they were pilots, whether they were operational experts, or they were intel experts. 'I think our women add significant value to the United States military, and we should never change that,&rdquo; he said. 'I would tell them that, you know, we need you, we have faith in you, we are appreciative of your service, and you add value to the finest and most lethal fighting force on Earth. Other than that, I haven't thought much about it.&rdquo; In numbers: As recently as 2022, women made up 17.5% of the U.S. military's active-duty force and 21.6% of the selected reserve, according to a November 2023 Defense Department report.

The statute further empowers the president to &lsquo;prescribe rules governing the competitive service.' That power is broad.&rdquo; More, here. And lastly: Two intelligence watchdogs exit ahead of Trump's return to the White House. The inspector generals for the intelligence community, Thomas Monheim, and CIA Robin Ashton, are leaving their posts in the New Year.

Intelligence IGs head for the exits ahead of Trump’s return	Two intelligence watchdogs are leaving their positions ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second term. Inspector General of the Intelligence Community Thomas Monheim and CIA IG Robin Ashton are set to depart around the start of the new year. The news was first reported by the Project on Government Oversight. Monheim has been serving in the position since 2020 when Trump fired his predecessor, Michael Atkinson, who drew White House condemnation after he alerted Congress in September 2019 &mdash; as required by law &mdash; to the whistleblower complaint that led to Trump's first impeachment. 'On Nov. 13, I informed the president of my intent to resign as the inspector general of the intelligence community, effective Jan. 3, 2025. Serving as the IC IG has been a tremendous privilege and the pinnacle of my more than 30 years of military and civilian service spanning seven different presidents,&rdquo; Monheim said in a statement to Government Executive. 'I am incredibly proud of the IC IG team's tireless and selfless efforts to conduct independent, objective and nonpartisan oversight of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and across the IC. As a result, the ODNI and the IC are better and the nation is safer.&rdquo; Over a span of six weeks in 2020, Trump fired five inspectors general, including Atkinson. Ashton said that, after more than 38 years of public service, she would retire from the federal government at the end of the year. 'It has been the pinnacle of my rewarding career to serve alongside the dedicated officers at CIA for the last three and a half years as the CIA inspector general,&rdquo; she said in a statement to Government Executive. 'I have every confidence that the exceptional work of the Office of the Inspector General will continue to have a positive impact on behalf of the American people.&rdquo; Trump has nominated his former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe as CIA director and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, as DNI in his new administration. Some current and former intelligence officials have criticized Gabbard for her record of Russia-aligned public statements.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/intelligence-igs-head-exit-trumps-return/401203/	2024-11-20T18:37:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/112024_Getty_GovExec_CIA_1/large.jpg
Why Ukrainian soldiers came to Idaho to study nuclear forensics	It's a long way from the Donbas region of Ukraine to Idaho, but Ukrainian officials recently made the trip to learn about collecting evidence after a nuclear attack. Ten soldiers from the Armed Forces of Ukraine and 10 members from the Security Services of Ukraine spent a week at Idaho National Laboratory learning and practicing debris collection techniques for post-detonation nuclear forensics. Nuclear forensics, which includes the science of determining the origin of nuclear materials used in a detonation, is an essential element of the United States' deterrence strategy. Being able to trace the source of material used in a nuclear device allows the U.S. to credibly hold accountable any state complicit in an act of nuclear terrorism. While Ukraine has practiced nuclear forensics as part of its counter-nuclear-smuggling efforts, officials sought to learn more about how to apply nuclear forensics in a post-detonation scenario after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. INL's decades of research, expertise and support to U.S. nuclear forensics operations position it as one of the few entities capable of providing Ukraine with nuclear forensics support. Although it is highly unlikely that Russia would use a nuclear weapon in Ukraine, 'Ukraine takes the threat of a Russian nuclear attack very seriously,&rdquo; said INL's David Chichester, a directorate fellow who develops radiation measurement systems and consults on nuclear counterproliferation and forensics. 'They have tackled it aggressively because the threat is real to them,&rdquo; he said. While the Ukrainian visitors got a chance to enjoy Idaho Falls' American heartland amenities during their stay, the war was never far from their minds. During their time in the U.S., they would often be alerted in real time about attacks back home. During the training exercises, Ukrainian officials were assisted by experts with years of nuclear forensics training expertise from INL, Argonne National Laboratory, the Kansas City National Security Campus&mdash;Albuquerque, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, the Nevada National Security Site, and the National Nuclear Security Administration. NNSA, a semi-autonomous agency within the U.S. Department of Energy, is responsible for the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, naval nuclear propulsion, and nuclear nonproliferation and counterterrorism programs. Clad in personal protective equipment at locations throughout INL's Research and Education Campus in Idaho Falls, Ukrainian officials learned proper techniques for sweeping areas, gathering dust and debris, placing it into radiation shielded storage casks called lead 'pigs,&rdquo; and loading the parcels into vehicles for transport. The Ukrainian delegation said the training was effective and useful. 'We wish to thank you for inviting us to this training and hosting us in your city,&rdquo; said one participant, speaking through a translator. 'The [response capabilities] we are learning this week will absolutely be implemented when we return home to Ukraine.&rdquo; The participants' names have been withheld for security purposes. 'The support and training you are providing to us means more than you know,&rdquo; said another Ukrainian official. Instructors from the national labs and NNSA who led the training exercise are part of the Department of Energy Forensics Operations team. These U.S. experts are on call 365 days a year to collect nuclear detonation debris samples for analysis. They can respond at a moment's notice during an emergency. DFO uses specialized aircraft and equipment to establish mobile command centers and forensics laboratories anywhere in the world. The materials they collect may be brought to the U.S. for further analysis. DFO's capabilities are especially relevant given Russia's reputation for exploiting misinformation. It's important for Ukraine to possess the ability to incontrovertibly prove the source of nuclear materials. INL and NNSA's nuclear forensics expertise helped advance their capabilities. DFO has evolved in response to Ukraine's ongoing conflict. 'The relationship with Ukraine has prompted some changes in DFO,&rdquo; said C.J. Johnson, senior adviser to the Department of Energy's NNSA Ukraine Task Force. 'We had to turn responders into teachers,&rdquo; he said. 'The point of this [exercise] is to build the capability for collecting high-quality samples for analysis,&rdquo; said Johnson. 'Until two years ago Ukraine had no capability of this kind.&rdquo; The U.S. began conducting post-detonation forensics exercises close to 20 years ago when the National Security Council asked what would happen if the country needed to collect debris for analysis after a nuclear detonation. Around that time, INL's national security and nuclear nonproliferation capabilities in support of NNSA were starting to grow, leading to the first ground debris collection exercise in 2005. Since then, INL has hosted annual nuclear forensics training exercises for U.S. first responders in case the unthinkable should happen. 'There is no better place in the world to do nuclear forensics training than the national labs,&rdquo; said Johnson. 'The capabilities and expertise the labs &mdash; including INL &mdash; have for conducting real-world training is unmatched.&rdquo; In addition to INL and the NNSA's Office of Nuclear Forensics, the Ukrainian team's visit to INL was supported by the U.S. Department of State. Nuclear forensics training events provide an opportunity for scientists and security experts to practice the tactics, techniques and procedures they would employ following a real-world nuclear attack. The relationships and mutual trust developed while working together through realistic scenarios are equally valuable. 'You can't maintain a proficient level of this capability if you don't train,' Chichester said.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/11/why-ukrainian-soldiers-came-idaho-study-nuclear-forensics/401100/	2024-11-20T15:39:49-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/8391038/large.jpg
DIU announces software awards for AI-enabled drone swarms	The Defense Innovation Unit on Wednesday announced new prototype awards for software to enable better command and control and autonomous drone swarm operations. It's part of the Replicator program, which is working to field large numbers of cheap, highly autonomous drones to deter Chinese military activity in the Pacific. 'DIU made prototype awards to Swarm Aero, Anduril Industries, and L3Harris Technologies,' the organization said in a statement. These awards are part of the Autonomous Collaborative Teaming, or ACT, effort, which is seeking 'automated coordination of swarms of hundreds or thousands of uncrewed assets across multiple domains.&rdquo; While the Replicator program's drone systems get lots of attention, the ability to integrate them together at the software level is every bit as important, Aditi Kumar, the deputy director for strategy, policy, and national security partnerships at DIU, said earlier this month at a Defense One event. And, she said, DIU's short calendar for testing new drone integration platforms and software is another challenge. 'We are buying this capability independently of the hardware systems, and so we need to be able to have open architectures, government-owned architectures, to ensure that the software that we're bringing in is one being upgraded and then integrated into all manner of hardware systems, which may then require their own hardware fixes to enable that. That is something we're going to test out as we mature these integrated enablers. We are going to demonstrate their integration with the other systems in the Replicator portfolio across multiple domains, and we'll be able to test that out.&rdquo; Anduril's Lattice platform is one of the winners. In a statement, Anduril said it has completed a variety of real-world tests with military partners, such as in the U.S. Pacific Fleet's Integrated Battle Problem 24.1 exercise, in which Navy operators used Lattice to integrate more than a dozen uncrewed systems and data feeds. Another example is CENTCOM's Desert Guardian 1.0, where Anduril integrated '10 different sensor teams into Lattice, merging real-time data sharing, fusion, and tasking across diverse sensor systems&rdquo; to more quickly detect airborne and other threats. And in Army's EDGE23 test, Lattice allowed a single soldier to 'manage an integrated team of multiple uncrewed aircraft to locate, identify, and destroy a surface-to-air missile site,&rdquo; according to Anduril. [[Related Posts]] DIU also made awards for part of another Replicator-related effort dubbed Opportunistic, Resilient & Innovative Expeditionary Network Topology, or ORIENT, to ensure communications for drones in a heavy electromagnetic warfare environment. The awards went to Viasat, Aalyria, Higher Ground, and IoT/AI. Will Replicator prevent World War III? The Defense Department launched Replicator specifically to deter Chinese military action in the Pacific. At a Pallas Foundation event on Wednesday, Adm. Sam Paparo, the head of U.S. INDOPACOM, discussed the role that autonomous systems could play in deterrence&mdash;a role similar to the one Ukraine's maritime drones are playing in the Black Sea. 'One need not actually achieve complete air and maritime superiority over a space when an adversary is trying to gain it. One need only perhaps deny it to the other, and can potentially do that at low cost,&rdquo; Paparo said. 'We've seen that actually in practice, and have learned from that, from Ukraine in the Black Sea, where a Slava cruiser was destroyed and sunk [by a Ukrainian sea drone.] And it's important that we learn that lesson from that and the Black Sea.&rdquo; Paparo also outlined how he might use different levels of autonomy for different missions as part of that deterrence effort. For offensive missions, maintaining human control is critical, he said. But for fleet defense, more autonomy could help speed reaction time. 'For instance, if a raid of ballistic missiles is approaching your unit, this is a time when you would want your system on full auto, carrying those arrows that are coming in. On the other hand, if you are executing a complex attack on an enemy system, this would be a case where you want to do so very circumspectly, because you're taking lives.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/diu-announces-software-awards-ai-enabled-drone-swarms/401197/	2024-11-20T13:45:12-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/8549751/large.jpg
The D Brief: More long-range missiles target Russia’s Kursk; Bide...	Developing: Ukraine's military used British-supplied cruise missiles to strike targets inside Russia for the first time, Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing parts of the Storm Shadow missiles that were allegedly spotted in Russia's Kursk region this week. If confirmed, the action follows Ukraine's recent use of U.S.-provided long-range missiles to strike Russian targets in the Kursk region as well. Worth noting: Few observers believe these long-range authorizations and strikes will alter the course of the war. In fact, as Jack Watling of the London-based Royal United Services Institute wrote on Tuesday, 'Ukraine fired the majority of the UK's Storm Shadow arsenal at Russian deep targets in 2023 yet failed to degrade Russian command and control to a level that the Ukrainian military could take advantage of.&rdquo; What they could lead to, however, are 'exploitable opportunities in Russia's defenses,&rdquo; said Watling. 'The question is whether the Ukrainian military is capable of exploiting the gap created.&rdquo; New: Ukraine's president says if President-elect Trump cuts military funding to Kyiv, 'I think we will lose&rdquo; against Russia's invasion troops. 'We will fight. We have our production, but it's not enough to prevail,&rdquo; he said in an interview with Trey Yingst of Fox that aired Tuesday. Also new: President Joe Biden just authorized the transfer of anti-personnel mines to Ukraine, which is a policy shift that reflects changing Russian tactics and Ukrainian needs, Defense One's Bradley Peniston reports while traveling with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin in the Asia-Pacific. Fine print: The mines will be 'non-persistent,&rdquo; which means they become inert after a set amount of time &mdash; 'anywhere from 4 hours to 2 weeks,&rdquo; an administration official said. The idea is to help Ukraine repel Russian advances that have in recent months been led by dismounted troops instead of armored vehicles, Austin said. SecDef Austin: 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they've kind of changed their tactics a bit, and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore. They lead with the dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces,&rdquo; Austin told reporters. Expert reax: 'I wouldn't be surprised if this decision has a greater effect on the battlefield than the policy change on ATACMS strikes into Russian territory,&rdquo; said Rob Lee of the Foreign Policy Research Institute. Continue reading, here. And the Pentagon announced a new $275 million aid package for Ukraine, which includes HIMARS rockets, Javelin missiles, and more, U.S. defense officials announced in Laos on Wednesday. The officials were visiting Laos for a meeting of ASEAN defense ministers, which is an annual conference of military leaders from the region and beyond. More, here. More on the ATACMS decision: 'I suspect the Biden administration did this for two reasons,&rdquo; said retired Navy Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. 'First to help preserve their legacy and not leave office with this glaring deficiency,&rdquo; he told Defense One on Monday. 'And second because this makes things easier for President Trump as he does not have to make this decision and it puts increased pressure on Putin before any negotiations.&rdquo; However, he added, 'In both cases this would benefit from more expanded geographic permissions.&rdquo; Second opinion: 'Militarily, the targets are easy to determine,&rdquo; said RUSI's Jack Watling. 'Destroying Russia's ammunition dumps, or the fuelling and arming points for its strike aircraft, or Russian tactical-operational missile complexes, would have a useful effect in reducing the casualties being suffered by the Ukrainians, and thereby contribute to stabilizing the front. But these are not the targets that will yield leverage in negotiations,&rdquo; he warned. Those include 'economic and industrial&rdquo; facilities, and 'to be effective, their use must be part of a wider strategy that targets a specific target set,&rdquo; Watling said. It's not yet clear that Ukraine is capable of pulling that kind of strategy off. What more could the Biden administration do to help Ukraine before leaving office on January 20? It could expand the ATACMS authority to 'JASMM air to surface missiles in Russian territory as well,&rdquo; Montgomergy said. He also advises 'more promises of security assistance &mdash; from both the U.S. and Europe &mdash; and possibly as a loan in the future,&rdquo; and recommends 'increased pressure on Russian oil exports to include sanctions enforcement on the &lsquo;shadow fleet' delivering Russian oil and natural gas.&rdquo; That would put President-elect Trump in a better negotiating position ahead of what he says will be brokered talks between the leaders of Ukraine and Russia after inauguration in two months' time. Additional reading: 'Russian nuclear doctrine change does not indicate imminent attack, Pentagon says,&rdquo; Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Tuesday; 'What Ukraine can now do with longer-range US missiles,&rdquo; according to Benjamin Jensen, a professor at American University and the Marine Corps University School of Advanced Warfighting, in a Q&A published Tuesday in The Conversation.

And if you're not already subscribed, you can do that here. On this day in 1942, President Joe Biden was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Pacific SecDef visited a South China Sea island to show U.S. support for its regional ally the Philippines, Defense One's Bradley Peniston reported Tuesday on location. That location is known as WESCOM, or the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. It sits on the island of Palawan, some 200 miles off the main Philippine archipelago. From this camp of low buildings under rows of towering palm trees, WESCOM directs and supports the joint forces that keep tabs on and maintain a presence in the waters to the west, Peniston writes. One young officer in the lobby said he'd spent seven months on one of the outposts that dot the sea. Big-picture consideration: The past three months have seen an uptick in Chinese aggression, U.S. and Philippine officials said. 'They have been more aggressive in denying us access to our exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea. They have really placed a lot of these pseudo-military vessels disguised as Coast Guard vessels and maritime militia vessels in the areas of the West Philippine Sea. They have been very aggressive in their information operations against the Philippines,&rdquo; Manila's Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro told reporters. While at WESCOM, SecDef Austin visited a brand-new intelligence-fusion center and received a demonstration of an uncrewed surface vessel, both purchased with U.S. security-assistance funds.

Industry Lastly today: U.S. satellite suppliers are struggling to meet the Pentagon's timelines for its plans to build a network of hundreds of military satellites in low-Earth orbit. And now the first set of operational satellites in the Space Development Agency's big plans aren't expected for another six months, Defense One's Audrey Decker reported Tuesday. The program is called the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. Its first satellites were supposed to begin launching in September; but SDA Director Derek Tournear said that will now be delayed until March or April. 'It's clear that a lot of the subcontractors, they weren't able to scale up as quickly as they had, and we've been working very closely with them,&rdquo; Tournear said at an event hosted by the Mitchell Institute in Virginia on Tuesday. 'We have put contracts in place with some of those subcontractors to help incentivize them, to build them up,&rdquo; he said. SDA is also looking into possible work with SpaceX since Elon Musk's company 'can launch faster than once a month,&rdquo; Tournear said. 'The space vehicles will be ready faster than that once we start the initial launching, but it's just a matter of how fast will it take us to get through launch and early operations,&rdquo; he told the audience. Why the hurry? The U.S. already has a constellation of satellites for missile warning and tracking, which detects launches and follows weapons as they maneuver, Decker reports. But now, SDA wants new missile tracking satellites that can direct interceptors as well, Tournear said. Continue reading, here.

US to begin providing anti-personnel mines to Ukraine	VIENTIANE, Laos&mdash;The United States will begin to send anti-personnel land mines to Ukraine, a Biden administration policy shift that reflects changing Russian tactics and Ukrainian needs, a U.S. official said here. The mines will be 'non-persistent&rdquo;&mdash;that is, they become inert after a set amount of time&mdash;after &rdquo;anywhere from 4 hours to 2 weeks,&rdquo; said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'The United States has sought commitments from the Ukrainians on their use, to further limit the risk to civilians. We expect Ukraine would use these mines on its own territory. The Ukrainians are committed to not employing them in areas populated with their own civilians,&rdquo; the official said. Asked about the not-yet-officially-announced policy shift, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the mines would help Ukraine repel Russian advances that have in recent months been led by dismounted troops instead of armored vehicles. 'What we've seen most recently is because the Russians have been so unsuccessful in the way that they have been fighting, they've kind of changed their tactics a bit, and they don't lead with their mechanized forces anymore. They lead with the dismounted forces who are able to close and do things to kind of pave the way for mechanized forces,&rdquo; Austin told reporters here. The Ukrainians have been making their own land mines, and U.S.-supplied nonpersistent ones would be safer, he said, adding that the United States has long provided Ukraine with anti-tank mines. The unnamed U.S. official noted that Russia has sown thousands of anti-personnel mines in Ukraine; few if any are non-persistent. 'On the note of Russia's mines being littered throughout eastern Ukraine, we are already providing post-conflict remediation for mines and unexploded ordinance will already be required for eastern Ukraine. We will continue to support Ukraine's efforts on this,&rdquo; the official said. In 2022, the Biden administration decided to 'align its policy concerning use&rdquo; of antipersonnel landmines 'outside of the Korean Peninsula&rdquo; with key provisions of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction&mdash;commonly known as the Ottawa Convention. The convention requires states to stop making, using, and transferring anti-personnel land mines, and to destroy any stockpiled mines except for the 'minimum number absolutely necessary&rdquo; for training purposes, according to a report from the Congressional Research Service.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/us-begin-providing-anti-personnel-mines-ukraine/401177/	2024-11-20T04:37:08-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/mines_GettyImages_2184757645/large.jpg
New $275M Ukraine-aid package to include HIMARS ammo	VIENTIANE, Laos&mdash;A new quarter-billion-dollar package of military aid to Ukraine will include HIMARS rockets, Javelin missiles, and more, a defense official said here. 'Later today, the White House will be announcing additional security assistance for Ukraine worth up to $275 million to meet critical battlefield needs, and that will include munitions for rocket systems and artillery and anti-tank weapons,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters here. Austin is in town for the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus, an annual conference of defense leaders from the region and beyond. A defense official said the package will include: Ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS); 155mm and 105mm artillery ammunition; 60mm and 81mm mortar rounds; Unmanned aerial systems; Tube-launched, Optically tracked, Wire-guided (TOW) missiles; Javelin and AT-4 anti-armor systems; Small arms and ammunition; Demolitions equipment and munitions; Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear-protective equipment; and Spare parts, ancillary equipment, services, training, and transportation. The arms, ammunition, and gear will be drawn from Pentagon stocks under the presidential drawdown authority for military assistance for Ukraine. An Oct. 31 fact sheet published by the State Department said the U.S. had provided more than $64.1 billion in military assistance since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, on top of about $2.8 billion provided since its initial invasion in 2014. It also said the emergency presidential drawdown authority had been used 55 times since August 2021, sending Ukraine aid worth a total of about $31.7 billion from DoD stockpiles.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/new-275m-ukraine-aid-package-include-himars-ammo/401176/	2024-11-20T03:50:01-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/20/himars_GettyImages_1494251893/large.jpg
What Ukraine can now do with longer-range US missiles	The outgoing Biden administration has authorized Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied longer-range missiles to strike deeper into Russia territory, according to reports citing White House officials. The move comes amid concern in the West that Moscow &ndash; aided by the influx of thousands of North Korean fighters &ndash; might be preparing a major counteroffensive to regain lost territory in the Kursk region of Russia. But how big a deal is the Biden decision? And could it change the trajectory of the conflict in Eastern Europe? The Conversation U.S. turned to Benjamin Jensen, a professor at American University and the Marine Corps University School of Advanced Warfighting, for answers. The Army Tactical Missile System, or ATACMS, are short-range ballistic missiles that can travel a lot farther than the weapons previously at Kyiv's disposal. We aren't talking about new technology. ATACMS have been around as a concept since the late 1970s and 1980s and first came into production toward the end of the Reagan era, around 1986. By the mid-1990s they were in service, being first deployed by the U.S. in 1991 as part of Operation Desert Storm. ATACMS have a range of approximately 190 miles. That distance is longer than British-supplied Storm Shadow and French-supplied Scalp cruise missiles, which have a range of 155 miles. Not only do ATACMS go a lot farther, they also travel very fast &ndash; at Mach 3, or three times the speed of sound, making them harder to intercept. Depending on where they are fired from, ATACMS can be difficult for radar systems to detect. The other benefit, in this regard, is that ATACMS are not reliant on GPS positioning. Moscow has had success in jamming and blunting the effectiveness of other weapons that depend on GPS. But ATACMS can switch to an inertia guidance system, based on gyroscopes, to avoid GPS jamming tactics. The newly authorized missiles also can carry a heavy payload of up to 500 pounds &ndash; enough to create a huge crater on impact. ATACMS' range, terminal velocity and size of warhead could potentially make a huge difference in the current conflict. It means that Ukraine would have the capability to conduct deep strikes on Russian territory. In addition, U.S. authorization of their use by Ukraine in Russia would, in theory, also make it easier for other allies to transfer ATACMS to Kyiv. Nearby Poland and Romania have them, as do South Korea and Australia. Authorization by the Biden administration could give those governments the green light to supply the missiles to Ukraine, too. Why was this longer-range weapon approved now? Washington's decision comes as Russian troop numbers are being swelled by North Korean fighters &ndash; the 10,000 North Koreans reportedly in Russia at present is likely just a first wave. This has coincided with a build up of 50,000 Russian troops near Kursk &ndash; the key Russian territory taken by Ukraine earlier this year. Over the past few days, there have been what I would call 'probing attacks&rdquo; by Russia in the area in preparation for what could be a much larger assault to recapture the territory. In advance of that counter-push, North Korean and Russian troops will need to marshal together before moving to the front &ndash; and they will be doing so in assembly areas deeper within Russia. The military thinking is, if you can hit troops in those deep areas, you can seriously disrupt Moscow's operational reach. And ATACMS are perfect for attacks on tactical assembly areas &ndash; their size, speed and range makes them harder to intercept. Certainly if I were advising the Ukrainian military, I would be looking to use ATACMS to hit both assembly areas, ammunition sites and airfields. What appears to be the thinking in Washington? If I had to bet, I'd say there are still deep concerns of escalation but growing acknowledgment that we are entering a transition phase in the conflict. President-elect Donald Trump has signaled that he wants to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. I assess that authorizing ATACMS now suggests the Biden administration is trying to give Ukraine a better hand during those negotiations. Alternatively, the current White House may have looked at the growing pro-Moscow support of North Korean and concluded that allowing Ukraine to hit North Korean troops before they can be deployed to the front is the only way to offset the advantage this gives Russia. Besides troops, Pyongyang has sent more artillery shells to Russia than the European Union has to Ukraine. These rationales are not mutually exclusive. It also appears that to the Biden administration, the imperatives outweigh any perceived risks of the U.S. getting drawn further into the conflict or of an escalatory response from Russian President Vladimir Putin. What does this signal about the state of the war? My reading of the conflict &ndash; and you are getting a sense of this through recent statements form Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy &ndash; is that Ukraine may only have until the end of the next campaign season, that is spring to summer 2025, to maintain its position. This is due to the ongoing cost that fighting is having on Ukraine. Kyiv is experiencing problems mobilizing sufficient troops &ndash; it has had to increasingly turn to conscription, something Ukraine had tried to avoid. This isn't to say that Ukraine has run completely out of steam. But it will struggle to take more Russian-controlled territory. Capturing territory in Kursk was a major achievement, but it was a one-off, high-risk gamble. And fighting in parts of Ukraine's east occupied by Russia is proving difficult. So is this about helping Ukraine keep control of Kursk? The reporting around Biden's authorization of ATACMS suggests that Washington is telling Ukraine that the missiles can't be deployed everywhere, just in Kursk. If Trump does have the ability to force people to talk, as he says he does, that will not stop the fighting. Fighting will continue until the parties agree to a cease-fire, and even after that, it could flare up at anytime. For these reasons, I think you will see Russia throw everything at Kursk, militarily. And Ukraine will do everything it can to keep control of territory there &ndash; Kyiv knows that Kursk would be its biggest bargaining chip should it come to negotiations. Did Trump's victory play a role in Biden's thinking? I really think that the decision to authorize ATACMS was more about the reality on the ground in Ukraine than politics in the United States. That said, the president-elect's stated push for negotiations as a way to settle the Ukraine-Russia conflict may well have escalated the decision.

Russian nuclear doctrine change does not indicate imminent attack...	The United States sees 'no indications&rdquo; that Russia is prepping for a nuclear attack, the Pentagon said Tuesday, despite the Kremlin's announcement of a change in nuclear posture. And while the doctrine change is alarming, experts say, it doesn't mean the world is on the brink of nuclear war. The Russian government on Tuesday announced a broadening of its nuclear doctrine, which allows for the use of nuclear weapons against a non-nuclear attack, and allows for strikes against Western nations that are supplying weapons to countries engaged in conflict with Russia&mdash;namely Ukraine. The doctrine was originally changed in September, but Russian government officials are now linking the public change to reported Ukrainian attacks with U.S.-supplied ATACMS missiles on Russian territory. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, speaking on the sidelines of the G-20 Summit in Brazil, said the Ukrainian use of the missiles 'is a signal that they want escalation. Using such sophisticated missiles without the Americans is impossible. Putin warned about this and about how our position will change.&rdquo; Michael Kofman, a senior fellow in the Russia and Eurasia Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Defense One the new doctrine 'emphasizes that the Russian president decides when to use nuclear weapons, which ultimately is what matters. In the end, this is intentionally ambiguous language, intended to signal and deter, while much comes down to one person's interpretation of this criteria.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] Still, some Western observers believe the doctrine change indicates Russian President Vladimir Putin is preparing to respond to U.S. support for Ukraine with a nuclear escalation. Sean McFate, adjunct professor at Syracuse University's Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs, said in a statement: 'Putin has lowered the bar for Russian nuclear engagement, a clear signal to NATO to back off. It's a response to Biden's allowing Ukraine to use long-range American missiles against Russian targets. It is difficult to know when Putin is bluffing or not. Biden is rolling the nuclear dice on the eve of his transition. It's completely reckless.&rdquo; However, in response to questions about the doctrine change, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters Monday: 'We don't have any indications that Russia is preparing to use a nuclear weapon within Ukraine.&rdquo; Other experts on Russian nuclear forces agree the doctrine change doesn't necessarily mean nuclear war is imminent, despite the announcement's language and timing. 'I caution against the view that Russia would never escalate, but there's still quite a lot of steps to go,&rdquo; Gabriela Rosa Hernandez, a specialist in Russian security policy at CNAS, told Defense One. 'Overall, I don't think these updates represent significant/true insights to Russia's nuclear threshold, nor its likelihood to resort to nuclear use. But it is a representation of an emerging consensus that Moscow must employ more assertive and creative measures when it comes to its nuclear signaling to compel the West and show how far it is willing to go to accomplish its goals in Ukraine,&rdquo; Hernandez said in an email. 'Russia is embracing ideas thrown around that would improve coercive credibility.&rdquo; Jeffrey Edmonds, an adjunct senior fellow at CNAS's transatlantic security program, told Defense One he thinks there is 'still significant space between where we are at and nuclear use,&rdquo; and noted the Russians have multiple avenues to threaten the West for its continued support of Ukraine. 'What this actually means for escalation is that we should not be surprised to see horizontal escalation&mdash;geographic e.g. arming Houthis, or vertical e.g. cables, [anti-satellite tests]... Put another way, we should be surprised Putin has not started killing Americans in response to the combat enablers we have provided Ukraine, allowing it to kill thousands of Russian soldiers.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russian-nuclear-doctrine-change-does-not-indicate-imminent-attack-pentagon-says/401170/	2024-11-19T16:01:17-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/19/GettyImages_2185015348/large.jpg
Next launch of SDA’s satellite constellation pushed to spring	The first set of operational satellites in the Space Development Agency's future orbital network will be launched about six months late, as suppliers have struggled to meet the Pentagon's timeline. Satellites in 'Tranche 1&rdquo; of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, a layered network of hundreds of military satellites in low-Earth orbit, were supposed to begin launching in September, but will be delayed to March or April, said Derek Tournear, director of the Space Development Agency. Manufacturers were 'a little optimistic&rdquo; in their initial assessments, and haven't been able to reach the production levels necessary on components such as optical terminals, Tournear said at a Mitchell Institute event today. However, the agency will still hit its goal to launch within two years of Tranche 0, he said. Tranche 0, which comprised demonstration satellites for PWSA, began launching in April 2023 after a six-month delay due to COVID-related supply chain problems. 'It's clear that a lot of the subcontractors, they weren't able to scale up as quickly as they had, and we've been working very closely with them. We have put contracts in place with some of those subcontractors to help incentivize them, to build them up. We've gotten involved with them and helped to try to build up their processes, as well as the primes. Some of the primes have sent people to their subcontractors on site to help build them up,&rdquo; Tournear said. But despite initial supply chain woes, industry is starting to reach the right production pace, Tournear said. And the agency is looking at other ways to get back on track going forward, he said, noting SpaceX's rapid launch cadence. [[Related Posts]] 'We know SpaceX can launch faster than once a month, so we can bring this in. The space vehicles will be ready faster than that once we start the initial launching, but it's just a matter of how fast will it take us to get through launch and early operations and pull that in,&rdquo; Tournear said. The plan for Tranche 1 is to launch once a month for 10 months, he said. SDA will launch 300 to 400 satellites over the next few years in Tranche 1 and 2. For Tranche 3, industry will need to develop some new capabilities, Tournear previewed&mdash;including satellites that can track and defend against missiles. 'We really want industry to tell us the state-of-the-art and the state of manufacturing readiness for a combined missile tracking-missile defense satellite,&rdquo; he said. The U.S. already has a constellation of satellites for missile warning and tracking, which detects launches and follows weapons as they maneuver. Now, SDA wants new missile tracking satellites that can direct interceptors as well, Tournear said. 'Defense takes that one step further, and says not only can we detect maneuvering missiles, we can detect them to such accuracy that I can send that data down to an interceptor with no other sensors needed,&rdquo; he said. Tournear's agency is already working on programs to address advanced missile threats, like the FOO Fighter program and the 'Gamma variant' of the Tranche 2 transport layer, but those follow a different class of targets than the missile tracking-missile defense architecture in Tranche 3, Tournear said, without disclosing the specific threats each program will address. The agency aims to launch nine satellites that can do both missile tracking and missile defense, in addition to 40 or 45 satellites focused just on missile tracking, Tournear said. In total, Tranche 3 will put about 200 satellites in the constellation. Because these satellites are only built with a five-year life span, Tournear said, Tranche 3 satellites will be the first tranche to replace other satellites being decommissioned, in addition to fielding new capabilities.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/next-launch-sdas-satellite-constellation-pushed-spring/401168/	2024-11-19T15:55:51-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/19/8240636/large.jpg
SecDef visits South China Sea island to bolster Philippines and c...	PUERTO PRINCESA, Philippines&mdash;If the South China Sea is where Beijing is pushing most aggressively into allied territory, then WESCOM HQ is most directly in charge of pushing back. WESCOM&mdash;that is, the Western Command of the Armed Forces of the Philippines&mdash;sits on the island of Palawan, some 200 miles off the main Philippine archipelago. The island is washed by the West Philippine Sea, which is what Manila calls its slice of the South China Sea. China's legal claim to the waters was rejected eight years ago by international courts, which has hardly slowed Beijing's efforts to gain de facto control by turning reefs into airbases, harassing Philippine vessels, waging information warfare, and more. Little surprise, then, that Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin chose to come here on his fourth and final visit to the country, for a series of engagements that have seen him proclaim solidarity with Manila and criticism of Beijing. From this camp of low buildings under rows of towering palm trees, WESCOM directs and supports the joint forces that keep tabs on and maintain a presence in the waters to the west. One young officer in the lobby said he'd spent seven months on one of the outposts that dot the sea. The past three months have seen an uptick in Chinese aggressiveness, U.S. and Philippine officials said. 'It's the same story over and over again,&rdquo; Secretary of National Defense Gilberto Teodoro told reporters here on Tuesday. 'They have been more aggressive in denying us access to our exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea. They have really placed a lot of these pseudo-military vessels disguised as Coast Guard vessels and maritime militia vessels in the areas of the West Philippine Sea. They have been very aggressive in their information operations against the Philippines.&rdquo; Beside him, Austin concurred. 'The behavior of the PRC has been concerning. You've heard me say that a number of times. They've used dangerous and escalatory measures to enforce their expansive South China Sea maritime claims,&rdquo; Austin said. 'We condemn dangerous actions by the PRC against lawful Philippine operations in the South China Sea...Again, we'll continue to work with our allies and make sure that we're doing the right thing to promote a secure and open Indo-Pacific.&rdquo; Austin had flown an hour from Manila to see that cooperation in action at WESCOM HQ. He visited a brand-new intelligence-fusion center and received a demonstration of an uncrewed surface vessel, both purchased with U.S. security-assistance funds. The latter had arrived in May, part of a package that included Martec T-12 and T-38 USVs and the command-and-control gear to operate them. The U.S. also dispatched Marine Staff Sgt. Logan Hampton to help the Philippine Navy detachment learn to operate their new remote eyes at sea. 'This stuff right here is all Philippines-owned,&rdquo; Hampton said, gesturing to a T-12 and two aerial drones in the yard. 'We help them with the interoperability and integration, but this is theirs, so I can't tell them, like, &lsquo;Hey, go do this, go do that.' It's all about building relationships and working by, with, and through the partners, and it's their show.&rdquo; For Austin's visit, the sailors put a T-12 up on blocks. The low, slender craft comes with autonomous collision-avoidance systems, carries either an optical camera or a sonar rig, has a range of about 39 miles, and can handle waves up to about three feet, Hampton said. 'So it's more for, like, port security, shoals, and, like, small channels and stuff like that, but it is basically a littoral monitoring station. You could just set it out there and let it kind of feed and get that picture back to the commanders on the Philippine side and the U.S. side,&rdquo; he said. 'One of them is actually on the water in Oyster Bay here. That's conducting surveys now.&rdquo; But when Austin emerged from briefings, the Philippine sailors showed him how they were controlling a T-38 in Subic Bay, some 350 miles to the north. Hampton said the U.S. military has also begun operating Martec USVs, and the two navies are learning about their new gear together. 'We're procuring them for them at the same time as us. And even some of that stuff on there&rdquo;&mdash;he gestured to the T-12&mdash;'is a little bit ahead of what we have, just because of procurement and all that, but we are developing TTPs [techniques, tactics, and procedures] and everything else together,&rdquo; he said. 'We're doing AAR&mdash;after-action reviews&mdash;and we're just together, Phil and U.S. side, trying to develop this as quick as possible.&rdquo; In his press conference, Austin called the remote-controlled craft part of a larger effort to help better equip the Philippines military. 'The T-12 is one of several unmanned capabilities funded and delivered this year through U.S. security assistance,&rdquo; he said, standing before a mural emblazoned Defenders and Patriots of the Last Frontier. 'We expect to see many more platforms like this delivered with the $500 million in foreign military financing that I announced during my visit to the Philippines in July. This will help ensure that the Philippines has the capabilities that it needs to defend its rights and its sovereignty throughout its exclusive economic zone.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/secdef-visits-south-china-sea-island-bolster-philippines-and-check-china/401145/	2024-11-19T09:51:50-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/19/IMG_3361/large.jpg
The D Brief: ATACMS use in Russia?; Undersea cable cut in the Bal...	Ukrainian troops attacked an alleged weapons depot inside Russia using U.S.-provided ATACMS missiles on Tuesday, several news outlets (including Forbes Ukraine and RBC Ukraine) reported Tuesday, citing Russian and Ukrainian officials. A U.S. official confirmed the development in remarks to the New York Times. The targeted facility is near the town of Karachev in Russia's southwestern Bryansk region, which is more than 70 miles from Ukraine's borders. 'As of 02:30 that night, 12 secondary explosions and detonations were recorded in the area of ​​the target,&rdquo; Ukraine's military said on Telegram, without claiming ATACMS were used in the strike. Russia's defense ministry claimed to have shot down five out of six ATACMS missiles, and said falling debris started a fire, but no one was harmed, the Associated Press and Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty report. View a map showing the possible range of ATACMS, published Tuesday by RFE/RL, here. Eye in the sky: Russia's military has been fortifying airbases inside Russia since early October, a former Ukrainian soldier explained on social media Monday using satellite imagery. 'Both the new and existing revetments are being reinforced with what appears to be concrete blocks for added protection,&rdquo; he writes. 'It's unclear whether the Russians plan to add roof coverage or focus solely on strengthening the walls,&rdquo; he added. Also: 'Satellite images show major expansions at five complexes where Russia has made solid-fuel missile engines, indicating the Kremlin plans to significantly boost missile production as it pursues its war in Ukraine,&rdquo; Reuters reported Monday, citing the work of Fabian Hinz of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'The sites are in the Altai Republic in Siberia, Rostov in southern Russia, outside Moscow and St. Petersburg, and in Perm, in western Russia,&rdquo; the wire service reports. Related reading: 'Putin Lowers Russia's Threshold for Using Nuclear Arms,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Tuesday; 'Hungarian official criticizes Biden decision allowing Ukraine to use US weapons to strike Russia,&rdquo; AP reported from Budapest. Developing: Early Sunday, a key data cable was severed along the Baltic Sea between Germany and Finland. Berlin and Helsinki released a joint statement in response to the findings, which they said 'immediately raises suspicions of intentional damage [and] speaks volumes about the volatility of our times.&rdquo; 'Our European security is not only under threat from Russia&lsquo;s war of aggression against Ukraine, but also from hybrid warfare by malicious actors,&rdquo; the two countries' foreign ministries said. 'Safeguarding our shared critical infrastructure is vital to our security and the resilience of our societies,&rdquo; they added.

Coming soon: Germany will reportedly begin delivering 'several hundred&rdquo; one-way attack drones to Ukraine in December, German newspaper Bild reported recently. An estimated 4,000 of these drones are expected overall, Ukrainska Pravda reported Monday. The drones have some degree of autonomy and, as a result, are allegedly less susceptible to electronic interference. They're also reportedly much cheaper than U.S.-made Switchblade drones. More here.

On this day in 1943, the Nazis killed at least 6,000 Jews after a failed uprising at the Janowska concentration camp in modern-day Lviv, Ukraine. Around the Defense Department U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed a new defense pact with the Philippines to share classified intelligence during Austin's fourth and likely final trip to the Pacific, Defense One's Brad Peniston reports while traveling with the secretary. The agreement paves the way for a new coordination center at the Philippine Armed Force's headquarters, giving U.S. personnel the space to plan and operate with the Philippine military. The two countries have shared information for decades, but the pact is set to streamline the process and usher greater cooperation. Read more, here.

Hampered by supply chain problems, workforce challenges, and a lack of capacity, U.S. shipyards are behind on orders for the Navy's Columbia and Virginia class submarines. And AUKUS, a pact to build subs for Australia, is driving more pressure on shipyards. There's 'untapped potential&rdquo; at some private ship maintenance yards, which the Navy could utilize for new construction, Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va, said at a recent Defense One event. Wittman also said the Navy needs to create incentives for shipyards to get work done on time, and penalties if they don't. Read more, here.

The test comes as the U.S. military races to develop highly maneuverable weapons that can reach hypersonic speeds. Read more, here. Trump (sort of) signals mass deportation strategy Lastly today: In a one-word social media post Monday, President-elect Trump seemed to confirm that once he takes office, he intends to declare a national emergency so that he can use U.S. military 'assets&rdquo; to carry out his plans to deport millions of people from the United States. The apparent confirmation came in the form of a 4 a.m. reply to a conservative activist on Trump's social media platform early Monday. 'TRUE!!!&rdquo; Trump wrote in response. Background: According to Trump advisors, there are several facets or possibilities within their broad plans that could involve the U.S. military in some form or fashion. One includes using military construction funds to build 'vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers&rdquo; for the people Trump wants to deport to await processing, according to his immigration advisor Stephen Miller. This possibility, with a procedural precedent in Trump's first term, seems most likely. Another idea is to use active duty troops to patrol the border and arrest people, 'invoking the [circa 1807] Insurrection Act to use troops as immigration agents,&rdquo; as the New York Times explained in August. This would seemingly be more difficult, as it would rely on the consent of congress to a larger degree than redistributing military construction funds. Relatedly, both active duty and National Guard troops already assist border patrol agents along the U.S.-Mexico border; however, their work is principally bureaucratic and logistical and does not involve active arrests. Trump's team appears eager to change that. In the meantime, as Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford said Monday of possible changes in immigration enforcement under Trump, 'If the National Guard is providing transportation, they do that a lot already.&rdquo; Yet another idea from Trump himself is to use the Insurrection Act to have federal troops 'get crime out of our cities,&rdquo; with New York and Chicago, in particular. In a manner similar to Travis Bickle of the gritty 1970s film 'Taxi Driver,&rdquo; Trump said those cities are 'crime dens,&rdquo; and their Democrat governors are chiefly responsible. 'You look at what is happening to our country &mdash; we cannot let it happen any longer,&rdquo; Trump said at a campaign rally in Iowa. 'Because you are not supposed to be involved in that, you just have to be asked by the governor or the mayor to come in; the next time, I am not waiting,&rdquo; Trump said. Expert reax: 'To my knowledge, there are no &lsquo;national emergency' authorities which permit the US military to carry out deportations,&rdquo; said Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council. 'The National Emergencies Act is a specific law which unlocks specific authorities to do specific things &mdash; a president doesn't declare a national emergency and then become king. And &lsquo;use the military for deportations' isn't one of those specific things,&rdquo; he said. 'Last time, Trump invoked a specific emergency authority to unlock military construction funding &mdash; and direct more troops to do logistical support at the border,&rdquo; said Reichlin-Melnick. That's most likely the Trump administration's play in 2025 as well, he suggested; but nobody really knows just yet. One big problem for media covering plans like these from Trump and his advisors: They almost always lack specifics, and most seem to prefer 'mak[ing] grandiose pronouncements that are aimed at triggering the libs and making headlines,&rdquo; Reichlin-Melnick pointed out. One last thing about national emergencies: The U.S. is currently under more than three dozen of them, one of which goes back to 1979 (PDF).

As the Navy battles ongoing schedule delays, supply chain problems, and workforce challenges in its effort to produce more submarines, the service may need to turn to private repair shipyards to rebuild capacity, says the vice chair of the House Armed Services Committee. 'I would argue that there is some additional capability at existing yards. But one of the untapped potentials there are the ship maintenance yards,&rdquo; Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., said at a Defense One event. 'Ship maintenance yards have a whole bow wave of work that comes in, they get the work done, and then the work drops off.&rdquo; 'These private repair yards have a lot of capacity to do work in new construction while they are managing the repair work there&mdash;much of it is exactly the same. In fact, what we're seeing right now is the big yards using smaller contractors to build parts of those ships. So they'll build a panel that slides into a submarine&hellip;and parts for aircraft carriers, for other surface ships. We need to find more opportunities to do that.&rdquo; Wittman also suggested incentives to encourage shipyards to complete work on time, as well as penalties for missing strict timeframes. 'And then give them incentives to say, how do you diversify the ship building enterprise? How do you do more than just what you do in the yard?&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] Earlier this year, the Navy set up a program office to focus on converting submarine industrial base efforts&mdash;including workforce and manufacturing technology&mdash;to submarine sustainment, surface shipbuilding, and repair, Matt Sermon, executive director of the strategic submarines program executive office, said at a Naval Submarine Symposium and industry update. Ship repair and maintenance were also prioritized in 2024 supplemental funding and the president's 2025 budget. 'The sustainment goals are getting [nuclear-powered submarines] to 80 percent, getting the Ohio to even past the end of its life in serving the nation. But every bit as important [are] the manufacturing technology efforts and the workforce efforts that [submarine industrial base] is doing&hellip;those are a rising tide that floats all boats,&rdquo; Sermon said. 'We seek to help the entire supply chain, right? To have material available, and to get the workers in the public shipyards, in the repair yards.&rdquo; U.S. shipyards are up to three years behind on submarine orders for the Navy's Columbia and Virginia class submarines, and the AUKUS deal to provide Australia with submarines has added even more pressure. To address that, the Navy wants to increase repairs of aging submarines to keep them operational for longer. That plan would mean producing one Columbia- and two Virginia-class submarines each year, while also ensuring 80 percent of attack submarines were operational and available each year, National Defense Magazine reported. The Navy previously floated the idea of repairing aging Ohio-class submarines to compensate for delays with the Columbia&mdash;a move that would help stabilize the U.S. sub-based nuclear capabilities. 'We all know that Columbia is struggling to stay on schedule. I mean that's no secret,&rdquo; Vice Adm. Johnny Wolfe, director for the Navy's Strategic Systems Programs, told reporters during the Naval Submarine Symposium. 'Even when that first Columbia comes in the water, the weapon system is the same as what's on Ohio. So, if the Columbia were to be delayed, from a deterrence perspective, it's not going to impact what the Navy has to do, because I'll have an Ohio that has that system that fills that gap.&rdquo; The lack of skilled workers is also causing sub-building delays. The Defense Department is putting billions of dollars into rebuilding the submarine workforce&mdash;including an unconventional job advertising campaign&mdash;with tandem efforts in the Navy and the Pentagon. But officials are taking steps to make sure work isn't duplicated, Sermon said. In recent months, the Pentagon awarded Deloitte an up-to-$2.4 billion contract, followed by a nearly $1 billion contract with not-for-profit BlueForge Alliance to increase shipbuilding capacity by addressing workforce training and manpower shortages. Sermon said most of the program executive office's work with IBAS has focused on the workforce, and where it intersects with manufacturing technology. 'We're partnering with [DOD's Industrial Base Policy, or IBAS,] on what they're doing, but they are executing those [submarine industrial base] workforce efforts through the Deloitte contract,&rdquo; which is run by the defense secretary's office and the General Services Administration, Sermon told Defense One on Thursday at the Naval Submarine League's annual symposium. Sermon said those contracting efforts, while coordinated with the Navy's BlueForge contracts, don't overlap. 'We're making sure we're pushing the right direction, that our projects are integrated with each other,&rdquo; he said. For 2025, DOD requested $4 billion to improve the submarine-building workforce, infrastructure, supply chain, manufacturing technologies, and government oversight. The Pentagon has also highlighted its investments in the submarine industrial base as part of its industrial base strategy to deter adversaries in the Indo-Pacific. The Navy in September awarded and funded a $50 million direct contract with BlueForge, Sermon said. That contract has a $950 million ceiling, and the remainder is expected to be funded with 2025 appropriations once Congress passes a budget. The Navy also previously awarded BlueForge about $700 million as a subcontractor to General Dynamics Electric Boat to handle submarine industrial base workforce challenges, he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/should-navy-lean-private-repair-shipyards-build-subs-faster/401136/	2024-11-18T16:05:34-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/8725712/large.jpg
Classified-info pact sets stage for closer US-Philippines coopera...	MANILA, Philippines&mdash;To the strains of a military band playing Mariah Carey's Christmas song, U.S. and Philippine leaders broke ground on a new coordination center&mdash;and a new era of military cooperation as the country shifts its security focus from internal rebellion to Chinese incursion. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin flew into this sprawling metropolis of 24 million on Monday to sign a classified-information agreement, turn over a symbolic spadeful of earth, and meet the country's president and defense minister. The pact sets out rules for sharing classified intelligence and other data, including how to handle it, safeguard it, and report breaches, U.S. defense officials said. The two countries&mdash;treaty allies since 1951&mdash;have long shared information on various occasions and in various ways, but the agreement will greatly streamline the process, the officials said. Formally called the General Security of Military Information Agreement, or GSOMIA, the pact follows a more-or-less standard template used with at least 10 other U.S. security partners. But it was more than two years in the making because of the necessary negotiations, planning, training, infrastructure improvements, and more. 'We set the end of 2024 as the goal for concluding it,&rdquo; one senior defense official said on grounds of anonymity, and it 'will be a huge breakthrough in our ability to continue to deepen the cooperation that we have with the Philippines.&rdquo; At the signing ceremony, Philippines Minister of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro echoed that sentiment&mdash;and added that the agreement will also enable his country to pursue similar information-sharing pacts with other countries. The pact also lays the groundwork for the nascent Combined Coordination Center at Camp Aguinaldo, site of the Philippine Armed Forces' general headquarters. The building, to be erected in a vacant lot at the camp, will essentially give U.S. personnel&mdash;military as well as diplomatic&mdash;a purpose-built space where they can meet, plan, and operate with their Philippine counterparts. 'It was clear there was a need to take this out of, you know, random conference rooms and into a more dedicated center, especially one that had the right types of information feeds coming in both classified and unclassified information that we could see together,&rdquo; a second defense official said. 'I think certainly it will be where we do the bulk of our exercise planning, and when we conduct the exercises, it's going to be the op center&mdash;the hub where our forces assess what's going on for other operational activities that we do together, like our maritime cooperative activities in the South China Sea,&rdquo; as well as humanitarian operations. The center is to open next summer or early fall, the official said. Still to be determined is how many U.S. troops and officials might rotate through the center. 'I think the idea is it would have pretty large capacity to support some of our larger-scale exercises like Balakatan,&rdquo; the official said. 'It's somewhere where we would envision potentially having liaison officers in the future, once it is at full operating capacity.&rdquo; Austin also paid a call to the country's president, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., at his official residence, the sprawling Malaca&ntilde;ang Palace. The defense secretary announced he had authorized U.S. forces&mdash;he didn't say which ones or how many&mdash;to provide humanitarian assistance to the country, just days after it was struck by a fourth typhoon in two weeks. The visit is Austin's fourth and likely final official visit to the Philippines. His visits&mdash;the most by any U.S. defense secretary&mdash;began during the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, who threatened to tilt the country's security alignment toward China before being brought back into the U.S. fold. Under Austin, U.S. forces have helped reduce the country's Maoist insurgency to a fraction of its former strength, even as China has increased its assertiveness in defiance of international courts. Austin is slated on Tuesday to travel to the island of Palawan for a Philippine Navy demonstration of T-12 unmanned surface vessels provided by the U.S. through Foreign Military Financing, then to travel on to Laos for the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting-Plus event. But on a hot day in Manila, with the Philippine Army Band playing upbeat selections and golden-handled shovels awaiting their ceremonial use, officials were ebullient. 'This center embodies our aspirations,&rdquo; one Philippines general said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/classified-info-pact-sets-stage-closer-us-philippines-cooperation/401135/	2024-11-18T15:31:03-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/signing_ceremony/large.jpg
INDOPACOM is replacing a pile of partner-nation networks with jus...	After years of building bespoke networks to connect with individual allied and partner militaries, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command is preparing to bring nearly two dozen countries into a single network in 2025. This INDOPACOM Mission Network, or IMN, is meant to replace the current unwieldy situation with a single seamless and secure platform that provides a common operating picture, file transfer, voice and chat tools. And while the IMN itself is meant for high-level information-sharing, it is intended to eventually enable new tactical networks as well. 'Most of our operations are not just joint, they are combined, they're multilateral, and this network of alliances and partnerships are, in fact, our key strategic asymmetric advantage,&rdquo; Adm. Sam Paparo, who leads the command, said last month at the AFCEA TechNet conference in Honolulu, Hawaii. Paparo said the IMN will make it 'so that we're operating off the same picture at all times, we're able to pass mission orders at all times, so that we're able to achieve unity of effort at all times.&rdquo; As INDOPACOM expanded its exercises with regional militaries over the years, it often tailored a new network for each new partner or ally, ultimately creating some 20 of these bespoke networks. This made adding partners to multilateral wargames increasingly complicated, said Brig. Gen. Mark Miles, who led the command's Command, Control, Communications and Cyber Directorate until a few months ago. 'For example, if we're doing an exercise with Japan and then at the last minute we include Australia, that's two different networks. We have a network we use to share with Japan, and we have a network we use to share with Australia. And, to collaborate across those two networks involved manual data movement, so thumb drives or CDs, or sometimes people looking at two different monitors,&rdquo; said Miles, who is now deputy commander of the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence. Over the past two years, Miles led the effort to create a network that could securely accommodate all, or at least most, of INDOPACOM's partners. In February, the IMN stood up with initial operating capacity for Keen Edge, a long-running U.S.-Japan exercise that this year included Australian forces for the first time. The network was subsequently approved for use by the Five Eyes, the intelligence alliance of the U.S., U.K., Australia, New Zealand, and Canada. IMN was also used in June's Valiant Shield, a larger multinational wargame designed to boost interoperability. Over the summer, South Korea was added to the IMN. Next up, the Philippines. 'We're currently participating in Exercise Bold Quest 24 as proof of concept for our Indo-Pacific Mission Network Tactical Data Center. And by 2025, in the summer, our mission network will reach full operational capability during Exercise Pacific Sentry,&rdquo; Paparo said. Once IMN gains approval by the National Security Agency, the admiral said, its zero trust architecture 'will be operationalized with our allies and partners.&rdquo; By the end of next year, INDOPACOM aims to connect 23 nations with key applications like phone and video calls, chat tools, file sharing, email, and a common operational picture. Miles said the IMN is built to accommodate other militaries' varying technical abilities and security requirements, using on-premise and cloud-based solutions. 'There are limitations to what we can put in the cloud. So I would say it's a hybrid. And I'll also say that we built and designed and architected the network with the ability to move it to the cloud at some time in the future. So we did that by building everything containerized,&rdquo; he said. Paparo said the new network would help with one of his command's top priorities: 'counter-C5ISR and T,&rdquo;&mdash;that is, 'the ability to dazzle, deceive, destroy&hellip;at times of our choosing, [our] adversary's ability to see and sense the battle space. And to do so while being interoperable with our allies and partners.&rdquo; Army's tactical network IMN's use focuses on a strategic or perhaps operational, level. But the network's architecture also makes it possible to link with platforms&mdash;dubbed 'tactical mission partner environments&rdquo;&mdash;that connect military units at lower echelons. The first of these will likely be deployed by U.S. Army Pacific Forces, which has been testing out preliminary equipment sets in various coalition exercises. 'It's iterative, and it's evolving,&rdquo; Gen. Charles Flynn, then the commander of U.S. Army Pacific, told reporters in May. &rdquo;Because the partner plays a role here, we have to do continual assessments of that architecture to make sure that we don't expose them or us the challenges with that communications network.&rdquo; The effort is being led by I Corps, the Army Pacific formation based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Washington. The corps is currently in Japan, setting up for a mega wargame that will test the MPEs capabilities. 'We are going to be the first tactical mission partner environment network that gets connected to the INDOPACOM Mission Network. That's our goal,&rdquo; said Col. Rett Burroughs, I Corps' chief information officer. 'All the way down and put it into vehicles that move and put it on the backs of soldiers that walk.&rdquo; Burroughs said the corps has been installing networking gear in various partner nations over the past year. 'We actually have our tactical server infrastructure in place all across the Pacific. We can now talk on our mission partner environment with the Australian 1st Division in Brisbane. We have our connection in Thailand and the Philippines,&rdquo; he said. But the networking software is coming more slowly. Over the past year, I Corps created and tested a tactical network between the U.S., Japan, and Australia with a simple goal: enable an Australian service member to send an email to her Japanese counterparts. There's no data-sharing policy between the three nations, which limits what can be shared between their respective networks. 'If you, from the Australian side, were going to send me, a Japanese officer, an email, you can't send an attachment. We would actually take that attachment and we would just make it disappear. But the body of the text would go through,&rdquo; Burroughs said. I Corps aims to test and refine the new system in December. 'We're throwing our warfighter exercise that [U.S. Army Forces Command] requires us to do every two years on top of an [U.S. Army Pacific] exercise that we do every year. So we're going to mash two exercises into one&hellip;it's going to be a pretty chaotic event for us communicators, to say the least, because it's never been done before,&rdquo; Burroughs said. 'We're going to refine them to make them simpler, more effective, and just a little more seamless to the operator so they don't have to take as many steps,&rdquo; like being able to find files easier. The goal is to inform the Army, Indo-Pacific Command, and the Joint Staff on 'what we know works in the Pacific&rdquo; using real-world test cases at scale to form requirements. 'Technologically, there's nothing that we can't do,&rdquo; Burroughs said. 'Everything that we see in science and science fiction, we can do it. But policy has to dictate what we're actually allowed to do. So those trilat agreements&hellip;military-level discussions, those are happening and those have to happen in order for us to modernize.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/indopacom-replacing-pile-partner-nation-networks-just-one/401129/	2024-11-18T13:48:13-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/8035141/large.jpg
Women veterans react to 'ill-informed' disparagement by Trump's S...	Originally published by The 19th. Women veterans, national security organizations and military historians are pushing back against recent disparaging comments made by Pete Hegseth, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Defense. 'I'm straight up just saying we shouldn't have women in combat roles,&rdquo; Hegseth, a Fox host who served in the Army National Guard, said on a podcast last week while promoting his new book, The War on Warriors. 'It hasn't made us more effective. It hasn't made us more lethal. It has made fighting more complicated.&rdquo; Allison Jaslow, the chief executive of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said she was deployed to Iraq in 2004 as a platoon leader. Within two months, her entire platoon's mission shifted to a more combat-focused directive and many of the 'women could run circles around some of the men&rdquo;&mdash;both in physical fitness and courage, Jaslow said. 'During my time in the military, I've had some male colleagues really freaking disappoint me,&rdquo; Jaslow said. 'I've seen women who've displayed more courage, better physical fitness and better character over some of the men that I've served with. I reject the notion [that men are categorically better] altogether, and I think some people with strongly held beliefs will look at one example and label all the rest of us.&hellip;It's just one of those things where I'm like, &lsquo;Tell me to my face.'&rdquo; Hegseth, who according to his personal website served in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, also said that institutions shouldn't incentivize women to take these roles because 'over human history, men in those positions are more capable.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] He argued in his book that standards have been changed to accommodate women, which ultimately detracts from the capability of military units. He also claims that 'America's white sons and daughters&rdquo; are walking away from the military because of 'woke&rdquo; ideology that is too 'effeminate&rdquo; and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion to the country's detriment. 'Everybody knows between bone density and lung capacity and muscle strength, men and women are just different,&rdquo; Hegseth added in the interview. Women&mdash;who currently make up more than 21 percent of the active-duty force&mdash;have held combat roles in the military for decades, though it's been a gradual progression. Congress repealed the law banning women from combat aviation and on ships in 1991 and 1993, respectively. The Navy reversed the policy barring women from submarines in 2010. And then in 2013, Congress announced the repeal of the combat exclusion policy, which was implemented in 2015. Over a quarter of a million women served in Iraq from 2003 to 2011, the largest-scale and most visible deployment of women in U.S. history. More than 1,000 women were injured in combat and 166 killed as of 2017, according to the Service Women's Action Network (SWAN). Lory Manning, a Navy veteran who served as the director of government operations with SWAN, said Hegseth's comments are 'ill-informed&rdquo; and there's no substantial evidence that the presence of women in combat roles harms the U.S. military's effectiveness. 'He keeps saying they've lowered standards for women [in combat roles], and that is just not true,&rdquo; said Manning, who also led Women in the Military Project at the Women's Research and Education Institute for 15 years. 'Number one: it's against the law to lower standards for women.&rdquo; Manning said he is likely confusing or conflating two different kinds of military standards: basic physical fitness and occupational. The basic physical fitness tests differ across military services and are typically adjusted by age and gender. 'These are basically just to see if this person is fit to be in the military, whether they're a heart surgeon or a Catholic chaplain or a combat person,&rdquo; Manning said. 'But for every single job in the military, there's also a set of occupational standards that have to be met. And the law says that they must be gender and age neutral.&rdquo; Women service members are required to meet the exact same standards as the men serving alongside them in the same roles. In some recent instances, Manning said women were even asked to participate in specialty combat squads called Lioness Teams. In Iraq, it became clear that only American women soldiers were able to communicate with Iraqi women due to cultural customs and were able to gain important intel on the ground. 'I think [Hegseth] is dead wrong when he says that women are the problem,&rdquo; Manning said. 'Leadership is and has historically been about how to blend the diversity in the armed forces.&rdquo; Jaslow emphasized that women should not be considered as weaker based on their gender, pointing to how many have competed and succeeded on the same playing field as their male counterparts. 'Look at the women who've graduated from Ranger School, which is so grueling that around half of the men who enter it fail out,&rdquo; Jaslow said, referring to one of the toughest Army training courses. 'These women deserve a Secretary of Defense who is aware of that reality and also ensures that the culture in the military embraces that reality.&rdquo; Jaslow said Hegseth's remarks were especially disappointing because he also fought during the post-911 conflicts alongside an increasing number of women service members. 'It's tough to swallow that he is somebody who is a contemporary of mine, who lived through our most recent wars and also understands that we are fighting our wars with an all-volunteer military right now,&rdquo; Jaslow said. 'We don't need to be standing in the way of any able-bodied American who wants to serve or telling them that there are restrictions on the way that they have to serve their country. Just set the standards, and if they can rise to the challenge, they should be able to serve.&rdquo; If confirmed, Hegseth would lead the largest government agency, which employs nearly 3 million military and civilian employees all charged with protecting the security of the country. Kara Dixon Vuic, who studies gender and the U.S. military at Texas Christian University, said that if Hegseth were to bar women from serving in combat roles, it would be a rare reversal in a centuries-long history of the military expanding toward greater inclusivity. A major exception was when Trump placed a ban on transgender people serving in the military, which went into effect in 2019 and was ended by the Biden administration in 2021. 'Nothing Hegseth's saying is new,&rdquo; Vuic said. 'People said those same things about the racial integration of the military. They said similar things about gay men and women being allowed to serve openly. He's putting the blame for anything negative that could happen on a group of people without providing evidence to support that claim.&rdquo; Yet, women have found themselves on the frontlines of war for centuries, even before they were given technical combat role titles. When the chaos of conflict ensues, roles are often not cleanly delineated into combat and non-combat. Even cooks, medics and radio operators can find themselves in the battlefield. As far back as the Revolutionary War, there were reports of women serving in combat alongside their husbands or disguised as men or as spies for the cause. 'I think top military leaders will push back because they know the realities on the ground,&rdquo; Vuic said. 'They see that women in combat is a matter of efficiency and effectiveness. And they have understood for a long time that to be the most lethal military, you have to draw on the widest pool of talent in this country. To cut off more than half of the population simply because of their sex is not going to give you an optimal military force.&rdquo; Lauren Buitta, who founded Girl Security, a nonprofit dedicated to increasing gender equity in the national security sector, said the U.S. military is currently struggling with high suicide rates, rampant sexual misconduct and assault and a recruitment crisis. 'In my mind, the short of it is that this issue is decided: Women have served selflessly,&rdquo; Buitta said. 'There are other tremendous challenges that the U.S. military confronts that I imagine a Secretary of Defense would be focused on.&rdquo; Buitta, who works on dismantling gender stereotypes to create career pathways for young girls and women in the national security sector, said that her organization will continue to help girls achieve their dreams, even if that is to serve in a combat role in the military. 'If Hegseth's words did turn into action that impacted women's contributions and combat occupations, I think it will hurt America's position on the global stage,&rdquo; Buitta said. 'We lead by example.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/women-veterans-react-ill-informed-disparagement-trumps-secdef-pick/401119/	2024-11-18T12:38:21-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/5401454/large.jpg
Exclusive: New rocket startup debuts with supersonic flight	The competition for new highly-maneuverable missiles just got much hotter. Dawn Hypersonics &mdash; part of Dawn Aerospace &mdash; today revealed it has achieved supersonic flight with their prototype Mk-II Aurora craft off the coast of New Zealand. Defense One spoke exclusively with the company's co-founder and CTO, Stefan Powell, on what the success means for the U.S. missile race. On November 7, the Mk-II Aurora completed a 66,000 foot ascent in just 118.6 seconds, beating the previous decades-old record by more than 4 seconds. 'With flight test 57, we retired the final major technical risk; vehicle dynamics through the transonic regime [between Mach 0.8 to 1.2]. In doing so, Aurora became the highest climb rate aircraft ever built. The door is now wide open for Aurora to become the world's highest and fastest flying aircraft too,&rdquo; Powell said. The U.S. military is racing to deploy a wide variety of high-speed, highly maneuverable missiles capable of hypersonic speeds, Mach 5 and above. But reaching supersonic speeds while maintaining maneuverability and control is a bigger barrier, said Powell. Once you overcome that obstacle, the transition from supersonic to near hypersonic speed is much easier. Powell said that the ultimate goal is to get the Aurora up to about Mach 3.5, or about 2,685 miles per hour. That's a bit beneath the technical definition of hypersonic. But the military's goal in its highly-maneuverable missile program isn't a magic number, it's a missile that can beat the world's most advanced air defense systems. After all, intercontinental ballistic missiles from the 1960s hit speeds above Mach 5 by flying in a simple ballistic path through space, which is also why they are beatable. High maneuverability means flying much closer to the Earth, at near space altitudes of between 20 and 100 kilometers. At those heights, atmospheric and other forces put a lot of pressure on aircraft moving at extremely high speeds. And maneuvering becomes an even greater challenge. The Mk-II builds off jet aircraft design and is intended to be reusable, up to two flights a day, but doesn't require a pilot, essentially making it a highly-maneuverable missile if that's how the operator chooses to use, or a high-altitude surveillance drone that's much harder to hit than many of those currently in use. 'We really want it to act like a jet engine, but you want to have the thrust-to-weight ratio of a rocket engine, which is about 20 times better than a jet and that means you don't end up building the whole aircraft around the engine. Most of the aircraft is actually just propellant and you got a tiny little engine at the back that really just kicks ass and gets you up to these hypersonic speeds,&rdquo; Powell said. The decision to make a jet that can serve as a missile, rather than focus on some minimal innovation on hypersonic engine design, was key to getting the craft certified as an aircraft and that made a huge difference in getting the necessary certifications to do testing, said Powell. 'Avoiding such novelty saves us literal decades of development and is why we already have a well-developed flight test program with 50+ flights under our belt,&rdquo; he said. That flight test record is the company's real advantage. Powell admits that while the Mk-II boasts an innovative design, it was a series of business decisions that enabled rapid and repeated testing. It's a big part of the reason the company is based in New Zealand. 'This is the real secret source of Dawn Aerospace testing. A lot of very forward-leaning companies come to New Zealand to do the aerospace testing, Powell said. 'Merlin Labs is one. Wisk [Aero] is another, because the CAA, our equivalent to the FAA, is extremely forward thinking. A small enough organization that you can get them all around a single table and talk to them and figure out this stuff of like, how are we going to do this in a constructive way? And they have a few rule sets that are performance-based rather than prescriptive, which means they require you to uphold a certain level of safety, rather than tell you how to design the vehicle.&rdquo; That allows the company to conduct tests out of a commercial airport. Contrast that with the severe limitations on test range facilities that are hobbling hypersonic missile development in the United States. While the company is aiming for the military market, Powell sees an expanded future for hypersonic craft in the commercial and public sector as well. 'I think what we're seeing now and what we will experience over the next 15 to 20 years will be very similar to the story of the jet engine, where the first markets were absolutely military, but potentially, in the long run, the most interesting applications are actually in the commercial sphere,&rdquo; Powell said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/exclusive-new-rocket-startup-debuts-supersonic-flight/401109/	2024-11-18T09:21:36-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/18/Screenshot_2024_11_18_at_12.07.56PM/large.png
The D Brief: Biden green lights ATACMS for Kursk; SecDef Austin i...	Biden lifts restrictions on long-range missiles It's been 999 days since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And just before that anniversary, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden finally authorized Ukraine's use of U.S.-made long-range missiles to attack Russian military targets inside Russia, with an early emphasis on Ukrainian-held territory inside Russia's Kursk region, U.S. officials told multiple news outlets over the weekend, including the New York Times and the Associated Press. It's a decision Ukraine's president has been requesting for months, at least partly because many Russian aircraft launch missile and glide bomb attacks against Ukraine from well inside Russia's borders. Since Ukraine first requested the Army Tactical Missile System authorization, White House officials signaled a reluctance to escalate the conflict and potentially provoke Russia into launching a nuclear attack or a war on NATO in response. The missiles, which can be fired from High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, can fly as far as 190 miles, potentially allowing Ukraine to strike additional Russian military resupply routes, Defense One's Patrick Tucker writes. Back in August, the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War published a series of maps to illustrate how the White House restrictions have hampered Ukraine's ability to target Russian forces that were directly attacking Ukraine. But Russia's military has escalated its own drone and missile attacks on Ukraine in recent days, and Russia has been more deliberately targeting Ukraine's energy infrastructure with long-range strikes, which could prove especially devastating as Ukraine heads into its third consecutive winter under the boot of Russian invasion forces. And this winter, those invasion forces are backed up by a contingent of North Korean troops. Why lift the restrictions now? The short answer is North Korea, U.S. officials reportedly said. The president was reportedly convinced 'by concerns that the Russian assault force would be able to overwhelm Ukrainian troops in Kursk if they were not allowed to defend themselves with long-range weapons,&rdquo; according to the Times. And AP reported Biden's decision 'followed meetings over the last two days with the leaders of South Korea, Japan and China,&rdquo; noting 'the addition of North Korean troops was central to the talks&rdquo; with those leaders. Think tanker reax: 'The Biden Administration's shift to allow ATACMS use in Russia is a good thing, but it must extend beyond Kursk Oblast,&rdquo; George Barros of ISW wrote on social media Sunday. 'There are hundreds of valid, legal, legitimate, and operationally consequential military targets in range of Ukrainian ATACMS,&rdquo; he added. Another thing: 'Both the French and UK government[s] have previously indicated a willingness to approve Ukrainian use against targets in Russia of the cruise missiles they have supplied,&rdquo; Matthew Savill of the London-based Royal United Services Institute writes. 'However, both rely on updated targeting data that probably comes from the US, meaning that they too have been blocked from Ukrainian use,&rdquo; he notes. 'It stands to reason that relaxation of the ATACMS criteria will similarly lead to some relaxation on both Storm Shadow and SCALP,&rdquo; Savill speculated. 'If so, from the Ukrainian perspective it would be preferable for this take place privately and not be announced until after first use, though the Russians already have some advance warning.&rdquo; For what it's worth 'The overall supply of ATACMS missiles is short, so U.S. officials in the past have questioned whether they could give Ukraine enough to make a difference,&rdquo; AP noted, while the Times points out, 'U.S. officials said they do not believe that the decision will change the course of the war.&rdquo; While Republican Sen. Roger Wicker said he's 'encouraged&rdquo; by the decision, which he also said came far too late, others close to President-elect Donald Trump questioned the change in policy. That included David Sacks, a close ally of Elon Musk and a favored Trump donor. 'President Trump won a clear mandate to end the war in Ukraine. So what does Biden do in his final two months in office? Massively escalate it. Is his goal to hand Trump the worst situation possible?&rdquo; Sacks wrote Sunday on Musk's social media platform. The view from Kyiv: 'Strikes are not carried out with words. These things are not announced. The missiles will speak for themselves,&rdquo; President Volodymir Zelenskyy said on social media Sunday. One Ukrainian military POV: 'With Trump, everyone is joking that it's better to have a horrible end than unending horror,&rdquo; a soldier told the BBC last week. Trump, he said, is 'willing to take hard decisions, and from there, we're getting better chances to get a good decision versus Democrats, who would be reluctant to make any hard decisions. They're pretty weak. Overall, it's surprisingly not as bad as I expected. So overall, the morale is quite nice. And we're all looking forward to seeing what's going to happen.&rdquo; Additional reading/listening: 'Russian officials say Biden decision to let Ukraine fire missiles deep into Russia could lead to world war,&rdquo; CBS News reported Monday; 'Long-range strikes against Russia: too late to save Ukraine?&rdquo; Reuters reported Monday; 'Germany still a 'no' on long-range missiles,&rdquo; Germany's Deutsche Welle reported Monday; And former NATO chief 'Jens Stoltenberg on...

On this day in 1978, the F/A-18 Hornet completed its first flight at Maryland's Naval Air Test Center. It was first introduced to the U.S. military just over four years later, in January 1983. SecDef Austin's (likely) last Pacific swing Japan, Australia, and the United States say they're strengthening three-way defense cooperation&mdash;vowing, among other things, to consult with each other in military planning and regional crises, Defense One's Bradley Peniston reported Sunday while traveling in the region with the U.S. defense secretary. The increased coordination will take place under a new structure called the Trilateral Defense Consultations, Richard Marles, Australia's deputy prime minister and minister for defence, told reporters at the naval base in Darwin, Australia. 'It provides a substance and a structure to the trilateral meeting of our three countries which has not been there before, and it represents the ambition that all of us have about taking this architecture of our three countries even further,&rdquo; Marles said. Marles spoke after an annual meeting with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts&mdash;Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani&mdash;that produced a slew of other announcements, including (1) Japan's new Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade will join annual U.S.-Australian exercises held by the Marine Rotational Force&ndash;Darwin, starting with Talisman Sabre 2025 and building toward the countries' first air- and missile-defense live-fire training event in the exercise's 2027 edition; (2) Australian forces will join U.S.-Japanese exercises, beginning with Orient Shield 2025, and increase their participation in others, including Yama Sakura, Keen Edge, and Keen Sword; and (3) the three nations will look for ways to increase Australian participation in the U.S.-Japanese Bilateral Information Analysis Cell.

From the region: 'China's second mass attack in a week spurs soul-searching,&rdquo; Reuters reported Sunday; 'Asia-Pacific summit closes in Peru with China's Xi front and center as Trump whiplash looms,&rdquo; AP reported Sunday from Peru; 'N. Korea sends trash-carrying balloons to S. Korea for 1st time in 3 weeks,&rdquo; Seoul's Yonhap news reported Monday; And 'As Beijing Threatens, Taiwan Looks Nervously at Trump,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Monday from Taipei. Around the Defense Department In a new first, the U.S. Air Force awarded the Silver Star to a female airman, Capt. Lacie 'Sonic&rdquo; Hester, after Hester helped defend Israel from Iranian drones and missiles in April. Air Force F-15E jets shot down 80 drones during Iran's attack on Israel, one of the largest-ever drone attacks. The Silver Star is the U.S. military's third-highest decoration for valor in combat. Update: Trump's defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth paid a woman who accused him of sexual assault, but he maintains that the encounter was consensual, and thereby is not something that should disqualify him from leading the U.S. military during Trump's second term, the Washington Post reported over the weekend. Hegseth's attorney said he paid the woman out of fear of being fired from his post as a Fox TV personality. The Post obtained a copy of a memo sent to the Trump transition team from a friend of the accuser, detailing the allegations. The accuser signed a nondisclosure agreement and received a payment after threatening litigation in 2020. Trump himself is reportedly undeterred. Indeed, Trump spokesman Steven Cheung insisted last week that 'President Trump is nominating high-caliber and extremely qualified candidates to serve in his administration. Mr. Hegseth has vigorously denied any and all allegations, and no charges were filed,&rdquo; said Cheung. Some senior officers in the Army's ROTC program have used their power to make unwanted sexual advances on young students, Military.com reported Friday. The investigation, which interviewed 15 women, found that 'the ROTC has consistently been a place where senior instructors &mdash; positions overwhelmingly held by men &mdash; can use the program as a personal dating pool, targeting women in the program and often taking advantage of their ability to skirt the traditional oversight the service has on its senior officers.&rdquo; Etc. And lastly today: Reed, Shaheen request probe into Musk's Russia calls. New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen says she and Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed have requested an 'investigation into Elon Musk's involvement in U.S. government contracts with SpaceX,&rdquo; citing several alleged phone calls between Musk and Russian officials over the past few months. 'These relationships between a well-known U.S. adversary and Mr. Musk, a beneficiary of billions of dollars in U.S. government funding, pose serious questions regarding Mr. Musk's reliability as a government contractor and a clearance holder,&rdquo; the senators warn in a letter (PDF) to U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. 'We urge an immediate review into this reporting to ascertain whether Mr. Musk's conversation and specific ties to high-level Russian officials warrant an investigation and a determination by the Department of Defense's senior debarment official whether SpaceX should exclude Mr. Musk's involvement in any and all U.S. Government contracts,&rdquo; they write. The two senators are also worried Musk has outsized influence within the Space Force, including a possible 'overreliance on SpaceX for national security space activities,&rdquo; they wrote in a separate letter (PDF) to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. 'We are also concerned that SpaceX's Starlink is the only commercial service available to offer global broadband connectivity in low-Earth orbit,&rdquo; they said to Kendall. Worth noting: 'The call by Shaheen and Reed for a federal probe is a longshot effort,&rdquo; Reuters reports, noting 'Trump prepares to return to the White House with backing from Musk, who spent over $119 million on Trump's reelection campaign and was appointed co-head of the president-elect's forthcoming Department of Government Efficiency.&rdquo; More, here.

Biden allows Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike Russia	Ukraine can now use long-range ATACMS missiles for some strikes inside Russia, the Biden administration said Sunday, a development that Ukrainians had been seeking for years. Administration officials told The New York Times the missiles would 'likely&rdquo; first be used against Russian and North Korean forces battling Ukrainians in Kursk, but noted that Biden may allow them to be used elsewhere. Army Tactical Missile System missiles, or ATACMS, were one of many weapons Ukraine requested at the outset of Russia's 2022 attack on Ukraine. The missiles, which can be fired from High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, can fly as far as 190 miles, potentially allowing Ukraine to strike Russian resupply routes or even Moscow. The United States has supplied HIMARS since the first few months of the war, but has been reluctant to provide the longer-range ATACMS, saying it could prompt Russia to escalate hostilities. Russian doctrine allows for the country's military to treat a threat to the capital or even a supply route far from the border as 'existential,&rdquo; and Russian officials had said even giving Ukrainians the missiles&mdash;much less allowing them for targets inside Russia&mdash;was a 'red line.&rdquo; However, in March, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. C.Q. Brown said the risk of escalation was 'not as high,&rdquo; and that same month, the White House began to send some of the longer-range missiles to Ukraine&mdash;albeit with strict limits on their use. [[Related Posts]] The Institute for the Study of War published a series of maps to illustrate how the White House restrictions have hampered Ukraine's ability to target Russian forces that were directly attacking Ukraine. The decision to loosen those restrictions comes after reports that North Korea may send as many as 100,000 troops to Russia to fight Ukrainians, and after Russia launched a brutal missile assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and other targets. 'Reminder that there are hundreds of valid, legal, legitimate, and operationally consequential military targets in range of Ukrainian ATACMS. The Biden Administration's shift to allow ATACMS use in Russia is a good thing, but it must extend beyond Kursk Oblast,&rdquo; George Barros, leader of the Russia team and GEOINT team at the Institute, said on X. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, told The Financial Times that ATACMS will greatly improve Ukraine's ability to strike Russian forces as they prepare to attack Ukraine: 'There are targets which can only be addressed by high payload missiles such as ATACMS or equivalent aerial missiles. This is, of course, a decision giving Ukraine troops a chance, though as with many previous decisions, coming after a significant and extremely painful delay.&rdquo; The move also follows a decision by the French and British governments to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles, according to La Figaro. It also signals a shift in Washington's risk calculus&mdash;a shift that many, like Zagorodnyuk, argue should have come sooner. Rep. Roger Wicker, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is one of several Republicans who have been pressuring the administration for more than a year to give Ukraine the missiles and lift the restrictions. 'If initial press reports are true, I am encouraged at the prospect of allowing Ukraine to use long-range ATACM missiles supplied by the U.S. This does not excuse the administration's deliberate slow-walking of items and assistance long authorized by Congress for use against Putin's illegal aggression,&rdquo; Wicker, of Mississippi, said in a statement. 'This devastating conflict could have been ended on terms benefiting the U.S. and NATO if Mr. Biden had listened to the counsel of bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate.&rdquo; But others in the party, such as David Sacks, a close ally of Elon Musk and Trump donor who spoke at the Republican National Convention, have taken a much different stance. 'President Trump won a clear mandate to end the war in Ukraine. So what does Biden do in his final two months in office? Massively escalate it.

US, Australia, Japan deepen defense cooperation	DARWIN, Australia&mdash;Japan, Australia, and the United States are strengthening their three-way defense cooperation&mdash;vowing, among other things, to consult with each other in military planning and regional crises, defense leaders from the countries said Sunday. The leaders also discussed prospects for increased cooperation under AUKUS and their views on the incoming Trump administration. The increased coordination will take place under a new structure called the Trilateral Defense Consultations, Richard Marles, Australia's deputy prime minister and minister for defence, told reporters at the naval base here. 'It provides a substance and a structure to the trilateral meeting of our three countries which has not been there before, and it represents the ambition that all of us have about taking this architecture of our three countries even further,&rdquo; Marles said.

The three nations will look for ways to increase Australian participation in the U.S.-Japanese Bilateral Information Analysis Cell. [[Related Posts]] India, too, got a nod: Marles said the three nations will deepen their cooperation with the Indian military in the realm of maritime domain awareness, building on a 'maritime patrol aircraft collaboration activity with India&rdquo; on the sidelines of September's Exercise Kakadu. AUKUS Just as in Austin's trip to London in September, local press wanted to know whether U.S. shipbuilding troubles would delay or boost the price tag of the Virginia-class attack submarines promised to Australia under AUKUS Pillar I. Replied Austin: 'I'm confident that we're going to be able to provide the capabilities that we set out to provide. Now, we recognize that there are challenges in the industrial base, and we're doing things to address those challenges. We're investing more so that, you know, we can speed up the production to meet our objectives going forward. And you know, I've met with the leadership of the companies that are producing submarines, and I'm encouraged by what they're doing and their focus to get this done, and they will get it done.&rdquo; And Marles: 'We do have a sense of confidence about the fulfillment of the timelines that we articulated when we announced the optimal pathway back in March of last year.&rdquo; As for AUKUS Pillar II, the effort to jointly develop various 'advanced military capabilities,&rdquo; the leaders said they 'look forward to continued consultations with Japan,&rdquo; whose first contribution is expected to be in maritime autonomous systems. In October, Japanese officials attended Exercise Autonomous Warrior as observers. Trump, incoming Reporters also asked whether AUKUS and the plans for increased cooperation could be expected to survive the incoming administration of Donald Trump, who has unexpectedly shut down multinational exercises and often expressed contempt for U.S. alliances. 'I think the answer to that is yes,&rdquo; Marles said. 'This time last year, legislation passed the U.S. Congress&mdash;with the support of Democrats, Republicans, Trump Republicans&mdash;which saw the legislative underpinning of the sale of Virginia-class submarines to Australia... 'The basis of the alliance is shared values, but it's a shared strategic objective and shared strategic advantage. And AUKUS is in the strategic interest of both the United States and Australia, and that's the fundamental here, as it is for Britain. And so we are seeing AUKUS survive change of governments in Australia, in United Kingdom&mdash;and it will happen in America as well.&rdquo; He added, 'Everything that I've heard about Pete Hegseth since his name became public, in the context of becoming the secretary of defense, has been positive, and I approach the prospect of getting to know Pete Hegseth and working with him with enormous optimism.&rdquo; And Austin: 'It's the prerogative of the president-elect to nominate whoever he deems appropriate to serve on his cabinet. As far as DOD is concerned, we remain focused on a smooth and effective transition to the next administration...I would just say that this is a large enterprise, DOD, and it often involves making life-and-death decisions on a near-daily basis, and accounting for and taking care of some 2.7 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, guardians and really remaining focused on protecting the country and protecting our interests around the world.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/us-australia-japan-deepen-defense-cooperation/401099/	2024-11-16T22:44:08-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/17/IMG_3154/large.jpg
‘Extraordinarily dangerous’: Intelligence community insiders warn...	Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, lacks experience, and her record of Russia-aligned public statements could undermine the ability of the United States to acquire intelligence from allies and partners, current and former intelligence officials say. Trump on Wednesday announced his intention to put Gabbard, who served in Congress as a Democrat from Hawaii, in charge of the national intelligence office. The office coordinates intelligence efforts across the entire government, forges intelligence-sharing relationships with other countries, and shapes the way the public and the White House understand threats to U.S. interests. The office takes a leading role in assembling the daily brief for the president, which the White House uses to understand how adversaries are working against the United States, and in telling the public about threats Americans face. Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran and lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, has military experience but not a deep background in intelligence. One former senior intelligence official told Defense One that such experience is vital to making sense of the wide variety of intelligence pieces that compose a picture of current or future threats. 'What people don't understand about intelligence is, if it's known, it's not intelligence. It's that assessment that you make. It has uncertainty, and the craft of understanding that uncertainty has nothing to do with opinion but rather has to do with trust, integrity and independence,&rdquo; the former official said. But intelligence community veterans are more concerned with her past actions and public statements&mdash;particularly those that aligned with Kremlin propaganda&mdash;than her resume. [[Related Posts]] In 2022, as Russian forces were launching an illegal expansion of their war against Ukraine, Gabbard said the U.S. was to blame, echoing a claim Russian President Vladimir Putin made to justify his invasion&mdash;but that NATO and the United Nations fully reject. Putin later said the war was actually a means to reconstitute the territorial empire of Catherine II. Gabbard has echoed other Russian talking points as well, including one that came directly from Kremlin information operations. Beyond Ukraine, Gabbard met with Syrian dictator and Russian ally Bashar Al-Assad in 2017. Assad continued to target civilians with chemical attacks after meeting Gabbard. But two years after the meeting, she refused to say whether he was a war criminal&mdash;despite clear evidence that he had killed some 1,400 people in Syria in a chemical weapons attack in 2013, among other crimes. Gabbard's pattern of publicly taking positions that are not supported by fact but do match up with narratives out of Moscow is going to hurt U.S. intelligence-sharing relationships with partner militaries and governments, the former senior official said. Many allies are already wary of Trump because of actions during his first term in the White House, such as abandoning Kurdish fighters in Syria in 2018&mdash;a move that prompted the resignation of several members of Trump's first cabinet, including then-Defense Secretary James Mattis and anti-ISIS coalition envoy Brett McGurk. 'They're watching. Remember, there are a whole bunch of people that already, from [Trump's] first term, are not comfortable with Trump because he was willing to throw allies and partners on a whim under the bus&hellip;So [allies] are already worried. And now this is a pertinent person who has basically said, &lsquo;Hey, I think these bad guys are good guys.'&rdquo; Gabbard's past public statements will also hurt her ability to earn trust among rank-and-file intelligence workers in the United States, said one current intelligence official. 'Tulsi's history of irresponsibly promoting misinformation and giving comfort to some of America's most aggressive adversaries is counter to the values of the intelligence community. If confirmed, she'll have a steep hill to climb to earn the trust and respect of the community,&rdquo; the official told Defense One. As DNI, Gabbard would be ultimately responsible for protecting U.S. intelligence operations and people from adversaries. She also would be the one to make the call on things like the 2022 decision to declassify intelligence analyses of Russia's intentions in Ukraine, which helped marshal allies to Ukraine's cause. 'That decision was an ODNI decision,&rdquo; said the former senior intelligence official. 'It is reflective of a new world order where we don't have absolute trust and you do need to be able to build coalitions&hellip; Alliances, friendships have always been one of the real elements of our strength. And it's imperiled.&rdquo; Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a former CIA officer, echoed this sentiment on MSNBC on Thursday. 'The idea that someone who has aligned herself with and defended Vladimir Putin could potentially have information related to the sources and methods of how it is that we knew that Russia was going to have invaded Ukraine&hellip;helps illuminate why this is so extraordinarily dangerous.&rdquo; Because of her past statements, intelligence professionals are also worried that she could alter analysis to fit a political narrative, which would leave the president or the public in the dark about key threats. Said the current intelligence official: 'Intelligence is conducted in the service of the nation, without regard for political parties or motives, and we are typically the bearers of bad news. Will she champion the professionalism and apolitical nature of what we gather and assess, and speak truth to power, or disregard our work to convey what power wants to hear?&rdquo; Gabbard may also face an additional challenge when building trust within the community: The Trump administration decided to forgo the traditional FBI vetting of nominees to top posts, including Gabbard, CNN reported Friday.

The D Brief: Austin to the Pacific; North Korean drones; Reformin...	SecDef Austin's last Pacific swing. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin took off this morning for his 12th and presumably final trip as U.S. defense secretary to the Asia-Pacific region. It starts with a visit to Darwin, Australia, for a trilateral meeting with Australian and Japanese officials&mdash;the latter of whom is expected to announce that Japan will start to integrate forces into U.S.-Australian exercises held by Marine Rotational Force-Darwin, senior defense officials said. Then it's over to the Philippines to meet President Bongbong Marcos and Secretary of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro and mark the opening of a new U.S.-funded intel fusion center. Next is a visit to Laos for the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus, a meeting that every U.S. defense secretary has attended since its inception in 2010, and finally to Fiji, to kick off negotiations for a status-of-forces agreement intended to lay the foundation for more defense cooperation. D Brief-er Bradley Peniston is traveling with the SecDef; stay tuned for more coverage. North Korea has ordered 'full-scale mass production&rdquo; of so-called 'suicide attack drones,&rdquo; state run media KCNA reported Friday. The country's dictator Kim Jong-un called the drones 'an essential requirement in military aspects&rdquo; and said North Korean production facilities have the 'potentiality to produce and introduce various types of drones&rdquo; in the months ahead. At least three different kinds of North Korean drones were demonstrated Thursday, according to selectively blurry photos posted at the Pyongyang Times. One was a smaller fixed-wing drone; another was a larger model similar in appearance to Russia's Ranchet 3; and the third, larger one was reportedly designed for long-range strikes, one South Korea-based analyst told the Wall Street Journal. Rewind: 'In July 2023, North Korea unveiled two types of new reconnaissance and multi-purpose attack drones at an arms exhibition and a military parade,&rdquo; South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. 'The North also sent five drones across the border with South Korea in December 2022, with one of them penetrating a no-fly zone close to Seoul's presidential office.&rdquo; From the region: 'Taiwan president plans Hawaii visit on sensitive trip to Pacific, sources say,&rdquo; Reuters reported Friday; 'Beijing is already preparing to retaliate in a second Trump era,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Friday; 'China Coped With Trump's First Trade War. A Second One Will Be Tougher,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Friday; 'Trump's &lsquo;America First' foreign policy will accelerate China's push for global leadership,&rdquo; William Matthews of Chatham House argued in an essay published Thursday; And 'Ex-Trump envoy on N. Korea says Kim Jong-un won't negotiate denuclearization,&rdquo; Yonhap reported Friday from Seoul. And ICYMI: U.S. authorities uncovered 'a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign&rdquo; carried out by China-affiliated actors, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement Wednesday. The operation hit 'multiple telecommunications companies&rdquo; and 'enable[d] the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals who are primarily involved in government or political activity, and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,&rdquo; according to the statement. That latter detail could refer to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which allows U.S. authorities to spy on the communications of individuals suspected of working for a foreign country. 'We expect our understanding of these compromises to grow as the investigation continues,&rdquo; the FBI and CISA said. Developing: CISA is under threat under new Republican leadership. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, who is about to take over as the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, which oversees CISA, told Politico he would like to 'eliminate&rdquo; it due to the work they do calling out foreign election interference particularly from Russia. You may recall President-elect Donald Trump clashed with CISA over its monitoring of the 2020 election. (CISA has said both the 2020 and 2024 elections were secure, despite foreign influence efforts.) While Trump can't just close CISA outright, Democratic lawmakers are reportedly worried he could weaken it through staffing decisions.

On this day in 2012, Xi Jinping took office as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, beginning what has since become at least 12 years of consecutive rule. The long-rumored prospect of a future U.S.-China war has prompted Air Force officials to change how they buy weapons, and that is driving defense companies to pursue new ways of making money, Defense One's Audrey Decker reported Thursday. Since the U.S. military will need to operate thousands of connected systems across vast distances in a Pacific conflict, those dynamics are posing new challenges for the Pentagon's acquisition community, Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said at an event hosted Wednesday by Defense One in Washington. For example, the service is investing in the mission systems of an aircraft or platform first, and building direct relationships with suppliers instead of working through the major defense companies to manage suppliers. This means prime contractors, who have historically profited from controlling the entire architecture, are having to relinquish some control, Decker writes. Consider: 'Every time we persuade ourselves that, Hey, we found a program [where] the risk is actually so small that we can probably use fixed price contracting here, even during the development phase, we end up finding risks we didn't appreciate,&rdquo; Hunter said. He pointed to two Boeing programs where the service massively underestimated development risks: the T-7 trainer and the KC-46 tanker. Both fixed-price contracts resulted in huge losses for Boeing and delayed capability for the Air Force. Continue reading, here. Suicides across the Army, Navy, and Air Force continued to rise in 2023, according to the latest annual report (PDF) published Thursday by the Defense Department. During that 12-month period, '523 Service members died by suicide, which is more than the previous year (493),&rdquo; the Pentagon said. That included 363 on the active duty side; 69 in the Reserves; and 91 among the National Guard. 'Young enlisted males accounted for the largest number of suicide deaths,&rdquo; and they most often used a firearm in the completed act, which is consistent with prior years, according to the report (poisoning is the most common way service members attempt suicide). The highest rates were among men under the age of 30; and overall, more than 9 out of 10 who died from suicide were men compared to less than 7% for females. While the Marine Corps' suicide rate did not rise in 2023, the service still has the highest rate among all the branches, U.S. Naval Institute News reports with accompanying slide data. However, 'In short-term comparisons, between 2023 and 2022, no service was found to have had a statistically significant difference in suicide rates,&rdquo; the report's authors write. The Associated Press has more.

DHS releases guidance for AI in critical infrastructure	The Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new series of recommendations for the safe use of artificial intelligence tools in U.S. critical infrastructure, breaking down flexible guidance by each sector included in the broader AI supply chain. Unveiled on Thursday, the Roles and Responsibilities Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Critical Infrastructure &mdash; created in consultation with Homeland's internal Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board &mdash; tailors recommended actions to specific sectors key to the AI industry. These include cloud and compute infrastructure providers, AI developers, critical infrastructure owners and operators, civil society and public sector entities. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this guidance is 'groundbreaking&rdquo; in regards to being the first such document that was created through 'extensive collaboration&rdquo; with a board that included AI developers themselves to help civil society responsibly deploy these softwares. 'The framework, if widely adopted, will go a long way to better ensure the safety and security of critical services that deliver clean water, consistent power, internet access and so much more,&rdquo; Mayorkas said during a Thursday press call. 'It is, quite frankly, exceedingly rare to have leading AI developers engaged directly with civil society on issues that are at the forefront of today's AI debates, and [it] presents such a collaborative framework.&rdquo; He added that the framework acts as a new model of shared responsibility and governance to safeguard critical infrastructure with AI technologies. The report goes on to identify specific recommendations that every individual stakeholder can adopt within their existing AI governance protocols. 'It is descriptive and not prescriptive,&rdquo; Mayorkas said. 'The evolution of the technology is still rapidly advancing, and to be particularly prescriptive would not necessarily capture that evolution. And we intend the framework to be, frankly, a living document and to change as developments in the industry change as well.&rdquo; The voluntary guidance for stakeholders working at the intersection of AI and critical infrastructure includes five steps: securing environments, driving responsible model design, implementing data governance, ensuring safe and secure deployment and monitoring performance and impact. Different stakeholders will have different tasks within these steps. An AI software developer, for example, would be responsible for managing access to models and data to secure a given environment, whereas a critical infrastructure owner and operator would be responsible for securing existing IT infrastructure. Given that the report's contents are voluntary, Mayorkas noted that he expects board members to help evangelize the guidance into practice across their industries, especially ahead of an incoming Trump administration that stands to change current tech and AI policy. 'There is a great push for the promulgation of regulations, the enactment of legislation in the AI sphere,&rdquo; he said. 'We are leading the world in innovation in AI and broader technologies and this framework, if, in fact, adopted and implemented as broadly as we envision it will be &ndash;&ndash; and the board members envision it should be &ndash;&ndash; will and could ward off precipitous regulation, legislation that that does not move at the speed of business and debt and does not embrace and support our innovative leadership.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/dhs-releases-guidance-ai-critical-infrastructure/401066/	2024-11-14T16:17:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/14/111424cityNG-1/large.jpg
How the Air Force is revamping acquisition to prepare for a Pacif...	The prospect of a fight with China has prompted the U.S. Air Force to change how it buys weapons&mdash;driving defense companies to pursue new ways of making money. The military will need to operate thousands of connected systems across vast distances if war breaks out in the Pacific, which poses new challenges for the Pentagon's acquisition community, Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said at Defense One's State of Defense Business event. 'If you think of the typical acquisition approach: cost, schedule, performance; see the fighter, buy the fighter, operate the fighter. This is more complicated than that. It's about how these things interact together effectively to achieve a warfighting outcome in a particular mission. So we've tried to engineer our acquisition tool set, which is not radically different from tools of the past, but to solve this particular problem, which is our pacing challenge,&rdquo; Hunter said. To do this, the service is investing in the mission systems of an aircraft or platform first, and building direct relationships with suppliers instead of working through the major defense companies to manage suppliers. This means prime contractors, who have historically profited from controlling the entire architecture, are having to relinquish some control. The Air Force still needs traditional defense primes to integrate the systems on a platform, Hunter said, but future money will flow to those who have the 'best of breed in missions systems,&rdquo; in addition to integration work. 'Now they're things that [traditional defense primes] would have thought of as their competitor's systems, there's more opportunity for them in that space as well. More competition. And then for the smaller providers, an opportunity to get in the game more easily and to have a direct relationship&hellip;with the government, and that is crucial, to have that engagement with the mission system providers as well,&rdquo; Hunter said. [[Related Posts]] Hunter pointed to the collaborative combat aircraft program as an example of their new approach to acquisition. The program was set up to allow companies to bid on future tranches if they miss out on the first one, creating a more dynamic relationship with industry. The service has also learned, through trial and error, that putting all of the risk on industry in the development stage of programs drives companies to ignore potential risks, which can hurt the service down the line, he said. 'Every time we persuade ourselves that, Hey, we found a program [where] the risk is actually so small that we can probably use fixed price contracting here, even during the development phase, we end up finding risks we didn't appreciate,&rdquo; Hunter said. He pointed to two Boeing programs where the service massively underestimated development risks: the T-7 trainer and the KC-46 tanker. Both fixed-price contracts resulted in huge losses for Boeing and delayed capability for the Air Force. Hunter remained fairly confident that Boeing will be able to turn things around, despite the company's defense arm bleeding billions and a recently concluded seven-week strike that put near-term deliveries on hold. 'I am confident that Boeing can still deliver quality aircraft. I think the record shows that &lsquo;on time' has been a bit of a question mark in recent years, and we'd like to see them get back there,&rdquo; Hunter said. While Boeing is still behind on a few programs, when they do deliver, they're 'effective combat aircraft,&rdquo; Hunter said, so the engineering talent is 'very much still there.&rdquo; The Pentagon needs a healthy industrial base that makes a profit, Hunter said, because without that, companies won't be able to retain a talented workforce. 'We need the best of the best, because the things that we're doing are really hard. So it's in our interest for industry to be profitable within reasonable bounds. And I think by and large, we achieve that, and we need to be careful not to push an industry to a place where they are unprofitable, unattractive to capital, and unattractive to human talent,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/how-air-force-revamping-acquisition-prepare-pacific-fight/401060/	2024-11-14T16:13:19-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/14/8217842/large.jpg
The D Brief: Trump’s DNI, AG picks; China’s improved bomber; USAF...	Trump's cabinet of loyalists, cont. Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence. A former Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, Tulsi Gabbard served as a Democratic U.S. representative from Hawaii for eight years, during which she criticized then-President Donald Trump for his approach to the Middle East and other matters. She ran for president, withdrew, and endorsed Joe Biden. But she subsequently switched to the Republican Party, denouncing her former colleagues as an 'elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness,&rdquo; and endorsed Donald Trump for a second presidential term. On Wednesday, the president-elect announced that he intends to nominate her to lead the nation's intelligence community. Gabbard, 43, has no direct experience in intelligence work, nor in running large organizations, and has held no senior government roles. She served two years on the House Committee on Homeland Security. She has been noted for speeches and social-media posts that align with Russian propaganda and espouse conspiracy theories. Also: Gaetz for AG. Trump on Wednesday also nominated Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz to be Attorney General. Gaetz, 42, is a relatively young but seasoned GOP operative, and the son of a prominent Florida politician Don Gaetz, who is likewise the son of former North Dakota Republican Jerry Gaetz. Rep. Matt Gaetz's Florida district spans the state's western panhandle, which includes the seaport of Pensacola. Gaetz has represented Florida's first congressional district since 2017. He's since risen among Republicans as a particularly rancorous lawmaker&mdash;the New York Times describes him as a 'right-wing provocateur&rdquo;&mdash;so much so that former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blamed for costing him his speakership role in October 2023. Another thing: As the Pensacola News Journal reminded readers, Gaetz is 'the subject of an ongoing Conservative-led House Ethics Committee investigation regarding sexual misconduct allegations&rdquo; as well as alleged illicit drug use. The Times reports that the investigative work concluded in 2023, but the findings were never released publicly. Gaetz's nomination Wednesday came just two days before the House Ethics Committee was set to vote on making that report public, Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News reported Wednesday evening. Shortly Trump nominated Gaetz, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the congressman had resigned&mdash;which means the House Ethics Committee no longer has jurisdiction over his actions, effectively ending the investigations. According to Trump, 'Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.&rdquo; 'Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,&rdquo; Trump wrote in a statement Wednesday. 'Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.&rdquo; For what it's worth: 'Gaetz is married to Ginger Luckey, the sister of Oculus V.R. founder Palmer Luckey,&rdquo; the Pensacola News Journal reports. Palmer Luckey founded the defense startup Anduril, which has been working hard lately to diversify its drone offerings for Pentagon contracts, as Defense One has covered extensively. The idea of Gaetz as AG came up 'just hours before it was announced,&rdquo; Politico reports. 'It was hatched aboard Trump's airplane en route to Washington, on which Gaetz was a passenger,&rdquo; according to Playbook, which poses four related questions about the nomination, including, 'Can Gaetz actually get the Senate votes to be confirmed?&rdquo; It's obviously too soon to know; but 'Republicans will have a three-seat majority&rdquo; in the Senate, 'so if four senators bounce, it's a wrap&rdquo; and Gaetz won't be confirmed. But that's a long way off right now.

Ukraine developments Update: The U.S. defense industrial base is now cranking out 50,000 or so 155mm artillery rounds each month, and will allegedly be able to double that rate sometime next year, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante said at an event hosted by Axios Wednesday in Washington. Similar advances could be made in the Patriot missile defense interceptor production line, he argued. His advice: Appropriate more for production in the U.S. industrial base. 'We still have situations where, at the end of the budget, to balance the budget people lower production numbers, because that's where the money is. We have to stop that,&rdquo; LaPlante said.

Military bases can use private 5G networks, Pentagon says	The Defense Department has released a new strategy document that gives global military installations the ability to use private 5G networks if such solutions best meet their mission needs. The Pentagon's private 5G deployment strategy, which was signed on Oct. 16 and publicly released on Tuesday, outlined the operational requirements that must be met for DOD bases to embrace private networks instead of commercial high-speed solutions. In a forward to the guidance, DOD Acting Chief Information Officer Leslie Beavers called the new document an addendum to the department's 5G strategy and implementation plan that were released in 2020. That previously issued guidance outlined the need for DOD to leverage the use of 'private, hybrid and public 5G networks' to enhance its operational and data-sharing capabilities across the globe. Beavers said DOD 'will leverage commercial networks to the maximum extent possible,&rdquo; but added that the department 'acknowledges that under certain circumstances, commercial networks may not fulfill an installation's requirements.&rdquo; In a Tuesday press release announcing the strategy, DOD also said it anticipates most military installations will use commercial networks but that private 5G solutions 'may augment or supplement commercial services because they are tailored to each installation's mission needs, security and military-unique capabilities.&rdquo; The document outlined three strategic objectives when it comes to deploying private 5G capabilities, including: aligning 5G networks with each military installation's unique needs; accelerating DOD's 'acquisition, development and secure deployment of 5G;&rdquo; and expanding an Open Radio Access Network &mdash; or Open RAN &mdash; ecosystem, which helps enhance interoperability between multiple capabilities. The strategy said DOD should incorporate Open RAN solutions 'in both commercial and government-owned models unless there are specific operational, technical or business concerns that make this approach impractical or cost prohibitive.&rdquo; The Pentagon has been working to adopt and deploy 5G that can offer warfighters the secure broadband capabilities needed to complete their missions, including through its combined joint all-domain command and control initiative. Known as CJADC2, the approach is designed to enhance communication across disparate military environments. The release of the private 5G deployment strategy comes after the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the Pentagon develop guidance for deploying 5G networks across DOD installations. The department said it will roll out additional implementation documents 'in the coming months&rdquo; to further guide the military's implementation of both private and commercial 5G networks.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/dod-issues-private-5g-deployment-guide-military-bases/401032/	2024-11-13T15:52:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/13/1113245GNG-1/large.jpg
Air Force ordering more robot wingmen for its experimentation uni...	The Air Force is buying more drones for its collaborative combat aircraft experimentation unit in Nevada to test out how the service will use these robot wingmen in a potential fight. 'One thing that I recently did was approve some additional CCA purchases to equip the experimental operations unit in order to enable that experimentation to happen using real assets,&rdquo; Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said today at Defense One's State of Defense Business event. The service will buy additional prototypes from both vendors building 'increment one&rdquo; CCAs&mdash;General Atomics and Anduril&mdash;for the experimental operations unit, Hunter said. The service has been setting up the unit at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to test how it might use CCAs in operations and how the drones will pair with manned fighters. Hunter did not say how many drones the service will buy, or when these test assets will get to the Nevada unit. The additional buy will help 'ensure that warfighters will have ample opportunity for experimentation to support operational fielding before the end of the decade,&rdquo; Diem Salmon, Anduril's vice president for air dominance and strike, said in a statement. [[Related Posts]] The experimental operations unit will help the Air Force build trust with the autonomous fighters, and formulate tactics, techniques, and procedures, said General Atomics spokesman C. Mark Brinkley. 'Supplying them with actual CCAs is an important step to that. We're happy to support them in any way,&rdquo; Brinkley said. Both companies' CCA designs recently cleared a key milestone, called critical design review, Col. Timothy Helfrich, senior materiel leader for the advanced aircraft division at Air Force Materiel Command said today at the Mitchell Institute's Airpower Futures Forum. The service has been able to keep the program on track by stopping when it's 'good enough,&rdquo; Helfrich said, instead of going after a highly exquisite system. 'If we are to continue to add capability and gold plate things, we're going to miss out on our costs and most importantly our schedule targets. And so making some of those tough trades. To say this is good enough and moving on has been a challenge, because we want a lot, but we are making those decisions,&rdquo; Helfrich said. General Atomics and Anduril expect to fly their drone offerings sometime next year, after which service officials will decide whether to build one or both of the companies' offerings in increment one. This decision hinges on first flight&mdash;but also each company's production capability, Hunter said. 'It's the approach to production, right? It's the people demonstrating that they can scale to the rates that we envision for this platform and that are necessary for it to be affordable mass. So I think both vendors have an opportunity to succeed, and it is entirely conceivable that we could move forward with both,&rdquo; Hunter said. The Air Force has emphasized that CCAs need to be cheap enough to buy en masse, and while service officials haven't disclosed the exact price, Hunter reiterated that a CCA will be a fraction of the cost of an F-35 fighter jet, and that he's 'feeling good&rdquo; about the figure they reached. Along with CCAs, the Air Force is devising plans for two key modernization programs: a sixth-generation fighter jet, called Next Generation Air Dominance, and a next-generation tanker. The designs of all three new programs are tied together, both from an operational and cost perspective. But, there's not enough money to pursue all three programs as the plans stand today, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said recently. Kendall's comments were a signal to the acquisition community to focus on affordability from the start, Hunter said, which is why the service baked affordability into its approach to CCAs. 'We need to be doing that with all of our programs. We need to do it with the Next Generation Air Refueling System, the NGAS program. We need to do it with our solution for our air dominance going forward. Affordability has to be a key component,&rdquo; Hunter said. All of these modernization plans will likely change under a Trump presidency, but asked about how the service will fare under the new administration, Hunter didn't say much. 'A lot depends on what is the strategy that the incoming administration adopts, and I'll be looking to see that as well as the rest of you. I think if the strategy remains similar, I think you're going to see that Air Force systems are well designed to address the challenges of the strategy,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/air-force-ordering-more-robot-wingmen-its-experimentation-unit/401030/	2024-11-13T15:37:42-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/13/7668885/large.jpg
