This ‘cloud in a box’ could save Air Force maintainers years of p...	Every time a KC-135 lands, it's greeted by a swarm of maintainers armed with three-ring binders and stacks of paper forms, sometimes tablets or laptops&mdash;all necessary to determine and document the plane's readiness to fly again. Converting that information into a readable format to update commanders can take 14 hours. To shrink that turnaround time, the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office is developing a prototyped 'cloud in a box&rdquo;&mdash;a portable data and compute center that can effectively hold the maintenance records of every aircraft the service has in a container the size of a window A/C unit. 'The goal is digitizing the flight line,&rdquo; Col. Nathan Stuckey, military department program executive officer at the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office, told Defense One. 'Having that maintainer, having that digital assistance &hellip; to help them maintain and repair our aircraft.&rdquo; The product hits a trifecta: it's a digital, cloud-based dashboard that displays maintenance data from disparate systems, a ruggedized box with compute and storage, and it offers the ability to access everything from a mobile device. Users can also load the cloud-based platform onto the box, called Google Distributed Air-Gapped Appliance, which can operate even when disconnected from networks. By teaming up with Google, the Air Force designed 'a marketplace of data input and output&rdquo; from several systems with 'real time readiness reporting&rdquo; so the data never needs to be manually re-entered at a workstation, said Josh Marcuse, director of strategic initiatives at Google Public Sector. And the system doesn't have to be hooked up to the internet to function. 'We have to have systems that will still work when our networks are attacked,&rdquo; Stuckey said. 'If you're in the Pacific trying to fix an airplane and your location loses all internet connectivity, this system's still got to work.&rdquo; Maintainers will be able to do their work and then reconnect the box to the network to update headquarters with essential mission data, like parts that are needed, which is available in seconds instead of hours. Less important information, like a video to assist in a repair, are deprioritized, Stuckey said. 'Information that higher headquarters needs to plan the fight, know what aircraft are available. That kind of data can be prioritized, so the second you get that connection, it's immediately seen by higher level. If it is lower priority data, you know, that might take a little bit &hellip; to see, but we're doing it in such a way that the most important data is available immediately,&rdquo; Stuckey said. The other feature with potential to change how maintainers work is the ability to securely connect with personal devices, Stuckey said. 'During a demo, I was able to use my personal phone and log into the device and get that dashboard. And that's the way. The vision is that a maintainer will be able to use their mobile devices, tablets, phones, to be able to access what they need at their fingertips.&rdquo; Current demonstrations of the 'cloud in a box&rdquo; have been limited to a handful or users over a handful of days. But the goal is for the tech to be a trusty digital assistant for maintainers, starting with select units. The plan is to launch the prototype at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev. and Minot Air Force Base, S.D. and do initial concept work in the coming months. But Stuckey was hesitant to give a more specific timeline because the product is going through the Defense Department's cybersecurity certification process, called authority to operate. 'We're in a state where getting those approvals is very soon&hellip;we're starting to talk months instead of years on when we're ready to go live&rdquo; with the first and then expanded demonstrations, Stuckey said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/cloud-box-could-save-air-force-maintainers-years-paperwork/399722/	2024-09-20T15:36:52-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/20/Screenshot_2024_09_20_at_12.34.27PM/large.png
Protest puts US Army’s $990M loitering-munition contract on hold	The U.S. Army has stopped work on an up-to-$990 million contract to buy AeroVironment Switchblade loitering munitions after a second company lodged a protest, according to an AeroVironment filing published Monday. The U.S. Government Accountability Office is to issue a decision on the protest by Dec. 16. It is not publicly known who filed the protest. The Army awarded AeroVironment the five-year, sole-source contract on Aug. 27 to fill a need for 'organic, stand-off capability to dismounted infantry formations capable of destroying tanks, light armored vehicles, hardened targets, defilade and personnel targets.&rdquo; At the time, AeroVironment said it would begin filling the order for Switchblades within months. In a research note cited by MarketWatch, analysts at William Blair wrote that the original contract winner generally retains 95 percent of these types of protests. The award serves the Army's lethal unmanned systems, or LUS, requirement, according to AeroVironment. More specifically, it is part of the Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance, or LASSO, program, which seeks to supply infantry brigade combat teams with loitering munitions to take out tanks, an Army spokesperson told Janes. Switchblades are used by, among others, newly created units in the 101st Airborne's second brigade such as the LUS platoon and the Multi-Functional Reconnaissance Company. The United States has also sent AeroVironment's Switchblade 300 and 600 systems to Ukraine. The larger Switchblade 600 is designed to take out hardened targets, like tanks. In May, the Defense Department announced that it would 'accelerate fielding&rdquo; of the Switchblade 600 to U.S. troops under the Replicator program. The program is an effort to field multiple thousands of affordable autonomous systems such as drones by August 2025. 'U.S.-supplied Switchblade drones have already demonstrated their utility in Ukraine, and this system will provide additional capability to U.S. forces,&rdquo; the Defense Department said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/protest-puts-us-armys-990m-loitering-munition-contract-hold/399708/	2024-09-20T10:37:15-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/20/Marine_Corps_Lance_C_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: Israel, Hezbollah exchange fire; Exploding pagers’ s...	After suffering two major device attacks this week, Hezbollah terrorists attacked northern Israel with 140 rockets on Friday&mdash;while Israeli jets targeted a Hezbollah leader again in Beirut, AP and Reuters report from the city formerly known as the Paris of the Middle East. '​​120 missiles were launched at areas of the Golan Heights, Safed and the Upper Galilee,&rdquo; while '20 missiles were shot at the areas of Meron and Netua,&rdquo; according to the Israeli military, which didn't say whether the attack caused any casualties. As for the Beirut strike, at least three people were killed and 17 others wounded in the city's southern suburbs, AP reports. Among those reportedly killed: Ibrahim Aqil, who 'commanded Hezbollah's operations in Syria for years and built a tight-knit operational relationship with Russia's Spetsnaz,&rdquo; said Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute. He was allegedly 'killed alongside members of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit as they were holding a meeting,&rdquo; according to a Reuters spot report. Update: Israeli intelligence officials made the pagers that detonated across Lebanon and Syria, killing more than a dozen people and wounding more than 2,700 others on Tuesday, the New York Times reported late Wednesday, citing '12 current and former defense and intelligence officials.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Hezbollah handed out pagers hours before blasts - even after checks,&rdquo; Reuters reported separately.

Air Force braces for new nuclear-war scenarios	The Air Force is planning a tabletop exercise to gauge U.S. readiness to react to a wide spectrum of nuclear-related scenarios, part of a larger effort to prepare for them, a service leader said on Wednesday. 'What if, God forbid, there was a low-yield [nuclear weapon] use in Europe tomorrow?&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Andrew J. Gebara, deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration, said at the Air & Space Forces Association conference outside Washington, D.C. 'Or what if there was a demonstration of nuclear use, or a nuclear test? What if we had to adapt the INDOPACOM regional fight because a nuclear power had a red line [that meant] we couldn't fly in certain areas? 'These are the kind of things that our warfighters need to understand from the beginning. It doesn't need to be just at the presidential level with no other discussion,&rdquo; Gebara said. That represents a big change in the way the military has historically talked about the possibility of nuclear war. It used to be that intelligence or analysis about the effects of such weapons on a given conflict was held at the highest possible, 'strategic&rdquo; level. That was a reflection of the times, when two great powers were engaged in a largely conventional arms race with knowable 'rules&rdquo; or at least principles of play. That doesn't represent the modern role of nuclear weapons in conflict, which may include far more players and means of delivery of nuclear effects. 'When I was younger, at the end of the Cold War, the biggest threat we had was no-notice-1,000 ICBMs just coming over the North Pole, and how would you handle that?&rdquo; Gebara said. 'That's horrific to even think about. But it's actually a pretty simple tactical problem. There's only a couple things you can do with something that bad.&rdquo; Today, ICBMs look quaint compared to new types of missiles and weapons that can deliver nuclear effects, including some that don't even appear to be weapons at first. If the Soviet Union's 100-megaton Tsar Bomba was the epitome of the Cold War arms race, the new race is best represented by the lower-yield 'tactical&rdquo; nuclear weapons that Russia has threatened to unleash on Ukraine or, possibly, in space. Gerbera said weapons instructors at Nevada's Nellis Air Force Base are already teaching these kinds of lessons to more pilots. 'So what does it mean if you're flying through this area and there's a radiological threat? What's it mean for the airplane?&rdquo; he said. Now, Gebara said, he's working to broaden training for such scenarios across the Air Force. 'I think at all levels we need to build that experience, not just at the tactical level and not just at the strategic,&rdquo; he said. The results of the tabletop exercise, which is slated for later this month, will be briefed at a CORONA commanders conference.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/air-force-braces-new-nuclear-war-scenarios/399693/	2024-09-19T16:09:33-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/19/GettyImages_dv1282003/large.jpg

Army embraces Ukraine-style warfare with new all-drone unit	FORT JOHNSON, Louisiana&mdash;Staff Sgt. David Meyer peered intently into the screen of his hand-held drone controller, sweat slowly beading through his face paint in the 100-degree heat. Somewhere below his quadcopter, an allied unit was under attack by Geronimo, the highly skilled force that plays the enemy in weeks-long wargames at the U.S. Army's Joint Readiness Training Center here. Meyer suspected the Geronimo troops of trying to trick his side into burning through its ammo. Then they'd melt back into the forest to strike again elsewhere. It's the sort of game that comes naturally to Geronimo, whose home-team status gives them an unmatched knowledge of the training area's 250,000 acres of pine forest. This time, they may have underestimated their opponent. Meyer was part of the new Lethal Unmanned Systems platoon, one of the Army's first formations dedicated entirely to operating short-range reconnaissance drones. If Meyer's drones could find Geronimo, they could bring the fire of an attached platoon of 81mm mortars and turn Geronimo's raid into a disaster. All Meyer had to do was find them. The LUS platoon In mid-August, Defense One spent an afternoon with LUS soldiers as they fought Geronimo. Soldiers explained how the unit is structured, what was working&mdash;and what could be improved. The soldiers are members of the 101st Airborne's second brigade, which had traveled to JRTC to test the Army's 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; initiative. Under the effort, the Army is fielding new equipment to the 101st Airborne's second brigade, the 10th Mountain Division's third brigade, and the 25th Infantry Division's second Brigade. Soldiers are responsible for giving feedback and working out on new doctrine in conditions as close as possible to actual war. The LUS platoon sits within the Multi-Purpose Company, or MPC, itself a new formation launched this April. The MPC's four platoons&mdash;scout, mortar, anti-tank, and LUS&mdash;replace the old heavy weapons companies, which were downgraded to platoons in February. Nine of the LUS platoon's 21 soldiers fly drones, including Meyer and platoon leader 1st. Lt. Jahmir King. The rest are air defenders who use a mix of anti-aircraft weapons like Stinger missiles and counter-drone weapons, including the Bal Chatri drone detector, Dronebuster jamming rifle, and Modi electronic warfare system. Just as in Ukraine, their drones are meant primarily to help spot enemy forces, and, if possible, coordinate indirect fire. But unlike the Ukrainians, the LUS drone operators cannot directly stream their video to other soldiers. Instead, they must rely on an attached fire control officer to radio to the mortar section where they are seeing the rounds land. Similarly, LUS soldiers must upload data to battle-management systems to share it with commanders, in contrast to the banks of live drone video feeds that Ukrainian commanders use to survey the battlefield. But the operators do have some ability to strike enemies themselves. Some of the drones can be rigged to drop munitions, and soldiers are trained to fly Switchblade loitering munitions systems. The unit was not practicing with the Switchblades at JRTC. The unit can also use their drones for route reconnaissance, said MPC commander Captain Phil Tateyama. If the unit wants to quickly clear an area, a drone operator will fly a drone just ahead of the moving vehicle. The platoon also carries a drone-borne electronic detection unit built on an ultracheap Raspberry Pi computer that can sniff for WiFi connections. To operate it, they'd temporarily brought along an Army cyber soldier. The counter-drone unit, meanwhile, serves as a mobile defense force that can be split out as needed, with some members defending the command post and others assigned to the mortars, according to Tateyama and King. Drones, lots of drones The unit's seven drone operators carry about five extra drones, but King said many more might be required in an actual war. In realistic training operations, such as the one they were on, he expected to have at least one drone down due to mechanical or other failures every other day. Combat operations would likely increase that rate, he said. 'We're going to start losing them, and then we're out of a job,&rdquo; said King. The unit operates Parrot, Skydio, and Vesper drones, all small short-range systems with a flight time of under an hour. King said such systems could fly only one to three kilometers out before losing signal in the dense vegetation of Fort Johnson. That meant the team had to be relatively close to the front line, placing them in easy range of Geronimo's artillery and even their infantry. Eventually, King and Tateyama said, they hope to equip the unit with medium-range drones like the C100. Smaller drones would then be assigned to the reconnaissance unit. Tateyama said those drones should most likely be operated by an experienced LUS member detailed to the recon unit. King said they could move up to operating first-person-view drones &mdash; hobbyist racing drones that Ukraine uses for pinpoint strikes&mdash;although he added that the weeks of training necessary made it harder to employ such drones. King said Skydio and Parrot drones performed well, with soldiers favoring the latter for its ability to identify the specific map coordinates of whatever object it looked at, which was useful for artillery coordination. A mechanical problem, however, meant that soldiers had not brought along the Parrot. Drone soldiers In contrast to previous Army drone operations, all of the LUS soldiers are infantrymen, rather than specialist operators. 'If you can drive semi-decent in [Grand Theft Auto],&rdquo; then you can fly, said one soldier. To hone their skills, the unit practices drone operations on a special course back at Fort Campbell, their home base. Soldiers also receive some training to recognize enemy vehicles, said King. Some features on the drone also help, such the Parrot's ability to pinpoint the hottest parts of whatever it's looking at. Using this feature, soldiers can easily identify exhaust pipes, thereby discovering vehicles. Besides flying and processing drone footage, soldiers are also expected to keep the drones charged. Battery management in particular is a major concern in planning, said King. 'That's what it's about: how long can we stay on the objective.&rdquo; One soldier said he kept extra batteries in the pouch typically used for dumping spent rifle magazines. On top of all that, soldiers must also pull security. Ideally, King said he'd like to see three to four soldiers assigned to flying, data management, and security, for a maximum of 12 soldiers versus the seven they have now. Hunting Geronimo Back at the screen, Mayer soon ran into difficulty. In the sweltering heat of the Lousianna pine forest, the drone's already limited batteries were eking out just 20 minutes of flight time&mdash;including only a few minutes over the objective. To maximize coverage, the unit kept a fresh drone ready to go when one returned. But flight-safety rules forbid operating two drones at once. As drone after drone buzzed into the sky, hope started to fade. For a brief moment, Meyer's screen showed a Geronimo truck driving along the road&mdash;but then lost it. Somewhere out there, Geronimo was still lurking, hidden beneath trees or simply beyond the range of the LUS platoon's drone. They'd gotten away, if only for the moment.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/army-embraces-ukraine-style-warfare-new-all-drone-unit/399679/	2024-09-19T12:55:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/19/Staff_Sgt._David_Mey_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: More device detonations; House rejects CR plan; Firs...	Walkie-talkies exploded across Lebanon Wednesday, killing another 25 people and wounding at least 600 others just one day after pagers exploded across the region, killing a dozen and wounding more than 2,000 people, the Associated Press reports. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah spoke publicly Thursday for the first time since the attacks were launched, telling supporters and Israeli officials listening, 'This is sheer terrorism. We'll call them Tuesday's massacre and Wednesday's massacre. These are war crimes or at least declaration of war,&rdquo; said the leader of the U.S.-designated terrorist group. About the Tuesday attack, Nasrallah claimed Thursday, 'A number of pagers were out of service or switched off. Some were not allocated and still in storage.&rdquo; Update: 37 of Hezbollah's fighters have been killed in the past 48 hours, including three from Israeli airstrikes, Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute reports. IDF reax: 'For decades, Hezbollah has weaponized civilian homes, dug tunnels beneath them, and used civilians as human shields &mdash; having turned southern Lebanon into a war zone,&rdquo; the Israeli military said in a statement Thursday. ICYMI: 'I believe that we are at the onset of a new phase in this war, and we need to adapt,&rdquo; Israeli military chief Yoav Gallant said in a statement Wednesday. By the way: Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin spoke with Gallant Wednesday to 'review regional security developments,&rdquo; to 'reiterate unwavering U.S. support for Israel,&rdquo; and to reaffirm 'the priority of achieving a Gaza ceasefire deal&rdquo; and an 'enduring diplomatic resolution to the conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border,&rdquo; according to a Pentagon readout. Expert reax: The exploding device operations are 'likely to damage Hezbollah's morale, and many fighters and collaborators will have been put out of action for some time due to their injuries,&rdquo; said Luca Trenta, associate professor in International Relations at Swansea University in Wales, writing Wednesday for the Royal United Services Institute. 'Israel has increasingly shown a tendency to escalate the fighting, bringing the region to the precipice of a wider war,&rdquo; he added. Former NSA Director Nakasone: The pager and walkie-talkie attack perpetrators 'had incredible ability to do targeting intelligence and to be able to actually know the numbers, know who's got them, know the periodicity upon which they're using them,&rdquo; said Paul Nakasone, former director of the National Security Agency and commander of U.S. Cyber Command, said Wednesday at a news conference in Nashville.

Making moves: Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper has joined the team of consultants at Squire Patton Boggs international law firm. He'll serve as a senior advisor with a portfolio spanning national security, domestic and foreign policy issues, the firm announced Thursday. Rewind: Esper was former President Trump's longest-serving Pentagon chief at 16 months on the job until he was fired in November 2020&mdash;five months after U.S. marshals and prison security forces were sent to Washington in a heavy-handed response to peaceful protests related to the police killing of George Floyd. In early June, Esper was filmed walking with Trump and then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Army Gen. Mark Milley across Washington's Lafayette Square for a photo op after authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to remove peaceful protesters. Two days later, Esper publicly broke with Trump and told reporters the Insurrection Act did not need to be invoked yet and active duty troops should not be used to suppress protests, as Trump had suggested. Esper's reaction rattled Trump, but the president waited until the week after Election Day 2020 to fire Esper&mdash;during a period in which Trump had begun isolating among his most loyal followers after it became clear had lost the election to Joe Biden. Esper had also served as Trump's Army secretary beginning November 2017 and running through his appointment as SecDef nearly 18 months later. Prior to that, Esper was employed as an executive at Raytheon, capping 21 years in the Army as an active duty officer, as well as more than a decade as a member of the National Guard and Reserve. 'We are living through an era of great change that has stoked national security ramifications that are rippling through board rooms around the world,&rdquo; Esper said in a statement, according to his new employer. 'Squire Patton Boggs has a clear vision to lead in this space and I am excited to add to the unique offering that the firm is building,&rdquo; he added. Read more, here. And former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy just joined the Florida-based private equity firm AE Industrial where he'll serve as an operating partner, the company announced Tuesday. McCarthy took over for Esper when Trump nominated the latter to lead the Pentagon in 2019. He stayed on in that role until the Biden administration took over in January 2021. Before that, he'd served for more than two years as Army undersecretary after hopping over from a role at Lockheed Martin. Like Esper, he, too, was an Army veteran, with five years of service on active duty ending 2002. But unlike Esper, McCarthy was an Army Ranger with the 75th Regiment's 3rd Battalion. 'Global events continue to illustrate that there is sustained need for innovative technologies to combat complex and evolving threats,&rdquo; McCarthy said in a statement, according to his new employer. 'I look forward to partnering with AEI's portfolio companies operating within the national security space to capitalize on new opportunities and create value,&rdquo; he said. And lastly today: The manhunt is reportedly over in Kentucky following an apparently random highway shooting less than two weeks ago that injured at least five people who were driving along I-75. Authorities said they located a body 'in the deep brush&rdquo; near the scene of the shootings Wednesday afternoon. 'The people of Laurel County can rest easy &mdash; much easier &mdash; knowing that this manhunt has now come to a conclusion,&rdquo; Kentucky State Police commissioner, Phillip Burnett Jr., said in a news conference later that evening. One tip off: 'vultures in the air,&rdquo; according to the police. Upon further investigation, they 'detected a heavy odor consistent with a decomposing body.&rdquo; What's more, 'Personal artifacts and a weapon found with the body are consistent with the suspect,&rdquo; police said.

Device detonations reveal ‘incredible’ intelligence abilities: ex...	NASHVILLE, Tennessee&mdash;The detonation of several thousand Hezbollah devices displayed a stunning capability for intelligence-gathering, likely Israel's &mdash; and underscored potential vulnerabilities in global supply chains, a former NSA chief said Wednesday. The perpetrators 'had incredible ability to do targeting intelligence and to be able to actually know the numbers, know who's got them, [and] know the periodicity upon which they're using them,&rdquo; said Paul Nakasone, the former director of the National Security Agency and four-star commander of U.S. Cyber Command. Thousands of pagers remotely detonated in Lebanon at 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people, including two children, and injuring roughly 2,800 others. On Wednesday, a second wave of explosions&mdash;this time, of walkie-talkies&mdash;killed at least 20 people and injured some 450. The covert attack on the Iran-backed militant group demonstrated a thorough understanding of their operatives, and that the targets were known 'pretty intimately,&rdquo; said Nakasone, who added that he had no advance knowledge of the operation. In recent months, Hezbollah has adopted a more basic tech strategy to try to evade Israeli intelligence, which has infiltrated the group's landlines and mobile phones. But the move seemingly backfired after someone&mdash;widely believed to be Israeli intelligence operatives&mdash;appeared to have orchestrated a series of covert supply-chain compromises that turned the devices into deadly weapons. A major concern now is how those types of hijacks could end up inside U.S. consumer products or devices, Nakasone said. 'One is, if this was a supply-chain [attack], I think about our own supply chains and what we need to be able to do to ensure their integrity,&rdquo; he said. 'The second piece is, if it wasn't a supply-chain attack, how was this conducted?&rdquo; In recent weeks, and following Israeli airstrikes against his commanders, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has advised his militant operatives to take a low-tech approach while fighting Israel. In February, he ordered a cellphone blackout in an effort to thwart Israel's intelligence gathering. Israel has a long history of rigging and exploding communications devices on their targets. In 1996, Israel's Shin Bet tricked notorious Hamas bombmaker Yahya Ayyash into using a cell phone rigged with explosives, killing him instantly. Nakasone, who retired from his post in February, was speaking to reporters at a news conference leading up to the launch of Vanderbilt University's National Security Institute, where he is slated to head the program meant to steer younger talent into national security roles.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/device-detonations-reveal-incredible-intelligence-abilities-ex-nsa-chief/399660/	2024-09-19T05:56:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/19/091924_getty_ng_nakasone-1/large.jpg
AFSOC still wants 75 light attack aircraft despite Congress’ doub...	The Air Force's special operators trimmed the number of light attack planes they're asking for after Congress looked askance. But they still need them, the commander of Air Force Special Operations Command said Wednesday. 'Our requirement still remains 75&rdquo; OA-1K aircraft to fight extremist groups or other low-tech adversaries, AFSOC commander Lt. Gen. Michael E. Conley told reporters at the AIr-Space-Cyber conference outside Washington. 'It is possible that we don't buy those 75 in the same timeframe that we wanted to, but that's still our requirement.&rdquo; In 2020, AFSOC launched its quest for a small propeller-driven attack plane for close air support and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Dubbed Armed Overwatch, the program aimed to buy 75 planes by 2029 for just $2 billion (a ceiling of $3 billion,) a fraction of the cost of larger aircraft. AFSOC eventually chose the OA-1K, a crop-duster made by Air Tractor and given sensors and a gun by L3Harris. But the program has since drawn fire from lawmakers who wonder about the planes' utility. 'Congress has expressed concerns about the Armed Overwatch program. It has delayed the reprogramming of funds for the aircraft and required the Department of Defense to provide information about its plans,&rdquo; GAO said in a report this month. In March, AFSOC cut the number it was acquiring from 75 to 62. But AFSOC still hasn't justified why it needs 75 light attack aircraft, planes that would be relatively useless in a fight with an adversary like China, with advanced air defenses and fighter jets. Said GAO: 'We found that SOCOM was limited in its ability to justify the acquisition of the Armed Overwatch aircraft for three reasons. First, because SOCOM decided on the size of the fleet before conducting required analyses. Second, SOCOM did not assess how changes in the aircraft's capabilities could affect the number needed for operations. And third, that SOCOM has not reevaluated its needs despite changes to operational missions.&rdquo; On Wednesday, Conley said, 'I think from when OA-1k was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world's changed a little bit&hellip;I think it still provides a cost effective close air support platform, which is one of the missions that it was designed for.&rdquo; AFSOC is still digesting the GAO report but 'Our requirement still remains 75,&rdquo; based on a Capability Development Document AFSOC has created, he said. Conley said that while the Defense Department remains highly focused on buying weapons to deter China, the world is more chaotic today than many experts thought it would be a few years ago. He said continued turmoil and ongoing operations in the Middle East show that low-tech extremist groups continue to be a threat, despite the Pentagon's hopes of moving focus to the Pacific. 'I tell my team every day, the Pacific is incredibly important to us for all the reasons&hellip;China, China, China. We get it. But we've also got the rest of the world,&rdquo; he said. 'I don't think we're done in CENTCOM. As a nation, I don't think we're done in CENTCOM.&rdquo;. Conley cautioned against drawing conclusions about the utility of low-tech attack aircraft based on present-day capabilities. Such assumptions overlook the sort of rapid adaptation that might make such aircraft more useful against a wider variety of missions. 'You know, we're a command that took an AC-130 or a C-47 and put guns on the side, or the command that put jets on a C-130 to try to get it out of the stadium in Iran. That's our DNA. And I think once we get the aircraft and we start flying our crew members and our maintainers will figure out novel ways that will be relevant in the future fight as well as the current one.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/afsoc-still-wants-75-light-attack-aircraft-despite-congress-doubts/399650/	2024-09-18T17:47:21-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_8.38.48PM/large.png
Army wants to buy as many drones as it does munitions	The Army wants to buy drones in the 'kind of quantities&rdquo; it buys munitions, Army acquisition chief Doug Bush said Wednesday during an webcast with Defense News. 'We need them potentially at very large scale and very quickly,&rdquo; said Bush. 'They're somewhere between a munition and the way we think about a large platform,&rdquo; he added. The Army has plans to eventually field drones of different types at the platoon, company, and brigade levels. So far, the Army has only fielded drones at the platoon level under the Short Range Reconnaissance program. Fielding of the drone, currently the Skydio RQ-28A, is still in its early stages. The Army requested 207 of these drones in 2023, and 459 in 2024, according to budget documents. In September, the Army selected Anduril and Performance Drone Works to provide drones to company-level units. These drones are larger than the RQ-28A and have a longer loitering time, among other features. Starting in fiscal year 2026, The Army will evaluate prototype drones for the brigade level program. [[Related Posts]] The Army may also field first-person-view drones, typically used as a loitering munition, and tethered drones. Bush did not specify what types of munitions he was referring to. Excluding rounds for small arms, the Army buys munitions like missiles and artillery shells in the range of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Army leaders have put drones at the center of a new fielding effort dubbed 'transforming in contact,&rdquo; and have asked for more money for them in this year's unfunded priorities lists. Multiple units across the Army are also experimenting with drone uses and training. However, an Defense One analysis indicates that U.S. industry is not ready to produce the hundreds of thousands of drones that may be needed in a major war, 'Until the U.S. military mainstreams operational concepts that demand large numbers of drones, production will remain at a relatively low level,&rdquo; Hudson Institute senior fellow Bryan Clark previously told Defense One. Smaller drones like those the Army gives platoons and companies, are relatively simple to manufacture, Bush said. 'A lot of it is people hand-building things.&rdquo; Bush also highlighted the Army's focus on software-based updates and modular open-system architecture&mdash;the ability to easily add and subtract components like a new radar or sensor. 'Those are the two major pushes from both large platforms like [Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft] and XM-30 [Infantry Combat Vehicle] all the way down to small [drones],&rdquo; Bush said. Both approaches allow the Army to upgrade equipment quickly, helping the service to field improved systems 'at the speed needed in combat,&rdquo; he said. Bush also said artificial intelligence is decreasing the load on the Army's contracting force. There are AI pilot programs that assist contracting personnel in 'everything from our research to writing initial [request for proposals] to doing draft contracts to doing evaluations of contracts,&rdquo; Bush said. 'I'm assuming we're probably not going to get a lot more [contracting professionals].&rdquo; he said. 'We've got to use technology to help them do their jobs.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/army-wants-buy-many-drones-it-does-munitions/399646/	2024-09-18T14:18:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_11.17.25AM/large.png
Budget drama could snag Pentagon’s satellite launch award	The Pentagon's new satellite launch competition between SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin could be delayed if Congress passes a long continuing resolution instead of a full budget for 2025, a space acquisitions official said Wednesday. Congress is scrambling to avert a government shutdown by Sept. 30 as House Republicans are poised to reject a proposed six-month continuing resolution funding bill for fiscal year 2025. Continuing resolutions, or CRs, are stopgap funding solutions that fund the government and programs at the same level as the previous year, to keep money flowing in the absence of full-year appropriations. Source selection for 'Lane 2&rdquo; of the National Security Space Launch Phase 3 program is continuing despite budget concerns, with the intent to award later this year. But work may be delayed if there's no permanent funding for 2025. 'The source selection is still underway. It's been underway for a while, it's a big important contract so we're definitely going to do a lot of due diligence on that. Anticipate the source selection being complete, being ready to award towards the end of this calendar year. But we need a budget,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, commander of Space Launch Delta 45 and program executive officer for Space Systems Command's assured access to space office. 'I can't do the mission assignments and actually put the specific launch on contract if I don't have that money. So while I would like to be able to do that at the beginning of the year, have a full budget, do it at the beginning of the fiscal year, give the companies the maximum amount of time to make sure integration and everything is ready to go, I have to wait until I have the funding to actually be able to put specific missions on contract,&rdquo; she told reporters Wednesday at the annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. [[Related Posts]] A continuing resolution could mean a monthslong waiting period and then 'sprinting to try to get everything done, which is not the most efficient cadence that we could be operating at,&rdquo; said Panzenhagen, who later added the command hasn't determined how it will handle award announcements if Congress agrees to a long CR. The Space Force has already signaled it wants to do more launches this year. Space Systems Command buys launches about two years in advance to give companies time to work on satellite integration. For 'Lane 2,&rdquo; there will be one large contract award for the annual mission assignments. Up to three companies can be awarded, with the third best provider getting seven missions and the top two splitting the rest 60-40, Panzenhagen said, without specifying how many total missions there would be. Companies must go through a certification process before they're eligible to bid on the contract. Some rocket providers are still going through that process, which has several components, including different reference orbits and launch bases. But the bottom line is: 'We also need an FY25 budget to award that contract,&rdquo; Panzenhagen said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/budget-drama-could-snag-pentagons-satellite-launch-award/399645/	2024-09-18T14:09:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_11.08.06AM/large.png
Test B-21 flying up to twice a week, Northrop reports	Flight testing of the Air Force's B-21 Raider stealth bomber is moving along swimmingly, officials report, giving a rare, and small, update on the highly classified program. 'We're really starting to strike up quite a cadence. We're actually able to generate two test flights, sometimes, within a week, which, if you think about how far ahead we are, that's great,&rdquo; said Tom Jones, president of Northrop's Aeronautics Systems. 'I think we're well on the way to delivering a kind of asset that can be that daily flyer for U.S. warfighters out there.&rdquo; The company has three aircraft 'in various configurations&rdquo; in flight test right now, Jones said Wednesday at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Two of them are being used for ground testing and one for flight testing. 'I don't want to jinx myself, but we've had more issues with test fixtures and training of our test personnel than we actually have with the test article, which, again, is a pretty good place to be at this point,&rdquo; Jones said. The program also completed a static test on a ground-based test article used to prove out the structure of the aircraft, according to William Bailey, director of the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office. Meanwhile, Northrop has already started building production aircraft. The company received the greenlight for low-rate initial production after the B-21 took its first flight in November. The Air Force plans to buy at least 100 B-21s to replace its B-1 and B-2 bombers. Once the Raider enters service, it will first go to Ellsworth Air Force Base. The service recently announced the second and third operating bases for B-21s: Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. Demand for the service's bomber task forces is only going to increase as B-21 comes online in the years ahead, Air Force Global Strike Commander Gen. Thomas Bussiere said Wednesday. 'As we transition from the B-1 and the B-2 to the B-21, and we transition from the B-52H to the B-52J model, there's a realization that we're probably not going to see a decreased demand signal from our regional combatant commands on bomber task forces,&rdquo; Bussiere said. 'As we transition from the legacy to new, the B-21 will provide great comfort to our allies and should provide great pause for a potential adversary.&rdquo; The service released a new image and video of the B-21 flying and landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/test-b-21s-flying-twice-week-northrop-reports/399641/	2024-09-18T13:37:53-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/8648580/large.jpg
Air Force’s Ospreys will return to forward-deployment within 'wee...	The Air Force is weeks away from sending its V-22 Ospreys back to combatant commands after the Pentagon lifted a months-long grounding on the tiltrotor fleet earlier this year. 'We will deploy out here in the coming weeks, back to support other geographic combatant commanders. We'll go back to the missions that only the CV-22 can do, or what the combatant commanders need us to do,&rdquo; Air Force Special Operations Command head Lt. Gen. Michael Conley told reporters Wednesday at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Conley didn't specify where they would send the V-22s, but said it will be to 'support the wars we're engaged in,&rdquo; and noted it won't be INDOPACOM or EUCOM, since those commands already have V-22 wings assigned there. The Pentagon grounded its entire fleet of Ospreys in late 2023 after a deadly crash off the coast of Japan killed eight airmen in November. The aircraft were cleared to fly again in March with some limitations: flights and missions have to stay within 30 minutes of a 'suitable divert airfield.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] But Conley said the divert rule is just a 'planning factor,&rdquo; and won't affect AFSOC's ability to complete its mission for combatant commands. 'I won't even call it a limitation,&rdquo; Conley said. As of today, 60 percent of the fleet is fully operational, and by late 2024 or early next year, all 51 of the service's CV-22s will be ready for duty, Conley said. Last month, the Air Force released its investigation into the November crash, and found it was caused by the 'catastrophic failure&rdquo; of a prop-rotor gearbox and the pilot's decision to keep flying despite warnings. The service still doesn't know exactly why the part failed, but Conley maintained it was a 'rare&rdquo; occurrence. Conley doesn't believe the failure was caused by poor material from Bell Textron and Boeing, who build the Pentagon's V-22s. The companies have been 'good partners&rdquo; throughout the investigation, he added. But the families of Marines killed in a 2022 Osprey crash disagree, and are suing the companies, alleging they knew the aircraft was unsafe and failed to disclose that to the Pentagon. Aviation Week reported last week that the Air Force is considering overhauling the V-22's airworthiness certification. Asked about the possibility of the service rescinding airworthiness, Conley said: 'I don't think we're there. I think discussions may continue, but I don't think anyone's close to a decision on whether we need to break from the current construct.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/air-forces-ospreys-will-be-forward-deployed-within-weeks/399638/	2024-09-18T13:14:08-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_10.10.03AM/large.png
The D Brief: Why pagers explode; Russian ammo dump blows up; CNO ...	Israeli intelligence operatives appear to have pulled off a legendary and deadly supply chain hack, installing tiny quantities of explosives into at least 3,000 pagers specially ordered by Iran-backed Hezbollah militants across Lebanon and Syria, U.S. officials told Reuters, the New York Times, and the Associated Press over the past 24 hours. What happened: Thousands of the AR-924 pagers exploded remotely Tuesday around 3:30 p.m. local, killing at least a dozen people, including two children, and wounding around 2,800 others, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said Wednesday. 'Explosive material, as little as one to two ounces, was implanted next to the battery in each pager,&rdquo; and 'A switch was also embedded that could be triggered remotely to detonate the explosives,&rdquo; the Times reported Tuesday. The pagers were initially traced to a company in Taiwan, but officials there point to Hungary, where the devices were made under license by a separate company based in Budapest, AP reported Wednesday. That Hungarian firm, known as BAC Consulting KFT, 'appeared to be a shell company,&rdquo; according to AP. Expert reax: 'There are many failure points in supply chains,&rdquo; noted Decker Eveleth of Virginia-based CNA. 'I don't think we should jump to the conclusion that [BAC was] directly involved or simply a front&rdquo; for Israeli intelligence, he warned. 'This would easily be the biggest counterintelligence failure that Hezbollah has had in decades,&rdquo; one former U.S. official told Reuters. Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank in Washington described it as 'Perhaps one of the most extensive physical supply chain attacks in history.&rdquo; Among those hurt: Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, who 'lost one eye and his other eye is severely injured,&rdquo; according to the Times. Q. Is such an attack a violation of international humanitarian law? Apparently, says Shashank Joshi of the Economist&mdash;but possibly not, according to the Brits' interpretation of the laws of armed conflict, he noted on social media with the assistance of others.

On this day in 2014, President Barack Obama offered military gear but denied weapons to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who had come to Washington seeking help against what the world believed at the time to be Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, though Vladimir Putin later admitted they were in fact Russian military forces without any insignia. A large Russian ammunition depot erupted in a remarkable series of explosions early Wednesday around 3:30 in the morning. Regional earthquake monitors even picked up the blast, which registered as a 'light magnitude&rdquo; 2.8 quake. Location: The Toropets Northeast Ammunition Depot, in the Tver region of Russia, which is about 300 miles from the frontlines of Russia's Ukraine invasion. Six Ukrainian kamikaze drones were allegedly used in the attack, which appears to have caused several intense burn zones that NASA sensors picked up in the agency's Fire Information for Resource Management System. In video: Here is some footage taken moments after impact showing the initial blast wave followed by a smaller series of secondary explosions and their waves rolling across the illuminated horizon. 'We're likely looking at the loss of thousands of tons of explosive materials, shells, and rockets,&rdquo; one former Ukrainian officer said, noting, 'In events of this magnitude, replacement can't be quick.&rdquo; Developing: Norwegian sensors have reportedly detected cesium near the border with Russia, which would seem to suggest Moscow just tested its new nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed cruise missile known as the 9M730 Burevestnik, aka 'SSC-X-9 Skyfall&rdquo; according to NATO. 'The levels are clearly higher than normal, but pose no risk to humans or the environment,&rdquo; a Norwegian official told the Barents Observer on Tuesday, which noted, 'Cesium-137 is formed as a fission product by operating a nuclear reactor.&rdquo; It's 'Likely Russia conducted their 13th test of the system,&rdquo; because that location 'correspond[s] to the activity we see in satellite imagery at the Burevestnik missile test site at Pankovo,&rdquo; said Decker Eveleth. Get up to speed: Reuters has much more on the particular test site, reporting with satellite imagery in early September, here. The Barents Observers also runs down a few alternate possibilities near the end of their report, here. CNO releases new Navigation Plan. Announcing her first addition to the long-running series of guidance papers by the Navy's top officers, Adm. Lisa Franchetti says her top priorities are 'readiness for conflict with the PRC by 2027 and enhancing long-term advantage.&rdquo; She aims to achieve these ends 'through two central ways: implementing seven 'Project 33&rdquo; targets and expanding the Navy's contribution to the Joint warfighting ecosystem.&rdquo; Project 33&mdash;apparently a nod to her status as the 33rd CNO&mdash;includes these bullet points: Ready the force by eliminating ship, submarine, and aircraft maintenance delays Scale robotic and autonomous systems to integrate more platforms at speed Create the command centers our fleets need to win on a distributed battlefield Recruit and retain the force we need to get more players on the field Deliver a quality of service commensurate with the sacrifices of our Sailors Train for combat as we plan to fight, in the real world and virtually Restore the critical infrastructure that sustains and projects the fight from shore.

He praises especially her focus on 'near-term readiness&rdquo; and a reduction in references to diversity compared to the 2022 version. Read that, here. Joint Chiefs Chairman Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., met with four NATO counterparts over the past few days. That included Czech Lt. Gen. Karel Řehka and Turkish Gen. Metin G&uuml;rak Saturday in Prague during the alliance's annual Military Committee Conference. Two days later, Brown spoke with Belgian Gen. Frederik Vansina and Danish Gen. Michael Wiggers Hyldgaard Monday in Copenhagen. CQ's CR warning to HASC's Rogers: Brown warned the top House Armed Services Republican against advancing another temporary funding bill known as a continuing resolution in a letter dated Friday. 'In the race against time, each CR is the equivalent of taking a knee on advancing our defense capabilities as security challenges increase their momentum to challenge our credible combat power,&rdquo; Brown wrote in his letter. CRs 'slow progress and damage our relationships with the defense industrial base, eroding trust driving up costs, and increasing delivery times, as industry hedges against funding inconsistencies,&rdquo; Brown said. 'Should Congress move forward with a six-month CR, we anticipate detrimental impacts to readiness and modernization across the Joint Force,&rdquo; the general warned. 'Pay and entitlements, nuclear enterprise modernization, shipbuilding and maintenance, aircraft procurement, weapons system sustainment. munitions production, and multiple new starts are just a few examples that will feel the brunt of the lost time and lost buying power caused by a CR.&rdquo; 'We are living in a consequential time. There is no time to waste,&rdquo; said Brown. And lastly: North Korea launched a series of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast just before 7 a.m. local time Wednesday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. The missiles flew for about 250 miles before splashing down into the water, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said afterward. Indo-PACOM: 'The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,&rdquo; U.S. military officials said in a statement. 'While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation,&rdquo; they added. ICYMI: 'The North fired several short-range ballistic missiles last Thursday, the first such launch in more than two months, which it later described as a test of a new 600-mm multiple launch rocket system,&rdquo; Reuters reports. And the launches come just a few 'days after North Korea offered a rare view into a secretive facility built to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs as leader Kim Jong Un called for a rapid expansion of his nuclear weapons program,&rdquo; AP reports. By the way: 'North Korea's rapid advancement of its nuclear and missile capabilities, combined with its stated ambition to exponentially expand its nuclear arsenal, is the single greatest challenge&rdquo; facing U.S. and allied forces in the region, said Army Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson, the nominee to lead U.S. Forces Korea, told lawmakers Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Yonhap has more from that extended exchange, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-18-2024/399621/	2024-09-18T08:28:46-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/DB_lander/large.png
NATO considering Arctic combined air operations center to deal wi...	The recent addition of Sweden and Finland to the NATO alliance is opening up new opportunities for members to better work together in the Arctic, where Russian activity has been increasing. That could mean a new combined air operations center, or CAOC 'fairly shortly,&rdquo; U.S. Air Forces Europe and NATO Allied Air Command Gen. James Hecker said Tuesday at the Air & Space Forces Association's Air Space & Cyber conference. Hecker said he has U.S. European Command head Gen. Chris Cavoli's approval to further explore the idea. 'We've thrown out the idea. Gen. Cavoli in principle agrees with it. That doesn't mean it's a done deal,&rdquo; he told Defense One, noting that the proposal still has to make it through NATO leadership. The location of the potential CAOC is yet to be determined, he said. During a panel discussion with representatives from the Swedish and Norwegian air forces, Hecker told them: 'We're going to exploit that close relationship between the Arctic nations and the knowledge that you bring to make that happen. So we're going to use that, and we're going to exploit it, and I think we'll probably get a third CAOC up there fairly shortly.&rdquo; Russian incursions into NATO airspace happen frequently in the Arctic, said Maj. Gen. &Oslash;ivind Gunnerud, the chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. 'On average, per year, we intercept Russians once or twice per week [and] their ships all the time.&rdquo; Additionally, he said, there is more to consider for air operations there than at lower latitudes. 'You will experience icing. Now, inland, dry, cold climate, it has its challenges. But what we see in Norway, we have a lot of the coastal climate, above and below the freezing level all the time. So you have slippery runways. And, of course, it's night [operation] during the winter time. So you better add your night flying skills up there, that's for sure.&rdquo; Said Hecker, the U.S. Air Force has been experimenting with MQ-9 Reaper and Global Hawk drones in the Arctic Circle to increase situational awareness, 'which we haven't done in the past,&rdquo; as well as high-altitude balloons and other drones. But, he noted, Arctic conditions offer special challenges to unmanned systems as well, as many are powered via solar panels on the wings. 'That will work out in the summer, probably not so great in the winter,&rdquo; he said. If the proposal becomes a reality, the Arctic CAOC would be NATO's third, joining one in Germany and another in Spain.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/nato-considering-arctic-combined-air-operations-center-deal-russian-threats/399614/	2024-09-17T18:31:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/17/GettyImages_1132893105/large.jpg
