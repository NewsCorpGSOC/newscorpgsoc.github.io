Can Syria's triumphant rebel coalition unite the country?	The brutal 54-year reign of the Assad family in Syria looks to be over. In a matter of days, opposition forces took the major city of Aleppo before advancing southward into other government-controlled areas of Hama, Homs and finally, on Dec 7, 2024, the capital, Damascus. The offensive was all the more astonishing given that the 13-year civil war had largely been in a stalemate since a 2020 ceasefire brokered by Russia and Turkey. Reports suggest President Bashar al-Assad has resigned and left the country. But what has he left behind and what happens next? As an expert on Middle East security, I believe the opposition forces' ability to maintain unity will be critical in the transition to a post-Assad Syria. Since the civil war started in 2011, the many opposition factions in Syria have been fractured by ideological differences and the interests of external backers&mdash;and that remains true despite their current victory. Meanwhile, the rapid change of fortunes in Syria's civil war poses serious questions for those countries that have backed one side or the other in the conflict. For Iran and Russia, the fall of their ally Assad will damage regional aspirations. For the backers of elements of the opposition&mdash;notably Turkey but also the United States, both of which maintain a military presence in Syria&mdash;there will be challenges, too. Fears of a &lsquo;catastrophic success' Iran, the U.S., Russia, and Turkey have been crucial players throughout Syria's civil war. The recent opposition offensive came as Assad's three key allies&mdash;Russia, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah&mdash;were stretched thin. Russia's focus on Ukraine and Iran's setbacks from Israeli strikes have limited their ability to provide Assad robust support, while Hezbollah appeared hesitant to commit additional fighters, as it had done previously. Then, on Dec. 2, as opposition forces were on the move, Russia began withdrawing naval assets from its strategic Mediterranean base at Tartus, Syria. This erosion of external backing substantially undermined Assad's capacity to regroup and mount an effective counteroffensive. The U.S. will no doubt welcome this diminished Russian and Iranian influence in Syria. But concern in Washington has already been aired over a scenario of 'catastrophic success&rdquo; in which Assad is replaced by an Islamist group that many in the West see as terrorists. It was members of the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham that spearheaded much of the opposition gains in Syria, fighting alongside the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. And while Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has not directly targeted the U.S. troops stationed in the northeast&mdash;which is under the control of Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces&mdash;instability and the potential for clashes between opposition factions and U.S. allies could increase the risks for the 900 Syria-based American personnel. The fact that different opposition groups have taken control of various once-government-held areas points to a crucial fact: Syria is de facto partitioned. The northwest is controlled by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army. The northeast is under the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, supported by the United States. Despite a shared goal of ousting Assad and the joint offensive on Aleppo, conflicts between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Syrian National Army are frequent. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, led by Abu Mohammad al-Golani aims to assert control over opposition-held areas, including those currently managed by the Syrian National Army. And the Syrian National Army and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham maintain complex, often conflicting relationships with the Syrian Democratic Forces, shaped by ideological, territorial and strategic differences. The Turkish-backed Syrian National Army frequently engages in direct clashes with the Syrian Defense Forces, which Turkey views as a terrorist organization and an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers Party it has been fighting in southern Turkey for more than four decades. The opposition's internal fragmentation may weaken its ability to bring stability to Syria in the long run. Adjustment problems Assad's fall will have major implications for those countries that have a stake in the region. Iran's grand strategy of preserving the 'Shia Crescent&rdquo;&mdash;connecting Tehran to Beirut through Baghdad and Damascus and in the process countering Sunni Islamist factions&mdash;has failed. For Washington, Assad's departure doesn't necessarily fit any hoped-for outcome. The U.S. has prioritized balancing, containing, and potentially diminishing Russian and Iranian influence in Syria. But until recently that did not mean the removal of Assad. The Biden administration had even hinted in early December that it would be prepared to lift sanctions on Syria if Assad severed ties with Iran and Hezbollah. There was also talk of Assad's government allying with the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces. But as city after city fell to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army, it became increasingly unlikely that the Kurdish group would align with the weakening Assad forces&mdash;especially as Kurdish forces themselves made significant territorial gains. Syrian Democratic Forces will need to adapt in response to the fall of Assad. This will be doubly true if, as many anticipate and President-elect Donald Trump has hinted at, the U.S. withdraws from Syria. Currently, the 900 U.S. troops are in eastern Syria, alongside a military base in Al-Tanf, located near the Iraqi and Jordanian borders. Should American forces withdraw, the Syrian Democratic Forces and the autonomous region it administers&mdash;known as the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria&mdash;would need to negotiate their autonomy with both different factions of the opposition and Syrian neighbor Turkey. A Kurdish and Islamist alliance? The precarious role of Syrian Democratic Forces in the transition to the post-Assad era could make for a significant foreign policy headache for the U.S. Given Turkey's history of military incursions and campaigns against the Syrian Democratic Forces in northern cities like Afrin and Kobani, the Kurdish group may need to align with some factions of the opposition, likely Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, should the U.S. eventually withdraw. Of late, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham has largely avoided antagonizing the Syrian Democratic Forces. Indeed, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's efforts to rebrand and moderate itself are notable, especially given its origins as a Salafist group with ties to al-Qaida. By adopting a range of policies like issuing an amnesty for Syrian army personnel, facilitating evacuation agreements and using the language of building an ethnically and religiously diverse governance structure, the Islamist group has attempted to soften its hard-line image and gain favor &ndash; or at least neutrality &ndash; from international stakeholders, like the U.S. Yet skepticism about Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's ultimate objectives persists. Strategic calculations for Turkey Turkey's position on Syria now is equally complex. Turkey is home to 3.6 million Syrian refugees&mdash;the largest refugee-hosting country globally. A prolonged economic downturn and rising anti-refugee sentiment had pressured Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to signal a willingness to engage with Assad prior to the opposition offensive. Turkey's hope was that normalized relations with Syria would help facilitate refugee return and address concerns about a potential Kurdish state in northeastern Syria. But Assad dismissed such overtures, and he intensified airstrikes on Idlib&mdash;triggering new waves of displacement near the Turkish border. Turkey's Syria policy is also closely linked to its renewed peace process with the Kurdistan Workers' Party. These talks reportedly include discussions about the potential release of imprisoned Kurdistan Workers' Party leader Abdullah &Ouml;calan &ndash; whose influence runs deep in Kurdish-led regions in northern Syria. The chance for a new Syria The apparent end of the Assad family's rule after half a century of brutal oppression signifies a pivotal moment for Syria &ndash; offering an opportunity to rebuild the nation on foundations of inclusivity, pluralism and stability. Achieving this vision depends on the opposition factions' ability to navigate the immense challenges of transition. This includes fostering unity among diverse groups, addressing grievances from years of conflict and establishing governance structures that reflect Syria's ethnic, religious and political diversity. That will be no easy task. This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Some Republicans remain unsold on Hegseth	SIMI VALLEY, California&mdash;Pete Hegseth, the president-elect's controversial pick for defense secretary, spent last week on Capitol Hill trying to persuade Republicans that he's fit for the job. But some lawmakers remain unconvinced. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a key Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and former military officer, said Hegseth will go through a 'very thorough vetting process&rdquo; and noted her experience with sexual assault when asked about what else she needs to hear from Hegseth before she supports him. 'I am a survivor of sexual assault, so I've worked very heavily on sexual assault measures within the military. So I'd like to hear a little more about that. I'd like to hear about the role of women in our great United States military,&rdquo; Ernst told the audience at the Reagan National Defense Forum here. Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2017; he later paid her as part of a nondisclosure agreement. The Fox TV personality and former Army major has also publicly questioned whether women should serve in combat roles. Ernst said she'll sit down with Hegseth again this week, and expects an FBI background check to provide her with more information about Donald Trump's pick. Other senators have expressed concern about reports of Hegseth's drinking on the job, but have since touted his promise to stop drinking if appointed. His inexperience is also a concern: Hegseth has never made national-security policy, served in a senior military role, worked in defense acquisition, or led an organization larger than a nonprofit advocacy group. He is an 'anti-woke&rdquo; crusader, and has drafted a list of Pentagon officers to fire if he takes the helm. This list includes officers who have promoted diversity, and those involved in the Afghanistan withdrawal. One Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., pushed back on Hegseth's plan, arguing that those military officials were following orders of their commander-in-chief. 'The nominee for the secretary of defense has talked about wanting to go after the generals for being too DEI or going after those who he thought responsible for Afghanistan, and I think we should be careful about that. Our generals are following the orders of the President of the United States, the civilian commander and the Secretary of Defense, and it's not right to punish a military guy for bad decisions,&rdquo; Bacon told Defense One on the sidelines of Reagan. Some of those generals recommended against 'a lot of the stuff&rdquo; President Biden ordered, but had to follow lawful orders from their civilian leaders, Bacon said. Politico recently summed up Hegseth's stances this way: 'Based on numerous public statements and writings, it's likely he will aim to undermine the military's long-standing nonpartisan pluralism by scrubbing diversity from the ranks, banning women in combat, urging the military to choose sides in a &lsquo;civil war' against &lsquo;domestic enemies' on the left, and orienting the military's mission around his fixation on the Muslim world, which he feels represents an existential threat to Western civilization.&rdquo; Trump has continued to defend his pick, writing on Friday that support for Hegseth is 'strong and deep, much more so than the Fake News would have you believe.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/some-republicans-remain-unsold-hegseth/401523/	2024-12-08T19:06:49-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/08/U.S._President_elect_2500/large.jpg
US strikes ISIS in Syria as Assad regime falls	U.S. military aircraft struck 75 ISIS-related targets in Syria on Sunday, just hours after the government of Bashar Al-Assad fell to rebel forces, according to the White House. 'ISIS has been trying to reconstitute in this broad area known as the Badiya desert,&rdquo; a White House senior official told reporters on background. 'We have worked to make sure they cannot do that. So when they try to camp there, when they try to train, which we do, we take them out, something.&rdquo; The strikes were executed by B-52s, F-15s, A-10s, and other Air Force assets, the official said. On Saturday, outgoing National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the United States will continue to play some role in the country, where it has since 2014 deployed troops to fight ISIS. 'There are three things we have to be particularly focused on,&rdquo; Sullivan said at the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, California. 'One: that the fighting in Syria not lead to the resurgence of ISIS, and we are going to take steps ourselves, directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to ensure that does not happen. 'Two: that our friends in the region, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, others who border Syria, or who would potentially face spillover effects from Syria, are strong and secure,&rdquo; he said. 'Three: that this does not lead to a humanitarian catastrophe.&rdquo; The White House official said Assad has been offered asylum by his longtime backers in Moscow, but his current whereabouts are unknown. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main rebel group, had some early links to ISIS and the United States designated it as a terrorist organization in 2018. The White House official said that over the course of the days, senior administration officials will be in the region, 'maintaining the mission against ISIS, helping ensure stability in East Syria, protecting our personnel from any threats, but most importantly, engaging with all Syrian groups to establish and help wherever we can transition away from the Assad regime towards an independent sovereign Syria.&rdquo; They said the United States was proactively involved with multiple groups in Syria and partners in the region. 'I just want to emphasize the future here will be written by Syrians. We are not coming up with a blueprint from Washington for the future of Syria is written by Syrians,&rdquo; the official said. The United States is also concerned about Assad's arsenal of chemical weapons. 'There's a number of efforts going on in that regard, including some of Our partners in the region who have been able to ratio, that's something that we're very much focused on,&rdquo; the official said but indicated that it was unlikely the United States would need to deploy additional assets to Syria to deal with them.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/us-strikes-isis-syria-assad-regime-falls/401522/	2024-12-08T15:22:34-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/08/A_U.S._Air_Force_B_5_2500/large.jpg
‘Multi-headed monster’: Biden, Trump officials address threat fro...	Simi Valley, Calif.&mdash;China, Russia, and Iran are working closely together across the globe, which presents new threats to U.S. and allied national security, defense officials from both the Biden and incoming Trump administrations said Saturday. But even together, those countries are not stronger than the American military and its allies, they said. 'Autocrats resort to partnerships of convenience. But America leads partnerships of conviction. And the department's National Defense Strategy rightly calls the U.S. network of allies and partners our &lsquo;greatest global strategic advantage,'&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said at the Reagan National Security Forum, in a speech that also included the announcement of a new Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package worth nearly $1 billion. 'That package will provide Ukraine with more drones, more rockets for its HIMARS systems, and more support for crucial maintenance and sustainment,&rdquo; he said. Robert Wilkie, who previously served as secretary of Veterans Affairs and is now leading the Trump administration's Pentagon transition, said: 'The killing fields of Ukraine are a warning to us all, and a warning that this is a multi-headed monster that we have to prepare for multiple theaters&hellip;Weakening the Iranians, weakening the Russians in Eastern Europe weakens China.&rdquo; Wilkie did not address speculation that Trump might cease arms support for Ukraine, but did say the next administration will emphasize a return to large-scale production of key weapons to challenge increasingly coordinated adversaries. 'We will be focusing on producing artillery shells, producing precision-guided munitions, putting more hulls in the water and making sure more ships and submarines are at sea and more aircraft are in the air,&rdquo; he said, adding that he was not speaking in an official capacity for the Trump transition. Wilkie made his remarks as the collapse of the Assad Syrian regime was imminent. He called the fall of Assad&mdash;a close alley of both Russia and Iran&mdash;'a welcomed development,&rdquo; though he noted the emergence of an extremist organization seeking to fill the power vacuum left by Assad's departure is not. The events in Syria, he said, are further proof that the West has over-estimated the strength of adversary states. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan made a similar observation as he defended the Biden administration's record. The partnership between Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea 'has not happened because these countries are so strong. It has happened out of necessity, because these countries are under pressure. Russia, under pressure in Ukraine, had to turn to Iran for munitions and North Korea for personnel. Iran, under pressure, tried to turn to Russia to get help because its attacks against Israel were defeated and its own air defenses were badly degraded. And if you look at China, when we came into this administration, the prevailing storyline was China will surpass the United States in economic strength by the end of this decade,&rdquo; he said, and that's no longer true. President-elect Trump acknowledged the difficulty the Russian regime is facing and made a connection to the collapse of the Assad regime, in a post on Truth Social. 'Russia, because they are so tied up in Ukraine, and with the loss there of over 600,000 soldiers, seems incapable of stopping this literal march through Syria, a country they have protected for years,&rdquo; he wrote. 'Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. THIS IS NOT OUR FIGHT. LET IT PLAY OUT. DO NOT GET INVOLVED!&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/multi-headed-monster-biden-trump-officials-address-threat-fromchina-russia-iran-coordination/401521/	2024-12-08T13:41:30-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/08/GettyImages_2152601665_1/large.jpg
A day in the diplomatic life of America’s defense secretary	VIENTIANE, Laos&mdash;From his first memo on the job, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has centered the tending and extending of ties with America's allies and military partners. One busy day&mdash;Wednesday, Nov. 20&mdash;offers a lens on the breadth and intricacy of his efforts. Austin had flown into this southeast Asian capital&mdash;part of a nine-day, four-country trip to the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;for the annual ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus, which this year gathered 19 regional defense leaders and their considerable staffs. He has attended the event in each of his four years as secretary, seizing the chance for face-to-face meeting with counterparts in a region central to U.S. defense strategy. 'People don't realize how much of the job of secretary of defense, particularly of this secretary of defense, is diplomatic,&rdquo; said one U.S. official who accompanied Austin on the trip. On Nov. 20, Austin arrived at the temple-roofed Lao National Conference Center for a series of meetings. Leading off: Austin's first in-person discussion with New Zealand Defense Minister Judith Collins, whose 13-month-old government is upping its regional-security contributions&mdash;for example, sending a warship through the Taiwan Strait for the first time since 2017. The defense chiefs discussed 'next steps for New Zealand's updated strategic documents and framework, and areas for expanded cooperation in the Pacific Islands region.&rdquo; Next up: a meeting with Cambodia's defense minister, part of a wider U.S. effort to woo Phnom Penh from China's ambit. The chiefs settled plans for a December visit by Adm. Samuel Paparo, who leads U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, and discussed trust-building projects such as military training, disaster assistance, and de-mining. Austin then met his Laotian counterpart, emerging with joint vows to accelerate work to clear the country of unexploded ordnance&mdash;much of it dropped by U.S. aircraft during the nine-year Secret War&mdash;and continued support for U.S. efforts to bring home troops' remains. And in the day's final 'bilat,&rdquo; Austin talked with Singapore's defense minister about getting the city-state's military more involved in multilateral efforts. This was a running theme of his trip: using American relationships to foster broader connections among friendly nations. A few days earlier, he had stopped in northern Australia to seal a deal to, among other things, bring Japanese forces into a long-running exercise of U.S. Marines and Australian troops. It's also a running theme of Austin's diplomatic efforts. In June, he laid it out in a speech to the Shangri-La conference in Singapore. 'You know, in the past, our experts would talk about a &lsquo;hub-and-spokes' model for Indo-Pacific security,&rdquo; he said. 'Today we're seeing something quite different. This new convergence is not a single alliance or coalition, but instead something unique to the Indo-Pacific&mdash;a set of overlapping and complementary initiatives and institutions, propelled by a shared vision and a shared sense of mutual obligation.&rdquo; In Laos on Nov. 20, Austin made this vision explicit. Having met individually with several of ASEAN military leaders throughout the day, he issued a late-afternoon message for all of them: 'U.S. Department of Defense Vision Statement for a Prosperous and Secure Southeast Asia,&rdquo; a 1,200-word declaration of support for a region 'free of coercion where safety, security, sovereignty, self-determination, and prosperity are shepherded by ASEAN centrality.&rdquo; The document outlines 'key lines of effort&rdquo;&mdash;mostly tactical things like exercises, training, and improving domain awareness. 'We really want to be able to operate with our partners more effectively and in more robust ways together,&rdquo; said one senior defense official. But the ultimate goal is strategic. It's no small thing to 'get a region's countries on board with a shared vision of shared values and shared purpose,&rdquo; as another put it. Austin's preparation Few U.S. defense secretaries can claim Austin's combination of battlefield leadership and diplomatic experience. He has commanded troops in combat as a one-, two-, three-, and four-star general&mdash;the latter as commander of U.S. Central Command, where he managed military relationships and wartime coalitions across a 21-country area of responsibility. Soon after President Biden appointed Austin in 2021, the new secretary issued a memo declaring that building and maintaining ties with allies and partners would be one of nine main thrusts of his tenure. Several months later, Austin was in Singapore, delivering a Fullerton Lecture entitled 'The Imperative of Partnership.&rdquo; An immediate challenge was Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, who had for five years sought to shift his country's security policy toward China and Russia. In July 2021, Austin sealed the U.S. ally's return to the fold at a meeting with Duterte in Manila. Not a year later, after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Austin helped rally international support for the besieged country, convening the Ukraine Defense Contact Group to coordinate military aid. Austin has been at the forefront of the Biden administration's efforts to manage international crises such as the Israel-Gaza war, Iran and Israel's exchange of air strikes, China's increasing aggressiveness, and more. Austin, in fact, had invited his Chinese counterpart to meet at the ASEAN event here, part of a long-running effort to bolster military-to-military ties. But on the eve of the conference, Chinese officials declined, citing a recent sale of arms to Taiwan, a senior defense official told reporters traveling with Austin. 'The PRC's decision is a setback for the whole region,&rdquo; Austin told reporters later. 'As I've said consistently, the right time to meet is any time.&rdquo; &lsquo;The role we would expect' As Austin flew from country to country aboard the modified 747 that serves as a traveling command post, Austin's staff kept him informed as the White House approved a loosening of limits on Ukraine's employment of ATACMS missiles, Kyiv fired them at targets inside Russia, and Moscow retaliated with a ballistic missile strike near Dnipro. The continued flow of events underscored the substantial investment Austin makes in partner outreach. 'It takes time, and that can be the most valuable resource that leader has to spend,&rdquo; a staffer said. At a late-afternoon press conference on Nov. 20, Austin laid out what the trip&mdash;and his previous 11 to the region&mdash;mean to him. 'It means a lot,&rdquo; he said. 'You know, when we came on board, we designed a national defense strategy that placed the PRC as a pacing challenge. And despite all the things that we've been supporting around the globe, we've remained focused on that pacing challenge. We've strengthened our relationships with our allies and partners. We've helped them increase their capacity to be able to protect their own interests.&rdquo; 'We have not come to this region ever, on my watch, just to come. We've always done something to increase our capability, our access.&rdquo; He expressed optimism that the progress would stick even as a new administration takes over. 'I think we've put some things in place that will be lasting no matter what happens,&rdquo; he said. 'We've done amazing things like, you know, initiated the AUKUS project, which will add a generational capability, and in my view will contribute to greater stability and security throughout the region. &rdquo;We see things like Japan drastically increasing its investment in its own defense capabilities, investing in long-range strike, wanting to co-produce munitions with us. You see ROK [South Korea] and Japan working together, unlike they've done before. 'We're seeing things that we've not seen before, and it's because of the influence and the hard work of the United States of America.&rdquo; A few days earlier, his Australian counterpart credited Austin himself. 'Of all my counterparts around the world, Lloyd Austin is the person with whom I've been the most&mdash;but I'm really aware that I'm only one of 20 or 30 defense ministers around the world who would say the same thing. And that speaks volumes about the effort that Lloyd Austin has put in,&rdquo; Minister for Defence Richard Marles said at a Nov. 17 press conference. 'He has played the role we would expect of a secretary of defense of America.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/12/day-diplomatic-life-americas-defense-secretary/401516/	2024-12-08T05:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/07/austin_laos_IMG_3424/large.jpg
Russia in talks to send fighter jets to North Korea, INDOPACOM sa...	SIMI VALLEY, California&mdash;Russia may send North Korea 'formidable, but&hellip;early fourth-generation&rdquo; fighter jets, the leader of U.S. Indo-Pacom Command said Saturday. 'We've seen some agreement&rdquo; between Moscow and Pyongyang on the transfer of Russian MiG-29s and Su-27s, Adm. Samuel Paparo said at the Reagan National Defense Forum here. He did not say how many jets might be transferred. The move follows Pyongyang's dispatch of what Paparo said were 12,000 North Korean troops to Russia to fight Ukrainian forces. Paparo spoke at a time of crisis for South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote for his brief declaration of martial law this week, which some are calling a failed coup. 'The National Assembly has drawn up articles of impeachment, which require a two-thirds majority in order to pass. That remains to be seen,&rdquo; the U.S. commander said. Yoon issued an apology on Saturday, four days after rescinding his martial-law declaration and two after firing his defense minister Kim Yong Hyun. Paparo said there was little chance that the drama would affect regional security. 'There is a little bit of political uncertainty in Korea. I'm convinced that, from a security standpoint, there is stability,&rdquo; he said. The discussion turned to whether the incoming Trump administration would come to the self-governing island's defense if China invades. Donald Trump dodged the question on the campaign trail, but said in July: 'Taiwan should pay us for defense...You know, we're no different than an insurance company.&rdquo; Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., who leads the defense panel of the House Appropriations Committee, said he didn't want to speculate how the next administration would approach Taiwan policy, but judged it unlikely that U.S. policy would shift dramatically. Paparo, asked about the possibility of a shift, replied that open-source information indicates that a conflict in the Western Pacific would be devastating for the U.S. economy, and therefore the United States should strengthen its deterrence in the region. Calvert said this was one reason why Congress must focus on INDOPACOM's $11 billion unfunded priorities list and pass military budgets on time. But the question remains open how best to deter China from invading Taiwan, which officials have said is possible before 2027. Paparo declined to endorse a proposal to put Marines or other U.S. forces on Taiwan, a policy shift he said would be 'provocative.' 'The real key to success is for the enablement of Taiwan to be more effective,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/12/russia-talks-send-fighter-jets-north-korea-indopacom-says/401520/	2024-12-07T16:15:02-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/07/Russian_Air_Force_ae_2500/large.jpg
Want ‘government efficiency'? Help change agencies from within	Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have been tweeting up a storm about creating a Department of Government Efficiency &mdash; although to listen to some of what they are saying, such a department has already come into being through their tweets. Most accounts of this effort have emphasized their calls for eliminating 'inefficient&rdquo; programs or cutting 'inefficient&rdquo; regulation of business. No prizes for guessing the kinds of regulations or programs they are likely to find most inefficient, as we can be certain it is ones that constrain the ability of companies to do what they want, rather than the internal procedures inside government agencies that constrain their ability to make sensible choices rather than checking boxes for rule compliance. But there is absolutely nothing in the Musk-Ramaswamy pronouncements about making the government more efficient by causing it to work better. Many of the anecdotes about egregious instances of inefficiency are exaggerated. Nonetheless, it is estimated by GAO that $60 billion in fraudulent payments were made during the COVID-19 pandemic, and anyone who has spent time in an agency can come up with many small examples of worthless uses of funds. But we need to understand that an important constituency for better government performance is actually among civil servants themselves. I know from my own experience working on organizational change in agencies from a perch in the Office of Management and Budget many years ago that there are many career civil servants&mdash;not all, but a significant group that I called at the time a 'change vanguard&rdquo;&mdash;who believed in and were committed to improving their agency's performance. My approach while in government was to unleash those people to pursue the changes they sought but had previously not been empowered to undertake. Those people were the backbone for creating changes I could never have done with the small staff I had in the White House. Back in those days, civil servants conceived and pushed important operational changes in how government worked. For example, the old system of buying food for soldiers involved developing a government specification for everything from ketchup to chocolate chip cookies and buying from the lowest bidder producing to the specification. Under a new arrangement that civil servants in the Defense Logistics Agency conceived, the government sampled a range of commercially available items and bought more or fewer depending on what soldiers ate. Other examples of beneficial changes include the switch from buying individual shrink-wrapped software to paying for site licenses (although it took a decade to adopt this practice) and the use of online auctions to buy products. These changes didn't come out of the White House, or from some version of a Musk-Ramaswamy 'Department of Government Efficiency.&rdquo; They came from career civil servants working in many agencies who had ideas people in the White House could never have thought of themselves. Musk and Ramaswamy are in a similar situation. They can't bring about performance improvements in government by themselves; they need to work with those inside the agencies seeking a more efficient government. Unfortunately, this is unlikely to happen, both because Musk and Ramaswamy are committed to demonizing and diminishing the federal workforce and because performance improvement is not really part of their agenda. This is a missed opportunity. If these two really wanted to make a difference rather than making ideology, they would talk about improving performance and not just slashing agencies, and they would seek to engage allies from our career civil servants. That is more likely to accomplish something than what they are doing instead.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/12/department-government-efficiency-what-about-government-performance/401518/	2024-12-07T10:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/12/07/120624MuskRamaswamyNG/large.jpg
