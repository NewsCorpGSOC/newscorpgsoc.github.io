FBI: 'Not credible' bomb threats tied to Russian email addresses	Bomb threats that have slowed or delayed polling processes around the nation appear to be tied to a slew of Russian email addresses, the FBI said in a Tuesday afternoon statement. 'The FBI is aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states, many of which appear to originate from Russian email domains. None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,&rdquo; the statement reads. Russia propagated a fake bomb threat targeting a polling place in Georgia, whose Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Tuesday such a threat was not credible. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has not observed any sustained, coordinated influence operation that's been built on the bomb threats, though agency senior advisor Cait Conley said, 'We should not be surprised if we do, because, as we've been saying for months, our foreign adversaries will seek out opportunities and capitalize on those opportunities&rdquo; to undermine confidence in the administration of the election. Moscow has backed election-disinformation efforts over the past several months, aiming to tip the election to GOP candidate Donald Trump, previous intelligence assessments have stated. Kremlin spin doctors also created a video purporting to show a person from Haiti claiming to have fraudulently voted several times in counties around Georgia, the U.S. intelligence community said Friday. Russia's foreign ministry did not return a request for comment on Tuesday afternoon's FBI attribution. 'We are in communication with impacted entities and will continue to provide support as possible,&rdquo; said Conley in a Tuesday afternoon briefing with reporters. 'While incidents may occur and things like this may cause temporary disruptions to the process, there are measures in place that election officials have implemented to ensure the security and resilience of the overall election administration process.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] Broadly speaking, America's cyber and infrastructure defense agency still isn't clocking any serious national-level threats to election security as of 2:30 p.m. EST, as most polls around the nation have opened. Myriad technical incidents have surfaced throughout Election Day. Voters in Pennsylvania's Cambria and Bedford counties reported software glitches with their voting machines. A court order issued in Cambria extended open voting times to allow for affected individuals to cast their ballot. In New York City, some Queens-based polling sites faced ballot-scanning issues, though the city's Board of Elections said that 'voters have not been impacted beyond additional attempts to scan their ballot&rdquo; and some have placed them into a back-up bin to be counted later, according to a post on X. Various scanning glitches have been observed in Virginia, Alabama, Minnesota, and a handful of other states, though volunteers at polling sites are working to ensure those ballots are cast and counted, according to a statement from Verified Voting, a group focused on mitigating technology risks in the administration of U.S. elections.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russian-email-domains-sent-uncredible-bomb-threats-polling-places-fbi-says/400843/	2024-11-05T12:10:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/05/110524georgiaNG-1/large.jpg
So far, no 'national-level significant incidents' on Election Day...	The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is tracking no 'national-level significant incidents&rdquo; that would affect the security of today's presidential election, a top agency official said Tuesday morning. Cait Conley, a CISA senior advisor focused on election infrastructure security, told reporters that the DHS agency is 'tracking instances of extreme weather&rdquo; and minor infrastructure disruptions that are largely expected and tend to be routine for election officials. Conley did not say where these were occurring. 'We are not currently tracking any national-level significant incidents impacting the security of our election infrastructure,&rdquo; she said in a briefing. The remarks come as Americans go to the polls to cast their vote in what's expected to be a deadlocked election between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Last night, the intelligence community said that it was tracking a slew of Russian and Iranian-affiliated online activity that's seeking to turn the tide of the election. 'Russia is the most active threat. Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences, judging from information available to the IC,&rdquo; the statement says. This morning, the FBI warned of instances in which its name and authoritative status was being exploited to peddle false narratives about the safety of the election. One case involves a fabricated newsclip purporting to show a terrorist threat warning, while another is a sham statement saying Americans should 'vote remotely&rdquo; because of terrorism risks at polling stations. 'This video is not authentic and does not accurately represent the current threat posture or polling location safety,&rdquo; FBI said in a statement. CISA is running an election-operations room in Arlington, Virginia, where the agency has gathered election coordinating partners plus federal entities, including Postal Service officials and the FBI, Conley said. There are also ten regional election-security advisors on site that represent different parts of the country. The operations center has lines of communication with the intelligence community. Most of the operations nexus functions in an unclassified manner, but there are classified sections made available in the event staff need briefings on nation-state or cybercriminal operatives seeking to meddle in the election process, she added. [[Related Posts]] CISA is notably not in active communication with social media firms, a dynamic born out of what eventually became a Supreme Court case that considered whether Biden administration agencies have the ability to stay in contact with social media platforms about removing posts that could contain disinformation. The court sided with the Biden White House in June, providing agencies a form of legal cover to help take down mis- and disinformation. But CISA has still taken a more cautious approach amid prevailing GOP concerns of content censorship. 'As we've said in previous statements, we are not engaging directly with social media companies, but if a threat were to arise that would necessitate us to do so, we would absolutely reach out,&rdquo; Conley said. 'With respect to when we engage [with social platforms], in terms of foreign malign influence or disinformation &mdash; at the federal-government level &mdash; there is a process that is outlined to do so.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/cisa-has-not-clocked-any-national-level-significant-incidents-impacting-election-official-says/400833/	2024-11-05T10:02:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/05/110524ConleyNG-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: National Guard on alert; Russian bomb plot?; USAF’s ...	Hundreds of National Guard troops are activated or on standby as Election Day begins. About 125 guardsmen are currently activated for operations across 10 states 'in general support or in supporting cyber networks,&rdquo; Ellis Hopkins, deputy division chief for National Guard current operations, told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday. None are in 'a civil disturbance or civil response mode.&rdquo; More states and Washington, D.C., have put units on stand-by and plan to activate them on Tuesday or later in the week, increasing the total number of guardsmen to roughly 250 total, according to a defense official. The states with current missions include Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington state. Units are on standby in Colorado, D.C., Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. Oregon also has some more on standby. U.S. intelligence agencies have warned of potential civil unrest on and after Election Day. Oregon and Washington began activating guardsmen after ballot boxes were set on fire in their states. As well, the National Guard has been stepping up its cyber support during recent elections to ward off potential attacks. Defense One's Audrey Decker has a bit more, here. Why might there be civil unrest? For one thing, Russia is pushing lies about potential election fraud in swing states, the intel community says. The effort aims to 'undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans,&rdquo; according to a joint statement released Monday evening by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Academic researchers are seeing the same thing. Several groups that traffic in pro-Kremlin stories across social media shifted their focus in recent months from attacking the Ukrainian government to undermining the Democratic nominee for president, according to a recent report from Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub. The report looks at the network behind Storm-1516, an pro-Russian disinformation campaign that is trying to shift Western public opinion on Ukraine and NATO. More, here. For another, GOP candidate Donald Trump has been lying about the integrity of the electoral process ever since he lost the 2020 election, pushing false claims about electoral fraud to the heart of his campaign. His efforts to sow these doubts have found an increasingly enthusiastic helper in Elon Musk, whose election-doubting posts on his X social network are shared 9 times more than his less extreme election content. 'That's despite many of Musk's claims &mdash; like alleged noncitizen voting &mdash; being false,&rdquo; NBC News reports after analyzing hundreds of the billionaire's posts. Read, here. One more thing: A 24-year-old white supremacist was arrested Saturday while trying to 'attack Nashville's power grid using a drone carrying an explosive device,&rdquo; the Department of Justice announced Monday. His violent plotting appears to have begun in June, when he told someone he wanted to commit a mass shooting at a YMCA facility. But the following month, he shifted his attention to attacking large interstate substations because, as he told an undercover informant, 'if you want to do the most damage as an accelerationist, attack high economic, high tax, political zones in every major metropolis.&rdquo; The day of the attack, he 'participated in a Nordic ritual, which included reciting a Nordic prayer and discussing the Norse god Odin,&rdquo; the Justice Department says. Shortly afterward, he 'was at the rear of the vehicle, with the drone powered up, and the explosive device was armed and located next to the drone&rdquo; when agents arrested him and took him into custody. 'If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison,&rdquo; the Department of Justice said. Read more, here.

On this day in 2017, a troubled Air Force veteran killed 26 people and wounded nearly two dozen others in a mass shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Suspected Russian sabotage Russia's military spies were behind a plot to place bombs on cargo planes flying to the U.S. and Canada this summer, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing European security officials. The incendiary devices were mailed in July via a DHL facility in Lithuania, and eventually caught fire at a different facility in Leipzig, Germany, as well as in Birmingham, England, triggering a multinational investigation. The BBC reports a third fire ignited at a transport company in Jablonow, Poland, near Warsaw; that incident took two hours to extinguish. The fires began in electric massage machines containing a magnesium-based substance. 'Magnesium-based fires are hard to put out, especially on board a plane,&rdquo; the BBC reports. The efforts appear to have been a 'test run,&rdquo; Polish officials allege. What's more, 'An aircraft far from land and over an ocean would have been at risk of going down,&rdquo; German authorities said, according to the Journal. The latest: 'Polish authorities have arrested four people and are searching for two more in connection with the case,&rdquo; NBC News reports. More, here. Around the services Air Force hedges on next-gen tanker plans: The U.S. Air Force has been devising plans to develop a future tanker called the Next Generation Air Refueling System, or NGAS, to use in contested operations in the Indo-Pacific, as China develops new counter-air systems that can threaten tankers at longer ranges. The problem: Building a new tanker from scratch doesn't look possible any time soon, so the service might resort to simply enhancing its current fleet of tankers, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Friday at the service's annual Airlift/Tanker Association Symposium. 'Unfortunately, any new design cannot be fielded for several years at best, even if affordable,&rdquo; Kendall said. Coming soon: The service plans to wrap up a study on NGAS and finish a review of the service's sixth-generation fighter jet program, called Next Generation Air Dominance, by the end of the year, to inform the service's 2026 budget request. Leaders paused the next-gen fighter program so they can take another look at cost projections, new threats, and the advent of other technologies, like new robot wingmen called collaborative combat aircraft. Defense One's Audrey Decker has more, here. Update: An American soldier injured while working to build a pier for residents in Gaza passed away on Thursday, CNN reported Monday. His name is Quandarius Davon Stanley, and he was a 23-year-old sergeant from a transportation brigade based at Virginia's Joint Base Langley-Eustis. Stanley and two others were 'injured out on a ship at sea&rdquo; in May, though not from a combat-related incident, according to Central Command officials. The two others 'were immediately returned to duty after suffering minor injuries,&rdquo; but Stanley was transferred to medical facilities first in Israel, and later to Texas in June.

During that same time, the U.S. paused a single shipment of 2,000-pound bombs, 'which Israel maintains a stockpile of,&rdquo; John Hudson of the Washington Post reported Monday. Despite those billions in weapons sent, Republican Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Rep. Michael McCaul wrote a letter to Biden late last week insisting Biden lift the hold, criticizing the single paused shipment as 'downright dangerous&rdquo; and 'misguided.&rdquo; Read the letter here. Industry New: Boeing workers ended their seven-week strike Monday evening, which means about 33,000 workers are headed back to their jobs as soon as Wednesday and no later than November 12.

Russia is pushing election-fraud lies in swing states, US intelli...	Hours before millions of Americans head to the polls on Tuesday, the U.S. intelligence community said Russia is spreading fake news stories to create the perception that officials in key swing states are preparing to commit various acts of election fraud. 'Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences, judging from information available to the IC,&rdquo; says a joint statement released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close.&rdquo; The fake article, posted and amplified by Russian influence operators, claims that U.S. officials across swing states are planning to stuff ballots, conduct cyber attacks against election infrastructure, and use a 'range of tactics&rdquo; to 'undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans,&rdquo; the statement said. The Russian actors aim, in part, to convince the American public that election-related violence is spreading and to frighten voters, it said. In Arizona, Russian actors created and spread a fake news article depicting an interview claiming that state officials created fake ballots and changed voter rolls in order to favor Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. 'The Arizona Secretary of State has already refuted the video's claim as false,&rdquo; the statement said. 'We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close,&rdquo; it said. [[Related Posts]] Iran also continues to be a 'foreign influence threat&rdquo; to U.S. elections, the statement said: 'As noted in a prior update, we have assessed that Iran has conducted malicious cyber activities to compromise former President Trump's campaign. Iranian influence actors may also seek to create fake media content intended to suppress voting or stoke violence, as they have done in past election cycles.&rdquo; The announcement came just hours after CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters that 'our election infrastructure has never been more secure and that the election community has never been better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections.'	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russia-pushing-election-fraud-lies-swing-states-us-intelligence-community-says/400814/	2024-11-04T19:48:28-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/GettyImages_2179051502/large.jpg
Hundreds of National Guard troops are activated or on standby ahe...	The National Guard has hundreds of troops activated or on standby across the country to defend against cyber attacks and support operations during Tuesday's presidential election. About 125 guardsmen are currently working on operations across 10 states. More states and Washington, D.C., have put units on stand-by and plan to activate them on Tuesday or later in the week, increasing the total number of guardsmen to roughly 250 total, according to a defense official. The states with current missions include Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington state. Units are on standby in Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Oregon also has some on standby. States are preparing for all possibilities as U.S. intelligence agencies warn of potential civil unrest on and after Election Day. Oregon and Washington began activating guardsmen after ballot boxes were set on fire in their states. But as of now, none of the National Guard units are in 'a civil disturbance or civil response mode. They're in general support or in supporting cyber networks,&rdquo; said Ellis Hopkins, deputy division chief for NGB current operations. [[Related Posts]] In recent years, the National Guard has been stepping up its cyber support around election time to ward off potential attacks. The guardsmen will only be activated or on standby during election week, Hopkins said. In January, the National Guard will send troops to support the presidential inauguration; more than two dozen states have signed up to send help, said Col. Jean Paul Laurenceau, NGB's chief of future operations. The Bureau hasn't received an official request for assistance from the DC Guard for the inauguration, but historically they've activated about 4,000 to 6,000 troops for the event, he said. When a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as Congress certified the election on Jan. 6, 2021, it took the National Guard hours to help Capitol Police restore order&mdash;due to miscommunication and confusion over whether the Guard could deploy. Laurenceau said the Guard still hasn't planned for the 'rules of the use of force&rdquo; in 2025 because they haven't received the request for assistance yet, which will dictate what they're able to do. 'One of the things we'll do is publish that rule on the use of force to all our soldiers, and that's one of the key training that they will go through as they make their way into D.C. But the No. 1 thing is that part of that rules on the use of force is that this is a civilian-supported mission, and so when you start talking about what you're able to do [and] where, it really is very important to us that we understand that, and that's what we'll understand and adhere specifically to that,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/hundreds-national-guard-troops-are-activated-or-standby-ahead-election-day/400813/	2024-11-04T16:59:43-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/GettyImages_1712521807/large.jpg
Report shows how Kremlin-linked group ramped up US election inter...	Several groups that traffic in pro-Kremlin stories across social media shifted their focus in recent months from undermining the Ukrainian government to undermining Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Kamala Harris, according to a new report from Clemson University. The report, released Friday by Clemson's Media Forensics Hub, looks at the network behind Storm-1516, an ongoing pro-Russian disinformation campaign targeting Western public opinion on Ukraine and NATO. The research, led by professors Patrick Warren and Darren Linvill, builds on the early investigative work on the Internet Research Agency to uncover the interconnected web of organizations and individuals supporting Storm-1516. That group, well known by watchers of Western disinformation, has a lot in common with other Russian-linked entities that are less well-known, like the Russian Foundation to Battle Injustice, or R-FBI, and the BRICS Journalist Association. The groups coordinate to amplify stories in order to hurt perceptions of Ukraine among Western audiences, which they refer to as 'narrative laundering&rdquo; or 'a process with the goal to conceal the origins and sourcing of false or misleading information,&rdquo; say the researchers. The groups use similar tactics, such as fabricating local news publications to make disinformation seem more credible. And there are big overlaps in the online networks that spread their stories. Storm-1516 and R-FBI both 'employed West African diaspora actors to play the role of Black Americans.&rdquo; 'We believe&hellip;that Storm-1516 and the R-FBI are part of a common structure. The R-FBI and BJA maintain a distribution network for the wider organization, to distribute both their content and the content attributed to Storm-1516,&rdquo; the report's authors wrote. [[Related Posts]] R-FBI's stories&mdash;52 between August 2023 and October 2024&mdash;can be very successful. A narrative, about Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska using Western aid money to buy jewelry from Cartier, had 52,732 posts on X within a week of it the group first publishing on it, meaning that X users had created 52,732 separate X posts off the story , the researchers said, accounting for '10.6% of the total conversation addressing Zelensky or Zelenska in that week.&rdquo; R-FBI recently turned their attention to the U.S. presidential election, to push false stories about Harris and running-mate Tim Walz, such as a discredited claim that Walz sexually abused a minor, and that Harris hit a child with a car and fled the scene, among others. The report comes as officials have flagged Russian election interference across the globe. In Moldova's recent election, officials called out Russian vote-buying and anonymous bomb threats to polling stations. In the country of Georgia, officials have blamed the Kremlin for massive voter intimidation efforts. The Russian government has on-going military operations in both countries.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/report-shows-how-kremlin-linked-group-ramped-us-election-interference-efforts/400812/	2024-11-04T16:27:19-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/GettyImages_2181096933/large.jpg
Federal agencies are ready for the transition. Trump hasn't done ...	Federal agencies across government have met the statutory deadline to prepare their materials for whoever wins this week's election, though Donald Trump may be delayed in accessing them due to his ongoing refusal to participate in the formal transition process. The Biden administration met its Nov. 1 deadline to finalize the briefing documents that agencies will offer to the winning side's transition team when designated career staff begin meeting as soon as this week, a General Services Administration spokesperson said on Monday. The materials outline the basics of that agency's operations and include some detail on ongoing and future projects. Unlike Vice President Kamala Harris' team, Trump's team has signed no agreement to work with the current administration, which could bog down the process if he wins, former Trump and federal transition officials said. Even if the election remains too close for the General Services Administration to make an official declaration&mdash;or 'ascertainment,&rdquo; as it is referred to in federal statute&mdash;of who won and is therefore eligible to proceed into the second, post-election phase of the transition, a reform President Biden signed into law would enable both Harris and Trump to receive the newly finalized materials and send their 'landing teams&rdquo; into agencies. Trump's decision not to sign a memorandum of understanding with GSA and the White House could cause delays, as agencies may not have the required heads-up from his team of which individuals will deploy into their offices. Typically, the screening to provide access to agencies takes place before polls close. 'Agencies want to know who is coming in on the days after the election,&rdquo; said Rich Bagger, who led Trump's transition team in 2016. 'They need to know who to let in&hellip;they wanted that information from us by Election Day.&rdquo; Bagger added that the exchange of information might be possible even without Trump's participation in the pre-election transition process, but the vast scope of the federal government would make that unwieldy without going through official channels. 'Because there were so many touch points, it was easier to do it in the official fashion,&rdquo; Bagger said. A former federal transition official told Government Executive that GSA is currently having discussions over how to handle access to buildings and classified materials for landing team members who have not been cleared. Under law, the official said, those individuals must be publicly disclosed and their ethics agreements posted in order to participate. Harris has already released her team's ethics agreement as part of its White House memorandum of understanding. There is a new wrinkle this cycle, under to a 2022 law giving both candidates access to transition funds and materials if neither one has conceded within five days of the election. Trump never conceded the election in 2020 and GSA waited weeks until it gave the official green light for transition activities to begin, which caused delays to Biden's transition efforts. This time around, under a similar circumstance, both Harris and Trump would have access to a segment of GSA's transition funds and be able to start working with agencies directly after five days. Once GSA designates that one side has won, the other team would have to cease its transition efforts. Trump's post-election transition planning was delayed in 2016 because he abandoned the efforts that Bagger and former Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., had led, opting to essentially start from scratch after his victory. Bagger said that the Trump team would have been prepared more quickly if it had used his work, noting that he had met before the election with the White House Transition Coordinating Council to go over big-picture steps and had participated in the Agency Directors Transition Council discussions each month that included what information each candidate's team wanted in their initial briefing materials. The team also engaged with the FBI on security clearances&mdash;a process Trump's team is now considering eschewing altogether&mdash;and coordinated with the Office of Government Ethics on what steps would be expected of potential political appointees. 'It seems it would be difficult to do [all of] that sitting completely outside that official process,&rdquo; Bagger said. Because Biden had engaged in that work, his team was setting up meetings within two hours of GSA's ascertainment in mid-November, the former federal transition official said. 'We had everything ready and the emails all set up,&rdquo; the former official said, referring to the .gov email addresses Biden transition team members received from the agencies to which they would be deploying. 'We just pressed the buttons.&rdquo; There is now a question of how quickly and even whether Trump could get his teams in place at agencies in the intervening period between the election and the new president's inauguration, as is customary. 'If they aren't submitting information, they can't get cleared,&rdquo; the official said. 'A lot of stuff that is normally happening that is not happening.&rdquo; GSA is gaming out its plans to be prepared for whatever outcome follows the election, the former federal transition official said. The agency has solicited input from its own and White House counsel. 'They have worked every scenario you can think of, and some you cannot think of,&rdquo; that person said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/agencies-have-completed-their-pre-election-transition-briefings-trump-may-still-not-get-them-time/400811/	2024-11-04T16:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/Republican_president_2500/large.jpg
Air Force hedges on next-gen tanker plans	Tomorrow's tankers might just be today's tankers with self-protection gear, Air Force officials say&mdash;because the service can't afford to pursue all its next-generation plans. The Air Force has been devising plans to develop a future tanker called the Next Generation Air Refueling System, or NGAS, to use in contested operations in the Indo-Pacific, as China develops new counter-air systems that can threaten tankers at longer ranges. But building a new tanker from scratch doesn't look possible any time soon, so the service might resort to simply enhancing its current fleet of tankers, said Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. 'Unfortunately, any new design cannot be fielded for several years at best, even if affordable. Other options include various ways of increasing the resilience of the current force. The need for improved connectivity and some degree of enhanced self-protection measure appears to be attractive from both an affordability and cost-effectiveness perspective. It's also something that can be accomplished in relatively short time frames at relatively low cost,&rdquo; Kendall said Friday at the service's annual Airlift/Tanker Association Symposium. The service plans to wrap up a study on NGAS and finish a review of the service's sixth-generation fighter jet program, called Next Generation Air Dominance, by the end of the year, to inform the service's 2026 budget request. Leaders paused the next-gen fighter program so they can take another look at cost projections, new threats, and the advent of other technologies, like new robot wingmen called collaborative combat aircraft. [[Related Posts]] The designs of all three of these new programs&mdash;NGAS, NGAD, and CCAs&mdash;are tied together, from an operational and cost perspective, Kendall said. But as things stand today, he said, there's not enough money to buy them all. 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be the availability of adequate resources to pursue any combination of those new designs. Right now, given our commitments, our resources and strategic priorities, it's hard for me to see how we can afford any combination of those new designs,&rdquo; Kendall said. Officials have warned that the 2026 budget will be even tighter than 2025, as other programs like the Sentinel ICBM replacement, are costing far more than initially projected, creating uncertainty around the service's next-gen aircraft programs. Funding the Space Force, modernizing both Air Force legs of the nuclear triad, building robust air base defense, and attacking adversaries' long-range kill chains are the service's top budget priorities, Kendall said. 'All of these are absolutely essential for the success of the Air Force and Space Force and the joint force, and all of them require substantial increased investments&hellip;notice that I haven't mentioned either NGAS or NGAD yet,&rdquo; Kendall said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/air-force-hedges-next-gen-tanker-plans/400805/	2024-11-04T13:49:29-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/Screenshot_2024_11_04_at_11.48.20AM/large.png
The D Brief: B-52s head to the Mideast; Russia’s progress, charte...	The Pentagon ordered more ships, fighter jets, and B-52 bombers to the Middle East this weekend, Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced Friday evening. The bombers arrived in the region Sunday, officials at Central Command said on social media. However, the full package won't arrive terribly quickly, Ryder said. Instead, 'These forces will begin to arrive in coming months as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group prepares to depart,&rdquo; he said. The Lincoln strike group has been in the region since August supporting Israel and U.S. forces nearby after pivoting away from an assignment in the Pacific over the summer. Talking points: 'These movements demonstrate the flexible nature of U.S. global defense posture and U.S. capability to deploy world-wide on short notice to meet evolving national security threats,&rdquo; Ryder said in a statement. 'Secretary Austin continues to make clear that should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,&rdquo; he warned. In case you missed it: Israel's military warned officials in Baghdad it may attack Iran-backed militias inside Iraq if nothing is done to suppress their recent attacks on Israel, Axios reported last week. Worth noting: The rate of strikes against Israel from Iraqi militias has sharply increased, 'from six attacks in August, to 37 in September, to 111 in October,&rdquo; according to the Washington Institute, which is tracking the allegations here. Israel's use of air-launched ballistic missiles in its recent strikes inside Iran have piqued others' interest in the weapon, Reuters says. 'The main advantage of an ALBM over an [air-launched cruise missile] is speed to penetrate defences,' said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. 'The downside&mdash;accuracy&mdash;looks to have been largely solved.' Read on, here.

And if you're not already subscribed, you can do that here. On this day in 1979, the Iran hostage crisis began. Russia's Ukraine invasion Ukrainian forces allegedly struck a Russian S-300/400 air defense system southeast of Donetsk City, in occupied eastern Ukraine, using a half dozen or so U.S.-provided ATACMS missiles on Saturday. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War tallied six more alleged strikes on Russian air defense systems (often Buk M2s and M3s) across occupied Ukraine over the past two weeks. Why bring it up: 'Russia has struggled to source the microelectronic components&rdquo; critical for these air defense systems 'due to Western sanctions,&rdquo; ISW wrote Saturday evening. If those attacks persist, 'Russia may not be able to produce or repair a sufficient number of air defense systems to maintain the current density of Russia's air defense coverage.&rdquo; Similar Ukrainian strikes could also affect Russian air force targeting and glide bomb strikes in the weeks ahead, ISW said. Update: Russia has reportedly armed North Korean soldiers with AK-12 assault rifles, RPK/PKM machine guns, SVD/SVCh sniper rifles, Phoenix anti-tank guided missiles, 60mm mortars, and RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launchers, Ukrainian officials said Saturday. Others may have night vision equipment, thermal imagers, and other optics including more traditional binoculars. Russian forces are increasingly targeting Ukrainian medics, according to the Economist, which reports that in some frontline locations, 'If you put a red cross on a car, you'll be fired on within 15 minutes.&rdquo; Accelerating invasion, charted: Compare Russia's month-to-month territorial gains in a recent illustration from conflict analyst War Mapper, posted Saturday on social media. October 'was Russia's largest monthly net gain since the start of the war, surpassing last month's 467.7km&sup2;,&rdquo; he writes. Election Day preparations The National Guard has been put on standby in the Pacific Northwest in case of unrest on Election Day, CNN reported Saturday. That includes troops in Oregon, Washington, and Nevada. 'Based upon general and specific information and concerns regarding the potential for violence or other unlawful activity related to the 2024 general election, I want to ensure we are fully prepared to respond to any potential additional civil unrest,&rdquo; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Friday. Coming soon: Pentagon officials are set to brief the media on the Guard's 'various election support roles&rdquo; Monday afternoon. Developing: Far-right groups are ready to dispute votes in Democratic areas, the New York Times reports after analyzing more than a million messages across almost 50 Telegram channels. 'Some posted images of armed men standing up for their rights to recruit for their cause. Others spread conspiracy theories that anything less than a Trump victory on Tuesday would be a miscarriage of justice worthy of revolt.&rdquo; Additional reading: 'Russia feigns indifference over U.S. election but roots quietly for Trump,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Sunday from Moscow; '&lsquo;Every single American' a target of election interference, former DHS official says,&rdquo; Nextgov reported last week from a panel discussion with Suzanne Spaulding, who led the predecessor organization to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; And 'Russia produced fake video of immigrant election fraud in Georgia, officials say,&rdquo; Nextgov reported late last week. Navy cruisers New: The Navy says it will extend the lives of three cruisers. The USS Gettysburg (CG 64), Chosin (CG 65), and Cape St. George (CG 71) will each receive maintenance and modifications to give them a total of ten years of extra service life, with the first of these expected in 2026, the service announced Monday. Those 30-plus-year-old ships are the youngest of the Ticonderoga class, whose oldest members the Navy has sought for years to retire, arguing that the money sunk into keeping them battle-ready would be better spent on new ships. In 2022, half of the Navy's unexpected maintenance days were due to Tico problems. Congress has generally refused, saying that the nation needs the cruisers' missile capacity tubes and accusing the Navy of slow-walking repairs. Last year, Navy Times offered a status report they called 'The Navy's continuing cruiser debacle.&rdquo; That makes 15 ships the Navy has recently announced will operate beyond their design lifespan. A dozen destroyers will also operate beyond their 35-year windows, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro announced last week. That plan was finalized after a 10-month evaluation conducted this calendar year amid what officials say is a shipbuilding budget shortfall. Expert reax: 'If we're going to have the Navy we need to counter the threats we face,&rdquo; retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery told Defense One, 'you're going to have to change the top line on Navy ship building in a fairly dramatic way&hellip;or you're going to have to reimagine where you build things at a labor cost you can afford.&rdquo; What are your thoughts on the state of U.S. Navy shipbuilding?

Defense officials to talk acquisition, business priorities Nov. 1...	The coming months will be a time of transition across the U.S. military, with a new president-elect and administration likely to lay out new defense priorities in the face of increasing conflict around the globe. Many ongoing Pentagon efforts, however, will persist regardless of the administration in place. Chief among them: improving the acquisition process and making the best of budget uncertainty. From building ships to buying cutting-edge software, the Defense Department will continue to modernize the way it buys increasingly complex technology and tools to meet its needs, from warfighters on the battlefield to leaders in the E-ring. On Nov. 13, Defense One will convene defense officials, lawmakers, and industry leaders at its State of Defense Business event to discuss these challenges and more.

Russia produced fake video of immigrant election fraud in Georgia...	Kremlin spin doctors are responsible for creating a video purporting to show a person from Haiti claiming to have fraudulently voted several times in counties around Georgia, the U.S. intelligence community said Friday. The video, which has been shared by some well-known Republicans, depicts a man alleging he immigrated from Haiti six months ago and swiftly gained U.S. citizenship. He claims to possess multiple state IDs, allowing him to vote for Kamala Harris across multiple counties in Georgia. The man also encourages all Haitians to move to America with their families. 'This judgment is based on information available to the IC and prior activities of other Russian influence actors, including videos and other disinformation activities. The Georgia Secretary of State has already refuted the video's claims as false,&rdquo; said the statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI. Georgia's Republican Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, asked X to remove the video involving the purported Haitian man. 'This is false and a clear example of targeted disinformation in this election,&rdquo; Raffensperger wrote, suggesting it was likely 'created by Russian troll farms.&rdquo; Another video accusing a person tied to Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign of taking a bribe from a U.S. entertainer was also manufactured by Russia, according to the intelligence community's statement. An official from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, speaking on the condition of anonymity under agency-set press guidelines, said the U.S. is 'very concerned about how our foreign adversaries will specifically target after Election Day&rdquo; during the period of time in which state and local officials undertake procedures to certify the election's results. That time window 'is an opportunity where our adversaries are likely to try to capitalize and to undermine the American people's confidence in the outcome of the election, regardless of who wins,&rdquo; the CISA official said. Recent foreign influence attempts leading up to Nov. 5 are keeping officials hyper alert. The efforts have accelerated in recent weeks and months, conducted by Russia, Iran and China, the latter two of which have successfully compromised tangible confidential data or communications of the two major presidential campaigns that are deadlocked in national polls. Russian election disinformation campaigns 'pose a real risk,&rdquo; Neal Higgins, a former deputy White House national cyber director, said in an interview. 'The Russians have made clear that they are determined to use disinformation to undermine American democracy. Eight years ago that was through leaked emails and false stories,&rdquo; said Higgins, a partner at law firm Eversheds Sutherland. 'Now it's through cheap-fake and deep fake videos, including videos falsely alleging election irregularities.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russia-produced-fake-video-immigrant-election-fraud-georgia-officials-say/400765/	2024-11-02T05:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/01/110124georgiaNG-1/large.jpg

New solid-rocket maker aims to start production next year	Colorado-based propulsion company Ursa Major plans to start building solid rocket motors next year at scale&mdash;moving from concept to production in just a year and a half. 'We have, in the last 18 months, rapidly scaled our internal team and the technology of making solid rocket motors. We've static fired over 300 [motors] this year. We're rapidly scaling capacity,&rdquo; said Bill Murray, Ursa Major's chief product officer and head of solid rocket motors. The company is one of a few new entrants eyeing the solid rocket motor business&mdash;an industry that has been consolidated into two domestic suppliers: Aerojet Rocketdyne and Northrop Grumman. With global conflict straining existing production lines, the Pentagon has been trying to foster new ones. In September, the Pentagon awarded Ursa Major $12.5 million to advance the company's motor manufacturing process, using money from the Office of Strategic Capital, an entity created to fuel technology development through private investor funds. This followed an April award from the Navy to test the company's Mk 104 motor, used in the Navy's Standard Missile family of weapons. The U.S. military's consumption of Standard Missiles is 'completely unsustainable right now in current conflicts,&rdquo; Murray said. The Navy has been running through its inventory of missiles during a year of engagements in the Mediterranean and Red Sea regions. [[Related Posts]] Ursa Major is using a new manufacturing process it calls Lynx, which uses 3D printing to build multiple types of motors without expensive re-tooling. Murray said the industry hasn't changed the way it's produced rocket motors in more than 60 years, using inflexible, expensive production lines that need long-lead tooling and are vulnerable to parts shortages. The company's new Lynx approach can adapt to demand changes, he said. 'Really, it's just more value-added to the U.S. taxpayer, and again, faster delivery. That really matters a lot, especially when new conflicts arise [and] we run out of one munition that we really didn't forecast appropriately. We can backfill that very quickly with our process,&rdquo; Murray said. The company is expanding its facilities and hiring more people in Berthoud, Colorado, where it produces inert components, motor cases and energetics; and Youngstown, Ohio, where it does a lot of the additive manufacturing. Murray didn't say how many motors it intends to build in Colorado, but said they aim to be in production on 'multiple motor programs in 2025 and 2026.&rdquo; The Lynx process can produce motors between two and 22 inches in diameter, which includes missiles like the Stinger, Javelin, GMLRS, and air-defense interceptors. The company's motor programs still need to get through several qualifications before they can be used by the military, but that process will happen as the company gets into low-rate initial production, Murray said. In order to get into qualification, the company needs to reach a certain production capacity because it's proving out the manufacturing process, in addition to the motor design. Ursa Major plans to make many components in-house, everything from cases to energetics, reducing reliance on the strained SRM supply chain. 'If we're going to do motor production the exact same way everyone else is, we're going to rely on the exact same strained vendors that are already trying to ramp up their production. So if we can go closest to the dirt&hellip;in our raw ingredients for the production of these motors, that'll set us up for success,&rdquo; Murray said. In addition to Ursa Major, other new companies like X-Bow and Anduril are trying to break into the solid rocket industry. Prime contractors are also hunting for their own supply of SRMs, like the recent teaming agreement between Lockheed and General Dynamics. 'The pie is growing right now. There is a lot of demand, and still, from everything I can tell, the DOD still will not meet its needs for multiple years to come. Additionally, it takes time for new companies to scale, develop technology, [and] get into production. It is a competitive environment&hellip;but there is room for more entrants, and there is plenty of room for them to stay and sustain business operations going forward,&rdquo; Murray said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/new-solid-rocket-maker-aims-start-production-next-year/400758/	2024-11-01T12:53:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/01/Screenshot_2024_11_01_at_9.51.38AM-1/large.png

‘Every single American’ a target of election interference, former...	Foreign adversaries aiming to influence next week's election and sway the outcome of the presidential race are targeting 'every single American&rdquo; in their efforts, a former Department of Homeland Security official warned Thursday. Suzanne Spaulding, who led the predecessor organization under DHS that later became the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said that nations including Russia and Iran are ramping up operations because the U.S. election is an existential issue for their position on the world stage. 'We are the target, and Americans should not take that lightly,&rdquo; Spaulding, now a senior homeland security policy adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said on an election security panel at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington, D.C.-based national security think tank. '[Americans] should be demanding of policymakers that they have a vigorous response to counter this activity.&rdquo; Foreign election disruption efforts have accelerated in the weeks and months leading up to the Nov. 5 presidential election. They've been conducted by Russia, Iran and China, the latter two of which have successfully compromised tangible confidential data or communications of the two major presidential campaigns that are deadlocked in national polls. Russia, meanwhile, has conducted complex and prolonged disinformation campaigns to sway Americans in favor of voting for former president Donald Trump, according to intelligence assessments. Adversaries will likely amplify disinformation campaigns about election results after Nov. 5 and may focus on domestic efforts to encourage physical violence between next month and Inauguration Day in January, officials warned last week. 'Americans should be confident about the legitimacy of [the election] process and the security of that process, and that's an important role that CISA plays,&rdquo; Spaulding said. 'CISA makes it very clear that Americans should look to authoritative sources, and to me, that is sources with first-hand information&rdquo; about developments, she said, encouraging Americans to lean on local officials administering the election next week. CISA Director Jen Easterly on Wednesday said the agency has 'not seen any evidence of foreign adversaries getting into our election infrastructure,&rdquo; a statement that's lined up with earlier public assessments from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/every-single-american-target-election-interference-former-dhs-official-says/400761/	2024-11-01T12:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/01/103124electionNG/large.jpg
The D Brief: Russia’s foreign-made drones; Ukraine’s EW-hardened ...	Ukrainian UAV wars: Russia launched 2,023 attacks against Ukraine using Iranian-designed drones last month, Ukrainian officials announced Friday. Those drones would have required an estimated 170,000 'foreign components,&rdquo; including microchips, microcontrollers, processors, voltage regulators, and transceivers. 'Without them, the Shaheds wouldn't fly,&rdquo; one official wrote on social media. The makers of those components include U.S.-based Texas Instruments, Analog Devices, CTS Electronic Components, and Maxim Integrated. Other components came from Switzerland's STMicroelectronics and U-Blox; China's Bixinda, and Ireland's Taoglas&mdash;all of which suggests the current sanctions regime isn't quite working as intended, the official said. Ukraine is now using U.S.-made, special-purpose drones built to withstand electronic interference, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reported Thursday after speaking with Brandon Tseng, president and co-founder of Shield AI, based in San Diego. How they worked: 'They launched from about 40 kilometers from the front, flew 100 kilometers past the front line of troops and then found these SA-11 surface-to-air missiles [on] 11 Buks, targeted them, called in HIMARS airburst rounds,&rdquo; Tseng explained. Why it matters: The ability to pass data quickly back to an artillery platform like a howitzer or Lockheed Martin HIMARS, is essential to taking out Russian positions, said Tseng. 'We flew within 1,000 meters of these jammers. No impact to our aircraft. It was wildly successful,&rdquo; he said. Next steps: Ukraine wants a lot more of these drones. Continue reading, here. A Ukrainian firm just built a new FPV drone designed specifically for intercepting Russian reconnaissance drones which spy target locations for Russian artillery, Kyiv-based United24 Media reported Friday. The new drone is called the Flamingo VB140; it has about a 30-mile range, and can fly in the dark as well as in the daytime. This week in drone adaptations, researcher Sam Bendett on Thursday flagged a 'Mad Max&rdquo;-looking Russian tank with multiple layers of protection against small Ukrainian FPV drones. 'The first layer is a net that initiates the drone's warhead or makes it get entangled. The second layer is the frame itself made of additional armor that reduces the impact, and the third layer is the main tank armor with dynamic protection, with &lsquo;everything else piled on top,'&rdquo; he writes. North Korean deployment update: About 3,000 North Korean military personnel are in Russia's Kursk Oblast and an unspecified number of North Korean engineers have allegedly deployed to Ukraine's occupied Donetsk Oblast, Ukrainian officials said Thursday. Stateside reax: The use of North Korean troops inside Ukraine may be 'more of a strategic messaging thing&rdquo; than a practical added benefit, said Mark Montgomery, retired U.S. Navy rear admiral and senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies in Washington. He recently returned from a trip to Ukraine and spoke to Defense One about his observations. On the one hand, the message from Russia 'could kind of accidentally be, you know, we're starting to reach our own limitations&rdquo; in terms of manpower and casualties on the battlefield, Montgomery said. However, North Korean artillery shells are a much more effective weapon in this conflict, he argued. 'The provision of the&mdash;it's hard to say how many, but&mdash;five to six million rounds of varying sizes up to 162, millimeter artillery? That's, I think, much more impactful on the battlefield&rdquo; than North Korean special forces. 'That's decades worth of U.S. production provided by North Korea to the Russians.&rdquo; 'I understand there might be some issues with some of the ammunition,&rdquo; he continued, 'but you know, quantity does have a quality all its own there. And if you're allowed to feed the Russians such artillery such that they can maintain a seven to eight to one outgoing to incoming ratio? That's a significant tactical operational impact. So to me, the ammunition has the biggest impact. [Whereas] Operationally, tactically&mdash;I think the troops are more of a strategic messaging thing.&rdquo; 'I would put the North Korean artillery in front of the [Iran-designed] Shahed [drones], and the Shaheds in front of the North Korean infantry in terms of tactical or operational relevance,&rdquo; he said. 'But again, this is about strategic messaging.&rdquo; Montgomery's advice for the U.S. in terms of improving support to Ukraine: Send AMRAAM and Patriot air defense interceptor rounds as promptly as possible. The U.S. also needs to provide Ukraine targeting data (satellite imagery, e.g.) much faster than it has been, he said. That means as fresh as 'eight or 12 minutes, or, you know, at least in the under a half hour kind of range&rdquo; instead of eight or 12 hours, as is often the case. 'I would not use that in combat,&rdquo; he said. The White House should also extend the range at which Ukraine can target Russian positions 'within a reasonable distance of Ukraine's traditional borders.&rdquo; When asked what range he would recommend, he replied, 'Three to 400 kilometers. And if they want to strike something beyond that,&rdquo; they can use one of their domestically-manufactured long-range drones, which have targeted Russian oil facilities, for example.

US-made jam-resistant drones helped Ukrainians cut through Russia...	When Russian jamming neutered the recon drones flown by a group of Ukrainian special operators near Dnipro in August, they turned to a new solution: V-BAT drones built to withstand the massive electronic interference used by both sides in the war in Ukraine. 'They launched from about 40 kilometers from the front, flew 100 kilometers past the front line of troops and then found these SA-11 surface-to-air missiles [on] 11 Buks, targeted them, called in HIMARS airburst rounds,&rdquo; said Brandon Tseng, president and co-founder of Shield AI, the San Diego-based maker of the V-BATs. That destroyed the SAMs&mdash;and, Tseng said, marked a big operational test for the V-BATs: flying, collecting targeting data, and relaying it to artillery units, all in the face of the most sophisticated electronic warfare tactics on earth. Ukraine has some drones that can perform well against EW, but they work through autonomy and on-platform computing, good for one-way attack missions with whatever munitions can be squeezed onboard. But the ability to pass data quickly back to a fires solution with real power, like a howitzer or Lockheed Martin HIMARS, is essential to taking out Russian positions. This is what the V-BAT supplied to the Ukrainians, according to Tseng, who witnessed the operation first-hand. The 300-mile range of the V-BAT, even in the face of anti-aircraft defenses, gave the Ukrainians a new view of the battlefield. 'They were able to collect intelligence that they had never collected before was because they had a long-endurance aircraft that was able to watch things for long periods of time,&rdquo; Tseng said in a Thursday interview. 'That absolutely blew their minds, because, while they had some aircraft, some weapon systems that could go 60 kilometers, maybe 100 kilometers, the on-station time was like, for those aircraft for like, 10,15, minutes. So when you're comparing it against us who's loitering around for eight, 9,10, 11 hours, you know, after we get on-station&hellip;you just actually have the time space to actually find lots and lots of targets.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] Tseng and his team at Shield AI originally brought the drones to Ukraine to test against electromagnetic warfare effects in June. The drones proved able to work in jam-heavy environments in ways that others could not, according to a June report from the Ukrainian military obtained by Defense One. 'We flew within 1,000 meters of these jammers. No impact to our aircraft. It was wildly successful,&rdquo; Tseng said. But those June results didn't have the persuasive effect that Tseng was hoping for. 'There were skeptics on the NATO side, on the American side, that were like, &lsquo;You know, no one's passed this testing. All drones fail here; you guys are going to be like everybody else.'&rdquo; They insisted on an actual battlefield experiment against the enemy. Tseng's account was backed up by a Ukrainian operator who spoke to the Wall Street Journal on Thursday. In August, Tseng also testified before Congress on the battlefield deployment success. There is no silver bullet that can bring Ukraine victory, Defense Department officials routinely remind the public, often when discussing why they refuse to provide certain weapons, (or withhold permissions to use them in the way the Ukrainians would like). Despite that, some common themes are emerging after years of war. Ukraine's success against the larger Russian military is based in large part on their ability to move faster, firing off rounds and maneuvering quickly to duck Russian counterfire. But the Russians are fast learners. The Russians are far better supplied with ammunition, a problem exacerbated by continued debates among Western allies about whether to provide Ukraine with what observers say it needs. The V-BAT works to lessen both problems. First, its size&mdash;small enough to fit in an SUV&mdash;and vertical takeoff help the Ukrainians scoot and shoot. 'Airstrips, air fields are targeted. They're observed. They're watched, and so they're just highly vulnerable points. So if your aircraft requires a runway, it's really not a good, great place to be,&rdquo; Tseng said. And because the V-BAT can pass not just targeting data but also battle damage assessment, it helps Ukrainian forces make the most of their limited ammo. Without EW-hardened drones, Tseng said, 'they don't know if they're hitting things most of the time.&rdquo; Tseng said the next step is to integrate missiles onto the drone itself. 'We have launched, organically off the V-BAT, a Northrop Grumman munition called the Hatchet, which is a laser-guided munition that was a prototype capability [for] board kinetic effects, is being released late next year.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/us-made-jam-resistant-drones-are-helping-ukrainians-cut-through-russia-ew/400735/	2024-10-31T18:02:50-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/31/Screenshot_2024_10_31_at_2.54.22PM/large.png
Pilot error blamed for crash of F-35 that flew for 11 minutes aft...	The crash of an F-35 stealth fighter jet that went missing for more than 24 hours after the pilot ejected was caused by pilot error, a Marine Corps investigation found&mdash;but multiple system failures and bad weather contributed to the incident. An F-35B jet was flying in heavy rain near Joint Base Charleston on Sept. 17, 2023, when the pilot ejected, landing in a North Charleston neighborhood. But the F-35 stayed in the air for about 11 minutes after the ejection because of the jet's autonomy flight-control systems, according to a Marine Corps investigation released today. Partly due to the plane's stealth coating, it took about 30 hours for authorities to find the jet&mdash;during which social media users raised a number of strange theories and jokes about what could have happened. It was eventually found 64 nautical miles northeast of Joint Base Charleston. The investigators pinned the blame for the crash on the pilot, but said an 'electrical event&rdquo; caused multiple system failures&mdash;including both radios, the transponder, the tactical air navigation system, and the instrument landing system. The helmet-mounted display&mdash;the pilot's primary display system&mdash;and the panoramic cockpit display were not operational at least three times, the investigation said, which caused the pilot to become disoriented during the heavy rainstorm. 'The pilot incorrectly diagnosed an out-of-controlled flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft, albeit during a heavy rainstorm compounded with aircraft electrical and display malfunctions,&rdquo; the investigation says. [[Related Posts]] The report said the pilot had extensive experience in the AV-8B Harrier jet, but a was a 'relative novice&rdquo; in the F-35B. Following the crash, authorities couldn't find the fifth-generation fighter jet because the plane's transponder failed due to the electrical malfunction, according to the investigation, and the aircraft's stealth coating made it much harder to locate than a traditional aircraft. 'The loss of positive radar contact with the mishap aircraft resulted from a failed transponder caused by the electrical malfunction and the aircraft's eventual descent below the air-traffic control radar horizon. The loss of positive contact could also be partially attributed to the F-35B's low-observable technology,&rdquo; the investigation said. After the mishap and two deadly Marine Corps aviation crashes, the service mandated a two-day aviation stand down.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/pilot-error-blamed-f-35-flew-11-minutes-after-ejection-investigation-finds/400731/	2024-10-31T14:49:11-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/31/Screenshot_2024_10_31_at_11.47.29AM/large.png
The D Brief: N. Korea tests big ICBM; Aussies’ arms ambitions; Pe...	North Korea tested what appears to be its farthest-flying missile yet early Thursday. Pyongyang's state-run media and White House officials both confirmed it was an intercontinental ballistic missile launched at about 7 a.m. local time from a site near the North's capital city. Typically, North Korean media has waited at least a day before confirming such tests, the last of which occurred this past December. Japanese military officials reported the missile flew for 86 minutes on a 7,000-km apogee, which Tokyo's Defense Ministry said is 'the highest ever.&rdquo; It eventually landed in the Sea of Japan, about 1,000 kilometers from its launch point near Pyongyang. Officials in Seoul reported identical estimates, and said the 86-minute flight was also a new record. South Korea's military said it's possible 'a new type of solid-fuel long-range ballistic missile&rdquo; was used in Thursday's launch, and that it appears to have been fired from a 'new 12-axle transporter erector launcher,&rdquo; Yonhap news agency reports. After the launch, Seoul's military announced it practiced attacking a 'mock mobile missile launcher&rdquo; Wednesday as part of a joint training exercise with the U.S., Yonhap reported separately Thursday. Those drills, known as Freedom Flag, are scheduled to conclude Friday. U.S., South Korean, and Japanese officials all condemned the ICBM test as a violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions. 'This launch needlessly raises tensions&rdquo; around the Pacific and 'demonstrates that the DPRK continues to prioritize its unlawful weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs over the well-being of its people,&rdquo; Sean Savett of the White House National Security Council said in a statement. 'While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation,&rdquo; military officials at Indo-Pacific Command said in a statement. 'The U.S. commitments to the defense of the ROK and Japan remain ironclad.&rdquo; S. Korea: The North is now an 'existential threat.&rdquo; 'The nuclear and missile threat from North Korea is now an existential threat, not only to the ROK, but also to the Indo-Pacific region,&rdquo; Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun told reporters during his visit to the Pentagon on Wednesday. One big worry: Moscow might send Pyongyang dangerous missile technology that Kim said could make North Koreans a far more threatening force. North Korea's quid-pro-quo requests would likely be in the areas of tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, reconnaissance satellites, and missile submarines, he told reporters. Russia could also help North Korea fill some critical technological gaps, particularly in terms of targeting with satellite data, which means its missiles could become much better far sooner than was thought possible just a few years ago, Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports.

On this day in 1956, a DC-3 airliner modified for the U.S. Navy landed at the South Pole, the first visit by humans since a Royal Navy expedition in 1912. Developing: Australian officials announced plans with Lockheed Martin to manufacture 'advanced guided missile systems in the country for the first time,&rdquo; although that operation isn't expected before 2029, the Financial Times reported Wednesday from Sydney. The facility will produce Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System rounds, which are used in the HIMARS systems that made headlines for use in Ukraine's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. 'The complex, which will be the first outside the US to produce the missile systems, will be located in either Victoria or New South Wales at an initial cost of A$316mn and will be capable of producing 4,000 such missiles a year, which Conroy said equated to a quarter of current global production,&rdquo; FT reports. Australia also announced a deal with French firm Thales to produce 155mm M795 artillery in the southeastern city of Benalla, just north of Melbourne. That's expected to be the first such dedicated forge based outside of the U.S., with a goal of cranking out '15,000 rounds each year by 2028, with capacity to produce up to 100,000 for global consumption.&rdquo; Both plans extend from Australia's 2024 National Defence Strategy, which 'affirmed the need to invest in munitions to build stocks, strengthen supply chains and support a domestic manufacturing capability,&rdquo; Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.

After years of shortfalls, nearly all of the U.S. military's active-duty components met their recruiting goals this year&mdash;and plan to increase those goals in 2025. The military services recruited 225,000 people in the fiscal year just ended, which is about 25,000 more than the previous year, Katie Helland, the Pentagon's director of military accession policy, told reporters Wednesday. Behind the numbers: Recruiters are regaining footholds in communities after COVID and the services are seeing increased willingness to serve, Helland said. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports, here. ICYMI: Immigrants show greater willingness than the native-born to join the military, study shows. That's from just a week ago; read it here. Update: A dozen destroyers will get extensive rehabs to extend their service lives, the Navy said Thursday. The work will give the Arleigh Burke-class Flight I warships a total of 48 extra years of service through 2035, according to the announcement, which did not put a price tag on the effort, but did say it will be in the fiscal 2026 budget request.

Automated scans of low-res imagery will cue high-res passes, while simulations will help manage ever-growing queues for service, says Maxar's chief product officer Peter Wilczynski, who joined the space-imagery company over the summer. Don't miss this interview by Defense One's Lauren C. Williams. And by the way, Maxar's working on a 3D-mapping tool to replace GPS. The idea is to use a drone's video feed to build up a three-dimensional understanding of its surroundings, then compare it to detailed 3d maps to navigate. Read on, here. And lastly: America's largest drone manufacturer, Skydio, 'is rushing to find alternative suppliers&rdquo; for critical parts&mdash;including drone batteries&mdash;after new Chinese sanctions announced earlier this month, FT reported Thursday. Skydio: 'This is an attempt to eliminate the leading American drone company and deepen the world's dependence on Chinese drone suppliers,&rdquo; CEO Adam Bry wrote in a recent note to customers. Those sanctions were viewed as 'retaliation for Washington's [recent] approval of the sale of attack drones to Taiwan,&rdquo; FT writes.

Military services upping recruiting goals after rebound in 2024	After years of shortfalls, nearly all of the U.S. military's active-duty components met their recruiting goals this year&mdash;and plan to increase those goals in 2025. The military services recruited 225,000 people in fiscal year 2024&mdash;25,000 more recruits than last year, Katie Helland, the Pentagon's director of military accession policy, told reporters Wednesday. Service officials have previously cited a lower desire to serve, limited familiarity with the military in the general population, a competitive labor market, and declining eligibility among young people as the biggest hurdles to military recruiting, and officials Wednesday said those challenges persist. Only about 23 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 24 are eligible to serve without some type of waiver, Helland said. But as recruiters regain a foothold in communities post-COVID, the services are seeing more willingness to serve, and that 'growing propensity&rdquo; helped them achieve their recruiting goals this year, Helland said. 'When our recruiters get out there and make contact with the individual, they can grow propensity one person at a time. That's where I believe we are seeing successes, is the operations and [when] we've been able to get back into communities. When you think about what happened during COVID, we had to pull out of communities for almost two years. It takes time to get back in and develop those relationships again,&rdquo; Helland said. [[Related Posts]] Looking to 2025, the military services plan to build on this year's momentum and bump yearly recruiting goals. The Army will increase its recruiting goal to 61,000 people in 2025, after beating its recruiting goal of 55,000 this year, and aim for 10,000 in the service's Delayed Entry Program, said Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, commander of Army Recruiting Command. The Air Force just barely met its recruiting goal of 27,100 troops in 2024, but plans to increase that goal to 32,500 in 2025, said Brig. Gen. Christopher Amrhein, commander of Air Force Recruiting Services. The 20 percent increase for the Air Force is ambitious, but Amrhein said it's achievable. Separately, the Space Force will increase its recruiting goal by 30 percent in 2025. The Navy will keep its recruiting goal for 2025 at 40,600 recruits&mdash;after it just squeaked by its 2024 goal, said Rear Adm. James Waters III, commander of the Navy Recruiting Command. The Marine Corps will increase its goal to 29,300 recruits next year after hitting this year's goal of 27,500 Marines, said Maj. Gen. William Bowers, the leader of Marine Corps Recruiting Command.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/military-services-upping-recruiting-goals-after-rebound-2024/400698/	2024-10-30T17:12:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/30/Screenshot_2024_10_30_at_2.10.42PM/large.png
Maxar’s working on a 3D-mapping tool to replace GPS	If GPS goes down, could aircraft navigate by comparing what they sense around them to detailed three-dimensional maps? A major satellite imagery company believes so. Maxar's nascent Pinpoint tool will use a drone's video feed to infer its surroundings in 3D, then match that to maps built with the company's P3DR, for Precision 3D Registration, said chief product officer Peter Wilczynski. While most mapping technology is 'focused on flat representations of the world,&rdquo; Wilczynski said, Pinpoint will answer 'how do you use that three-dimensional representation to help drones navigate, to help planes navigate, to help understand when you get a video feed from a drone or from an aircraft, what position is it actually looking at in the world.&rdquo; He said it could be an alternative to GPS, which can be vulnerable to enemy interference. That's important in part because of 'all of the jamming issues we've seen in Ukraine,&rdquo; he said. 'I think what we're going to see in the next few years is sort of a shift back from this absolute navigation system of GPS towards a much more referential navigation system, more like what happened when you were in a ship and you were looking at the stars.&rdquo; The fast-growing Maxar began developing Pinpoint after Wilczynski arrived from Palantir this summer. The company also recently hired Matt Santangelo as chief financial officer and Matt Jenkins to be its chief space systems officer. The plan for Pinpoint is to finish several pilot programs with domestic and foreign drone makers by next summer, and then make the tech broadly available. 'We're working with some different companies across the value chain. Some companies that manufacture the gimbals, some who manufacture the full [unmanned aerial vehicle]. There's a bunch of different types: attritable, more expendable, some of the more enduring UAV. So we're trying to experiment with this market,&rdquo; Wilczynski said. 'This market is really developing quickly now, as people sort of realize across the defense community that GPS, which we've relied on for so long, may not be available in the next conflict.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/maxars-working-3d-mapping-tool-replace-gps/400678/	2024-10-30T13:47:06-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/30/Screenshot_2024_10_30_at_4.32.20PM_2/large.png
Russia could transfer missile tech to North Korea, ‘escalating’ t...	As North Korean troops train in Russia for likely deployment against Ukrainians, South Korea's defense minister said Wednesday that Moscow might send Pyongyang dangerous missile technology that he said would 'escalate tensions&rdquo; across the Korean peninsula and make North Koreans a far more threatening force. 'There is a high possibility that North Korea, in exchange for their troops' deployment, would ask for cutting-edge technology,&rdquo; Kim Yong-hyun said at a Pentagon press conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Kim said the requests would likely be in the areas of tactical nuclear weapons, ICBMs, reconnaissance satellites, and missile submarines. Austin said some 10,000 North Korean soldiers are currently in Russia, where 'they're drawing equipment and conducting some training.&rdquo; Austin said Russia might send the North Koreans to its Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting since they invaded in August. He called that possibility 'disturbing,&rdquo; but wouldn't comment on the timing of that or that it was a certainty that would occur. Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said on Tuesday that the soldiers are likely special operations forces. [[Related Posts]] Background North Korea has been steadily increasing the destructive power of its nuclear weapons for years and in November 2017 unveiled a new design for an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-15, which could reach the continental United States and closer targets in the Pacific. But North Korea's missile program lacks the sophistication of China's and Russia's, due in large part to crushing international sanctions (and possibly, clandestine U.S. sabotage.) Result: despite a large and expensive increase in testing over the last ten years, North Korea's missiles are unreliable, especially the long-range variants. They have failed launch tests, exploded in the air near North Korean population centers, and, especially the intercontinental missiles, have not shown they can actually hit any target other than the ocean. Russia could help North Korea fill some of those technological gaps, particularly in terms of targeting with satellite data, which means its missiles could become much better far sooner than was thought possible just a few years ago. Why far sooner? In part because giving technology to North Korea was something Vladimir Putin promised not to do. 'Let me remind you that Russia signed onto the UN Security Council resolution agreeing not to provide military assistance to North Korea,&rdquo; Austin said. 'Of course, we know that Putin has gone tin-cupping to get weapons from the DPRK and Iran. Turning to a pariah state like North Korea for troops just underscores how much trouble he is in.&rdquo; Joint response In response to the deepening coordination between Russia, China, and North Korea, the United States and South Korea on Wednesday advanced a new series of cooperation agreements to enable technology transfer and joint development between the two countries. According to a Pentagon fact sheet, the initiatives include: More cooperation on nuclear deterrence to build out better joint responses to nuclear and conventional threats on the Korean Peninsula via the Nuclear Consultative Group. Enhancements to crisis management through joint field exercises like Freedom Shield and Ulchi Freedom Shield. Upgrading the Shared Early Warning Systems to more quickly share radar and other data in response to North Korean or other missile threats. Establish a new Defense Science and Technology Executive Committee to help both militaries integrate AI, autonomous systems, and quantum tech into defense applications. Accelerate industrial cooperation through the Partnership for Indo-Pacific Industrial Resilience and mutual maintenance and repair, or MRO, to improve interoperability between the two militaries' equipment. The two militaries also announced today a new regional cooperation framework&rdquo; to increase collaboration on Indo-Pacific security, with an emphasis on maritime security, defense-industry cooperation, and multilateral exercises. Those efforts build on a trilateral security agreement that Japan, South Korea, and the United States launched this July in Tokyo. That agreement advanced its own framework to institutionalize missile-data sharing, high-level dialogues, and joint military exercises. 'The nuclear and missile threat from North Korea is now an existential threat, not only to the ROK but also to the Indo-Pacific region. We had a shared understanding that the ROK US, Japan, trilateral security cooperation framework signed in this July represents a historic milestone in trilateral security cooperation,&rdquo; Austin said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/russia-could-transfer-missile-tech-north-korea-escalating-threats-south-korea-warns/400688/	2024-10-30T13:15:01-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/30/Russias_President_V_2500/large.jpg
Who tells satellites where to take pictures? Increasingly, it’ll ...	Maxar's chief product officer Peter Wilczynski, who joined the company over the summer, is spearheading an effort to build navigation systems that use 3D maps instead of GPS. But the Palantir alum is also working to develop systems to better manage the ever-growing queues for his company's orbital-imagery services. He also foresees automated tools that track changes captured by the company's relatively low-resolution imagery to cue passes by its higher-resolution satellites. This interview has been edited for length. D1: What are some areas you want to explore, especially as the Defense Department looks to bring more commercial space companies into the fold? Wilczynski: Our historical strength is really in foundational mapping. When we think about more operational missions, I think a lot about how we can&hellip;cut down the latency of our space-to-ground and ground-to-space communication. And as one of the only owner-operator-builder [satellite] companies in the world [that] actually designs, launches, and then owns and operates the satellite constellation, we have a lot of potential for integrating across the space and ground segments to really cut down the latency. And so that's a big focus for us. So, for example, if you're monitoring ships in the South China Sea, you're trying to reduce the time needed to process and analyze that data? I think that's exactly right. And, you know, I also think a lot about not just looking at the proximate analytic targets, so like a vessel that's moving, but actually, can you look backwards in the chain of events that would cause the vessel to move? So modeling site networks and understanding sort of how activity at one site could correlate with future activity at another site. We're doing some work right now on monitoring mines. Those mines are going to affect the downstream supply chain. So, more activity there in a couple weeks means more activity here. And so, as you think about managing a [satellite] constellation to do these tasks, as you get more supply on orbit, which I think we all know has happened in the last few years, you also get a lot more demand for that supply. The thing I'm excited about, from the Maxar perspective, is &hellip;experimenting with that supply-demand mapping for [with how] you take the different analytic admission requirements and then map them to the assets as they're continuously orbiting in space. What are the biggest hurdles? A lot of it actually is on the policy side. The core challenge of deconfliction and harmonization of requests. As you expand the number of entities and people who can make requests of a given constellation, you have to have some system of prioritizing those requests. And right now, a lot of that goes through a clearinghouse on the U.S. government side [that] has a pretty standardized prioritization scheme for deciding which requests turn into collections and taskings. If you push for more real-time collection management, you have to have different, more sophisticated ways of intercepting and interrupting that existing priority queue to get something to the top. And so I think that constellation scheduling system&mdash;taking a request right now and actually putting it at the top of the queue, as opposed to putting it at the bottom of the queue because it came in later&mdash;that's really where the magic is going to happen. We actually own our own constellation scheduler, we own the constellation, and we own a lot of the demand signals into that scheduler. And so I think there's a way where, without changing anything about what's on orbit today or the demand that's happening, we can actually experiment and play around with different ways of scheduling. And so that's a place where we're doing a lot of sort of active development and, honestly, quite a bit of simulation. What are the different courses of action you could take? How do you actually simulate the orbitology, and then tie that to a schedule? So it's a place where I think there's actually a lot of potential to experiment in silico before shifting the whole collection-management system in practice to what's done in physical reality. What does that experimentation look like? Within the international business, we have a pretty well-established ladder system for prioritizing what we call satellite access windows. These are different windows of access to the satellites where customers are able to use the satellites and take pictures with them. So one of the experiments we're working on: is there an ability for a customer to basically jump ahead in line? And how would we actually balance that across all of our different customers? I think what we're going to see in the U.S. government is something similar, where maybe different [combatant commands] actually start needing that same kind of adjudication process. I hope to see this as a shift in the U.S. government, in general, towards more buying centers&hellip;more ability for different buyers to be creative about their requirements. And then, our ability to arbitrate between those buyers ultimately helps figure out the right mission solution for any given workflow. What are you bringing to this job from your 12 years at Palantir? They always talk about decisions, not data. And I think that is something that I'm bringing into the Maxar environment. Maxar is a company that makes a thousand decisions a day about where to take pictures. And I think what I saw is that when you apply better data and better algorithms to those core decisions that you're making as a business, you can actually improve the decision making pretty rapidly. When I think about the products that we offer, whether it's tasking products, data products, analytics products, all of them fundamentally point back to 'Where are we pointing the satellites every minute of every day?&rdquo; And so I think that focus on decision-making, and really decision-making loops, is something that I definitely carry forward. A lot of the geospatial industry, I think, has been really focused on [tasking] a satellite, [getting] an image, [and doing] analytics on that image. That's been the flow of what people think about as what we're trying to provide as an industry, whether in the commercial or government sector. I'm really focused on once you have the analytic and you have the insights out of that [machine learning] algorithm, how do you actually tie that back to tasking? Where do you task next? And applying that whole idea of loops to the actual work products we're producing, so that you can move towards a world of more autonomous tasking, where humans and analysts don't necessarily need to be manually looking at an image. But the images themselves can be driving more tasking, and can be sort of intelligently collecting data without a really manual collection management process happening. How does that work? We have some work going on right now that's doing this, at maybe a lower frequency. There's Sentinel data, which is 10-meter data that's collected pretty regularly of the whole globe. You can run a machine-learning algorithm on that data that tells you where might have buildings and roads be being constructed. It's not going to give you the level of detail you need to turn that into a map, but what it can do is it can say, 'Hey, at low resolution, we see change here. Why don't we take an image of that change so that we can digitize it at high resolution?&rdquo; So you're [getting] output of a machine-learning algorithm applied to really low-resolution imagery, putting that as an input to your tasking, and then tasking high-resolution imagery to collect that region and validate whether or not the machine-learning algorithm was correct or wrong about the building that's been constructed. So grainy photos taken every day with automatic detection of changes that triggers a satellite to take a better picture of that change. Exactly. So like, you could imagine taking a daily picture at low resolution and sort of saying, 'OK, you know, the change started; the change ended.' And that's probably going to be durable for another few years, right? They're not going to knock the building down immediately, but if you try to take that high-resolution picture every day, that asset can be a lot more expensive than the low-resolution asset for that particular mission. I would imagine it's better than an analyst having an alert to remind them to check an area to see if something has changed. I think about it a lot. If you walked into Wall Street in the 1980s, you would have a bunch of people yelling about which stocks to buy and which bonds to buy and which options to buy. You walk in now and you hear a bunch of humming computers. There's still people programming those algorithms figuring out what trades to make. They're just not manually making the trades. The trades are being made automatically with a machine-to-machine system that is able to, in a much more sophisticated way, set the right price for whatever instrument people are trying to buy. And so I think we've seen this transition in a lot of other industries, whether it's online advertisement, or taxi dispatching, or trading, and I think it's something that I'm excited about. We're finally at the point where we have enough supply, we have enough demand that really the market making is where a lot of value needs to be developed in the next few years. What products and services will come in 2025 or early 2026? There's really two major pushes that I'm focused on right now. One is sort of this broader evolution within cartography, and especially digital cartography, from sort-of 2D representations of the world to 3D representations of the world and then to vector representations of the world. When you think about your experience using Google Maps or Apple Maps as a consumer, if you're anything like me, you often use the vector-based navigation system. You don't look at the satellite imagery. You look at the buildings and the roads and the schools and the Starbucks that exist on the map that have been extracted from that satellite imagery. And so one of the big threads is pushing from that raw data into the derived data. That takes a lot of work, a lot of machine learning, a lot of training to get to, but ultimately is a much more semantically meaningful representation of the world that really helps users understand, not just navigating between two points, but between two places.

The D Brief: Russia pushes deeper into Ukraine; N. Korea prepping...	An estimated 3,000 North Korean soldiers have moved to western Russia, South Korean officials said Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. Seoul's Yonhap news agency did not confirm that number, but did report Wednesday 'at least 11,000 North Korean troops have been deployed to Russia, with some sent to Russia's western region near the border with Ukraine.&rdquo; U.S. officials haven't yet confirmed the North Koreans are already fighting inside Ukraine, though CNN notes, 'US officials did not confirm publicly that the troops were in Russia until weeks after South Korea first alleged it.&rdquo; Battlefield latest: Russia's newest offensive, across a 40-mile front in the east, 'has breached Ukrainian defenses in just a few days in many areas,&rdquo; conflict analyst Emil Kastehelmi writes. 'At the moment the Russians are struggling to expand their breach into a breakthrough. Even though the Ukrainians are losing many square kilometers, the defence hasn't crumbled into chaos, and nothing extremely crucial has been lost,&rdquo; he adds. Bigger picture: 'The rate of Russian advances in Ukraine has increased in recent weeks but remains slow and consistent with positional warfare rather than with rapid mechanized maneuver,&rdquo; the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote Tuesday. 'Russian forces have been making gains in eastern Ukraine recently, but comparing those gains to the initial deep Russian penetration into Ukraine at the start of the war misleadingly frames these most recent advances,&rdquo; ISW cautions. Manpower update: Russia's military 'is recruiting around 30,000 men per month,&rdquo; which isn't quite 'enough to meet internal targets,&rdquo; but it's believed to be enough 'to cover even the gargantuan losses of recent months,&rdquo; NATO officials told the Economist this week.

Boom times Russia's military says it 'practiced launching a massive nuclear strike in response to a nuclear strike by a simulated enemy&rdquo; on Tuesday. As part of the drills, the Russians launched a Yars intercontinental ballistic missile from a base near Alaska, submarine-launched ballistic missiles northeast of Norway and north of Japan, and dispatched Tu-95 strategic bombers firing air-launched cruise missiles. The nuclear tests are 'a reliable guarantor of the sovereignty and security of our country&rdquo; and 'solve the problems of strategic deterrence, as well as maintain nuclear parity and the balance of power in the world as objective factors of global stability,&rdquo; Russian leader Vladimir Putin said in a statement. Context: Russia's 'focus on weapons of mass destruction is aimed at offering reassurances to a domestic audience amid the uneven performance of Russian troops in Ukraine, and at deterring Western nations from providing more advanced weapons to Ukraine,&rdquo; the New York Times writes. South Korea's military says the North is on the brink of conducting its seventh nuclear weapons test, though it's unclear if it will occur before or after Election Day in the U.S. on November 5, the Associated Press reports from Seoul. 'It appears that preparations are nearly complete for an ICBM-class long-range missile, including a space launch vehicle,&rdquo; South Korea's Defense Intelligence Agency said Wednesday, according to Yonhap. 'Preparations for a transporter erector launcher are complete, and it has been deployed to a certain area,&rdquo; but no missile has been loaded yet, two lawmakers said. Rewind: This would not be the first time Russia and North Korea have carried out nuclear exercises close to U.S. presidential elections. Eight years ago, North Korea detonated a hydrogen bomb less than two months before the election, and Russia announced 'nuclear-bomb survival drills&rdquo; the following month. By the way: South Korea's military chief Kim Yong Hyun is visiting the Pentagon today for talks with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and his team. Similar talks&mdash;under the banner of a U.S.-ROK Security Consultative Meeting&mdash;occur nearly every year, including last November with Seoul's previous defense minister. Industrial strategy The implementation plan for the Pentagon's defense-industrial strategy was rolled out on Tuesday, and includes six 'initiatives&rdquo; for fiscal 2025, starting with improvements to the missile and submarine industries. The unclassified, nearly-100-page document precedes a classified 'annex&rdquo; to come, Laura Taylor-Kale, who leads Pentagon industrial base policy, told reporters Tuesday. The strategy, which was itself rolled out in January, broadly aims to bolster supply chains to make weapons securely, faster, and en masse. The Pentagon spent about $39.4 billion on the strategy in fiscal 2024 and asked for $37.7 billion in 2025. More than three-quarters of the funds&mdash;about $60 billion total&mdash;will go toward missiles and munitions, followed by $3.3 billion for the submarine industrial base and $500 million for the Defense Department's Replicator initiative. What could go wrong? Well, Congress could fail to pass the 2025 budget bills before the continuing resolution runs out in December, Taylor-Kale said. 'It creates a lot of challenges in procurement, in general, and also in planning for us, when we have these continuing resolutions.&rdquo; Defense One's Lauren C. Williams has more, here. The best way to make sure the Pentagon gets the quantum sensors it needs is to increase R&D spending across the federal government, a new industry-backed report argues. Currently, the U.S. government spends about $900 million on quantum sensing each year, most going to the Defense Department. An increase is needed, according to the report, which was produced by the industry-driven Quantum Economic Development Consortium with funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. By boosting the nascent quantum-sensing industry and its efforts to serve domestic markets from aeronautics to energy, the report argues, these increases will help answer defense leaders' years-old calls for new instruments&mdash;quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and clocks&mdash;that don't rely on vulnerable signals from space to provide navigation and timing data. Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports, here. Europe Developing: A fire at Britain's nuclear shipyard put two workers in the hospital. The blaze broke out early Wednesday morning in BAE Systems' six-acre assembly hall at Barrow-in-Furness, where the UK's four Dreadnought-class missile boats and an Astute attack sub are being built. The Lancaster Guardian and BBC have a bit more. And lastly: Spain has deployed 1,000 soldiers to help evacuate people from flash floods that have killed at least 64 people so far.

Broader federal investment in quantum sensing needed to outpace C...	The tech industry needs more funding from the U.S. government&mdash;not just the Pentagon&mdash;if it is to outpace China in the quest for quantum sensors, whose national-security implications include ground-based replacements for aging and vulnerable GPS satellites, an industry group argues in a new report. Currently, the U.S. government spends about $900 million on quantum sensing each year, most going to the Defense Department.. An increase is needed, according to the report, which was produced by the industry-driven Quantum Economic Development Consortium with funding from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. By boosting the nascent quantum-sensing industry and its efforts to serve domestic markets from aeronautics to energy, the report argues, these increases will help answer defense leaders' years-old calls for new instruments&mdash;quantum magnetometers, gravimeters, and clocks&mdash;that don't rely on vulnerable signals from space to provide navigation and timing data. A recent Quantum Economic Development Consortium, QED-C, workshop brought together over 100 experts to outline how quantum sensing technology can enhance position, navigation, and timing, or PNT, capabilities. Perhaps the biggest insight to come out of the meeting: federal spending to help the quantum sensing industry has to grow beyond the Defense Department. 'Federal investment would support the technology's initial development and ultimately its broader adoption and scaling. Additionally, collaboration among federal agencies could lead to increased standardization of quantum sensors,&rdquo; the report notes. [[Related Posts]] Celia Merzbacher, QED-C's executive director, told Defense One in an email: 'The state of quantum sensing is still at a relatively early stage. Government funding will accelerate the pace and ensure that the stringent requirements for government use cases such as military and space applications, e.g. to operate in extreme environments, will be met. Government funding will accelerate progress.&rdquo; One of the chief challenges is that quantum sensing tech makers right now are focused on very, very specific customers, like labs and academic research centers. Those labs need sensors for special experiments so the quantum sensing industry, to the extent that it exists, is all over the place in terms of parts or even the function of the technology they are putting out. That makes it hard for the government to come up with standards that new players can use to guide their choices on what to make and where to find parts and components. A lack of standard testing also makes the business case for quantum sensors harder&mdash;at least for anyone not in the Defense Department. 'Standardized performance metrics, which are essential to enable the sensors to demonstrate their advantages over classical sensors and drive their adoption. Comprehensive testing is needed to accurately assess the current state of the technology. But a lack of testbeds for quantum sensors makes it nearly impossible to collect the performance data necessary for setting standards or showcasing capabilities,&rdquo; the report says. 'Federal funding of testbeds could dramatically accelerate both quantum sensor development and technology adoption.&rdquo; The workshop's participants also said that federal funding should go to photonic integrated circuits to 'address the size, weight, power, and cost&hellip; issues.&rdquo; They said the federal government should work harder to be an 'early adopter&rdquo; not just the Pentagon, but especially the Department of Energy Department and NASA. 'Early adoption would not only advance the technology's reliability but also position the government as a primary driver in creating cost-effective, scalable quantum solutions for national security needs,&rdquo; they wrote. Of course, that's easier said than done, at least politically. While both parties agree on robust funding for the Defense Department, continued funding for other agencies like Energy is more controversial and could be cut next year depending on the outcome of the presidential election. China, conversely, has been investing heavily in quantum sensing. It has even overtaken the United States&mdash;at least in the number of published research papers on the topic, according to the Australian Strategic Policy Institute's tracker of critical technologies.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/broader-federal-investment-quantum-sensing-needed-outpace-china-industry-report-says/400661/	2024-10-29T17:11:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/GettyImages_2161413352/large.jpg
Six charged with conspiring to defraud agencies with IT-contracti...	The Justice Department charged six people for working to defraud a number of government agencies, including those in the defense and intelligence community, through a series of bidding, kickback and bribery schemes, the agency said Tuesday. The move is among 'the first charges in the Justice Department's ongoing investigation into IT manufacturers, distributors and resellers who sell products and services to government purchasers including the intelligence community,&rdquo; Justice said in a statement. Victor Marquez, who owns two IT companies with sizable government contracts, faces a four-count indictment on charges of wire fraud conspiracy, wire fraud, and major fraud against the U.S. for rigging bids and inflating contract payments. Two others that worked alongside him, Antwann C.K. Rawls &mdash; an employee at one of his companies &mdash; and Scott Reefe &mdash; an IT sales executive &mdash; were also charged. Court documents filed in Maryland alleged the trio exchanged bid information prior to submitting offers, with one emailing that he would file a 'high price third bid.&rdquo; Marquez and his accomplices submitted these coordinated bids in full knowledge that the government sought independent, competitive submissions for the contracts, and in spite of Marquez's certification of independent bidding, Justice claims. The government often awards the contract to the lowest reasonable bidder or the one offering the best value, depending on circumstances. In cases of bid rigging or fraud, firms conspire to manipulate the bidding process by coordinating bids to undermine competition and illegally increase their returns. Marquez did not respond to a request for comment. Separately, Breal Madison Jr. was indicted on 13 counts, including conspiracy, bribery of a public official, mail fraud and money laundering for orchestrating a multi-year scheme that defrauded his employer out of over $7 million in relation to the sale of IT products to various government agencies. IT contractor Brandon Scott Glisson, who provided services to the U.S. government, along with his supervisor, Lawrence Eady, a former senior government official, have been charged for their respective parts in the scheme with Madison. Madison and his co-conspirators plotted to steal funds from his employer at the time, Rubrik, and government agencies. He funneled more than $9 million in stolen proceeds to his shell company, Trident Technology Solutions, as well as another shell entity, according to the allegations. The DOJ served Rubrik, a cloud cybersecurity firm, with a grand jury subpoena last October regarding a former employee who had worked in its sales division, citing potential violations of federal law in connection with government contracts. 'We are deeply disturbed by the alleged conduct by a former employee related to a scheme to defraud Rubrik and the government. The alleged behavior is inconsistent with our values and business ethos and is in violation of our code of conduct and other company policies. As previously disclosed in public filings, we have been cooperating with authorities and will continue to do so,&rdquo; a Rubrik spokesperson told Nextgov/FCW. Madison didn't return a request for comment. 'Antitrust crimes can undermine competition for products and services that are vital to our national security,&rdquo; said Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division in a press release. 'When fraudsters siphon taxpayer funds, the Antitrust Division and its Procurement Collusion Strike Force (PCSF) partners across the government will hold accountable those who collude to subvert competition, line their pockets with federal procurement dollars and compromise the integrity of our intelligence community programs.&rdquo; Officials from the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, FBI, National Security Agency Office of Inspector General and CIA Office of Inspector General also issued statements affirming their offices' commitments to stopping such fraud schemes.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/us-charges-6-conspiring-defraud-agencies-through-it-contracting-schemes/400660/	2024-10-29T16:38:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/GettyImages_2172231947-1/large.jpg
Budget woes may slow Pentagon efforts to strengthen industry	Lawmakers' continued failure to pass a 2025 budget could hinder Pentagon efforts to beef up supply chains and bolster defense, defense officials warned Tuesday. They spoke at the release of the Defense Department's nearly 100-page implementation plan for its inaugural defense industry strategy. The plan is broadly intended to bolster supply chains to make weapons securely, faster, and en masse. It outlines six initiatives for fiscal 2025, starting with improvements to the missile and submarine industries. 'It's best for us to have a full budget done&hellip;on time for us to be able to implement. It creates a lot of challenges in procurement, in general, and also in planning for us, when we have these continuing resolutions. So we're hopeful that Congress will work together and develop and pass a bill, a defense policy bill, as well as a funding bill soon,&rdquo; Laura Taylor-Kale, who leads Pentagon industrial base policy, told reporters Tuesday. The Pentagon plans to spend about $39.4 billion on the industry strategy in fiscal 2024, according to a fact sheet, and asked for $37.7 billion in 2025. In both years, the vast majority of funds&mdash;about $30 billion apiece&mdash;will go to missiles and munitions, followed by $3.3 billion for the submarine industrial base and $500 million for the Defense Department's Replicator initiative. [[Related Posts]] Taylor-Kale said the strategy was coming together during the 2024 and 2025 budget cycles, so the 2026 budget&mdash;now under construction&mdash;will be the first to fully incorporate its plans and principles. She said the department intends to update the strategy and implementation plan annually. The plan's six initiatives aim to address the biggest pitfalls the defense industrial base has from long and costly development timelines to a dearth of skilled workforce, reduced productivity, and intellectual property theft. Other initiatives include moving critical defense capabilities to reduce supply-chain vulnerabilities; adding co-production and development between U.S. and allied and partner nations; modernizing supply-chain infrastructure in the nuclear industrial base and organic industrial base, which includes facilities that make, store, and dispose of munitions; fine-tuning use of rapid acquisition for better prototyping and fielding; and protecting intellectual property. Much of this work is in progress, officials said. There will be a classified annex to the implementation plan with metrics and risks released in the coming months. 'This implementation plan offers industry, global allies, and partners clear direction on the Department's priorities for industrial capacity building,&rdquo; Taylor-Kale said in a statement announcing the plan's release. 'Implementing these initiatives will require coordinated efforts across the DoD, and support and cooperation from our interagency, industry, and international stakeholders, as well as our champions in Congress.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/budget-woes-may-slow-pentagon-efforts-strengthen-industry/400651/	2024-10-29T13:08:45-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/Screenshot_2024_10_29_at_10.07.01AM/large.png
UN cyber pact would help autocrats crush dissent, US lawmakers wa...	A group of Democratic senators is sounding the alarm about U.S. participation in a forthcoming United Nations cybercrime treaty vote, fearing that America's involvement could lend credibility to policies promoted by authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. The missive, led by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., is addressed to top administration officials including Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Attorney General Merrick Garland, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, arguing the U.S. 'must not align itself with repressive regimes&rdquo; that have carried out digitally-enabled human rights abuses. The letter raises concerns about abuses by authoritarian nations, particularly around privacy, surveillance and censorship, arguing the finalized Cybercrime Convention allows for broad definitions of cybercrime and surveillance without strong safeguards for individual users. The lawmakers add that the treaty risks criminalizing good-faith cybersecurity and AI research. Countries under the proposed treaty must adopt laws or procedures that permit their authorities to demand access to computer systems or stored data from individuals or companies. The senators warn this could erode access to encrypted communications services and give broad jurisdiction back to a country's own legal standards. 'In Iran, for example, the lack of such requirements could provide international legal cover for the regime's efforts to promote the widespread surveillance and policing of women and girls. Likewise, the Convention compels countries to collect and share private internet user data with other countries regarding a wide range of crimes,&rdquo; they write. The pact led by the global diplomatic and international political standards body has been in the works for years and has the potential to rewire how countries prosecute cybercriminals and track people suspected of engaging in cybercrimes against sovereign entities. Nation-state adversaries &mdash; namely Russia, China, North Korea and Iran &mdash; are among the greatest purveyors of cybercrime activity, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency says. But the convention has become a lightning rod for debate among Western officials because it could allow foreign adversaries to have a bigger seat at the table when it comes to debating cross-border intelligence, cyber and surveillance issues. Russia has sought the creation of a cybercrime agreement in the UN as far back as 2017. The White House National Security Council declined to comment on the letter. Both law enforcement and national security officials have been debating whether the treaty should get the green light from the U.S., Politico reported last month.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/un-cybercrime-convention-will-legitimize-authoritarian-nations-cyber-behavior-senators-warn/400642/	2024-10-29T09:58:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/29/102924UNNG-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: Houthis resume ship attacks; ‘Put [feds] in trauma’;...	After an 18-day lull, the Russia-supported Houthi terrorists in Yemen targeted another commercial vessel in the Red Sea on Monday. British maritime authorities confirmed the attempted attack, but said the vessel&mdash;Liberia-flagged bulk carrier Motaro&mdash;was unharmed after three explosions occurred close to the ship as it transited the Bab el-Mandeb strait. The Houthis also claim to have attacked two other ships in the Arabian Sea, but offered no proof to support their claims, the Associated Press reported Monday. Israeli officials say a drone launched from Yemen landed in the coastal city of Ashkelon Tuesday. 'The impact caused no injuries but sparked a small fire,&rdquo; according to the Times of Israel.

Bush and claiming responsibility for the 9/11 attacks. He said the attacks were motivated partly by the 1982 Lebanese Civil War, and that he intended to bait the U.S. into wars that would bankrupt the country. Emerging tech New rule aims to stop U.S. investors from backing Chinese research into AI and quantum science. Issued Monday by the White House, the rule 'prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions involving semiconductors, quantum and artificial intelligence. And second, it requires U.S. persons to notify [the] Treasury [Department] of certain other transactions involving semiconductors and artificial intelligence,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters ahead of the release. How much do U.S. investors pour into Chinese military tech? From 2015 to 2021, they pumped $40.2 billion into 251 Chinese AI companies, accounting for 37 percent of the $110 billion raised by all Chinese companies working on AI. That's according to a February 2023 paper from the Center for Security and Emerging Technologies. Defense One's Patrick Tucker has more, here.

Space Force's effort to bring in new launch providers hasn't worked yet. Officials aren't surprised. Last year, the service launched a competition called National Space Security Launch Phase 3 with two categories: 'Lane 1,&rdquo; for less risky missions, and 'Lane 2,&rdquo; for more challenging missions. The idea was that new entrants to the space launch market could get a foot in the door with a Lane 1 mission. But nothing bars established giants like SpaceX from competing in Lane 1, and on Oct. 18, the Space Force announced that SpaceX won $733.5 million for the first set of launches in that category. 'I don't look at it as a failure at all. We fully anticipated it. I mean, everybody knows who's launching right now. We knew it was going to be a very limited set, but we knew we had to start somewhere,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports. Future of American democracy Trump's former OMB director: 'We want to put [federal employees] in trauma.&rdquo; A key ally to former President Donald Trump, Russell Vought, has plans that track closely with Trump's campaign rhetoric about using the military against domestic protesters, or what Trump has called the 'enemy within,&rdquo; ProPublica reported Monday after obtaining video of Vought's private speeches over the last two years. In those appearances, Vought described his work crafting legal justifications so that military leaders or government lawyers would not stop Trump's executive actions. As OMB chief, Vought sought to use Trump's 2020 'Schedule F&rdquo; executive order to strip away job protections for nonpartisan government workers, ProPublica reminds readers. But until these private speeches were made public, he had 'never spoken in such pointed terms about demoralizing federal workers to the point that they don't want to do their jobs.&rdquo; Why bring it up: 'Vought is widely expected to take a high-level government role if Trump wins a second term. His name has even been mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff,&rdquo; according to ProPublica. 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,&rdquo; Vought said. 'When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. We want to put them in trauma,&rdquo; he said. Continue reading, here. View from Capitol Hill: If re-elected, Donald Trump will behave 'like a fascist&rdquo; and 'destroy the Department of Defense,&rdquo; warned the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Chairman Jack Reed of Rhode Island, in a conversation with reporters Monday. Reed called the meeting to bring attention to what he described as 'Trump's dystopian threats to misuse the military and trample on the Constitution.&rdquo; 'What Trump wants is power&mdash;power to first dismiss the legal cases against him, then power to accumulate more and more,&rdquo; Reed said. 'He wants to create chaos and a dysfunctional non-government, actually, because there in that context, he has more power.&rdquo; If he returns to office, Trump 'will destroy the Department of Defense,&rdquo; the senator cautioned. 'He already demonstrated at the end of his last term his willingness to essentially fire the civilian senior defense employees to his Schedule F episode. That's been replicated in the Project 2025 report, and it's going to be something he does. He will create chaos, and he will force many, many of our best officers, frankly, to decide whether they continue to serve or they must leave the service.&rdquo; 'Why is it that men Trump once called &lsquo;my generals'&mdash;men like Gen. [John] Kelly, General [Mark] Milley, General [Jim] Mattis, General [H.R.] McMaster, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and more, everyone who worked closely with him, even his own former Vice President Mike Pence&mdash;why is it they all believe Trump is unfit to be president?&rdquo; Reed asked. Citing the recent work of historian Heather Cox Richardson, Reed said that a March 1945 U.S. Army publication, Army Talks, 'tried to explain to most of the troops what fascism was. And one of the lines from the document said it is &lsquo;government by the few and for the few. The objective is seizure and control of the economic, political, social, and cultural life of the state.' And that sounds a lot like Donald Trump and Elon Musk and the gang all plotting to take over and get special powers and to go after enemies and do things like that.&rdquo; Citing that Army publication, Reed reminded reporters, fascists 'make their own rules and change them when they choose&hellip;they maintain themselves in power by the use of force combined with propaganda based on primitive ideas of &lsquo;blood' and &lsquo;race,' by skillful manipulation of fear and hate and by false promises of security.' [That] Sounds like a Trump speech,&rdquo; Reed said. 'So I'm very concerned that he would, regardless of the definition of a fascist, act like a fascist.&rdquo; But Reed wasn't entirely lacking in optimism. 'I have faith in the leadership of the military that if they detect people who are acting contrary to the law and Constitution and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, that they'll take steps and correct that; that's their job,&rdquo; he said. However, 'The question that becomes much more difficult is, if he assumes office, then I think he has powers that can basically purge the military of people with conscience and replace them with his cronies. That would be a disaster&rdquo; since 'people would be there not because they're the best strategist, tactician, etc. They're there because they'll do whatever [Trump] says. And frankly, I don't think he has a very good grasp on many issues affecting the world.&rdquo; Learn more: Review the eight-page 1945 U.S. Army publication in its entirety, here.

Space Force’s effort to bring in new launch providers hasn’t work...	The Space Force gave the first contract in a program intended to bring new companies into the launch industry to SpaceX&mdash;the world's dominant space launch provider. But officials say that's what they expected. Last year, in an effort to diversify the list of companies launching military satellites into space, the service launched a competition called National Space Security Launch Phase 3. The program splits launches into two groups: 'Lane 1,&rdquo; for less risky missions, and 'Lane 2,&rdquo; for more challenging missions. The idea was that new entrants to the space launch market could get a foot in the door with a Lane 1 mission. But nothing bars established giants like SpaceX from competing in Lane 1, and on Oct. 18, the Space Force announced that SpaceX won $733.5 million for the first set of launches in that category. 'I don't look at it as a failure at all. We fully anticipated it. I mean, everybody knows who's launching right now. We knew it was going to be a very limited set, but we knew we had to start somewhere,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, program executive officer for Assured Access to Space. The service didn't want to wait for other companies to be ready before it launched the new acquisition approach, Panzenhagen told reporters last week during Space Systems Command's annual Space Industry Days conference. 'We never expected that it was going to be immediate in the first year because this is rocket science, right? Developing rockets, designing them, producing them, buying them is hard. We've got a lot of new companies working at it that we're excited to bring on, but we know that it's going to take time to flush all this out,&rdquo; she said. To qualify for this year's contract awards, companies had to have a credible path to first flight by the year's end. Up-and-coming launch providers like Relativity Space, Firefly Aerospace, Rocket Lab, and ABL Space Systems are expected to eventually compete for Lane 1 launches, but it's unclear when these companies will have a rocket ready for primetime. The Pentagon this summer picked SpaceX, Blue Origin, and United Launch Alliance to compete for $5.6 billion worth of contracts in Lane 1, which includes at least 30 missions from fiscal 2025 to 2029. But additional companies will still be able to join future Lane 1 competitions, and there will be an 'on-ramp&rdquo; opening later this year, Space Force has said. Blue Origin is pitching its New Glenn rocket, which still needs to complete two certification flights, but is aiming for a first flight in November. ULA is offering its Vulcan rocket, which flew its second certification flight at the beginning of the month. ULA declared the flight 'successful&rdquo; despite an abnormality during launch where material broke off one of its solid rocket boosters. The anomaly could complicate Pentagon certification, depending on the results of the investigation. ULA needs to get Vulcan certified quickly because it's on contract to launch Space Force missions by the end of the year. The service is looking at post-flight data from the Vulcan launch and going through the standard process for new vehicle certification, Panzenhagen said. 'As far as impacts go, we don't give ourselves a certification date timeline. It's not calendar driven. It's once we've gone through all the data, and we are confident that the vehicles are ready to start flying our missions&hellip; when we reach that point, we'll have a certified vehicle and be ready to start flying missions,&rdquo; she said. Even once Vulcan comes online, it's unclear whether it will be able to challenge Elon Musk's company&mdash;especially when SpaceX's reusable mega-rocket Starship becomes operational. Starship made history earlier this month after it caught a Super Heavy booster for the first time, paving the way for faster launch turnaround times. 'While Starship does have very unique capabilities, [and] I think much of the nation is watching what they're doing and their lift capability, that's not the only exciting rocket out there, right? Every new provider gives us another chunk of resiliency and some more capability. So that's why we structured at Lane 1 in our Phase 3 acquisition strategy, the way we have to be able to bring those new providers into our launch family and benefit national security,&rdquo; Panzenhagen said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/space-forces-effort-bring-new-launch-providers-hasnt-worked-yet-officials-arent-surprised/400625/	2024-10-28T17:13:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/28/A_United_Launch_Alli_2500/large.jpg
White House targets US investments in Chinese AI and quantum tech	A new White House 'final rule&rdquo; announced today aims to shut down the flow of U.S. venture capital and other investment funds into Chinese technology that poses a national security risk, such as quantum computers, artificial intelligence and advanced microelectronics, senior White House officials said. The rule is intended as a guide to implement an executive order the White House put out last August, ordering the Treasury Department and other relevant agencies to identify categories of investment in Chinese tech that could pose a threat to the United States. Today's rule 'prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions involving semiconductors, quantum and artificial intelligence. And second, it requires U.S. persons to notify treasury of certain other transactions involving semiconductors and artificial intelligence,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters ahead of the release. The rule bars investments in any Chinese company that is developing or scaling quantum computers or networks that could undermine encryption. That follows the publication of multiple research papers out of China purporting to show that Chinese advancements in quantum computing have rendered key U.S. encryption standards vulnerable, such as the 2,048-bit RSA encryption system used by banking systems and software makers the world over. Experts have pushed back on those papers' claims, but the White House says the threat posed by China's ongoing quantum work remains very real, even if it hasn't yet resulted in encryption-destroying capabilities. 'These technologies can be used for advanced code breaking, the development of the next generation military applications, or offensive cyber operations,&rdquo; said a senior White House official. AI is another key focus area of the new rule. Chinese investments in AI include areas like facial recognition to target minority groups, deep fakes to spread disinformation, and autonomous weapons. How big a problem is U.S. investment in Chinese military tech? A February 2023 paper from the Center for Security and Emerging Technologies said that between 2015 and 2021, U.S. investors pumped $40.2 billion into 251 Chinese AI companies, accounting for 37 percent of the $110 billion raised by all Chinese companies working on AI. According to CSET, '167 U.S. investors participated in 401 investment transactions&mdash;or 17 percent of 2,299 global investment transactions&mdash;into Chinese AI companies.&rdquo; The vast majority of those investments, more than 90 percent, came from venture capital. 'I think if you think about those sets of facts and scenarios, that's the kind of situation, that when it comes to certain artificial intelligence capable of impacting our national security, from a military intelligence, cyber, other related perspective, that's what we're concerned about,&rdquo; a senior White House official said. Said another Senior White House official, a lot of the venture capital investment that has gone to Chinese startups went to companies that eventually ended up on the Treasury Department's 'Entity List&rdquo; of companies, which restricts some types of U.S. investments. 'As we were looking at some case studies to inform the development of this executive order, and the regulation actually was focused on cyber security&hellip; we saw a number of VC investments directly into firms working on cybersecurity that ended up on the Entity List for working with Chinese military and intelligence services.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/white-house-targets-us-investments-chinese-ai-and-quantum-tech/400624/	2024-10-28T16:46:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/28/GettyImages_452512614/large.jpg
‘Put them in trauma': A key MAGA leader’s plans for civil servant...	A key ally to former President Donald Trump detailed plans to deploy the military in response to domestic unrest, defund the Environmental Protection Agency and put career civil servants 'in trauma&rdquo; in a series of previously unreported speeches that provide a sweeping vision for a second Trump term. In private speeches delivered in 2023 and 2024, Russell Vought, who served as Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget, described his work crafting legal justifications so that military leaders or government lawyers would not stop Trump's executive actions. He said the plans are a response to a 'Marxist takeover&rdquo; of the country; likened the moment to 1776 and 1860, when the country was at war or on the brink of it; and said the timing of Trump's candidacy was a 'gift of God.&rdquo; ProPublica and Documented obtained videos of the two speeches Vought delivered during events for the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank led by Vought. The think tank's employees or fellows include Jeffrey Clark, the former senior Justice Department lawyer who aided Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election result; Ken Cuccinelli, a former acting deputy secretary in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump; and Mark Paoletta, a former senior budget official in the Trump administration. Other Trump allies such as former White House adviser Steve Bannon and U.S. Reps. Chip Roy and Scott Perry either spoke at the conferences or appeared on promotional materials for the events. Vought does not hide his agenda or shy away from using extreme rhetoric in public. But the apocalyptic tone and hard-line policy prescriptions in the two private speeches go further than his earlier pronouncements. As OMB director, Vought sought to use Trump's 2020 'Schedule F&rdquo; executive order to strip away job protections for nonpartisan government workers. But he has never spoken in such pointed terms about demoralizing federal workers to the point that they don't want to do their jobs. He has spoken in broad terms about undercutting independent agencies but never spelled out sweeping plans to defund the EPA and other federal agencies. Vought's plans track closely with Trump's campaign rhetoric about using the military against domestic protesters or what Trump has called the 'enemy within.&rdquo; Trump's desire to use the military on U.S. soil recently prompted his longest-serving chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, to speak out, saying Trump 'certainly prefers the dictator approach to government.&rdquo; Other policies mentioned by Vought dovetail with Trump's plans, such as embracing a wartime footing on the southern border and rolling back transgender rights. Agenda 47, the campaign's policy blueprint, calls for revoking President Joe Biden's order expanding gender-affirming care for transgender people; Vought uses even more extreme language, decrying the 'transgender sewage that's being pumped into our schools and institutions&rdquo; and referring to gender-affirming care as 'chemical castration.&rdquo; Since leaving government, Vought has reportedly remained a close ally of the former president. Speaking in July to undercover journalists posing as relatives of a potential donor, Vought said Trump had 'blessed&rdquo; the Center for Renewing America and was 'very supportive of what we do,&rdquo; CNN reported. Vought did not respond to requests for comment. 'Since the Fall of 2023, President Trump's campaign made it clear that only President Trump and the campaign, and NOT any other organization or former staff, represent policies for the second term,&rdquo; Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. She did not directly address Vought's statements. Karoline Leavitt, his campaign's national press secretary, added there have been no discussions on who would serve in a second Trump administration. In addition to running his think tank, Vought was the policy director of the Republican National Committee's official platform committee ahead of the nominating convention. He's also an architect of Project 2025, the controversial coalition effort mapping out how a second Trump administration can quickly eliminate obstacles to rolling out a hard-right policy agenda. As ProPublica and Documented reported, Project 2025 has launched a massive program to recruit, vet and train thousands of people to 'be ready on day one&rdquo; to serve in a future conservative administration. (Trump has repeatedly criticized Project 2025, and his top aides have said the effort has no connection to the official campaign despite the dozens of former Trump aides and advisers who contributed to Project 2025.) Vought is widely expected to take a high-level government role if Trump wins a second term. His name has even been mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff. The videos obtained by ProPublica and Documented offer an unfiltered look at Vought's worldview, his plans for a Trump administration and his fusing of MAGA ideology and Christian nationalism. A Shadow Government in Waiting In his 2024 speech, Vought said he was spending the majority of his time helping lead Project 2025 and drafting an agenda for a future Trump presidency. 'We have detailed agency plans,&rdquo; he said. 'We are writing the actual executive orders. We are writing the actual regulations now, and we are sorting out the legal authorities for all of what President Trump is running on.&rdquo; Vought laid out how his think tank is crafting the legal rationale for invoking the Insurrection Act, a law that gives the president broad power to use the military for domestic law enforcement. The Washington Post previously reported the issue was at the top of the Center for Renewing America's priorities. 'We want to be able to shut down the riots and not have the legal community or the defense community come in and say, &lsquo;That's an inappropriate use of what you're trying to do,'&rdquo; he said. Vought held up the summer 2020 unrest following George Floyd's murder as an example of when Trump ought to have had the ability to deploy the armed forces but was stymied. Vought's preparations for a future Trump administration involve building a 'shadow&rdquo; Office of Legal Counsel, he told the gathered supporters in May 2023. That office, part of the Justice Department, advises the president on the scope of their powers. Vought made clear he wants the office to help Trump steamroll the kind of internal opposition he faced in his first term. Historically, the OLC has operated with a degree of independence. 'If, all of a sudden, the office is full of a bunch of loyalists whose only job is to rubber-stamp the White House's latest policy directive, whose only goal is to justify the ends by whatever means, that would be quite dangerous,&rdquo; said an attorney who worked in the office under a previous Republican administration and requested anonymity to speak freely. Another priority, according to Vought, was to 'defund&rdquo; certain independent federal agencies and demonize career civil servants, which include scientists and subject matter experts. Project 2025's plan to revive Schedule F, an attempt to make it easier to fire a large swath of government workers who currently have civil service protections, aligns with Vought's vision. 'We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,&rdquo; he said. 'When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so. 'We want to put them in trauma.&rdquo; Vought also revealed the extent of the Center for Renewing America's role in whipping up right-wing panic ahead of the 2022 midterms over an increase in asylum-seekers crossing at the U.S.-Mexico border. In February 2022, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich released a legal opinion claiming the state was under 'invasion&rdquo; by violent cartels and could invoke war powers to deploy National Guard troops to its southern border. The legally dubious 'invasion&rdquo; theory became a potent Republican talking point. Vought said in the 2023 speech that he and Cuccinelli, the former top Homeland Security official for Trump, personally lobbied Brnovich on the effort. 'We said, &lsquo;Look, you can write your own opinion, but here's a draft opinion of what this should look like,'&rdquo; Vought said. The nonpartisan watchdog group American Oversight later obtained an email in which Vought pitched the 'invasion&rdquo; framework to Brnovich. Brnovich wrote in an email to ProPublica that he recalled multiple discussions with Cuccinelli about border security. But he added that 'the invasion opinion was the result of a formal request from a member of the Arizona legislature. And I can assure you it was drafted and written by hard working attorneys (including myself) in our office.&rdquo; In the event Trump loses, Vought called for Republican leaders of states such as Florida and Texas to 'create red-state sanctuaries&rdquo; by 'kicking out all the feds as much as they possibly can.&rdquo; 'Nothing Short of a Quiet Revolution&rdquo; The two speeches delivered by Vought, taken together, offer an unvarnished look at the animating ideology and political worldview of a key figure in the MAGA movement. Over the last century, Vought said, the U.S. has 'experienced nothing short of a quiet revolution&rdquo; and abandoned what he saw as the true meaning and force of the Constitution. The country today, he argued, was a 'post-constitutional regime,&rdquo; one that no longer adhered to the separation of powers among the three branches of government as laid out by the framers. He lamented that the conservative right and the nation writ large had become 'too secular&rdquo; and 'too globalist.&rdquo; He urged his allies to join his mission to 'renew a consensus of America as a nation under God.&rdquo; And in one of his most dramatic flourishes, he likened the 2024 election to moments in America's history when the country was facing all-out war. 'We are here in the year of 2024, a year that very well [could] &mdash; and I believe it will &mdash; rival 1776 and 1860 for the complexity and the uncertainty of the forces arrayed against us,&rdquo; Vought told his audience, referring to years when the colonies declared independence from Britain and the first state seceded over President Abraham Lincoln's election. 'God put us here for such a time as this.&rdquo; Vought said that independent agencies and unelected bureaucrats and experts wield far too much power while the traditional legislative process is a sham. He extended that critique to agencies like the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve, whose independence from the White House had long been protected by both political parties. 'The left in the U.S. doesn't want an energetic president with the power to motivate the executive branch to the will of the American people consistent with the laws of the country,&rdquo; he said in the 2024 speech. 'They don't want a vibrant Congress where great questions are debated and decided in front of the American people. They don't want empowered members. They want discouraged and bored backbenchers.&rdquo; He added, 'The all-empowered career expert like Tony Fauci is their model, wielding power behind the curtains.&rdquo; Fauci was one of the top public health experts under Trump at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and a key figure in coordinating the national response. What sets Vought apart from most of his fellow conservative activists is that he accuses powerful organizations on the right of being complicit in the current system of government, singling out the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, the conservative and libertarian legal network co-chaired by activist Leonard Leo. The society is widely seen as an instrumental force in cultivating young conservative lawyers and building a bench of future judges whose embrace of legal theories like originalism and textualism have led to decisions overturning abortion rights, environmental protections and social welfare policies. Yet in his 2024 speech, Vought accused the Federalist Society and 'originalist judges&rdquo; of being a part of the problem, perpetuating the 'post-constitutional structure&rdquo; that Vought lamented by not ruling more aggressively to weaken or dismantle independent regulatory agencies that Vought and his allies view as illegitimate or unconstitutional. It was 'like being in a contract quietly revoked two decades ago, in which one party didn't tell the other,&rdquo; he said. 'At some point, reality needs to set in. Instead, we have the vaunted so-called Federalist Society and originalist judges acting as a Praetorian Guard for this post-constitutional structure.&rdquo; Echoing Trump's rhetoric, Vought implicitly endorsed the false claim of a stolen 2020 election and likened the media's debunkings of that claim to Chinese Communist propaganda. 'In the aftermath of the election, we had all these people going around saying, &lsquo;Well, I don't see any evidence of voter fraud. The media's not giving enough [of] a compelling case,'&rdquo; he said. 'Well, that compelling case has emerged. But does a Christian in China ask and come away saying, &lsquo;You know, there's no persecution, because I haven't read about it in the state regime press?' No, they don't.&rdquo; Vought referred to the people detained for alleged crimes committed on Jan. 6, 2021, as 'political prisoners&rdquo; and defended the lawyers Jeffrey Clark and John Eastman, who have both faced criminal charges for their role in Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Federal law enforcement agencies, he added, 'are keeping political opponents in jail, and I think we need to be honest about that.&rdquo; The left, Vought continued, has the ultimate goal of ending representative democracy altogether. 'The stark reality in America is that we are in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country,&rdquo; he said, 'in which our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us. And they are going to continue to aim it until they no longer have to win elections.&rdquo; When Democrats called Trump an 'existential threat to democracy,&rdquo; they were not merely calling for his defeat at the ballot box, he said, but were using 'coded language the national security state uses overseas when they are overthrowing other governments&rdquo; to discourage the military from putting down anti-Trump protests should he win. 'They're making Trump out to be a would-be dictator or an authoritarian,&rdquo; he said. 'So they're actively working now to ensure, on a number of levels, that the military will perceive this as dictatorial and therefore not respond to any orders to quell any violence.&rdquo; Trump, Vought insisted, has the credibility and the track record to defeat the 'Marxist&rdquo; left and bring about the changes that Vought and his MAGA allies seek. In his view, the Democratic Party's agenda and its 'quiet revolution&rdquo; could be stopped only by a 'radical constitutionalist,&rdquo; someone in the mold of Thomas Jefferson or James Madison. For Vought, no one was in a better position to fill that role than Trump. 'We have in Donald Trump a man who is so uniquely positioned to serve this role, a man whose own interests perfectly align with the interests of the country,&rdquo; Vought said. 'He has seen what it has done to him, and he has seen what they are trying to do to the country. 'That,&rdquo; he added, 'is nothing more than a gift of God.&rdquo; This story was originally published by ProPublica.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/put-them-trauma-inside-key-maga-leaders-plans-new-trump-agenda/400614/	2024-10-28T12:55:57-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/28/US_President_Donald_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: Israel strikes in Iran; Russia advances in Ukraine; ...	Nearly 100 Israeli jets carried out a series of daring airstrikes inside Iran early Saturday, ending nearly four weeks of suspense following Iran's October 1 missile attack on Israel, which featured at least 180 ballistic missiles. The Israeli strikes were conducted in three waves, and 'targeted around 20 locations around Tehran and western Iran, including vital air defense assets and facilities tied to the Iranian drone and missile programs,&rdquo; according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. The strikes killed four Iranian soldiers, 'presumably at the air defense sites that the [Israeli jets] struck,&rdquo; ISW reports. One target included a solid-propellant rocket motor plant in Parchin, southeast of Tehran. The facilities were inaugurated just three years ago, according to researcher Fabian Hinz of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, based in London. 'Targeted buildings appear to be related to propellant mixing and casting,&rdquo; which suggests 'Israel targeted a critical bottleneck in the missile production process (similar to its previous campaigns against missile production infrastructure in Syrian and Lebanon),&rdquo; Hinz wrote Saturday on social media. The Iranians had also used the Parchin facilities 'for high explosives testing in support of its nuclear weapons program,&rdquo; according to ISW. One suspected consequence: 'The mixers are highly sophisticated equipment that Iran cannot produce on its own and must purchase from China,&rdquo; which could take several months, Israeli officials told Axios. Other targets included a radar installation and an alleged drone factory. In photos: The Associated Press published post-strike satellite imagery from Planet Labs on Sunday. Review those images, here. Tactical note: 'The IDF struck several locations in Iraq and Syria...likely targeting early warning radars and sensors that would have given Iran advanced notice,&rdquo; ISW writes. 'Iran has in recent years worked to build an early detection network across Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon in order to better defend against Israeli airstrikes,&rdquo; the think note explained. The Israelis also destroyed four Russian-made S-300 air defense batteries inside Iran, which are 'the most advanced air defense system that Iran operates,&rdquo; ISW reported. Why that matters: 'Russia's traditional customers have lost faith in the country's defense industry and are looking for new suppliers,&rdquo; Singapore-based researcher Ian Storey told the Wall Street Journal. Relatedly, 'Moscow's foreign weapons sales fell 52% last year from 2022,&rdquo; according to researchers in Stockholm, who predicted (PDF) this past March that 'Russian arms exports are likely to remain well below the level reached in 2014-18, for at least the short term.&rdquo; According to the White House, 'The President and his national security team, of course, worked with the Israelis over recent weeks to encourage Israel to conduct a response that was targeted and proportional with low risk of civilian harm, and that appears to have been precisely what transpired this evening,&rdquo; U.S. officials said after the Israeli strikes. 'Should Iran choose to respond, we are fully prepared to once again defend against any attack,&rdquo; the official said. Big-picture consideration: 'Israel remains in control of the escalation and could decide to press home its advantage,&rdquo; writes Emile Hokayem of IISS. 'Israeli officials believe that the country's operational competence and success on the battlefield will overcome whatever political and moral qualms the Americans, Europeans and Arabs have about its conduct of these wars,&rdquo; he added. Meanwhile, Israeli 'defence planners are probably putting more ideas on the table,&rdquo; said Hokayem. 'But, like the Iranians, Netanyahu should beware the seductions of hubris,&rdquo; he warned.

He added, 'One reason why the Russian Central Bank struggles to control inflation is that interest rates hardly influence the ruble exchange rate. Before 2022, higher rates would lead to a stronger ruble, leading to lower prices in Russia. This doesn't work anymore due to war & sanctions.&rdquo; However, none of this means Vladimir Putin is at all interested in slowing his Ukraine invasion, Kluge noted Friday as well.

China's deepening telecoms hack sparks DHS probe	A key cybersecurity review panel will investigate a Chinese infiltration into U.S. telecom networks and affiliated wiretap infrastructure, the Department of Homeland Security said Sunday, escalating a federal probe into breaches that have targeted government officials and presidential campaign staff. The Cyber Safety Review Board, established by the Biden administration in 2022 to find the causes of major cybersecurity events, 'will initiate a review of this incident at the appropriate time,&rdquo; a DHS spokesperson said in an email. The Wall Street Journal first reported the panel's decision. It's not clear when the probe would start, but it would likely take months before public findings from the analysis are released. The Chinese state-backed hacking collective, dubbed Salt Typhoon, penetrated the networks of AT&T, Verizon, Lumen and around 10 others, and for months was likely inside systems that facilitate court-authorized wiretap requests, according to reports that first surfaced last month. The network of affected individuals has expanded since U.S. investigators began scrutinizing the incident just weeks ago. The hackers have attempted to access the phone communications of presidential campaign officials, including former president Donald Trump and running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, the New York Times reported Friday. The hackers have also hoovered up audio communications from U.S. political figures, including a Trump campaign advisor, the Washington Post reported Sunday. Salt Typhoon also had access to victims' unencrypted messages, added the report, which cited people familiar with the matter. At least one U.S. official was notified that hackers had accessed their personal phone. The targeting was bipartisan in nature. Staff of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and staff on Vice President Kamala Harris's campaign were also hit. 'Agencies across the U.S. government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defenses across the commercial communications sector,&rdquo; the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said Friday. The break-ins into the wiretap request systems may have compromised some of the most sensitive national security data on U.S. surveillance targets, and have raised questions about the security architecture of the backdoor installations enabled by a 30-year-old surveillance law whose oversight falls heavily on the private sector and third-party compliance providers. 'If you want to know what diplomats are thinking, it's in their email, it's in their texts. And that's the kind of stuff that I think people have always targeted,&rdquo; Kevin Mandia, who founded the eponymously named threat intelligence firm Mandiant, told Nextgov/FCW earlier this month. It remains uncertain whether other surveillance systems, such as those governed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, were penetrated in the hacks. Data from those networks could provide Beijing with insights into U.S. overseas intelligence targets. The espionage operation likely began months ago. In early September, DHS policy undersecretary Rob Silvers said the Cyber Safety Review Board would announce an investigation 'soon&rdquo; but did not specify any further details. CSRB's review was long anticipated to focus on this past summer's CrowdStrike-enabled IT outages or the 2020 SolarWinds Orion hack, the latter of which motivated establishment of the board. In April, CSRB penned a critical report about Microsoft's security posture that enabled a separate band of Chinese hackers to access the email inboxes of top U.S. officials around summertime last year. The telecommunications espionage marks China as now the second major foreign adversary to have explicitly compromised the data and communications of 2024 presidential campaign entities, after Iranian state-affiliated hackers this past summer nabbed Trump campaign documents and floated them to media outlets with hope that they'd be published online. Individuals behind those hacks were charged by the Justice Department last month. The infiltrations are 'really concerning,&rdquo; former NSA director Gen. Paul Nakasone said in an interview. 'The scope and the scale of allegedly being in American telecommunications companies &mdash; that's a different ballgame,&rdquo; he said. 'I think the follow on question now is, okay, what are we doing about it?&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/dhs-cyber-review-board-investigate-chinese-hack-us-telecom-victim-net-widens/400606/	2024-10-28T07:28:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/28/102824telecommNG-1/large.jpg
China’s chip chokepoints	Earlier this year, American investigators were tipped off about a plan to ship semiconductor manufacturing equipment to China. The alarm was sounded after two Chicago-based buyers of a Dynatex DTX-MDB 150 'scribe and break' machine asked the California manufacturer to file export paperwork that omitted the machine's final destination: Chengdu GaStone Technology Company, a firm in southwest China under U.S. sanction for an illegal 2021 scheme to purchase military-grade integrated circuits. In April, Lin Chen was arrested and charged while Han Li escaped to China. The case illuminates the complex U.S.-China competition to produce ever-more-advanced chips. CGTC sought the Dynatex machine to handle a final step in making military-grade gallium arsenide chips, which can better withstand extreme temperatures and radiation than ordinary silicon devices. Had they succeeded, the Chengdu firm could have improved their chip-manufacturing 'success rate' and therefore their ability to meet customer demand&mdash;including from China's military. While companies such as SMIC have turned China into a chip-manufacturing powerhouse, the country remains unable to mass-produce the most advanced chips on its own. Despite massive government investment, China continues to rely on foreign companies for the chips that power everything from the AI revolution to the internet of things to the most advanced military equipment. This problem remains a huge vulnerability for China's economy, its military, and its global ambitions. Commentators inside China identify advanced chips as one of the 'chokepoint&rdquo; technologies that keep the country from technological parity with the world's most advanced economies. In 2018, the government's S&T Daily publication named 35 such technologies, most in the fields of information technology, electronics, manufacturing, biotech, and new-energy vehicles. Eight of these chokepoints related to the design and manufacture of advanced chips, casting doubt on the country's ability to produce such chips anytime soon. Western leverage While China's struggle is hardly secret, few stop to think about what exactly it means, why it is so difficult to overcome&mdash;and what leverage it might give U.S. and allied governments. To paraphrase Boromir, one does not simply insert silicon into one end of a machine and wait for an advanced chip to emerge from the other. Producing these chips is a complex, multi-stage process. And each stage, in turn, provides numerous avenues for U.S. and allied governments to apply pressure on China's efforts at its own advanced chip production. Before the chips can even be manufactured, they must be designed. This necessitates the use of electronic design automation software, which brings order to the billions of transistors that go into a modern chip, a task impossible for human engineers to accomplish on their own. Here lies China's first chokepoint. Chinese-made EDA software from companies such as Beijing Empyrean and Primarius Technologies can handle analog designs and simpler IoT applications but appear unable to compete at the high end. Thus, the Chinese market for this specialized software is dominated by the three largest U.S. developers: Synopsys, Cadence, and Siemens EDA, who collectively hold 90 percent of the PRC market. In 2022, the U.S. Commerce Department placed export controls on the most advanced versions of this software, which is needed to design top-of-the-line 3nm chips. Next, raw materials must be turned into the silicon wafers that will eventually become chips. Silicon is extracted from sand, refined to 99.9999999% purity, melted, and fashioned into a single-crystal ingot. This ingot, called a 'boule,&rdquo; is sliced into thin wafers and polished to create an ultra-flat, mirror-like surface. To achieve the extraordinary nanometer-level smoothness that is required, ultra-precise polishing equipment is needed. Herein lies a second chokepoint: China appears to lack companies that can produce this equipment, although their research is showing some promising results. The leading manufacturers are in the U.S. and Germany. In 2020, the U.S. government slapped export controls on the most advanced versions of this equipment. Once the wafers are ready, one side is coated with a light-sensitive chemical called photoresist to prepare it for photolithography. Production of this chemical is a third chokepoint. 'Extreme ultraviolet&rdquo; photoresist is needed for the densest chips below 20nm, and this market is dominated by Japanese companies bound by strict export-control policies. Even South Korean and Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers depend on Japan's advanced resists. Chinese companies make less-advanced photoresists, which are in high demand worldwide for manufacturing inexpensive commodity chips such as those found in automobiles and consumer products. But their products are insufficient for leading-edge devices. Chinese firms such as Jingrui, Red Avenue, and its subsidiary Beijing Kempur, a U.S.-China joint venture, are pouring research into making advanced photoresists. This will not be easy, because older photoresist chemicals based on bis-azide photoresists cannot create circuits below two micrometers (2,000 nanometers). Further, the most advanced core technologies, including fine-particle filtering for new chemicals such as fullerenes (a zero-dimension carbon nanomaterial for high-resolution photoresists) may not be exported from the U.S. and its allies to China without a license. Next, the light-sensitive wafers are sent through a photolithography machine, which projects light through a series of reticles to produce microscopic circuit patterns. Herein lies yet another chokepoint. The most advanced machines, manufactured by Dutch company ASML, have more than 100,000 parts and cost hundreds of millions of dollars. They have carried a 'presumption of denial&rdquo; in the export application process led by Washington since 2022. While China manufactures huge amounts of less advanced chips, it remains incapable of reproducing the complex photolithography machinery needed for the most advanced devices. Based on past performance, the prospects for quickly catching up with the world's photolithography industry leaders are not good: China has striven to do so since the 1980s and has historically been a decade or two behind. China's leading producer, SMIC, can reportedly make 28nm chips, far from the global leading edge of 2 to 3nm. And while China is reportedly now producing a 7nm chip for the latest Huawei smartphone, this is believed to use a less advanced and less efficient form of lithography from a machine acquired from ASML before U.S. controls went into effect. SMIC's success rate for chips on each wafer may be low and commercially unacceptable, keeping costs high and production limited. And Washington is trying to further restrict sales and service of the lithography machines SMIC used to make them. There are almost certainly other chokepoints buried in the intricate process that produces modern semiconductors, perhaps in the stages of etching, ion implantation, metal deposition, dicing, and final assembly and testing. For instance, Chen and Li's efforts in Chicago indicate that China depends on foreign 'scribe and break&rdquo; machines to dice military-grade gallium arsenide chips, making this yet another potential chokepoint not named in S&T Daily's 2018 list. The multiple chokepoints China must contend with provide a dual picture. They show the difficulties it faces in its quest for world-class chips. Meanwhile, they show how Washington's efforts to keep cutting-edge semiconductor technology out of China have achieved some successes, but still face significant hurdles. Export controls have only been partly updated since the Cold War and rely on a network of nations and companies. The United States needs a new multilateral export regime powered by consensus among key partners that make semiconductor manufacturing tools, many of whom would prefer to continue selling to China at some level. China will continue to improve its chip-making through overt and covert means, for the one certainty about the future of the economy and warfare is that they will be powered by semiconductors. The question is where those technologies will come from, and how much volume in chips and equipment clandestine actors can manage to smuggle to China.

US efforts to protect democracy in Europe could fade under Trump	The Oct. 20 election in Moldova went off successfully&mdash;despite record Russian attempts to disrupt it&mdash;because of U.S. efforts to help, U.S. and Moldovan officials said this week. Such efforts could be imperiled should Donald Trump return to office. Last Sunday, more than one and a half million Moldovans took to the polls and narrowly passed a referendum to join the European Union, an outcome Russian President Vladimir Putin worked hard to prevent. 'Every single tool from the Soviet hybrid-war toolbox was used&rdquo; to undermine the outcome Viorel Ursu, Moldova's ambassador to the United States, said this week during a CSIS event. 'There are armies of online trolls and call centers that were established to spread deepfake videos and false information about the EU, about selling land to Europeans or hosting immigrants from Europe.&rdquo; Russia also 'created an elaborate Ponzi scheme&rdquo; to buy votes, a scam that poor Moldovans were particularly vulnerable to, Ursu said. He said other Russian efforts included 'training of young adults on conducting cyber actions and provoking violence during protests&hellip;engaging criminal groups, including foreigners, to disrupt the work of public offices in order to provoke a sense of fear and mistrust, constant bomb alerts that took resources from investigating the deeds of these criminal groups, paying religious community leaders to engage in political campaigning.' Such efforts laid bare Russia's determination to 'undermine its democracy in a truly unprecedented fashion,&rdquo; said Christopher Smith, the State Department's deputy assistant secretary for Eastern Europe and policy and regional affairs. So why did the effort not succeed? One huge factor, said Ursu, was U.S. help&mdash;millions of dollars in aid, cybersecurity training, and more&mdash;all to build up the country's resilience to attacks. 'The European Union and the U.S. partners here, the State Department, and particularly USAID, have been on on our side, on reinforcing that infrastructure&hellip;of the electoral process,&rdquo; he said. The scale of the Kremlin's effort was unprecedented: 6.5 million attacks between December and May alone, a top USAID official said. All aimed to disrupt the electoral process directly or indirectly, targeting government actors, journalists, and elements of infrastructure, said Mark Simakovsky, deputy assistant administrator of USAID's Bureau for Europe and Eurasia. 'It continues to grow, and it grew as we approached the election and even on election day,&rdquo; Simakovsky said. 'Moldova's digital infrastructure, including the site of the presidency, came under attack.&rdquo; To counter those attacks, he said, USAID worked for months to 'really ramp up our assistance&rdquo; in various ways, such as sharing intelligence about Russian cyber actors, training a cyber workforce, and providing cybersecurity tools. Smith said the United States also helps protect Moldovan elections by sanctioning pro-Russian operators such as the fugitive oligarch Ilan Shor, 'All of these cyber attacks, all of these trolls, all of these bots require money. Russia can field these instruments because they use Ilan Shor's network of influence in order to support these campaigns. And throughout this year, we have leveled sanctions against multiple elements of Ilan Shor's network,&rdquo; he said. Moldova is hardly the only Russian neighbor under stress. In Georgia, which will hold parliamentary elections on Saturday, the rise of the pro-Kremlin Georgia Dream party Is beginning to bend the country to Putin's will. Western observers say a 'foreign agent&rdquo; law passed in May is modeled closely after a Russian law used to crush dissent. The law, which targets aid and non-governmental organizations that receive more than 20 percent of their funding from foreign sources, is used to target pro-Western dissident groups and complicate Georgia's ascension into the European Union more difficult, they said. What does that have to do with Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate? As president, he repeatedly pushed to slash foreign aid, particularly through agencies like USAID. To the extent that the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 accurately reflects his agenda, foreign aid would face sweeping changes and a change in focus away from Europe toward the Pacific. Perhaps most importantly, Trump has both denied and welcomed Russian interference in U.S. elections and even briefly proposed to establish a joint Russian-U.S. cybersecurity project. And given Trump's vocal support for pro-Kremlin strongmen in Europe such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, it's unlikely he would find much urgency to help fledgling democracies protect themselves from Russian meddling.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/us-efforts-protect-democracy-europe-could-fade-under-trump/400585/	2024-10-25T16:06:07-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/25/GettyImages_1152460422/large.jpg
The D Brief: Musk, Putin talk; Trump’s record; Houthis’ satellite...	The rich man and the despot: Elon Musk has been in secretive contact with Russian leader Vladimir Putin for the past two years, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday (gift link). The private talks between the world's richest man and the world's most nuclear-armed autocrat reportedly 'raise potential national-security concerns&rdquo; among U.S. officials since conversation topics have included denying Taiwan access to Musk's Starlink service ('as a favor to Chinese leader Xi Jinping&rdquo;) and Musk has blocked Ukraine from using certain Starlink terminals in its defense against Russia's full-scale invasion. Recall that 'Musk has forged deep business ties with U.S. military and intelligence agencies, giving him unique visibility into some of America's most sensitive space programs,&rdquo; the Journal notes. For example, 'SpaceX, which operates the Starlink service, won a $1.8 billion classified contract in 2021 and is the primary rocket launcher for the Pentagon and NASA.&rdquo; Musk's duplicity doesn't end there: 'Through the first months of the year, Musk said he would refrain from backing any presidential candidate while at the same time holding private conversations discussing how he could get Trump elected,&rdquo; the Journal reminds readers. But that changed in July when Musk endorsed Trump and began campaigning on his behalf&mdash;an effort that has since morphed into a possibly illegal scheme of handing out millions of dollars to incentivize citizens in battleground states to vote so long as they sign a Trump-aligned pledge. Trump is also alleged to have been in contact with the Russian despot. Citing a Trump aide, journalist Bob Woodward reported in a new book that there have been 'maybe as many as seven&rdquo; conversations between Trump and Putin since the former left office in 2021. For details on Musk's contract with, and influence over, the federal government, see this New York Times report from earlier in the week. Musk has been doing Trump's work in the online information space this year, too. That includes spreading misleading claims about immigration and conspiracies about alleged voter fraud, which are his most popular topics to tweet about, according to an analysis of Musk's writing on X published Thursday by Bloomberg. The analysis covers more than 13 years of Musk's posts, which changed noticeably as the election season got underway in 2024. And as November 5 has gotten closer, 'Musk's effort to popularize his views on voting and migrants has become relentless &mdash; and more effective in terms of engagement,&rdquo; Bloomberg reports. Why it matters: 'In Musk, the former president has found an influential ally who is willing to launder a false conspiracy theory for the masses, helping lay the groundwork for Trump to once again dispute the results of next month's election, should they not be in his favor, according to Melissa Ryan, founder of CARD Strategies, a consulting firm that researches disinformation.&rdquo; But perhaps most importantly, 'as the most-followed account on X, Musk is the platform's single most important influencer,&rdquo; and 'He is still the most widely read person on the site today,&rdquo; Bloomberg reports. Read over the full analysis (gift link), here. Reminder: If re-elected, 'Donald Trump says he will order mass deportations, use soldiers against citizens, prosecute his enemies, abandon allies, and play politics with disasters,&rdquo; the New York Times Editorial Board writes in a multimedia presentation published Friday. 'Believe him,&rdquo; the editorial board cautions. 'The record shows that Mr. Trump often pursues his stated goals, regardless of how plainly they lack legal or moral grounding,&rdquo; they write. In contrast to his first term, 'Trump has learned from that experience to surround himself with supplicants who would instead obey his wishes and bring his words and ideas to life even if they contradict facts, the public interest or the Constitution.&rdquo; Using his own words, the board encourages readers to 'take the painful step of imagining America were his plans and promises to come to pass, to imagine the impacts to our culture, to our economy, to our security, to our shared commitment to the rule of law.&rdquo; Dive in (gift link), here.

North Korean soldiers are expected to begin arriving in Ukraine 'combat zones&rdquo; as early as Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy said Friday, citing intelligence officials. 'North Korea's actual involvement in combat should not be met with indifference or uncertain commentary, but with tangible pressure on both Moscow and Pyongyang, to uphold the UN Charter and to hold them accountable for this escalation,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. The first tranche of North Korean troops arrived in Russia's western Kursk region Wednesday, Ukrainian intelligence officials claimed the following day. 'North Korea has transferred roughly 12,000 North Korean personnel, including 500 officers and three generals, to Russia and that Russian Deputy Defense Minister Colonel General Yunus-Bek Yevkurov is responsible for overseeing the training and adaptation of the North Korean military personnel,&rdquo; the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War wrote in its Thursday assessment, citing Ukraine's Main Military Intelligence Directorate. South Korea's military chief described the North Korean troops as 'mere cannon fodder mercenaries.&rdquo; North Korea's soldiers are 'being disguised with a Russian uniform and acting under Russian military command without any operational authority,&rdquo; Defense Minister Kim Yong-hyun told parliamentarians Thursday in Seoul.

New: Russia helped the Houthi terrorist group attack commercial vessels in the Red Sea and along Yemen's coasts, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday, citing 'a person familiar with the matter and two European defense officials.&rdquo; The help consisted of Russian satellite data that was 'passed through members of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who were embedded with the Houthis in Yemen.&rdquo; Why it matters: The targeting data 'shows how far Russian President Vladimir Putin is willing to go to undermine the U.S.-led Western economic and political order,&rdquo; the Journal writes.

Lastly today: Problems with a German railroad contract slowed U.S. munitions to Ukraine, IG says. Shipments were delayed in December 2022 and January 2023 because of problems with a U.S. European Command contract with Germany's Deutsche Bahn railways, according to a Defense Department Inspector General report. In at least one instance, 'no rail service was available to transport the ammunition.&rdquo; The problem was eventually solved by chartering boats to deliver it instead, at a cost of $1.6 million to the United States. The report was released, in much-redacted form, to Defense One on Thursday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. The delays hit around the same time Ukraine began to run out of U.S.-supplied ammunition&mdash;making it one of several instances in which U.S. aid shortfalls have affected the Ukrainian military since Russia's full-scale invasion.

Problems with a German railroad contract slowed US munitions to U...	U.S. shipments of ammunition to Ukraine were delayed for at least two months last year because of problems with a U.S. military contract with Germany's Deutsche Bahn railways, according to a Defense Department Inspector General report. The 'multiple delays&rdquo; happened between December 2022 and January 2023, according to the report, around the same time Ukraine began to run out of U.S.-supplied ammunition&mdash;making it one of several instances in which U.S. aid shortfalls have affected the Ukrainian military since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The report was released to Defense One on Thursday in response to a Freedom of Information Act request. In at least one instance, 'no rail service was available to transport the ammunition.&rdquo; The problem was eventually solved by chartering boats to deliver it instead, at a cost of $1.6 million to the United States. The IG report said the delays were caused by the U.S. European Command agreement with Deutsche Bahn failing to account for some criteria or factor, but the specifics of the deficiency are redacted. [[Related Posts]] Another section of the report says the agreement 'does not contain any requirement for Deutsche Bahn,&rdquo; to take some action, but the nature of the action is redacted. The wording suggests that Deutsche Bahn denied the military's request for some kind of service. Germany's federal government owns Deutsche Bahn, which is Germany' largest rail provider. Without a revised agreement, future delays that would be 'disruptive to the flow of critical ammunition to Ukraine,&rdquo; could still occur, the report said. When the report was published in July 2023, the military had not yet fixed its agreement with Deutsche Bahn. The report also recommended that European Command investigate other means of shipping ammunition to Ukraine. European Command's deputy director for logistics agreed with the recommendation to review the military's agreement with Deutsche Bahn and enact any necessary changes. And the command agreed with the report's call to find other shipping options, saying it would look at other seaports and logistics. Germany's rail network's ability to move military goods is hampered by extensive bureaucracy, too little investment in infrastructure, and not enough flat-bed wagons for military goods, according to a June report by the German Council on Foreign Relations. Military shipments also must compete with commercial goods, the report noted. While the Germany military signed a 2023 agreement to reserve 343 flat wagons, Deutsche Bahn Cargo would struggle to do more because of commercial transport reservations, it said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/problems-german-railroad-contract-slowed-us-munitions-ukraine-ig-says/400551/	2024-10-24T16:36:13-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_24_at_1.35.17PM/large.png
Northrop expecting next B-21 production award by end of the year	Northrop Grumman anticipates getting a second contract to continue producing the Pentagon's new B-21 Raider by the end of the year, executives announced today. 'With B-21, we are on track for meeting the milestones associated with an award&rdquo; for Low-Rate Initial Production Contract 2, or LRIP 2 'and so we are expecting that to happen in the fourth quarter,&rdquo; CEO Kathy Warden told investors during the company's third-quarter earnings call Thursday. Warden didn't say how many planes the contract would cover. But it would be the second of five annual LRIPs that are expected to total 21 aircraft&mdash;and to cost the company a total of $1.2 billion, she has said, blaming the losses on inflation, supply-chain problems, and the company's commitment to a fixed-price contract before they had a mature design. The Air Force expects to pay roughly $780 million per LRIP aircraft&mdash;officially, $550 million per plane in 2010 dollars&mdash;based on its overall plan to buy at least 100 Raiders. Northrop executives say the program will eventually be profitable. The company has negotiated a higher cost ceiling for the 19 aircraft that will follow the first 21. [[Related Posts]] The service doesn't plan to buy more than 100 Raiders&mdash;although some think tankers argue that it should&mdash;since the future may bring new and improved technology, officials say. The service is taking another look at all of its next-gen plans, as previous concepts of air superiority and adversary capabilities have changed. Said Warden, 'They are undertaking a force structure design review and the [Air Force] Secretary has been open about looking at the various options they have for increasing their force size, and has talked specifically about NGAD, and we know that B-21 is in the mix as well. It would be premature for me to suggest where that force structure review will end up, but I do think in the coming months, we may get a better indication from the Air Force as to how they're thinking about B-21 quantities in the long run.&rdquo; In the meantime, flight testing and production are moving along well, Warden said. 'The B-21 program has also made solid progress in achieving ground and flight testing milestones on the development contract, and is continuing to execute the aircraft production contract in line with our estimates,&rdquo; she said. Last month, Northrop said it has three aircraft in test, two for ground testing and one for flight testing, and has been able to conduct flight tests twice a week.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/northrop-expecting-next-b-21-production-award-end-year/400526/	2024-10-24T11:31:47-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_24_at_8.30.09AM/large.png
The D Brief: US confirms N. Korean deployment; WH’s natsec AI mem...	After nearly two weeks of warnings from Ukrainian and South Korean intelligence officials, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed Wednesday 'there is evidence that there are [North Korean] troops in Russia.&rdquo; Ukraine's president claimed last week at least 10,000 North Koreans will be helping Russia fight Ukrainian troops, possibly in and around Russia's Kursk region, bordering Ukraine. On Tuesday, President Zelenskyy said that number could be as high as 12,000 spread across two brigades. South Korean intelligence officials said Friday the North Koreans began their journey on October 8, beginning with 1,500 or so traveling via 'four amphibious landing ships and three escort vessels owned by Russia,&rdquo; according to Yonhap news agency. White House officials said Wednesday at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers traveled to eastern Russia for military training earlier this month. 'We assess that these soldiers traveled by ship from the Wonsan area in North Korea to Vladivostok,&rdquo; National Security Communications Advisor John Kirby told reporters. 'We do not yet know whether these soldiers will enter into combat alongside the Russian military, but this is certainly a highly concerning probability,&rdquo; Kirby said. 'If they do deploy to fight against Ukraine, they're fair targets, and the Ukrainian military will defend themselves against North Korean soldiers the same way they are defending themselves against Russian soldiers,&rdquo; Kirby told reporters. Russian leader Vladimir Putin 'may be even in more trouble than most people realize,&rdquo; Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin told reporters Wednesday. Referring to the North Korean soldiers, Austin said, 'If they're co-belligerents, if their intention is to participate in this war on Russia's behalf, that is a very, very serious issue, and it will have impacts not only in Europe. It will also impact things in the Indo-Pacific as well.&rdquo; Mapped: See the path North Koreans are believed to be traveling to training sites inside Russia via this graphic published Wednesday by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. Expert reax: 'In addition to sending 8 million rounds of 122 millimeter (mm) and 152mm munitions and scores of ballistic missiles, North Korea is now providing the ultimate sign of an alliance commitment in the spirit of the renewed mutual defense treaty signed by the two leaders in June 20,&rdquo; Victor Cha of CSIS wrote in an explainer Wednesday. 'It's unclear whether these are technicians or combat troops,&rdquo; he cautioned. But 'Either way, this makes DPRK the most visible and committed supporter of Russia's aggression in Europe,&rdquo; he said. Worth noting: 'Thus far, China's reaction to North Korea's support of Russia has been caught somewhere between paralysis and incompetence, lacking either the political will or policy ingenuity to create disincentives for either party,&rdquo; said Cha. 'For one, China does not like Russia to have so much influence over the North,&rdquo; he said. 'In addition, if the longer-term ramifications of this cooperation lead to greater DPRK capabilities that invite even more U.S. military presence and allied capabilities in China's region, that does not benefit China.&rdquo; More on Ukraine after the jump...

Update: The White House won't greenlight long-range strikes inside Russia, and for reasons that have been known for months&mdash;including Russia's movement of equipment out of the range of relevant U.S.-provided weapons (ATACMS, in particular) as well as the unpredictability of second-order effects from nuclear-armed Moscow, Fox's Jacqui Heinrich reported Wednesday afternoon, citing a U.S. official. This week in data: Russia's military has used at least 36 types of missiles to attack Ukraine, CSIS researchers Benjamin Jensen and Yasir Atalan reported Wednesday. 'This diversity reflects an operational approach to firepower strikes of combining different models like long-range attack drones, ballistic missiles, and cruise missiles to complicate the ability of Ukraine to defend its skies. Of note, many of these unique combinations were launched from different geographic sites further complicating air defense.&rdquo; That would seem to suggest 'The United States and its partners need to do more to curb the ability of [Iran, China, and North Korea] to replenish Russia's arsenal,&rdquo; they warn.

That's why so many of the most notable military and national security leaders of the past two decades of war have recently broken with long tradition to publicly warn that he is manifestly unfit to serve again as commander-in-chief. No fewer than 741 former high-ranking national security and military leaders&mdash;including 233 general and flag officers, 15 four-star generals, and 10 former service secretaries&mdash;recently signed a letter endorsing Kamala Harris for president. They warn that Trump is 'too impulsive and ill-informed&rdquo; to entrust with the world's most powerful fighting force.

New AUKUS experiment shows how allies with autonomy will speed up...	U.S., Australian, British, and Japanese defense officials converged on Australia's Jervis Bay this week for a weeklong experiment to test how to integrate new, developmental tech from different countries in order to speed up intelligence and reconnaissance data transmission at sea. The results: 'Things that would have taken perhaps months were taking place minutes in terms of common operating pictures,&rdquo; one senior defense official told reporters. The so-called Maritime Big Play exercise is part of the broader AUKUS partnership between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. The first pillar of AUKUS focuses on the co-development of a nuclear-powered submarine, while the second pillar involves co-development and deployment of emerging technologies like autonomous drones. Madeline Mortelmans, the current acting assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, told reporters Wednesday that progress on AUKUS pillar II is already changing the way the allies think about joint operations and fielding new technologies. 'We're advancing our undersea warfare capabilities by expanding our ability to launch to and recover uncrewed underwater systems from the torpedo tubes on current classes of British and U.S. submarines,&rdquo; she said. 'That will increase the range and capability of our undersea forces. We're integrating the [BAE] Sting Ray lightweight torpedo into the P-8A maritime patrol aircraft, which will support our forces in being more interchangeable while providing resilience to munitions stockpiles across AUKUS nations.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] The experimentation in Jervis Bay served as a showcase for a lot of new drone tech and other systems, both in the water and above, from across the alliance. 'Much of the gear that was brought to the party was from the partners,&rdquo; one official said. Some of the systems the United States brought include the GARC unmanned surface boat, the Vanilla long-endurance UAV, and the Ocean Aero underwater and surface vessel (Triton.) 'This was all industry. We had 30 different systems, from the sea bed to the stratosphere, involved here,&rdquo; an official said. The experiments tested how well the systems and the militaries could collect and disseminate intelligence and data. 'The testing and experimentation was driven by specific scenarios. So think of the need to use a mix of uncrewed and crewed assets to do very large area [intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance] for example, and to maintain a common operating picture,&rdquo; an official said. Another focus of the experiment was to identify how allies could modify or develop specific tactics, techniques and procedures to allow for faster data and intelligence sharing across the alliance&mdash;and to do so from the wide array of drones and other assets. 'We demonstrated not only the systems&hellip; but also how we would employ those systems. So the specific TTPs that will help us do that more effectively, that will accelerate our adoption, and then further it helps us understand how we would do it together, through connecting and communicating and command and controlling the devices,&rdquo; another official said. Japanese officials attended the briefings this week, as the AUKUS nations are considering closer collaboration with Japan in these areas. One former senior defense official told Defense One, 'Integrating increasingly autonomous capabilities is critical to the future success of all three navies.&rdquo; The experiment 'provides a unique platform for experimentation to ensure each country benefits from the advances of the other, helping the AUKUS partners scale better than future capabilities faster,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-aukus-experiment-shows-how-allies-autonomy-will-speed-naval-operations/400513/	2024-10-24T04:30:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/Screenshot_2024_10_23_at_11.39.49PM/large.png
White House signs national security memo on AI	President Joe Biden will issue a new national security memorandum today on artificial intelligence, aimed at helping the U.S. government deploy AI and retain its advantage over China. The United States must 'ensure that our national security agencies are adopting this technology in ways that align with our values,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters ahead of the unveiling. A failure to do so 'could put us at risk of a strategic surprise by our rivals, such as China,&rdquo; the official said. The memorandum provides guidance&mdash;via a framework&mdash;on how to employ AI for national security missions. 'These requirements require agencies to monitor, assess, and mitigate AI risks related to invasions of privacy, bias and discrimination, the safety of individuals and groups, and other human rights abuses,&rdquo; according to a fact sheet from the White House. The guidance will allow the government to take better advantage of the new AI tools coming out of Silicon Valley, the White House said. 'The innovation that's happened, particularly in this current wave of frontier artificial intelligence, has really been driven by the private sector, and it's critical that we continue to both foster that leadership,&rdquo; the official said. 'AI is rooted in the premise that capabilities generated by the transformer and large language model revolution in AI, often called frontier AI, are poised to shape geopolitical, military, and intelligence competition.&rdquo; There are still major concerns about applying those AI tools, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, to high-stakes areas like national security, given the propensity of such models to hallucinate and produce false positives. And the publicly available data sets those models are largely trained on can contain personal (but legally obtainable) personal information on U.S. civilians, as Defense One has reported. The national security community is 'well aware&rdquo; of the concerns, the official said. 'We have to go through a process of accrediting systems. And that's not just for AI systems, but, you know, national security systems generally,&rdquo; he said, pointing to Biden's previous executive order on AI and the establishment of the AI Safety Institute as two steps the White House has taken to mitigate AI risks, particularly in government use. The new memo designates the Commerce Department's AI Safety Institute as 'U.S. industry's primary port of contact in the U.S. government,&rdquo; according to the fact sheet. Those efforts join already existing Defense Department and Intelligence Community guidelines on AI development and deployment. The official agreed that the availability of U.S. citizens' data is a growing problem. 'We have been very concerned about the ways in which Americans' sensitive data can be sold, really through the front door, first collected in bulk, then sold through data brokers, and then end up in the hands of our adversaries. And so that's something that the President issued an executive order on [in February] to try to restrict adversary access to some of that data.&rdquo; But while the risks are real, the government still must establish a way for the national security community to 'experiment&rdquo; with AI through 'pilots,&rdquo; the official said. 'There are going to be challenges associated with adopting any new technology,&rdquo; they said. 'The framework&hellip;is one that's going to be continuously updated.&rdquo; And those updates may be subject to political disruption: Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has vowed to repeal Biden's executive order on AI safety.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/white-house-signs-national-security-memo-ai/400512/	2024-10-24T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/24/GettyImages_1765529254/large.jpg
Heed the generals who call Trump unfit to lead	As a coda to two decades covering the post-9/11 conflicts as a correspondent, I wrote a book in 2021 profiling the 25 Medal of Honor recipients from the nation's longest wars. Theirs are stories of never surrendering despite harrowing odds, of facing death and finding the courage and faith not to be cowed, of wearing their profound scars&mdash;both physical as well as mental&mdash;like badges of honor. There is wisdom and warrior fierceness in those narratives, but also acts of profound tenderness and love. The common theme running throughout is troops united in a cause greater than themselves, caught in a brush with eternity and choosing to risk and even forfeit their own lives to save their brothers in arms. Their heroism and self-sacrifice is awe-inspiring, and explains why those privileged to lead them in combat consider these uniformed volunteers and their teammates America's 'New Greatest Generation.&rdquo; Donald Trump cannot fathom any of that. As if we needed reminding, the former and possibly future commander-in-chief continues to prove in the crudest terms imaginable that he views the U.S. military from a deep well of incomprehension, not as a sacred trust to be honored by any leader, but rather as an instrument of self-aggrandizement and brute force. That was the message behind Trump's recent description of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which he has bestowed on supporters and major campaign donors, as 'much better&rdquo; than the Medal of Honor, because service members who receive the nation's highest military honor have either 'been hit so many times by bullets, or they're dead.&rdquo; Militaries always have an irresistible allure to 'wannabe dictators,&rdquo; to borrow a phrase from Gen. Mark Milley, whom Trump appointed Joint Chiefs chairman. Trump has made no secret of his yearning to deploy the active force onto the streets of America to strike fear into his domestic political opponents, who he chillingly called 'the enemy from within&rdquo; in a recent Fox interview. He has also repeatedly telegraphed his intention to use the military to quell a supposed crime wave in Democratic-led cities, and to conduct the largest deportation in our nation's history of immigrants and 'radical left thugs&rdquo; that 'live like vermin&rdquo; inside the United States and are 'poisoning the blood of our country.&rdquo; Given Trump's Nazi-esque rhetoric, it's not surprising&mdash;yet still extraordinary&mdash;that his former chief of staff, retired Marine Corps Gen. John Kelly, recently confirmed that Trump repeatedly praised Adolf Hitler's generals for their perceived blind loyalty, and wanted U.S. military leaders more in the mold of the German Wehrmacht under the Nazis. Nor is it surprising that Milley, now retired, has called his former boss the 'most dangerous person to this country&rdquo; and a 'fascist to the core.&rdquo; Decades of covering the U.S. military as a reporter taught me that even retired generals and admirals are instinctively resistant to engaging in partisan politics. They have been inculcated from their first days as cadets or newly minted lieutenants with the principle that the military must stay above the partisan fray in a democracy and submit to civilian authority. Their leaders know that the nonpartisan nature of the U.S. military helps explain why it has long remained the nation's most respected institution. I also know from talking with many of Milley's contemporaries, both on-the-record and privately, that they share his dire assessment, and genuinely fear for their country should Trump return to the Oval Office. That's why so many of the most notable military and national security leaders of the past two decades of war have recently broken with long tradition to publicly warn that he is manifestly unfit to serve again as commander-in-chief. No fewer than 741 former high-ranking national security and military leaders&mdash;including 233 general and flag officers, 15 four-star generals, and 10 former service secretaries&mdash;recently signed a letter endorsing Kamala Harris for president. They warn that Trump is 'too impulsive and ill-informed&rdquo; to entrust with the world's most powerful fighting force. Roughly half of my fellow citizens have chosen to ignore those warnings, and that is certainly their right. Before they vote, however, I hope they reconsider why the nation's guardians have chosen to break with tradition. Consider just one recent, revealing incident that was quickly buried beneath the media coverage of Trump's non-stop outrages and falsehoods. In August, Trump and the bully boys of his campaign pushed past an Army employee into the highly restricted Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery, the section largely reserved for the fallen of Afghanistan and Iraq, in order to illegally film a TikTok campaign video and snap a picture of the candidate with Gold Star Family members. Take a close look at that photograph of the former president grinning broadly and giving the thumbs-up over the graves of Marines who lost their lives in the Biden administration's chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and ask yourself: What must he have been thinking? Perhaps his thoughts were similar to the ones he expressed privately during a 2018 trip to France for the centennial anniversary of the end of World War I, when then-President Trump cancelled visits to cemeteries for America's fallen because he said they were filled with 'losers&rdquo; and 'suckers.&rdquo; Or perhaps his thoughts tracked with those Trump expressed to General Milley, who as JCS chairman had arranged for a severely wounded Army captain to sing at a ceremony for the president. 'Why do you bring people like that here?&rdquo; Trump reportedly asked Milley afterwards, before instructing him not to let the soldier appear in public again. 'No one wants to see that, the wounded.&rdquo; Trump has repeatedly shown that such blasphemy comes from a deep hollowness of character. How else to explain the then-president's casual cruelty during an earlier visit to Arlington National Cemetery, there supposedly to pay respects at gravesite No. 9480. It held the remains of a young Marine killed in action in Afghanistan: 1st Lt. Robert Michael Kelly, the son of Trump's soon-to-be chief of staff. 'I don't get it,&rdquo; Trump told the grieving Kelly. 'What was in it for them?&rdquo; Why young American men and women volunteered after 9/11&mdash;knowing they would be subjected to the horrors of war, running to the sound of guns as their fathers and uncles had in Vietnam, and their grandfathers had in Korea and World War II&mdash;was not something that could ever be explained to Donald Trump. Yet in his own grief, John Kelly, himself a retired four-star Marine general and decorated combat veteran, understood that his son Robert had already given the answer to the question of whether the cause was worth the sacrifice. 'In his mind&mdash;and in his heart&mdash;he had decided somewhere between the day he was born at 2130, 5 September 1981&mdash;and 0719, 9 November 2010&mdash;that it was worth it to him to risk everything&mdash;even his own life&mdash;in the service of his country,&rdquo; Kelly would later tell other grieving Gold Star families. 'So, in spite of the terrible emptiness that is in a corner of my heart and I now know will be there until I see him again, and the corners of the hearts of everyone who ever knew him, we are proud. So very proud. Was it worth his life? It's not for me to say. He answered the question for me.&rdquo; Before surrendering the fate of America's sons and daughters in uniform to the whims of an unstable commander-in-chief who simply cannot grasp the meaning of their devotion and sacrifice, I hope voters will listen to the actual patriots who have devoted their lives to our nation's defense. They know from experience that Trump will cozy up to autocratic strongmen and once again denigrate democratic allies, eroding the alliances that undergird America's global strength. They have never forgotten that on January 6, 2021, after inciting a violent mob that ransacked the citadel of our democracy on one of the darkest days in modern U.S. history, the former commander-in-chief was AWOL, watching the desecration on television for hours and breaking the chain of command at the top. They have heard him recently refer to that desecration as a 'day of love.&rdquo; Above all, they know that the hollowness and narcissism at Donald Trump's core masks a darkness that could eclipse what they and so many others have risked everything to defend. 'A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs are all &lsquo;suckers' because &lsquo;there is nothing in it for them,&rdquo; John Kelly said of his former boss in a blistering statement to CNN last year confirming many of Trump's outrageous comments, first reported and recently confirmed in The Atlantic. 'A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because &lsquo;it doesn't look good for me.' A person who demonstrated open contempt&hellip;for all Gold Star families&hellip;and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are &lsquo;losers,' and wouldn't visit their graves in France.&rdquo; 'A person that has no idea what America stands for and has no idea what America is all about,&rdquo; Kelly continued in what amounted to a scream from the soul of a grieving father, and a dire warning from a renowned military leader afraid for his country. 'A person who admires autocrats and murderous dictators. A person that has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law. 'There is nothing more than can be said,&rdquo; Kelly concluded. 'God help us.&rdquo; Amen.

Military must improve acquisition to win future wars, admiral say...	HONOLULU&mdash;The war in Ukraine shows how the United States must improve its acquisition process if it hopes to maintain military strength, the deputy commander of Pacific Fleet said Tuesday. Ukraine 'provides us a great example of the importance of rapid innovation and lightning-quick transition from the drawing board to the battlefield,&rdquo; Vice Adm. Blake Converse said during the opening keynote speech at AFCEA TechNet Indo-Pacific here. 'Ukrainians have perfected the rapid acquisition of technology for multi-domain combat operations. They have shown us that even without a robust military-industrial complex and infrastructure, we can integrate land, sea, air, space, cyber, and information.&rdquo; Ukraine's success in using unmanned vessels and missiles against the Russian Black Sea fleet is 'not just compelling, it's revolutionary,&rdquo; Converse said. Of course, the U.S. is not Ukraine, and the Pentagon's high-tech weapons 'weren't developed in a makerspace lab in Silicon Valley, they're the products of our acquisition systems,&rdquo; he said. 'Our imperative as a military must be to work with industry, to partner to foster innovation and to integrate emerging capabilities alongside our acquisition processes that exist today, but as fast as humanly possible.&rdquo; That speed is necessary to be prepared for 'a highly contested combat environment in the western Pacific,&rdquo; Converse said, adding that in addition to 'building capabilities, sensors, and weapons,&rdquo; the joint force must also 'massively upgrade our command-and-control systems and processes.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] That potential conflict would also require a highly resilient digital infrastructure in the region that could handle a huge influx in troops and requirements, said Marine Col. Jared Voneida, commander of DISA's Pacific field office. 'This what we're trying to build. We are looking for an infrastructure that's ready to go on day one of the fight, to absorb bandwidth increases from that joint force descending on this theater,&rdquo; Voneida said at the conference. Such a fight would be much different than the previous 20 years, Voneida said. 'Instead of deconflicting between one Marine unit and one Army unit located in the desert of Iraq, we're deconflicting globally across combatant commands. It's a global fight,&rdquo; he said. ' You need a global network. You need to be able to seamlessly move our data across, not just the Indo-Pacific theater, but the globe. Because that's where the fight is going to happen. Asked about the speed at which Ukrainians have rebuilt networks there, Voneida said the reason he believes having a 'robust, reliable, resilient, all the adjectives&rdquo; network ready before a conflict is critical is that expert technicians may not be able to physically access the infrastructure to rebuild over and over again during a war with China. 'If we can, great, I think we'll do exactly what's happening in Ukraine. If not, I think our goal is to have such a resilient network that we can gracefully degrade it as we go through the conflict,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/military-must-improve-acquisition-win-future-wars-admiral-says/400509/	2024-10-23T14:50:44-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/Screenshot_2024_10_23_at_11.49.15AM/large.png
Boeing will look to ‘do less and do better’: CEO	Boeing won't be able to fix its ailing defense arm, which lost $2 billion this quarter, anytime soon, but the company's CEO said Wednesday that its defense products are still core to the company. 'It's going to take a lot of work. We're not going to be able to just wave a wand and clean up these troubled contracts. We signed up to some things that are problematic,&rdquo; Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors during the company's third-quarter earnings call&mdash;his first public comments since taking the job in August. Fixed-price development programs have been dragging down the company's defense arm, causing billions of dollars in losses. But Boeing couldn't walk away from these money-losing defense contracts 'even if we wanted to,&rdquo; Ortberg said. Instead, the company may consider cuts to other, non-core defense programs, he said. 'I think that we're better off doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well, so we're in the process of taking an evaluation of the portfolio,&rdquo; Ortberg said. [[Related Posts]] What might Boeing cut? In the defense sector, it will likely keep its aircraft and weapons programs, and try to offload most, if not all, of its space program. But it's unclear if it could find buyers, said Richard Aboulafia, managing director for AeroDynamic Advisory, an aerospace consulting firm. 'This is a question of buyers, not willingness to sell,&rdquo; Aboulafia said. Sierra Space was at one point reportedly considering buying the joint Boeing-Lockheed rocket launch firm ULA, but the status of any such sale is still up in the air. Ortberg didn't offer a list of what the company might shed, but said, 'our core of commercial airplanes and defense systems are going to stay with the Boeing company for the long run, but there's probably some things on the fringe there that we can be more efficient with, or that just distract us from our main goal here.&rdquo; The company aims to finalize decisions on what stays and what goes by the end of the year, Ortberg said. In order to get the current defense programs on track and prepare for future contracts, the company needs to focus on the things it can control, Ortberg said, such as how they estimate the total cost of a project. 'We know how to run these programs. We just have lost a little bit of discipline. I don't think our people are close enough to the people in the labs, on the factory floor, identifying what's keeping us from being successful, and so, we've made some changes in that regard,&rdquo; Ortberg said. During the call, Boeing executives also confirmed previously disclosed losses on the defense side: $2 billion on the T-7 trainer, KC-46 tanker, Starliner spacecraft, and MQ-25 unmanned refueler. 'The magnitude of these losses expanded as we close the books, primarily reflecting higher estimated production costs on the T-7A program, mainly on contracts in 2026 and beyond, and an updated assessment of impacts on the KC-46A program associated with the IAM work stoppage and the decision to conclude production on the 767 freighter,&rdquo; CFO Brian West told investors. Boeing machinists have been striking for more than a month now in the Pacific Northwest, which is hitting the company's defense programs since those facilities also build the commercial-derived Air Force KC-46 tanker and Navy P-8 maritime aircraft. The workers will vote on a new contract Wednesday, just hours after Boeing released its earnings. During the earnings call, Ortberg said 'first and foremost&rdquo; the company has to end the IAM strike, and they've been 'feverishly working&rdquo; to find a solution. Following the start of the strike, Boeing announced it would cut 10% of its workforce, roughly 17,000 people. This dramatic cut was needed because Boeing is 'inefficient&rdquo; and has too much overhead, Ortberg said. 'I wouldn't think of it like we're going to take people off the production or out of the engineering labs. That's not our intent here. It's about getting ourselves more efficient and having a more lean and mean machine going forward, and I think that's going to be really important as we ramp up the production,&rdquo; he said. As the company attempts to position itself for the future, it's already started making leadership changes. Head of Boeing's defense sector Ted Colbert was pushed out in September, though the company has yet to announce his successor. Asked about the replacement, Ortberg wouldn't say whether they'd fill the spot with someone external or internal to the company, but said he's 'not averse to bringing in some additional resources to help the team, and I don't think the teams are averse to that as well.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/boeing-will-look-do-less-and-do-better-ceo/400500/	2024-10-23T13:03:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/GettyImages_2170865140/large.jpg
Army wargame to test cargo drones and live logistics data	In a future war, Army tanks growling around the battlefield may be able to send live data back to their headquarters showing every time they fire a round or burn a gallon of fuel. Using that data, logisticians back at the base might then send swarms of drones buzzing back to the tanks with new ammo, or guide fleets of drone boats laden with fuel to a beach somewhere. None of these ideas is ready for prime time yet &mdash; but the Army will test all three at Project Convergence this spring, according to Brig. Gen. Shane Upton, commander of the Contested Logistics Cross-Functional Team. Upton spoke to Defense One on the sidelines of the recent AUSA conference. Some of the work, like the tank-ammo project, consists of updating logistics for the modern era. Historically, Upton said, logisticians typically receive radio reports from units about how many rounds they have left, then add those numbers to an enormous spreadsheet by midnight each day. But that method is not flawless. A typing error could change 20 rounds to 200, he said. With logistics data updated only every 24 hours, meanwhile, a commander may make unrealistic plans based on a faulty understanding of their logistics. If soldiers in the tank can reliably send the data directly back to headquarters, by contrast, logisticians can keep a closer eye on usage rates and prioritize resupply missions. Commanders will also have an up-to-the-minute understanding of their forces' readiness. For the upcoming Project Convergence, the starting objective will be to transfer shell and fuel consumption data while the tank is stopped, with a 'stretch&rdquo; goal of transferring data when it's on the move, Upton said. Other technologies the team is prepping for Project Convergence aren't just updates, but entirely new ways of doing logistics. During the event, the team will test two heavy cargo drones capable of carrying 1,000 pounds or more up to 250 nautical miles. The aim of such drones is to deliver multiple artillery shells or precision munitions to troops, all without risking the lives of pilots who would otherwise be tasked with ferrying in munitions by plane or helicopter. The Marine Corps, which already fields a small resupply drone, is also testing options from Leidos and Kaman for a heavier-lift drone in the ranges Upton outlined. Under an 'aggressive&rdquo; schedule, that type of heavy-lift drone could be fielded to its first unit by 2030, Upton said, though that would require many more Army organizations than Army Futures Command to achieve. A smaller drone capable of lifting 150 pounds might be fielded to some units of the Army's 'transformation-in-contact&rdquo; modernization program by 2026, Upton said. The team will also test autonomous resupply boats that the Navy has already experimented with, Upton said. The Army wants the systems to be relatively cheap so it can send 'hundreds&rdquo; to the field, allowing them to disperse widely, which will make them harder for an enemy to strike. Other tech is also in the works, even if the Army isn't ready to pull the trigger on it yet. The service is watching how Ukraine is using drones for casualty evacuation, he said, and while Army discussions about implementing similar practices are 'pre-decisional,&rdquo; he called Ukraine's efforts 'very ingenious.&rdquo; The Army is also looking into better ways to supply troops with energy, but Upton noted numerous problems with existing tech even as troops rely on more and more powered tools, from drones to directed energy. Solar panels could offer frontline troops easy charging options, for example, but could be just as difficult to move as a towed generator, he said. Hydrogen-powered fuel cells or even small nuclear energy could help power bases, meanwhile, but both come with a host of policy, safety, and other problems. Still, Upton was optimistic. 'I think there's a lot of movement that's got to happen in the [power-generation] space,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/army-wargame-test-cargo-drones-and-live-logistics-data/400499/	2024-10-23T12:53:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/23/8286377/large.jpg
The D Brief: A shipyard death; Another F-35 delay?; US troops wou...	He died building a ship for the U.S. government. His family got nothing. ProPublica reports on the death of a shipbuilder at Thoma-Sea, among Louisiana's largest shipyards. Elmer De Le&oacute;n P&eacute;rez died last January as he welded inside a ballast tank of a new oceanographic-research vessel, but his family received no death benefits because he was an employee not of the shipyard, but of G-4 Services, a local staffing subcontractor. G-4 officials insisted that, one, P&eacute;rez was somehow 'not working&rdquo; as he welded, and, two, he wasn't really their employee. 'P&eacute;rez was a self-employed independent contractor and thus a claim for death benefits is not compensable,&rdquo; a lawyer for G-4 Services wrote in May. There are lessons to be learned from this incident and others like it, and a U.S. Navy and shipbuilding industry that is desperately trying to attract employees had best learn them quickly. Writes ProPublica: 'Today the lack of welders is acute. The U.S. needs at least 300,000 more of them in the next few years. Shipyards have been hit particularly hard by the gap, which has contributed to a shortfall in warship production. As in many other industries, immigrants are filling that gap. P&eacute;rez embodied many aspects of the immigration debate.&rdquo; Read on, here. Speaking of immigrants, they appear much more willing to join the U.S. military than the native-born, according to a new study that may have resonance amid military recruitment struggles and an election charged with rhetoric and misinformation. Some 60 percent of U.S. respondents expressed a willingness to fight for their country, and immigrants were nearly 30 percent more likely to do so than native-born citizens, according to the study, whose results were described in the September issue of Armed Forces & Society. Defense One's Patrick Tucker unpacks it, here. F-35 tech problems, protracted negotiations hit Lockheed finances. The company and Pentagon have yet to reach an accord on the contract for the next two production lots&mdash;18 and 19&mdash;and that kept Lockheed from collecting about $700 million last quarter, company officials said Tuesday. They've had to spend company cash to keep the production line running. Another TR-3 delay? Lockheed executives previously said that the jets' full, combat-ready TR-3 package could be ready late next spring. But the company seems to have backed away from that goal in today's earnings call. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports, here.

On this day in 1942, the Second Battle of El Alamein began in Egypt, eventually resulting in a British-led Allied victory over the Nazis and Italians after almost three weeks of fighting. The victory eased Axis threats to the Suez Canal and prevented a Nazi and Fascist advance into the Middle East. Iraq officials say they've killed a top ISIS official after a U.S.-assisted raid in the northern Hamrin Mountains, according to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute, reporting Tuesday. It's not yet clear exactly who was killed, however. Two U.S. troops were injured in linked operations, which U.S. defense officials confirmed Wednesday and said consisted of 'strikes and follow-on raids on multiple ISIS locations in central Iraq, targeting several senior ISIS leaders and killing at least seven ISIS operatives.&rdquo; The two Americans 'were wounded while assisting Iraqi forces with site exploitation,&rdquo; but they're now in stable condition, according to Central Command. Moment of impact: A photographer in Beirut captured several milliseconds before and after an Israeli rocket struck a building allegedly used by Hezbollah in broad daylight on Tuesday. Behind the lens: Associated Press photographer Bilal Hussein, who stayed around 'roughly 40 minutes after an Israeli military spokesperson posted a warning in Arabic on social media, notifying people in and around a pair of buildings on Beirut's southern outskirts that that [sic] they should evacuate the area,&rdquo; AP writes. Review about a half dozen of those images here. Retaliation watch: Israeli officials are still talking up a future attack on Iran in response to Iran's October 1 barrage featuring an estimated 180 ballistic missiles, dozens of which appear to have struck an Israeli air base hosting F-35 aircraft. 'After we strike in Iran, everyone will understand what you did in the preparation and training process,&rdquo; Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Israeli troops Wednesday, according to the Times of Israel. 'Everyone who dreamed a year ago of beating us and attacking us, paid a heavy price and is no longer in that dream,&rdquo; Gallant said. It's been another busy day for Israeli air defense systems, which reportedly shot down drones and rockets allegedly launched from Lebanon, according to the Times of Israel's Mannie Fabian. And lastly: An era of 'total war&rdquo; has returned, argues former Pentagon policy official Mara Karlin, writing this week in Foreign Affairs. 'An era of limited war has ended; an age of comprehensive conflict has begun,&rdquo; she says. How so? 'In both Ukraine and the Middle East, what has become clear is that the relatively narrow scope that defined war during the post-9/11 era has dramatically widened,&rdquo; writes Karlin, who served for more than two years as the Biden administration's assistant defense secretary for strategy, plans, and capabilities. 'Indeed, what the world is witnessing today is akin to what theorists in the past have called &lsquo;total war,' in which combatants draw on vast resources, mobilize their societies, prioritize warfare over all other state activities, attack a broad variety of targets, and reshape their economies and those of other countries.&rdquo; The twist: New technologies and a globalized economy make the new total wars different from earlier eras, so strategists and planners must rethink how they fight and prepare, Karlin argues.

Immigrants show greater willingness to join the military, new stu...	Immigrants to the U.S. are more willing to 'fight for the country&rdquo; than the native-born, according to a multinational study that may have resonance amid military recruitment struggles and an election charged with rhetoric and misinformation. Some 60 percent of U.S. respondents expressed a willingness to fight for their country, and immigrants were nearly 30 percent more likely to do so than native-born citizens, according to the survey, whose results were described in the September issue of Armed Forces & Society. The researchers compared multiple surveys across several years including 2024, specifically looking at Americans and Canadians questions about background, self-identity, religious beliefs, feelings of national pride, and more. It was conducted by Christopher Simon of the University of Utah, Nicholas P. Lovrich of Washington State University, Kenneth G. Verboncoeur, of the U.S. Army, and Michael C. Moltz of Shippensburg University. The authors write that demographics will lead many Western militaries to recruit more immigrants. 'Recruitment shortfalls plaguing prominent Western militaries employing the all-volunteer force model raise concerns about the maintenance of force size and readiness. Faced with aging populations, many developed nations will increasingly rely on immigrant youth to address recruitment shortfalls,&rdquo; the authors write. (So far, in the United States, most services report being on track or above their 2024 goals to date but fell beneath their 2023 goals.) The survey also indicates that immigrants are more civic-minded and oriented toward public service than the native-born populations of the countries in which they reside. That belies many claims by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has made derogation of immigrants a chief theme of his campaign. Immigrants' propensity to 'fight&rdquo; appears to be less about their affinity for the military than for the society they have joined, the authors write. 'The evidence presented here would indicate that immigrant willingness to fight is associated primarily with building civic connectedness in the host nation and is not a function of militarism or nationalism,&rdquo; they wrote. While military service has long been a way for documented immigrants to speed up the naturalization process, much of the current national immigration debate has focused on undocumented immigrants, who are generally not allowed to join the military. Their wait for legal status averages about two years, and grew longer during the Trump administration. On the campaign trail, Trump has vowed mass deportations of even legal immigrants at gunpoint by the National Guard. It's hard to imagine such a policy gaining support among the immigrant community interested in military service.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/10/immigrants-show-greater-willingness-join-military-new-study-shows/400469/	2024-10-22T15:10:59-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/22/GettyImages_566039953-1/large.jpg
