Army wants to buy as many drones as it does munitions	The Army wants to buy drones in the &ldquo;kind of quantities&rdquo; it buys munitions, Army acquisition chief Doug Bush said Wednesday during an webcast with Defense News. &ldquo;We need them potentially at very large scale and very quickly,&rdquo; said Bush. &ldquo;They&#39;re somewhere between a munition and the way we think about a large platform,&rdquo; he added. The Army has plans to eventually field drones of different types at the platoon, company, and brigade levels. So far, the Army has only fielded drones at the platoon level under the Short Range Reconnaissance program. Fielding of the drone, currently the Skydio RQ-28A, is still in its early stages. The Army requested 207 of these drones in 2023, and 459 in 2024, according to budget documents. In September, the Army selected Anduril and Performance Drone Works to provide drones to company-level units. These drones are larger than the RQ-28A and have a longer loitering time, among other features. Starting in fiscal year 2026, The Army will evaluate prototype drones for the brigade level program. [[Related Posts]] The Army may also field first-person-view drones, typically used as a loitering munition, and tethered drones. Bush did not specify what types of munitions he was referring to. Excluding rounds for small arms, the Army buys munitions like missiles and artillery shells in the range of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Army leaders have put drones at the center of a new fielding effort dubbed &ldquo;transforming in contact,&rdquo; and have asked for more money for them in this year&rsquo;s unfunded priorities lists. Multiple units across the Army are also experimenting with drone uses and training. However, an Defense One analysis indicates that U.S. industry is not ready to produce the hundreds of thousands of drones that may be needed in a major war, &ldquo;Until the U.S. military mainstreams operational concepts that demand large numbers of drones, production will remain at a relatively low level,&rdquo; Hudson Institute senior fellow Bryan Clark previously told Defense One. Smaller drones like those the Army gives platoons and companies, are relatively simple to manufacture, Bush said. &ldquo;A lot of it is people hand-building things.&rdquo; Bush also highlighted the Army&rsquo;s focus on software-based updates and modular open-system architecture&mdash;the ability to easily add and subtract components like a new radar or sensor. &ldquo;Those are the two major pushes from both large platforms like [Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft] and XM-30 [Infantry Combat Vehicle] all the way down to small [drones],&rdquo; Bush said. Both approaches allow the Army to upgrade equipment quickly, helping the service to field improved systems &ldquo;at the speed needed in combat,&rdquo; he said. Bush also said artificial intelligence is decreasing the load on the Army&rsquo;s contracting force. There are AI pilot programs that assist contracting personnel in &ldquo;everything from our research to writing initial [request for proposals] to doing draft contracts to doing evaluations of contracts,&rdquo; Bush said. &ldquo;I&#39;m assuming we&#39;re probably not going to get a lot more [contracting professionals].&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We&#39;ve got to use technology to help them do their jobs.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/army-wants-buy-many-drones-it-does-munitions/399646/	2024-09-18T14:18:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_11.17.25AM/large.png
Budget drama could snag Pentagon’s satellite launch award	The Pentagon&rsquo;s new satellite launch competition between SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin could be delayed if Congress passes a long continuing resolution instead of a full budget for 2025, a space acquisitions official said Wednesday. Congress is scrambling to avert a government shutdown by Sept. 30 as House Republicans are poised to reject a proposed six-month continuing resolution funding bill for fiscal year 2025. Continuing resolutions, or CRs, are stopgap funding solutions that fund the government and programs at the same level as the previous year, to keep money flowing in the absence of full-year appropriations. Source selection for &ldquo;Lane 2&rdquo; of the National Security Space Launch Phase 3 program is continuing despite budget concerns, with the intent to award later this year. But work may be delayed if there&rsquo;s no permanent funding for 2025. &ldquo;The source selection is still underway. It&rsquo;s been underway for a while, it&rsquo;s a big important contract so we&rsquo;re definitely going to do a lot of due diligence on that. Anticipate the source selection being complete, being ready to award towards the end of this calendar year. But we need a budget,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, commander of Space Launch Delta 45 and program executive officer for Space Systems Command&rsquo;s assured access to space office. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do the mission assignments and actually put the specific launch on contract if I don&rsquo;t have that money. So while I would like to be able to do that at the beginning of the year, have a full budget, do it at the beginning of the fiscal year, give the companies the maximum amount of time to make sure integration and everything is ready to go, I have to wait until I have the funding to actually be able to put specific missions on contract,&rdquo; she told reporters Wednesday at the annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. [[Related Posts]] A continuing resolution could mean a monthslong waiting period and then &ldquo;sprinting to try to get everything done, which is not the most efficient cadence that we could be operating at,&rdquo; said Panzenhagen, who later added the command hasn&rsquo;t determined how it will handle award announcements if Congress agrees to a long CR. The Space Force has already signaled it wants to do more launches this year. Space Systems Command buys launches about two years in advance to give companies time to work on satellite integration. For &ldquo;Lane 2,&rdquo; there will be one large contract award for the annual mission assignments. Up to three companies can be awarded, with the third best provider getting seven missions and the top two splitting the rest 60-40, Panzenhagen said, without specifying how many total missions there would be. Companies must go through a certification process before they&rsquo;re eligible to bid on the contract. Some rocket providers are still going through that process, which has several components, including different reference orbits and launch bases. But the bottom line is: &ldquo;We also need an FY25 budget to award that contract,&rdquo; Panzenhagen said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/budget-drama-could-snag-pentagons-satellite-launch-award/399645/	2024-09-18T14:09:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_11.08.06AM/large.png
Test B-21 flying up to twice a week, Northrop reports	Flight testing of the Air Force&rsquo;s B-21 Raider stealth bomber is moving along swimmingly, officials report, giving a rare, and small, update on the highly classified program. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re really starting to strike up quite a cadence. We&#39;re actually able to generate two test flights, sometimes, within a week, which, if you think about how far ahead we are, that&#39;s great,&rdquo; said Tom Jones, president of Northrop&rsquo;s Aeronautics Systems. &ldquo;I think we&#39;re well on the way to delivering a kind of asset that can be that daily flyer for U.S. warfighters out there.&rdquo; The company has three aircraft &ldquo;in various configurations&rdquo; in flight test right now, Jones said Wednesday at the Air & Space Forces Association&rsquo;s annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Two of them are being used for ground testing and one for flight testing. &ldquo;I don&#39;t want to jinx myself, but we&#39;ve had more issues with test fixtures and training of our test personnel than we actually have with the test article, which, again, is a pretty good place to be at this point,&rdquo; Jones said. The program also completed a static test on a ground-based test article used to prove out the structure of the aircraft, according to William Bailey, director of the Air Force&rsquo;s Rapid Capabilities Office. Meanwhile, Northrop has already started building production aircraft. The company received the greenlight for low-rate initial production after the B-21 took its first flight in November. The Air Force plans to buy at least 100 B-21s to replace its B-1 and B-2 bombers. Once the Raider enters service, it will first go to Ellsworth Air Force Base. The service recently announced the second and third operating bases for B-21s: Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. Demand for the service&rsquo;s bomber task forces is only going to increase as B-21 comes online in the years ahead, Air Force Global Strike Commander Gen. Thomas Bussiere said Wednesday. &ldquo;As we transition from the B-1 and the B-2 to the B-21, and we transition from the B-52H to the B-52J model, there&#39;s a realization that we&#39;re probably not going to see a decreased demand signal from our regional combatant commands on bomber task forces,&rdquo; Bussiere said. &ldquo;As we transition from the legacy to new, the B-21 will provide great comfort to our allies and should provide great pause for a potential adversary.&rdquo; The service released a new image and video of the B-21 flying and landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/test-b-21s-flying-twice-week-northrop-reports/399641/	2024-09-18T13:37:53-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/8648580/large.jpg
Air Force’s Ospreys will return to forward-deployment within 'wee...	The Air Force is weeks away from sending its V-22 Ospreys back to combatant commands after the Pentagon lifted a months-long grounding on the tiltrotor fleet earlier this year. &ldquo;We will deploy out here in the coming weeks, back to support other geographic combatant commanders. We&#39;ll go back to the missions that only the CV-22 can do, or what the combatant commanders need us to do,&rdquo; Air Force Special Operations Command head Lt. Gen. Michael Conley told reporters Wednesday at the Air & Space Forces Association&rsquo;s annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Conley didn&rsquo;t specify where they would send the V-22s, but said it will be to &ldquo;support the wars we&rsquo;re engaged in,&rdquo; and noted it won&rsquo;t be INDOPACOM or EUCOM, since those commands already have V-22 wings assigned there. The Pentagon grounded its entire fleet of Ospreys in late 2023 after a deadly crash off the coast of Japan killed eight airmen in November. The aircraft were cleared to fly again in March with some limitations: flights and missions have to stay within 30 minutes of a &ldquo;suitable divert airfield.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] But Conley said the divert rule is just a &ldquo;planning factor,&rdquo; and won&rsquo;t affect AFSOC&rsquo;s ability to complete its mission for combatant commands. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even call it a limitation,&rdquo; Conley said. As of today, 60 percent of the fleet is fully operational, and by late 2024 or early next year, all 51 of the service&rsquo;s CV-22s will be ready for duty, Conley said. Last month, the Air Force released its investigation into the November crash, and found it was caused by the &ldquo;catastrophic failure&rdquo; of a prop-rotor gearbox and the pilot&rsquo;s decision to keep flying despite warnings. The service still doesn&rsquo;t know exactly why the part failed, but Conley maintained it was a &ldquo;rare&rdquo; occurrence. Conley doesn&rsquo;t believe the failure was caused by poor material from Bell Textron and Boeing, who build the Pentagon&rsquo;s V-22s. The companies have been &ldquo;good partners&rdquo; throughout the investigation, he added. But the families of Marines killed in a 2022 Osprey crash disagree, and are suing the companies, alleging they knew the aircraft was unsafe and failed to disclose that to the Pentagon. Aviation Week reported last week that the Air Force is considering overhauling the V-22&rsquo;s airworthiness certification. Asked about the possibility of the service rescinding airworthiness, Conley said: &ldquo;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re there. I think discussions may continue, but I don&#39;t think anyone&#39;s close to a decision on whether we need to break from the current construct.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/air-forces-ospreys-will-be-forward-deployed-within-weeks/399638/	2024-09-18T13:14:08-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_10.10.03AM/large.png
The D Brief: Why pagers explode; Russian ammo dump blows up; CNO ...	Israeli intelligence operatives appear to have pulled off a legendary and deadly supply chain hack, installing tiny quantities of explosives into at least 3,000 pagers specially ordered by Iran-backed Hezbollah militants across Lebanon and Syria, U.S. officials told Reuters, the New York Times, and the Associated Press over the past 24 hours. What happened: Thousands of the AR-924 pagers exploded remotely Tuesday around 3:30 p.m. local, killing at least a dozen people, including two children, and wounding around 2,800 others, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said Wednesday. &ldquo;Explosive material, as little as one to two ounces, was implanted next to the battery in each pager,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A switch was also embedded that could be triggered remotely to detonate the explosives,&rdquo; the Times reported Tuesday. The pagers were initially traced to a company in Taiwan, but officials there point to Hungary, where the devices were made under license by a separate company based in Budapest, AP reported Wednesday. That Hungarian firm, known as BAC Consulting KFT, &ldquo;appeared to be a shell company,&rdquo; according to AP. Expert reax: &ldquo;There are many failure points in supply chains,&rdquo; noted Decker Eveleth of Virginia-based CNA. &ldquo;I don&#39;t think we should jump to the conclusion that [BAC was] directly involved or simply a front&rdquo; for Israeli intelligence, he warned. &ldquo;This would easily be the biggest counterintelligence failure that Hezbollah has had in decades,&rdquo; one former U.S. official told Reuters. Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank in Washington described it as &ldquo;Perhaps one of the most extensive physical supply chain attacks in history.&rdquo; Among those hurt: Iran&#39;s ambassador to Lebanon, who &ldquo;lost one eye and his other eye is severely injured,&rdquo; according to the Times. Q. Is such an attack a violation of international humanitarian law? Apparently, says Shashank Joshi of the Economist&mdash;but possibly not, according to the Brits&rsquo; interpretation of the laws of armed conflict, he noted on social media with the assistance of others.

And if you&rsquo;re not already subscribed, you can do that here. On this day in 2014, President Barack Obama offered military gear but denied weapons to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who had come to Washington seeking help against what the world believed at the time to be Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, though Vladimir Putin later admitted they were in fact Russian military forces without any insignia. A large Russian ammunition depot erupted in a remarkable series of explosions early Wednesday around 3:30 in the morning. Regional earthquake monitors even picked up the blast, which registered as a &ldquo;light magnitude&rdquo; 2.8 quake. Location: The Toropets Northeast Ammunition Depot, in the Tver region of Russia, which is about 300 miles from the frontlines of Russia&rsquo;s Ukraine invasion. Six Ukrainian kamikaze drones were allegedly used in the attack, which appears to have caused several intense burn zones that NASA sensors picked up in the agency&rsquo;s Fire Information for Resource Management System. In video: Here is some footage taken moments after impact showing the initial blast wave followed by a smaller series of secondary explosions and their waves rolling across the illuminated horizon. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re likely looking at the loss of thousands of tons of explosive materials, shells, and rockets,&rdquo; one former Ukrainian officer said, noting, &ldquo;In events of this magnitude, replacement can&#39;t be quick.&rdquo; Developing: Norwegian sensors have reportedly detected cesium near the border with Russia, which would seem to suggest Moscow just tested its new nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed cruise missile known as the 9M730 Burevestnik, aka &ldquo;SSC-X-9 Skyfall&rdquo; according to NATO. &ldquo;The levels are clearly higher than normal, but pose no risk to humans or the environment,&rdquo; a Norwegian official told the Barents Observer on Tuesday, which noted, &ldquo;Cesium-137 is formed as a fission product by operating a nuclear reactor.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s &ldquo;Likely Russia conducted their 13th test of the system,&rdquo; because that location &ldquo;correspond[s] to the activity we see in satellite imagery at the Burevestnik missile test site at Pankovo,&rdquo; said Decker Eveleth. Get up to speed: Reuters has much more on the particular test site, reporting with satellite imagery in early September, here. The Barents Observers also runs down a few alternate possibilities near the end of their report, here. CNO releases new Navigation Plan. Announcing her first addition to the long-running series of guidance papers by the Navy&rsquo;s top officers, Adm. Lisa Franchetti says her top priorities are &ldquo;readiness for conflict with the PRC by 2027 and enhancing long-term advantage.&rdquo; She aims to achieve these ends &ldquo;through two central ways: implementing seven &ldquo;Project 33&rdquo; targets and expanding the Navy&rsquo;s contribution to the Joint warfighting ecosystem.&rdquo; Project 33&mdash;apparently a nod to her status as the 33rd CNO&mdash;includes these bullet points: Ready the force by eliminating ship, submarine, and aircraft maintenance delays Scale robotic and autonomous systems to integrate more platforms at speed Create the command centers our fleets need to win on a distributed battlefield Recruit and retain the force we need to get more players on the field Deliver a quality of service commensurate with the sacrifices of our Sailors Train for combat as we plan to fight, in the real world and virtually Restore the critical infrastructure that sustains and projects the fight from shore. You can read the 27-page document here (free trial required). Reax: The new NAVPLAN drew kudos from Cmdr. Salamander, the venerable and oft-cranky navy blogger. He praises especially her focus on &ldquo;near-term readiness&rdquo; and a reduction in references to diversity compared to the 2022 version. Read that, here. Joint Chiefs Chairman Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., met with four NATO counterparts over the past few days. That included Czech Lt. Gen. Karel Řehka and Turkish Gen. Metin G&uuml;rak Saturday in Prague during the alliance&rsquo;s annual Military Committee Conference. Two days later, Brown spoke with Belgian Gen. Frederik Vansina and Danish Gen. Michael Wiggers Hyldgaard Monday in Copenhagen. CQ&rsquo;s CR warning to HASC&rsquo;s Rogers: Brown warned the top House Armed Services Republican against advancing another temporary funding bill known as a continuing resolution in a letter dated Friday. &ldquo;In the race against time, each CR is the equivalent of taking a knee on advancing our defense capabilities as security challenges increase their momentum to challenge our credible combat power,&rdquo; Brown wrote in his letter. CRs &ldquo;slow progress and damage our relationships with the defense industrial base, eroding trust driving up costs, and increasing delivery times, as industry hedges against funding inconsistencies,&rdquo; Brown said. &ldquo;Should Congress move forward with a six-month CR, we anticipate detrimental impacts to readiness and modernization across the Joint Force,&rdquo; the general warned. &ldquo;Pay and entitlements, nuclear enterprise modernization, shipbuilding and maintenance, aircraft procurement, weapons system sustainment. munitions production, and multiple new starts are just a few examples that will feel the brunt of the lost time and lost buying power caused by a CR.&rdquo; &ldquo;We are living in a consequential time. There is no time to waste,&rdquo; said Brown. And lastly: North Korea launched a series of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast just before 7 a.m. local time Wednesday, South Korea&rsquo;s Yonhap news agency reports. The missiles flew for about 250 miles before splashing down into the water, Seoul&rsquo;s Joint Chiefs of Staff said afterward. Indo-PACOM: &ldquo;The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,&rdquo; U.S. military officials said in a statement. &ldquo;While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation,&rdquo; they added. ICYMI: &ldquo;The North fired several short-range ballistic missiles last Thursday, the first such launch in more than two months, which it later described as a test of a new 600-mm multiple launch rocket system,&rdquo; Reuters reports. And the launches come just a few &ldquo;days after North Korea offered a rare view into a secretive facility built to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs as leader Kim Jong Un called for a rapid expansion of his nuclear weapons program,&rdquo; AP reports. By the way: &ldquo;North Korea&#39;s rapid advancement of its nuclear and missile capabilities, combined with its stated ambition to exponentially expand its nuclear arsenal, is the single greatest challenge&rdquo; facing U.S. and allied forces in the region, said Army Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson, the nominee to lead U.S. Forces Korea, told lawmakers Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Yonhap has more from that extended exchange, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-18-2024/399621/	2024-09-18T08:28:46-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/DB_lander/large.png
NATO considering Arctic combined air operations center to deal wi...	The recent addition of Sweden and Finland to the NATO alliance is opening up new opportunities for members to better work together in the Arctic, where Russian activity has been increasing. That could mean a new combined air operations center, or CAOC &ldquo;fairly shortly,&rdquo; U.S. Air Forces Europe and NATO Allied Air Command Gen. James Hecker said Tuesday at the Air & Space Forces Association&#39;s Air Space & Cyber conference. Hecker said he has U.S. European Command head Gen. Chris Cavoli&rsquo;s approval to further explore the idea. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve thrown out the idea. Gen. Cavoli in principle agrees with it. That doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s a done deal,&rdquo; he told Defense One, noting that the proposal still has to make it through NATO leadership. The location of the potential CAOC is yet to be determined, he said. During a panel discussion with representatives from the Swedish and Norwegian air forces, Hecker told them: &ldquo;We&#39;re going to exploit that close relationship between the Arctic nations and the knowledge that you bring to make that happen. So we&#39;re going to use that, and we&#39;re going to exploit it, and I think we&#39;ll probably get a third CAOC up there fairly shortly.&rdquo; Russian incursions into NATO airspace happen frequently in the Arctic, said Maj. Gen. &Oslash;ivind Gunnerud, the chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. &ldquo;On average, per year, we intercept Russians once or twice per week [and] their ships all the time.&rdquo; Additionally, he said, there is more to consider for air operations there than at lower latitudes. &ldquo;You will experience icing. Now, inland, dry, cold climate, it has its challenges. But what we see in Norway, we have a lot of the coastal climate, above and below the freezing level all the time. So you have slippery runways. And, of course, it&#39;s night [operation] during the winter time. So you better add your night flying skills up there, that&#39;s for sure.&rdquo; Said Hecker, the U.S. Air Force has been experimenting with MQ-9 Reaper and Global Hawk drones in the Arctic Circle to increase situational awareness, &ldquo;which we haven&#39;t done in the past,&rdquo; as well as high-altitude balloons and other drones. But, he noted, Arctic conditions offer special challenges to unmanned systems as well, as many are powered via solar panels on the wings. &ldquo;That will work out in the summer, probably not so great in the winter,&rdquo; he said. If the proposal becomes a reality, the Arctic CAOC would be NATO&rsquo;s third, joining one in Germany and another in Spain.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/nato-considering-arctic-combined-air-operations-center-deal-russian-threats/399614/	2024-09-17T18:31:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/17/GettyImages_1132893105/large.jpg
