New AI-powered strike drone shows how quickly battlefield autonom...	Small drones have been changing modern warfare at least since 2015, when Russia and Ukraine began to use them to great effect for rapid targeting. The latest addition is a strike-and-intelligence quadcopter that its builder hopes will do more things with a lot less operator attention. The point of the Bolt-M, revealed by Anduril today, is to make fewer demands on the operator and offer more information than, easy-to-produce first-person-view strike drones, the type that Ukraine is producing by the hundreds of thousands. The U.S. Army, too, is looking at FPV drones for infantry platoons. But they require special training to use and come with a lot of operational limits. The Bolt-M, according to an Anduril statement, works 'without requiring specialized operators.&rdquo; The company has a contract from the U.S. Marine Corps' Organic Precision Fires &ndash; Light, or OPF-L, program to develop a strike variant. Bolt-M's key selling feature is its autonomy-and-AI software powered by Anduril's Lattice platform. The operator can draw a bounding box on a battlefield display, set a few specifications, and send the drone on its way. 'Once a target is identified in Lattice, an operator can specify a standoff position for Bolt-M to maintain, tasking the system to stalk the target from beyond visual or acoustic detection range even as the target moves and is occluded,&rdquo; the company statement said. 'When it's time to strike, an operator can define the engagement angle to ensure the most effective strike, while onboard vision and guidance algorithms maintain terminal guidance even if connectivity is lost with the operator.&rdquo; But the system is also intended to handle some reconnaissance tasks that humans do but other small cheap strike drones don't. In conversation with reporters on Wednesday, Anduril chief strategy officer Chris Brose said that the Bolt-M is intended to help its operator 'to understand what's happening on the battlefield, whether it's kind of known targets or targets that are recognizable to the systems on board, or whether it's unknown things that that operator can then select through its interaction with the autonomous system, tell it to track, tell it to follow, eventually, if so desired, based on the human saying &lsquo;Go,' to actually fly in and engage that target.&rdquo; Brose said the Bolt-M might even be able to spot new variants of older weapons. 'If the Russians in this instance start modifying them and building these kinds of turtle tanks, maybe the computer vision hasn't seen that already&hellip;it can still surface that insight back to an operator.&rdquo; Over the next six months, the Marine Corps will put the Bolt-M's munition variant through 'a pretty rigorous test and evaluation campaign,&rdquo; he said. The Bolt-M pushes right up to the limits of the Pentagon principle that robotic weapons should always have a person involved in lethal decisions. Brose said that their efforts are guided by the company's experiences in Ukraine, particularly feedback from Ukranians who are face-to-face with Russia's electronic warfare. The drone can fly to GPS waypoints. But in places where GPS is under attack, operators can manually control it&mdash;and it can maintain custody of the target and execute previous operator-delivered commands even when links are broken. In many ways, the Bolt-M derives its real value, and its intelligence, from the Lattice platform, which can integrate data from varioussensors and sources. Anduril is working to make sure that Lattice works with a variety of drones, even from other manufacturers, said Brose. That could give the company a key, central role as different forces buy different drones or make their own in the field. 'What we are doing with Lattice is to deliver as much autonomy across that entire kill chain to put that human being on-the-loop so that they can make better decisions faster. They can make more decisions. They can take more actions because they have an intelligent system that's incorporating&hellip;sensor data, platforms, vehicles,&rdquo; he said. But what decisions? The Defense Department maintains a list of AI ethical principles that say that human beings must be able to 'exercise appropriate levels of judgment and remain responsible for the development, deployment, use,&rdquo; over AI-enabled weapons. Last year, the Pentagon sought to clarify what is and is not allowable&mdash;while leaving room to adjust the rules if things change. One of the key lessons from Ukraine's battlefield is that battlefield conditions can move very rapidly. Different nations, allied and adversary, will have different policies around lethal autonomy. Those other policies will change rapidly, too, depending on what's happening on the front lines. As attacks against the connections binding humans to drones become more effective, the need for more capable autonomy will increase. Brose said Anduril anticipates that U.S. policy will change, and they want to be ready to serve the Pentagon's new needs when it happens. 'We're not going to go out and solve for every sort of hypothetical edge case,&rdquo; he said. 'Our focus is on making the system as capable as possible based on how we believe users want to and need to use it now and in the near future. Then, to the extent that that gets limited or governed or restrained by policy or rules of engagement, that is entirely the decision of the government. We want them to have that choice, rather than realize that they would like to have a more capable system, but, but, you know, we're not capable of providing it to them.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-ai-powered-strike-drone-shows-how-quickly-battlefield-autonomy-evolving/400179/	2024-10-09T21:01:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/2024_Bolt_Hero_1/large.jpg
Russian casualties have topped 600,000 in Ukraine war, US says	More than 600,000 Russian soldiers have been killed or wounded since Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a senior U.S. defense official said Wednesday. Ukrainian drone strikes have taken out large amounts of Russian supplies as well, the official added, speaking on background. Hundreds of thousands of rounds of ammunition have been destroyed in Russian and North Korean weapons stockpiles in Russia. The attacks have made a 'serious dent&rdquo; in Russian supply lines, the official said, adding that Russia would likely need to move munitions dumps farther from the front lines, thereby slowing deliveries to the front. Russia has also lost more than two-thirds of its tanks, and has begun drawing on Soviet-era stocks that date back to World War II, the official said. Russian forces sustained their highest month-on-month losses of the war in September, said a senior military official, who cited a Russian push toward Pokrovsk as a leading factor in the high casualty rate. Russia has been making gains near Pokrovsk thanks to a grinding offensive that has seen its forces inch forward as Ukrainian troops are constrained by ammunition shortages, deal with flagging morale, and struggled to recruit soldiers. Moscow's losses could eventually influence Putin's calculus on continuing the war as he seeks to balance his foreign and domestic goals, said the senior government official. 'Putin is trying to avoid a mass mobilization because of the effect that would have on Russia's domestic population,&rdquo; the official said. 'At this point, he has been able to significantly increase the pay of these voluntary soldiers, and he has been able to continue to field those forces without doing a major mobilization. And I think we're just watching very closely how long that stance can actually be one that he can maintain.&rdquo; It's a proposition that bears similarity to a victory plan proposed by Estonia in December 2023, which sought to increase weapons transfers to Ukraine and training for its troops in order to exhaust Russian forces and force Putin to either make unpopular mobilization choices or make peace. Russia performed partial mobilization in September and October 2022. At the time, tens of thousands of Russian men left for neighboring countries to avoid the draft. Moscow is now meeting its need for soldiers by offering lucrative contracts that push soldiers' pay far past the average for Russian citizens. Russia has also decreased its standards for soldiers in order to avoid mobilization, leading to greater reported crimes and discipline problems within its army. Putin's decision to only partly mobilize troops so far is evidence that he sees political risks in expanding recruiting, said John Herbst, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center. 'This is a potential point of vulnerability for the regime,&rdquo; Herbst said. 'The Russian people are not in this war. They're not marching towards the sound of the drums.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/russian-casualties-have-topped-600k-us-says/400181/	2024-10-09T20:35:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/Russias_Southern_Mi_2500/large.jpg
Lockheed taps deputy F-35 chief to take over program	Lockheed Martin is switching the leader of its behemoth F-35 fighter jet program, announcing today that the program's deputy, Chauncey McIntosh, will take the helm. On Dec. 1, McIntosh will succeed Bridget Lauderdale, a long-time Lockheed executive who led the company's F-35 efforts for three years. Lauderdale will retire at the end of the year, according to a company statement. McIntosh will take over after a rocky year for the program: the company is dealing with major delays while developing new technology for the jet, which resulted in the Pentagon halting deliveries last year. Company officials have yet to finish negotiations over the price tag of jets in the next production lot. F-35 sustainment costs remain high, and the company has failed to convince Pentagon officials to move to a long-desired, performance-based logistics sustainment deal. 'As the vice president and general manager for the F-35 program, McIntosh will be responsible for further strengthening positive customer experiences by reinforcing and continually growing the capability and reliability of the F-35; showcasing significant program progress; and ensuring the F-35 program meets the speed, agility, quality and affordability requirements deserved and expected by U.S. and international customers,&rdquo; the company said. Before joining the F-35 program as deputy, McIntosh led Lockheed Martin's integrated warfare systems & sensors business, which develops software for Aegis air-defense systems. Before that, he was the vice president and general manager for Lockheed's training and logistics business, leading mission readiness and sustainment programs for the F-35 and other products. He has also worked on aspects of the F-22, C-5, P-3, and S3 programs.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/lockheed-taps-deputy-f-35-chief-take-over-program/400163/	2024-10-09T11:15:24-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/7791195/large.jpg
Industry ‘hamstrung’ by Space Force-intel community’s turf war	The space industry is waiting for the Space Force and intelligence community to come to an agreement over buying commercial satellite imagery and related analysis&mdash;a fight, some say, that is preventing troops from making the fullest use of orbital capabilities. Currently, the National Reconnaissance Office is in charge of buying intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance imagery from commercial space providers, and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency in charge of purchasing analytic products. But in the five years since the Space Force was created, the young service has increasingly pushed for funds and leeway to work directly with commercial firms, arguing that it can more quickly get important information to combatant commands. Earlier this year, Space Force launched a $40 million pilot program to show just how fast it could move information and insights from orbiting sensors to troops on ground. It began soliciting bids for 'tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking,&rdquo; or TacSRT, through a 'marketplace,&rdquo; Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told reporters last month. 'What TacSRT is doing with this pilot in particular is: we simply ask a question into the marketplace: &lsquo;Hey, what generally does it look like around Air Base 201? Are there any items of interest, trucks, that are massing? Is there a huge parking lot? Do we see people milling around?' We simply ask the question. And commercial industry provides us products that try to help us answer the question,&rdquo; he said. Saltzman has emphasized that the pilot program buys analysis based on imagery but not images themselves, carefully skirting NRO's territory. Executives with commercial space companies that have participated in the pilot's marketplace call it revolutionary. Some jobs have moved from a work statement announcement to the start of a mission in as little as 24 to 72 hours. But these executives say that unless TacSRT gets more funding, and the intel community gives more leeway to the Space Force, commercial companies and combatant commands could suffer. Under the current NGA-centric process, it can take weeks for military analysts in a relatively quiet command&mdash;i.e., anywhere that's not China, Ukraine, or the Middle East&mdash;to hear back on a request for satellite imagery, said Joe Morrison, the vice president of remote sensing at Umbra, which operates a synthetic aperture radar constellation and provides data to analytics firms in the TacSRT program. Morrison said the current system was designed to manage requests for a scarce number of very-high-quality, very-much-in-demand 'national assets&rdquo;&mdash;not to draw efficiently on commercial offerings to make sure all needs are met in timely fashion. He said this has discouraged analysts from even putting in a request for imagery or insights, which has artificially depressed apparent demand for them and has 'hamstrung&rdquo; Umbra's ability to demonstrate its utility. 'If there's one way in which the inability for us as a nation to come to terms on Title 10 versus Title 50 has probably hurt Umbra&mdash;and really the commercial remote sensing industry in the United States more generally&mdash;is that we haven't been able to show how effective we can be as quickly as we were able technically because of the vestigial bureaucratic processes that are set up in order to avoid government waste, which is a good reason to set them up, but the reality on the ground is changing faster than those policies can change,&rdquo; Morrison said. NGA officials have recently pushed back on allegations that the agency moves too slowly: 'My inbox would be full of emails if we were failing in this regard&mdash;and it is not. I do not get negative reports from the COCOMs on our timelines,&rdquo; NGA director Vice Adm. Frank Whitworth told reporters in August. Decision time While officials in the intelligence community and Space Force generally agree that they will need to use commercial capability, especially in wartime, the entities still have to draw lines over who has tasking authority for specific situations and who is in charge of the COCOMs' needs. And it's not easy to change the culture of the intel community, which for decades has only been trusting systems made in-house. 'It's only natural for an entity in the IC that's used to building really badass systems and is anointed on behalf of the entire government to do it, to bristle at the fact that someone else is going to come in and say they have a new way of doing things. For sure, there will be resistance when Space Force tries to scale it, if for nothing else other than it's going to require moving someone's cheese,&rdquo; said Eric Jensen, CEO of ICEYE U.S., a subsidy of a Finnish SAR imagery provider that participates in the Space Force's TacSRT program. Despite this reticence, Jensen said, there has to be policy change so the Space Force can provide surge capacity to the COCOMs when they need it&mdash;and to support commercial-space companies like his. 'The question is: is the government going to continue to support the crossing of the chasm where these companies are able to truly operationalize their capabilities in a way that is well defined? I think that that's been painful for companies that, like us, can move very quickly, but are somewhat beholden to the government's bureaucratic timelines,&rdquo; Jensen said. Programs like TacSRT are key to incubating space startups that can work quickly, said Derek Tishler, founder of analytics provider BoxMica, a five-person company whose 2024 revenue has largely come from TacSRT jobs. 'With a few million dollars, a half dozen or more companies like ours would flourish and imagine if it's a little bigger budget when it comes to things like TacSRT,&rdquo; Tishler said. 'The NRO might not be working at such a small contract level, or a lot of those organizations, so I really hope there's a place for both, and then they can meet in the middle ground where everyone gets a little bit more money and a little bit more opportunities.&rdquo; He said he hopes the Space Force gets 'a lot more leeway&rdquo; to work directly with commercial firms. A potential compromise would see the NRO keep the high-resolution, exquisite capability and hand the tactical ISR mission to the Space Force, said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. But that would likely require intervention by higher levels of government. 'I would think that is something the next administration should tackle and the National Space Council, but I'm not optimistic that they're going to reach any kind of a consensus on how to do this going forward in the near future, so I think we're going to be stuck in this bureaucratic paralysis where what's suffering is the Space Force's ability to do its job and the warfighters ability to leverage commercial space to the fullest extent,&rdquo; Harrison said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/industry-hamstrung-space-force-intel-communitys-turf-war/400156/	2024-10-09T10:16:50-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/09/02_nelsonmandelabridgeandbraamfonteinrailyard_johannesburgsouthafrica_24july2024_wvl/large.jpg
The D Brief: Baltics raise defenses; Israel orders hospital evacu...	Lithuania's military says it's ready to blow up its bridges to Russia's Kaliningrad exclave, which is located on the Baltic coast between Poland and Lithuania. The Lithuanians have placed vehicle obstacles known as 'dragon's teeth&rdquo; on a bridge over the Nemunas River, which leads to Kaliningrad. Those obstacles 'will eventually be supplemented with iron beams, which will be sunk in and anchored,&rdquo; Defense Minister Laurynas Kasčiūnas said Wednesday on Facebook with an illustrating photo. 'The Lithuanian army is now testing them, evaluating how they hold back the advancing heavy equipment.&rdquo; 'Fortifications will be supported by firepower, in case it's needed, to stop and destroy the enemy&hellip;with some bridges set to be demolished,&rdquo; the Lithuanian Defense Ministry said Wednesday on social media. Context: 'Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania agreed to build a Baltic defense line in the coming years to strengthen the eastern border with Belarus and Russia, the Estonian Defense Ministry said on Jan. 19,&rdquo; the Kyiv Independent reports. 'Russia's war in Ukraine has shown that, in addition to equipment, ammunition and manpower, we also need physical defense facilities on the border to protect Estonia from the first meter,&rdquo; Estonia's defense minister said at the time. Rewind: You may recall that when Defense One traveled to Denmark in 2019 to observe Danish military training, troops spent part of their time rehearsing river crossings in anticipation of a possible invasion by the Russian military. 'Our major problem fighting in an environment like the Baltics would be bridging capacity,&rdquo; one officer explained. 'There are so many rivers, and they are so wide, and we only have bridges that can stretch 20 meters. And we don't have very many bridges. And that's as I see it our major challenge to fighting in the Baltics.&rdquo; For what it's worth: Most of Kaliningrad's border with Lithuania follows either the Nemunas or &Scaron;e&scaron;upė rivers. Additional reading: 'Most of Europe is fine without Russian gas,&rdquo; Politico reported Wednesday; 'Russia bans Discord chat program, to the chagrin of its military users,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Friday; And 'Ukraine's Allies See Kyiv Getting More Flexible Over War Endgame,&rdquo; Bloomberg reported Tuesday.

Involved: 'The Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile, a type of air-launched cruise missile, and a communications system known as the Link 16 &mdash; a data sharing network used by the US and NATO,&rdquo; CNN reported, citing 'an annex attached to a classified report&rdquo; delivered to Congress in early September. Fine print: 'US officials have previously expressed concerns about sensitive US technology falling into Russian hands, which one source said is likely the holdup with the Link 16 system.&rdquo; And the missiles, 'which are fired from fighter jets, might not be useful to the Ukrainians unless they achieve some level of air superiority.&rdquo; Continue reading (new paywall alert) at CNN, here.

'The arsenal stored ammunition for missile and artillery systems, including those delivered from North Korea, as well as glide bombs,&rdquo; the General Staff said, adding, 'Much of the ammunition was stored in the open.&rdquo; Relatedly, Russian authorities declared a 'state of emergency&rdquo; in the region Ukraine says it attacked overnight, according to Reuters. 'The Bryansk emergencies ministry said the situation was under control, and made no mention of a weapons arsenal,&rdquo; the wire service reports. How to build a multi-sensor anti-drone dashboard in just two weeks.

Taking a public pulse, Taiwanese version: Most Taiwanese believe China is unlikely to invade in the next five years, according to a survey conducted last month by the Institute for National Defence and Security Research, which Reuters calls Taiwan's top military think tank. Key results: 61% of respondents believe an attack is 'unlikely or very unlikely.' More than 67% said they would fight back if China did invade, but were about evenly split over whether Taiwan's military could actually turn back an invasion. Some 74% believed the U.S. government was likely to 'indirectly' help Taiwan by providing food, medical supplies, and weapons, but just 52% thought the U.S. would send military forces to fight. Read more from Reuters, here. U.S. version: If China invades Taiwan, Americans would support airlifting supplies (74%) and sending weapons to Taipei (59%) but not putting US forces into a position that could lead to war with China (58% oppose)&mdash;all that according to respondents to a recent survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. Other findings: 51% said the U.S. should encourage Taiwan to maintain the status quo rather than move toward independence (36%) or unification (4%). Just 42% want to commit to defend Taiwan from China, but more support Taiwan's inclusion in international organizations (59%) and want a U.S.-Taiwan free trade agreement (62%).

Trump’s refusal, so far, to accept transition assistance creates ...	Donald Trump's presidential campaign has missed deadlines to accept assistance from the federal government to prepare for a transition should he win the election, potentially making a change in administration even more stressful for federal employees. Presidential campaigns are supposed to conclude two memorandums of understanding about transition assistance: the first by Sept. 1 with the General Services Administration, concerning office space and information technology; and the second by Oct. 1 with the White House, to cover transition staffers' access to federal agency facilities, documents, and employees. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign reached its agreement with GSA on Sept. 19, almost three weeks late, and a Biden administration official told Government Executive in a statement that it has entered an MOU with Harris, although such a document has not yet been made public. Her campaign has posted its accompanying ethics plan for transition-team members. (Sample: 'Transition Team members will avoid both actual and apparent conflicts of interest.') The official said that the federal transition coordinator is 'actively working with the Trump transition team to complete an MOU.&rdquo; The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment but has previously told Government Executive that it is continuing 'to evaluate and communicate with GSA about the options related to the support offered by GSA.&rdquo; A GSA spokesperson said that the agency 'is prepared to begin providing services to the Trump transition team once an MOU is executed.&rdquo; It would be challenging for the White House to establish the second agreement with Trump without the first, because GSA provides the secure networks and .gov email addresses that enable federal employees to safely exchange information with verified individuals. Agencies 'need to plan. There's a lot of investment that goes in, so the uncertainty of not having those MOUs in place presents a real challenge to them,&rdquo; said Max Stier, president of the Partnership for Public Service, at a press briefing on Monday. 'There's going to be a ton of work that has to be done&hellip;the early investment is critical to get it done and not to put even more burden on the career civil servants.&rdquo; PPS, a nonpartisan good-government group, hosts a Center for Presidential Transition that provides assistance to campaigns and agencies with respect to changes in administration. Valerie Smith Boyd, who leads the PPS Center for Presidential Transition, said the agreement with the White House is necessary for the incoming administration to access the agencies it is about to manage. 'We have one president at a time. The federal agencies are part of the current administration. And for federal agencies to share information and to meet with a president-elect, it's important to define the terms of where that takes place [and] what type of information may be shared at a high level,&rdquo; she said. While the MOUs are optional, Stier argued they're 'optional at a real risk.&rdquo; 'On this proposition [of] &lsquo;we don't trust the government,' that's a problem, because at the end of the day, if you're running it, you're going to have to be trusting it,&rdquo; he said. 'There may be elements of things that you're concerned about, but you're going to need to engage, and if you don't engage, that really will put our country in jeopardy.&rdquo; Boyd said other aspects of transition planning are moving along. The White House has set up a Transition Coordinating Council composed of senior Biden administration officials. Both campaigns have named leaders for their transition teams. And each agency has named an employee in the career Senior Executive Service as transition director. Eric Katz contributed to this report.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/trumps-refusal-so-far-transition-assistance-creates-real-risk-government-continuity/400145/	2024-10-08T12:34:46-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/100824_Getty_GovExec_TrumpandHarris-1/large.jpg
How to build a multi-sensor air-defense dashboard in just two wee...	It takes just a moment to add a new app to your phone, but adding a sensor to a military radar display takes years. That's why air-defense troops must bounce between multiple systems, wasting precious seconds as they scramble to identify incoming drones. But it doesn't have to be that way, according to a recent experiment led by U.S. Central Command. In just two weeks, private companies managed to integrate multiple sensors onto a single display that Army troops tested in upstate New York&mdash;thanks in part to CENTCOM officers who paved the way by negotiating past bureaucratic blocks and assuaging company execs worried about intellectual property rights. While the tech won't be sent to the Middle East just yet, officials hope it will serve as a building block for future efforts. The event began with a week in which companies worked out how their devices would share data to a display. Then, from Sept. 30 to Oct. 4, soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division tested the rig at Fort Drum against 'adversary&rdquo; drones. The unit was selected to test the kit because it currently provides counter-drone support in the Middle East. Army air-defense leaders have said that it takes multiple sensors to identify enemy drones, which can approach friendly forces in a variety of directions, speeds, and courses. Putting all those sensors onto one platform is typically an arduous process, said Master Sgt. Clark Davis, senior non-commissioned officer for CENTCOM's chief technology office. 'If you look at program-of record systems through the acquisition and software development timeframes, most systems take 18 to 24 months to integrate anything&mdash;and that's fast&rdquo; for the Defense Department, Davis said. One previous attempt to integrate a company's sensor into an existing Terminal High Altitude Area Defense radar took 24 months, added Maj. Bryan Cercy, who works with Davis. In principle, integrating multiple displays onto a single screen should be simple, said Schuyler Moore, CENTCOM's chief technology officer. Private companies do such things all the time, such as when mobile developers share their applications on a phone's operating system. But the Defense Department isn't used to it, Moore said. 'The department hasn't necessarily always had to flex that muscle of doing it really quickly in the way that the tech sector has,&rdquo;she said. One obstacle may be technical talent. Age is another problem, with some sensors having been built decades ago before it became standard to make it easy to share data, said Col. Nate Huston, CENTCOM's director of innovation. Getting them to interact with a brand-new display is like 'trying to use your first-gen iPhone in today's world,&rdquo; he said. To change that, the Defense Department needs to get better at encouraging companies to develop products that can be swapped out, Huston said. 'We just have to think more and more creatively about how we incentivize interoperability.&rdquo; Bureaucratic hurdles were another factor, as were companies hesitant to share data lest they lose intellectual property. 'We were working through a lot of concerns,&rdquo; Cercy said. He credited Army senior leaders' focus on the problem for helping to get companies on board. The resulting system will not deploy to the Middle East just yet, said Moore. However, it sets the stage for a second effort that will focus on helping soldiers identify threats faster amid the many signals pinging on their screens. It's the sort of effort that could help prevent deadly attacks like the January one that killed three U.S. soldiers and wounded dozens more in Jordan. The Wall Street Journal reported that air-defense troops misidentified the enemy drone as a friendly one. 'The second piece will be to take all of the data that we have pulled from this week and start working on that quicker tag of hostile or non-hostile,&rdquo; she said. While the sensor systems that CENTCOM tried in the recent experiment are built for the larger drones that soldiers face in the Middle East, the platform for sharing sensors could also eventually integrate sensors for the smaller first-person-view drones common in Ukraine, Moore added. 'We've discovered in conversations with a lot of the vendors that they have the ability to drop down to smaller sizes if we were to give them the chance,&rdquo; she said. Moore said her team is also closely focused on what Ukraine is doing against drones, and has talked multiple times with Security Group Assistance Ukraine, the U.S.-led body that coordinates aid for Ukraine. 'We have, in many ways, been watching Ukraine for the last three years as it goes through Christmas future of what we would experience in our theater,&rdquo; she said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/how-build-multi-sensor-air-defense-dashboard-just-two-weeks/400135/	2024-10-08T12:03:04-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/desert_guardian_Screenshot_2024_10_08_at_2.15.23PM_2/large.jpg
Foreign adversaries will aim to discredit US election results, in...	Certain foreign countries will attempt to cast doubt on the results of the upcoming U.S. election by amplifying false claims and disinformation, intelligence officials warn. The intelligence community 'expects foreign influence actors to continue their campaigns by calling into question the validity of the election's results after the polls close,&rdquo; an official in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told reporters on a Monday call. 'Thus, in such a contested post-election atmosphere, foreign actors probably will use tactics similar to those that they are using today to undermine trust in the integrity of the election and election processes, as well as to further exacerbate divisions among Americans,&rdquo; said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity per ground rules of the call. The assessment, delivered just under a month before Election Day, adds that foreign adversaries are expecting the race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump to be a close call. Foreign nations &mdash; namely China, Iran, and Russia &mdash; have already made attempts throughout the past year to meddle in election outcomes and political discourse. The U.S. last month charged Iranian operatives with carrying out hacking activities to disrupt the election, including a breach into the email inboxes of Trump campaign staff. Officials also said that China, Cuba, and Russia are aiming to influence the vote in select congressional races to promote candidates that are more in favor of the nations' geopolitical or economic stances. Moscow, for instance, backs candidates opposed to sending more aid to Ukraine, while Beijing is pushing for those that support core interests around its claims to Taiwan. Cuba is focused on top-of-mind political issues, including trade embargoes and travel restrictions. 'Havana considers election influence activities as part of its standing requirements to influence those policies, and Florida is a prime target of their activities,&rdquo; said the ODNI official, who added that Cuban operatives have focused heavily on the Latino population and Spanish-speaking voters. A different ODNI official said that campaigns have received 'defensive briefings&rdquo; about the malign influence efforts but declined to name specifics. The official added that the office has delivered more than 'three times the number of briefings that we have delivered in prior election cycles.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/foreign-adversaries-will-aim-discredit-results-after-election-day-intel-officials-warn/400129/	2024-10-08T08:45:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/100824electionNG-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: MacDill AFB evacuates; Ukraine hits oil terminal; Ru...	Milton intensifies: Florida residents in the vicinity of Tampa Bay are under new evacuation alerts after Hurricane Milton quickly strengthened Monday into a category five storm headed for the Florida coast. In the hours since, however, it has reduced somewhat into a category four storm expected to make landfall in Florida on Thursday. Latest: 'Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida,&rdquo; the National Hurricane Center said Tuesday. On Monday, it reached a maximum intensity of 180 mph, 'making it one of the most intense Atlantic Basin hurricanes on record,&rdquo; according to the Weather Channel. New: Personnel on MacDill Air Force Base are under a limited evacuation order, with basewide closure expected later today. MacDill, which is home to U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command, is situated on a peninsula between St. Petersburg and Tampa&mdash;almost directly in the path of Milton as it's projected to sweep northeast toward Orlando and Daytona Beach. Evacuations began Monday, base officials said in a video on Facebook. The airfield itself is already closed. The base commissary and Post Exchange are closing today at 12 p.m. ET. Portions of seven surrounding counties are also under that limited evacuation order. For more details, you can read over the order (PDF) here. Meanwhile in North Carolina, portions of the 101st Airborne Division are going house to house to find out what storm-hit families need, Liz Friden of Fox reported from Garren Creek, near Asheville. 'Once checked, the soldiers tied a pink ribbon on the houses to mark they had what they needed and told residents they would come back in a few days,&rdquo; said Friden's colleague, Jenn Griffin.

Ukraine is keeping up its campaign of attacking Russia's oil infrastructure, including an early morning strike Monday at a large terminal in occupied Crimea. Troops with Kyiv's missile forces carried out the attack, Ukraine's General Staff said on Facebook. 'The Feodosia terminal is the largest in Crimea in terms of transshipment of oil products, which were used, in particular, to meet the needs of the occupation army of the Russian Federation,&rdquo; the military said in a statement Monday. A bit more, here. Invasion latest: 'Russian troops have now entered Toretsk, a strategic hilltop city, and are pressing with assaults elsewhere in the Donetsk region,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Tuesday from Kyiv. 'To seize the remaining third [of Donetsk], it would need to break through several Ukrainian defensive lines of trenches and anti-tank ditches, and battle its way through densely populated urban centers &mdash; a grueling fight that U.S. officials believe the Russian army cannot successfully wage in the short term.&rdquo; ICYMI: Russia downed one of its prototype UCAVs over Ukraine. Why? In what The War Zone described as 'a bizarre situation,&rdquo; a Russian fighter jet fired a missile at a S-70 Okhotnik-B flying-wing unmanned combat air vehicle on Saturday, downing it miles behind the Ukrainian front line. The UCAV was carrying at least one precision glide bomb, leading to speculation that it was on some sort of operational trials. Purported photos of the downed S-70 are here, and you can read more, here. Iran apparently has China's Silent Hunter anti-drone laser system. The system, which can dazzle or possibly even damage incoming UAVs, made a cameo appearance as part of security measures around a rare public sermon by Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Is &lsquo;Big AI' beating 'small AI'&mdash;and what does that mean for the military? The prevailing 'bigger-is-better' approach to artificial intelligence&mdash;ingest more training data, produce larger models, build bigger data centers&mdash;might be undermining the kind of research and development the U.S. military actually needs now and in the future. That's the argument in 'Hype, Sustainability, and the Price of the Bigger-is-Better Paradigm in AI,' a new paper that scrutinizes common assumptions driving AI research. Defense One's Patrick Tucker unpacks that, here. Diego Garcia negotiations update: No 'foreign armed forces.&rdquo; One week after the British announced plans to relinquish sovereignty over a small chain of islands in the Indian Ocean&mdash;except for one with a 99-year lease&mdash;the UK's top diplomat said Mauritius has agreed to new terms that include 'preventing foreign armed forces from accessing or establishing themselves on the outer islands&rdquo; known collectively as Chagos, British Foreign Secretary David Lammy announced Monday. Chagos includes the island of Diego Garcia, which hosts an obscure yet key outpost for the British and U.S. militaries, as many folks with a naval background are apt to tell you. (That's the island with the nearly century-long exemption from Mauritian sovereignty.) Self-declared 'right of center&rdquo; U.S. naval blogger Cdr. Salamander was particularly aggrieved over the surprise developments when Lammy first announced them last week. An 'epic own-goal&rdquo; is how Salamander described the new direction from the Brits, alleging they seem to get a 'masochist's thrill from damaging themselves and their nation.&rdquo; Some history: The Brits occupied Diego Garcia during the Cold War in a process that ran afoul of the United Nations, forcibly displacing at least 2,000 locals to make room for a naval base. Its location was especially useful later during the U.S.-led Global War on Terror, and British and U.S. officials are keen to not lose that perk&mdash;even though it comes with the baggage of that bygone era of colonialism. Contemporary British officials are trying to thread the needle of shedding some of that baggage while also retaining the strategic benefits of the naval base's geography. That's why the Brits announced last week the islands were indeed Mauritius's sovereign territory, but that the Brits don't plan to depart the base at Diego Garcia until at least another 99 years. The other big fear? Chinese developers would very likely step in where the Brits and U.S. depart. That helps account for the language from Lammy about 'foreign armed forces&rdquo; on Monday. 'From countering malign Iranian activity in the Middle East to ensuring a free and open Indo-Pacific, [Diego Garcia] is critical for our national security,&rdquo; Lammy reminded British lawmakers Monday. 'Without surety of tenure, no base can operate effectively&mdash;nor truly deter our enemies.&rdquo; Perhaps more importantly, at least in the short term, continuing to occupy Diego Garcia without agreeable terms from Mauritius, 'undermined our international standing,&rdquo; Lammy said Monday. With the updated terms, 'We are showing that what we mean is what we say on international law and desire for partnerships with the Global South,&rdquo; which 'strengthens our arguments when it comes to issues like Ukraine or the South China Sea,&rdquo; he said. Next steps: 'After Mauritian elections, the government will move towards treaty signature&rdquo; to formalize the new terms, the foreign secretary said. Afterward, 'it is then our intention to pursue ratification in 2025, by submitting the Treaty and a Bill to [the House of Parliament] for scrutiny,&rdquo; he said In the meantime (emphasis added), 'Mauritius is now free to implement a resettlement programme to islands other than Diego Garcia,&rdquo; which 'has an uncontested long-term future&hellip;under full UK control well into the next century,&rdquo; said Lammy.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-08-2024/400125/	2024-10-08T08:26:40-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/08/DB_lander-1/large.png
Is ‘Big AI’ beating 'small AI'—and what does it mean for the mili...	The prevailing 'bigger-is-better' approach to artificial intelligence&mdash;ingest more training data, produce larger models, build bigger data centers&mdash;might be undermining the kind of research and development the U.S. military actually needs now and in the future. That's the argument in 'Hype, Sustainability, and the Price of the Bigger-is-Better Paradigm in AI,' a new paper that scrutinizes common assumptions driving AI research. Its authors demonstrate that the performance of larger models doesn't necessarily justify the vastly increased resources needed to build and power them. They also argue that concentrating AI efforts in a relative handful of big tech companies adds geopolitical risks. Broadly speaking, the Defense Department is pursuing AI along two tracks: large models that require enormous computational resources, and smaller, on-platform AI that can function disconnected from the internet. In some ways, the study validates the second approach. But, the authors note, future research in 'small AI&rdquo; could be limited due to growing influence of large AI providers. Where does the idea that bigger is better, at least in AI, come from? In their paper, Ga&euml;l Varoquaux of Universit&eacute; Paris-Saclay, Alexandra Sasha Luccioni of the Quebec AI Institute, and Meredith Whittaker of the Signal Foundation trace it to a 2012 paper by University of Toronto professor Alex Krizhevsk, who argued big data and large-scale neural networks offered much better results for image classification than smaller ones. This idea was borne out by other researchers, and has since become a staple of the way large companies are approaching AI. 'The consequence of this is both an explosion in investment in large-scale AI models and a concomitant spike in the size of the notable (highly cited) models. Generative AI, whether for images or text, has taken this assumption to a new level, both within the AI research discipline and as a component of the popular &lsquo;bigger-is-better' narrative surrounding AI,&rdquo; they write. The authors gather evidence to show that benefits of scaling up AI models diminish rapidly compared to the increased computational demands. For instance, the environmental cost&mdash;measured in energy consumption&mdash;rises significantly faster than the improvement in model performance, making large-scale AI not especially efficient. That's lost on a lot of big AI's richest and most well-known boosters like former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, who argued last week that businesses and governments should continue to pursue energy-intensive large AI models regardless of the energy cost because 'we're not going to hit the climate goals anyway.&rdquo; The military can't take such a cavalier approach to the massive energy costs of AI. The Defense Department views climate change as a national security concern but, more immediately, also views energy efficiency as a key military objective for future operations. What's worse, the bigger-is-better conventional wisdom AI research is narrowing and losing diversity, they write.''The bigger-is-better norm is also self-reinforcing, shaping the AI research field by informing what kinds of research is incentivized.&rdquo; That means that researchers will increasingly ignore areas where smaller models could make a big difference, in fields like healthcare and education. Although the authors don't address it in their paper, that narrowing effect has ramifications for the military's own development of AI. Smaller models could also make a big difference in places where computer resources are scarce and connectivity is intermittent, sparse, or even non-existent. That could apply to everything from autonomous drones operating in environments saturated with adversary electromagnetic warfare effects to small bases in forward locations where energy is scarce and connectivity is weak. The rapid evolution of weapons and tactics means that more and more operators close to the edge of combat will have to invent or modify their own gear and weapons. Operators at forward bases might face a lot of situations where they may have good use for an AI model that runs on a relatively small corpus of data and doesn't require a massive server farm or lots of GPUs to work. These might include applications that analyze drone- or satellite-image data for specific types of vehicles , parsing the specific electromagnetic weapons signatures they are encountering, or even just understanding local economic, weather, population or consumer data to plan more effective and safe operations in dense urban settings. But if the AI research field prioritizes expertise in big AI over small, that could mean less scholarship and fewer experts to train operators in how to make their own small AI models well. The growing trend toward big AI has another geopolitical implication, a concentration of power. Only a few companies possess the resources to build and deploy massive models. 'The concentrated private industry power over AI creates a small, and financially incentivized segment of AI decision makers. We should consider how such concentrated power with agency over centralized AI could shape society under more authoritarian conditions,&rdquo; they write. One obvious example of the threat that poses is Elon Musk, one of the world's richest defense contractors and, through SpaceX, a key supplier of space access and satellite communications to the Pentagon. Musk also has close financial ties to Saudi Arabia and has used his large and expensive social media presence to boost posts and content linked to Russian disinformation operations. Musk is also emerging as one of the key financial players in the development of future AI. Whittaker and her fellow authors are among a small but growing number of AI-focused researchers who point out the risks posed by the prevalence of the bigger-is-better school of AI. A separate paper, published in September by a group of researchers at Berkeley also notes 'It is exceedingly common for smaller, more task-focused models to perform better than large, broad-purpose models on specific downstream tasks.&rdquo; A new class of innovative AI practitioners are also highlighting the degree to which the conversation around big AI is drowning out approaches that could be more useful for specific groups. Pete Warden, CEO of AI startup Useful Sensors, is one of them. Warden's work focuses on embedding intelligence into devices or computers. He says that the industry and academic obsession with larger AI is missing what most people actually want from the AI they interact with. 'Academic benchmarks have diverged from real-world requirements,&rdquo; Warden said. 'For example a lot of customers just want to be able to retrieve results from existing information (like user manuals) rather than generating new text in response to questions, but that isn't seen as interesting by researchers.&rdquo; Retrieval-Augmented Generation, he said, is an academic hobby horse. But customer applications don't need that level of complexity,&rdquo; he told Defense One. 'For a lot of realistic problems, like drone tracking for example, the underlying models are now good enough and the real challenge is integrating them into larger systems. We don't need any more computer vision breakthroughs or new model architectures. We just need better data that reflects the actual problems in deployment and a way to fit the models onto hardware.&rdquo; Drew Breunig ran data science and strategic client projects at PlaceIQ, which is now part of Precisely. In September he wrote a post on how many peoples' high expectations of generative AI, the quintessential example of large AI models, are unlikely to be met. When those realizations settle in, that could lead to a broader discussion about different potential paths for AI development. Breunig told Defense One: 'The capability of our existing models greatly outpace the [user interface] and frameworks we've built to deliver their intelligence for nearly all the real world problems they solve.&rdquo; He breaks AI into three groups. 'Gods,&rdquo; which he defines as 'Superintelligence AGI stuff. Replacement for humans doing lots of different things, unsupervised.&rdquo; Beneath them are 'interns&rdquo; which he describes as 'Copilots. Domain-specific applications that help experts with busy and tedious work, doing things an intern might. Interns are supervised by experts, so your tolerance for hallucinations is high. The programmer, writer, or whomever spots the mistakes when they occur and moves on.&rdquo; Finally, the most local form of AI is 'Cogs,&rdquo; defined as 'Models that have been tuned to do one job, with very low tolerance for errors, working unsupervised within applications or pipelines. This is by far the dominant use case I am seeing in the enterprise. All the big platforms (AWS, Azure, Databricks, etc) have pivoted to helping companies load their proprietary data to tune open models to do one little thing well.&rdquo; Even though generative AI pilots get a lot more attention the military is exploring all three of them through programs that provide decision assistance for target identification, i.e. Project Maven, and other decision assistance efforts,&rdquo; and 'cog&rdquo; efforts such as visual recognition of instrument indicators in helicopter cockpits. Because such needs will only grow, it's important for the military that the future of AI research be broad enough to continue to support all three areas. 'Pete and I see eye to eye on this,&rdquo; said Breunig. 'When Pete says the academics' research cases are out of step with the practical reality of actually building with AI, it's because a lot of their focus is on attaining gods not the boring job of building cogs.The cool thing about focusing on cogs is you can do so much with little models! A tiny model tuned for one thing can outperform a giant general model at the same task. And it's faster, cheaper, etc.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/big-ai-prevailing-over-small-ai-and-what-does-mean-military/400111/	2024-10-07T18:26:16-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/GettyImages_2087343447/large.jpg
Navy places two new submarine contract modifications	Oct. 4 brought a pair of nine-figure modifications to Naval Sea Systems Command contracts with General Dynamics Electric Boat. The first was a $377 million cost-plus-fixed-fee modification to a previously awarded contract for lead yard support and development studies and design efforts related to Virginia-class submarines. Work is expected to be completed by October 2025. The second was a not-to-exceed $244 million cost-plus-fixed-fee undefinitized order against a previously issued basic ordering agreement to provide unique parts and specialized material, including initial spares, for Virginia-class submarines. Work is expected to be completed by September 2028. [[Related Posts]] A Navy study of the country's submarine-construction infrastructure concluded that tentative plans to produce two Virginia-class SSNs and one Columbia-class SSBN per year for 12 years are viable, given sufficient funding. By the end of that run, the newest of the Improved Los Angeles-class SSN 688s will be 40 years old and overdue for replacement, adding pressure to meet at least the two-SSN's-per-year goal. The Virginia-class Block V construction has seen delays, which the Government Accountability Office has ascribed to supply-chain problems, workforce shortages, and limited shipyard capacity that have made it difficult for the Navy to produce two submarines a year. Throw into the mix the AUKUS plan for the U.S. to sell three Virginia-class submarines for operational deployment in the early 2030s, which comes with an option to buy two more, for a total of five. The U.S. will be hard-pressed to meet its own force requirements. While such a sale will have to have the approval of the U.S. Congress, Australia's fielding of Virginia-class submarines as soon as possible would provide a stopgap until Australia begins fielding its own SSN-AUKUS submarines, which are planned to be operational in the early 2040s. The latest plan floating around is for the U.S. to transfer two of its current Virginia-class submarines (probably Block III or IV) to Australia, with the third to come off the current production line. Although not set in stone, this is likely the best solution to fill the gap between the retirement of Australia's Collins-class diesel-electric submarines and the planned SSN-AUKUS submarines. Some have suggested that the Navy will begin to order three SSNs per year after the final Columbia is delivered.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/navy-places-two-new-submarine-contract-modifications/400113/	2024-10-07T18:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/FacebookXCopy_LinkEm_2500/large.jpg
The Middle East is in a new era of mass displacement	A year of conflict has ushered in a new era of mass displacement in the Middle East. Since Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, and the subsequent sustained Israeli bombardment of Gaza, Israel has expanded its operations on multiple fronts to include the West Bank, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon. With fighting continuing unabated and the prospects for a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel rising, the region is now in a new period of internal and cross-border displacement that has already uprooted millions. As scholars of migration, we fear that the results of such displacement will affect the region for years to come &ndash; and is likely to further hamper the ability of the region's people to live safe and secure lives. Israel's ongoing attacks have forced nearly 2 million Palestinians to flee their homes in Gaza over the past year, amounting to 9 in 10 inhabitants of the densely populated strip. What is unique about the scale of the displacement in Gaza is that nearly all internally displaced persons remain trapped, unable to leave the territory amid Israel's ongoing border closure and bombardment. This has intensified cascading humanitarian crises, including famine and the spread of disease, along with countless other hardships that make normal life nearly impossible. For many Palestinians in Gaza, the yearlong bombardment has meant repeated displacement as Israeli attacks shift from area to area, amid shrinking humanitarian spaces. And although there are complex historical and geopolitical reasons regarding the border closures, international law experts argue that Egypt and Israel have violated international refugee law by refusing to allow Palestinians in Gaza to cross the Rafah border to seek asylum. The situation in Gaza is structurally different from previous displacement crises in the region &ndash; even in civil war-torn Syria, where cross-border aid operations have constantly been on the brink of collapse. That's because Israel continues to limit and block aid into the territory, and humanitarian workers struggle to provide the bare minimum of food, shelter and medical care during bombing campaigns that have rarely stopped. To make matters worse, the experience of the past year has shown that refugee camps, civilian apartment buildings, U.N. schools, and hospitals serving civilians and refugees are not safe spaces. Israel frequently justifies its attacks on such locations by saying they are used by Hamas or Hezbollah, despite formal U.N. disputes of many of these accusations. At least 220 U.N. workers have also been killed in these targeted Israeli attacks in the past year &ndash; more than any other crisis ever recorded. This contributes to humanitarian workers struggling to access populations in need, especially displaced individuals. For its part, the United States continues to be the top donor to the the U.N. refugee agency (UNHCR) and the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), as well as the top supplier of weapons to Israel. In Lebanon, massive displacement has also resulted from Israel's developing war with Hezbollah. Even before the September escalation of conflict across the Lebanon-Israel border, nearly 100,000 Lebanese had been displaced from their homes in the country's south due to Israeli shelling. Meanwhile, approximately 63,000 Israelis were internally displaced from the country's north due to Hezbollah's rocket attacks. But starting in late September 2024, Israeli strikes on Hezbollah and Palestinian targets in Beirut and across Lebanon killed hundreds of civilians and exponentially increased internal and cross-border displacement. More than 1 million Lebanese have now fled their homes in a matter of days amid Israel's invasion and bombardment. In addition, Syrian refugees and the large migrant worker population in Lebanon were also displaced, with many sleeping on the streets or in makeshift tents, unable to access buildings that were converted into shelters for Lebanese. In a separate stark example of reverse migration, about 230,000 people &ndash; both Lebanese and Syrians &ndash; have fled across the border into Syria. Bringing the recent regional conflicts full circle with post-2011 Arab uprising displacement and crisis, returning home is an unsafe option for many Syrians who still fear repression under the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Israel's ongoing invasion of Lebanon is likely to only amplify these trends, as the country ordered numerous villages and towns in the country's south &ndash; miles above the U.N.-recognized buffer zone &ndash; to evacuate. Over several decades, the Middle East has experienced many large-scale, cross-border displacements for myriad reasons. The original forced displacement of Palestinians surrounding the creation of Israel in 1948 and subsequent conflicts created the world's longest-standing refugee situation, with approximately 6 million Palestinians living across the Levant. The first Gulf War, sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s and the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq produced millions of refugees, with long-standing political repercussions for the region. More recently, the 2011 Arab uprisings and the wars that followed in Syria, Yemen and Libya created millions of refugees, as well as internally displaced peoples, with nearly 6 million Syrians still living in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan and another 6 million displaced inside Syria. Because Syrians have largely not returned home, international organizations have become a semipermanent safety net to provide basic services to refugees and host communities. New layers of displacement in Lebanon &ndash; nationals, refugees and migrant workers &ndash; as well as cross-border movement into Syria will put further strain on the underfunded system of humanitarian assistance. Further, the current Israel-Hezbollah war in Lebanon is not the first time conflict between the state and its neighbor to the north has preceded large-scale displacement. In an attempt to eliminate the Palestinian Liberation Organization, Israel invaded Lebanon in 1978 and again in 1982. Israel's 1982 invasion led to the Sabra and Shatila massacres of between 1,500-3,000 Palestinian civilians &ndash; carried out by Israel's Lebanese Christian allies &ndash; showing that military operations that do not distinguish between militants and civilians can lead to devastating impacts for displaced populations. Between 600,000 and 900,000 Lebanese fled abroad during the entire course of the country's civil war from 1975 to 1990. Two decades later, Israel again invaded Lebanon in 2006 in an attempt to stamp out Hezbollah, leading approximately 900,000 Lebanese to flee the south &ndash; both internally and across the border into Syria. While the speed and volume of Lebanese displacement in 2006 was unprecedented at the time, the number of people forced to flee in late September and early October 2024 has quickly surpassed that record. So, the region is well versed with the consequences of mass displacement. But what is clear a year into the current conflict is that the Middle East is now in a new era of displacement &ndash; in terms of scale and kind. And the number of families' lives disrupted by this new era of displacement looks set only to increase. Tensions in the region have escalated further with fresh missile attacks against Israel from Iran and threats of retaliation by Israel. The experience of decades of conflict in the region is that civilians are most likely to bear the brunt of fighting &ndash; whether through forced displacement, an inability to access food or medical care, or death. Only by way of a cessation of current hostilities and a lasting cease-fire across the region can the conditions be set for at-risk populations to begin to return and rebuild. This is particularly true for those displaced in Gaza who have been repeatedly forced from their homes, but have no borders over which they can cross to safety, and for whom a political solution remains elusive.

The D Brief: Another hurricane looms; Grim anniversary in Israel;...	From Helene to Milton: The death toll from late September's Hurricane Helene has risen to at least 230 people as recovery efforts continue in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, and the Carolinas, the Associated Press reported Monday. More than 250,000 are still without power across the south, with the majority (136,180) in North Carolina alone, according to Poweroutage.us. New this weekend: 'The entire length of the Blue Ridge Parkway in North Carolina and Virginia is closed&rdquo; &mdash; that's 469 miles of road &mdash; 'as crews continue their assessment of the damage from Hurricane Helene,&rdquo; the National Park Service said Saturday after erosion washed out significant portions of the scenic highway. 'Based on what the teams have seen so far, significant, and in some cases catastrophic, damage has occurred along the parkway, particularly from milepost 280 to milepost 469,&rdquo; officials said. Panning out: Nearly 7,000 federal workers are helping, including more than 1,200 Urban Search and Rescue personnel who have helped rescue or support more than 3,200 people in North Carolina so far, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Sunday. Additional FEMA workers have shipped out meals, water, generators and tarps to those in need. The Army Corps of Engineers is on duty conducting assessments around North Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. Their tasks span water/wastewater checks, bridge and road inspections, debris removal, and more. Almost 1,000 active duty soldiers from Fort Campbell and Fort Liberty are also helping out around western North Carolina in the vicinity of the hard-hit mountain town of Asheville, where flooding swept away key stretches of road, leaving many folks stranded. An additional 500 active duty soldiers will join the recovery efforts soon, Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement Sunday. The thousand or so active troops come from the 82nd Airborne, the 101st Airborne, the 20th Engineer Brigade, the 18th Airborne Corps, and others, according to officials at Northern Command, which helps coordinate efforts across the U.S. mainland, with FEMA leading overall efforts. Worth noting: 'The National Guard has activated more than 6,100 Guardsmen, hundreds of high-water vehicles, and dozens of helicopters and rescue boats from 18 different states in State-Active-Duty status,&rdquo; Ryder said Sunday. Status report: The Georgia National Guard has their hands busy passing out supplies. The Tennessee National Guard is clearing debris. The North Carolina National Guard is doing a bit of it all. And the Florida National Guard is preparing for another major storm, which could make landfall Wednesday, Hurricane Milton. What might lie ahead with Milton: 'A possible 8- to 12-foot storm surge (2.4 to 3.6 meters) in Tampa Bay and said flash and river flooding could result from 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 centimeters) of rain in mainland Florida and the Keys,&rdquo; AP reports, citing forecasters. Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis expanded his state of emergency declaration on Sunday to 51 counties across the state in anticipation of Milton. He also cautioned that more power outages were likely, and recommended residents keep at least a week's worth of food and water available&mdash;and be ready to drive elsewhere to safety.

According to AP: 'Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.&rdquo; Of particular note: Donald Trump 'has lied about the federal hurricane response with staggering frequency and variety,&rdquo; CNN's Daniel Dale reported in a fact check published Sunday. Also not helping: Georgia conspiracy theorist Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who wrote on social media Thursday that unspecified humans 'control the weather.&rdquo; Related reading: 'FEMA's Criswell dismisses 'ridiculous' Helene recovery falsehoods,&rdquo; ABC News reported Sunday after an interview with Criswell; 'Helene recovery is more political online than on the ground,&rdquo; NPR reported Monday; 'Hurricane Milton Intensifies Into A Category 4; Prompts Hurricane And Storm Surge Watches In Florida,&rdquo; the Weather Channel reported Monday morning.

It's been one year since Hamas launched its brutal surprise attack on Israel, killing more than 1,100 people. The Oct. 7, 2023, attack 'brought to the surface painful memories left by millennia of hatred and violence against the Jewish people,&rdquo; President Biden said in a statement Monday. 'One year later, Vice President Harris and I remain fully committed to the safety of the Jewish people, the security of Israel, and its right to exist,&rdquo; he said, and stressed, 'We support Israel's right to defend itself against attacks from Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and Iran.&rdquo; 'What Hamas did that day was pure evil &ndash; it was brutal and sickening,&rdquo; said Vice President Kamala Harris in her own statement Monday. 'We will not forget, and we will not lose faith,&rdquo; she said. 'And in honor of all those souls we lost on October 7, we must never lose sight of the dream of peace, dignity, and security for all.&rdquo; Timeline and outlook: Axios looks back at what happened on Oct. 7, 2023, what's going on now, and where it might all lead. Read that, here. Latest: 'At least seven people were injured late Sunday in what Israel said was a Hezbollah rocket attack on the northern Israeli cities of Haifa and Tiberias,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported, adding that on Monday afternoon, Israel bombarded areas around Lebanon's southern city of Tyre. Additional reading: 'Mossad's pager operation: Inside Israel's penetration of Hezbollah,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Saturday. Inside the Marine Corps' first-ever littoral regiment. Much of what the 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment trains for is basic infantry operations&mdash;with a modern and Pacific twist, its leaders told Defense One's Jen Hlad during a recent exercise. 'When we go on the next deployment, we're going to be pretty disaggregated, seizing key maritime terrain, providing the sensing capability and things like that,&rdquo; said Staff Sgt. Dylan Greene of Banjo Company. And unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq, 'The most challenging thing is going to be [that] we do not have air dominance.

A destroyer's first deployment took an unexpected turn. The USS Daniel Inouye's maiden deployment was supposed to be seven months long, mostly working with regional partners such as Japan and Korea as part of the Theodore Roosevelt strike group. But as tensions in the Red Sea heated up, the group's deployment was extended, and the brand-new destroyer received a fresh tasking: deter aggression and protect 'the free flow of commerce&rdquo; in the waters of the Middle East. Hlad talked with the destroyer's leadership as it returned to its home port of Pearl Harbor. Read that, here. And lastly: For several months, Chinese government hackers penetrated major U.S. broadband providers, 'potentially accessing information from systems the federal government uses for court-authorized network wiretapping requests,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Saturday. Targets included Verizon Communications, AT&T and Lumen Technologies, among others, officials said, describing it as 'a potentially catastrophic security breach,&rdquo; according to the Journal. 'Hackers apparently exfiltrated some data from Verizon networks by reconfiguring Cisco routers,&rdquo; the Washington Post reports (gift link). 'The fact that they were able to make changes in the routers without detection reflects the sophistication of the adversary but also raises questions about Verizon's security posture, analysts said.&rdquo; Read more at BleepingComputer, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-07-2024/400087/	2024-10-07T08:15:48-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/07/DB_lander/large.png
Inside the Marine Corps’ first-ever littoral regiment	MARINE CORPS BASE HAWAII&mdash;'Hold right, clear left.&rdquo; Four Marines in helmets and flak jackets are stacked outside a rusty metal building covered in faux brick and wood. The first enters the doorway with his rifle at the ready, followed by the other three, while 2nd Lt. Alex Willbanks observes inside. Other than the color of the camouflage, the scene is virtually indistinguishable from Marine pre-deployment training at the height of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. But instead of a traditional infantry unit preparing for a counterinsurgency fight in the desert, these Marines are part of the Corps' first-ever littoral regiment, getting ready for a potential future war in the Pacific. Back in 2008, Willbanks was one of the young enlisted Marines just learning how to clear a room before he deployed to Afghanistan with 1st Battalion, 3rd Marine Regiment. Now he's back as an officer in the two-year-old 3rd Marine Littoral Regiment, passing on his hard-earned knowledge to new Marines. 'The MLR is still rooted in infantry tasks, but has a new flavor to it,&rdquo; Willbanks said after a morning of training at the base's Military Operations on Urban Terrain, or MOUT, facility here. 'It still does the same things that every other unit would do, but now we're looking at the Indo-Pacific region and deploying up there, as opposed to what we did in' the Global War on Terror.&rdquo; The 3rd Marine Regiment became the 3rd MLR on March 4, 2022, in a ceremony that created the first of three such units prescribed by the service's Force Design 2030 transformation effort. A second MLR is now being formed in Okinawa, with a third planned for Guam. Unlike the Corps' traditional infantry regiments, which are composed of a headquarters company and four infantry battalions, the 3rd MLR has a headquarters element and three subordinate commands: 3rd Littoral Anti-Air Battalion, Combat Logistics Battalion 3, and Littoral Combat Team 3. The Force Design concept, including the design of the MLRs, faced criticism from a cadre of retired general officers early on, who said the changes would weaken the Marine Corps and take focus away from the infantry. Willbanks said he understands some of the criticisms, but noted that 'Marines are still doing the same things that they did before, even looking at peacetime, going into Desert Storm and everything. Like, everyone at some point was training to do a certain thing, and then we pivoted immediately to direct ourselves at what the new threat was&hellip;I think everyone's going to have their own preference of what they think the Marine Corps should be doing. But I think at this time, from my understanding, we're doing what is needed.&rdquo; Across base, on a grass sports field across the street from a rocky beach, Staff Sgt. Dylan Greene and the rest of Banjo Company&mdash;part of the Littoral Combat Team&mdash;are rehearsing for fire team attack training. 'The basic skills have not changed at all,&rdquo; Greene said. As the unit moves closer to its planned deployment next summer, the Banjo Company Marines will begin integrating with the scout platoon, signals intelligence, electronic warfare, and small drone operators. 'When we go on the next deployment, we're going to be pretty disaggregated, seizing key maritime terrain, providing the sensing capability and things like that,&rdquo; he said. And unlike in Afghanistan and Iraq, 'The most challenging thing is going to be [that] we do not have air dominance. I would argue we don't even probably have air superiority, just because of near-peer, and also just going to be like signature management.&rdquo; Greene said there have been a lot of discussions about how to manage not just electromagnetic and radio signatures, but other types of signatures as well., He pointed out the unit's new camouflage netting, which is smoother than the previous version and provides a 'nice thermal screen&rdquo; for people standing underneath if a drone flies by. Up a steep hill from the sports field, on a training range inside a crater, 1st Lt. Seth Benscoter and Chaos Company's 2nd Platoon are practicing basic infantry skills. 'Buddy fire and movement, being able to shoot at the target&mdash;the guy in front shoot at the target, and the guy behind him sort of see what's going on, assess how the rounds are making it downrange, and then when he's ready, he moves, so on and so forth until they are able to get close,&rdquo; Benscoter said. The skills are the same that any infantry unit might practice&mdash;MLR Marines refer to traditional infantry regiments as 'legacy units&rdquo;&mdash;but as the deployment training cycle continues, 'it'll get more complicated,&rdquo; he said. Asked about how the unit is adapting to the shift in focus from land battles to working with the Navy for amphibious operations, Benscoter said he thinks that's something the entire Marine Corps is working through. 'We haven't done that, aside from [Marine Expeditionary Units] in a very, very long time, and actually affected an amphibious assault at a larger scale,&rdquo; he said. 'I think it's not, it's not really just the LCT and the MLR that's working through that, but it's kind of the entire Corps' priorities.&rdquo; Back at the MOUT facility, Willbanks is underscoring the importance of fundamentals. 'I can't tell you the answer to everything&hellip;you have to be postured and ready to pivot at a moment's notice,&rdquo; he said. 'There are some standardized ways and practices to do these things, but at the end of the day, you have to rely on your instincts.&rdquo; A contractor who served 14 years as a Marine helicopter pilot overhears the conversation and jumps in: 'Just because you can see some guys in an open desert from eight miles away doesn't mean you're going to find anything in a triple-canopy jungle in the middle of the Philippines, right? Like, it doesn't translate sometimes, and you need to be ready to solve that problem.&rdquo; The contractor, Brent Kreckman, said the MLR Marines are 'building those little building blocks, like how to break down the door and clear the room, that they can then go, &lsquo;Well, how am I going to apply this there? And how do I avoid the small drone problems? How do I avoid booby trap problems?' And they get to solve a new problem set&rdquo; without the bias that some of the older Marines have. That ability to take initiative is trained into them, Benscoter said. 'The NCOs in the infantry, and even the more junior guys, they're trained to critically think and to not just follow orders, but to seize initiative,&rdquo; he said. 'I think the best part of the Marine Corps is that no matter what the mission is, no matter what the time period, the technology, whatever, our whole goal is to be ready when we're called on. And I don't think that culture's going anywhere.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/inside-marine-corps-first-ever-littoral-regiment/400084/	2024-10-06T13:17:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/06/mlr_8679447/large.jpg
A destroyer’s first deployment took an unexpected turn	PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii&mdash;The USS Daniel Inouye's maiden deployment was supposed to be seven months long, and include mostly 'encouraging stability&rdquo; by working with regional partners like Japan and Korea as part of the Theodore Roosevelt strike group. But as tensions in the Red Sea heated up, the group's deployment was extended, and the brand-new destroyer received a fresh tasking: deter aggression and protect 'the free flow of commerce&rdquo; in the waters of the Middle East. While there, the crew heard an emergency call. 'A distressed mariner is a distressed mariner,&rdquo; Cmdr. Kevin Dore, the commander of the Inouye, said Friday after his ship and crew tied up at their homeport here. 'If an emergency like that happens, it is &lsquo;Get there as fast as you can and do everything you can' to save what, in this case, was two distressed mariners who happened to be Iranian.&rdquo; The crew sent search-and-rescue swimmers out in a small boat, rescued the mariners, and gave them medical assistance. 'That was really one of those moments where we see the team fully come together, because we knew there were lives at stake, and the crew gets that. It's incredible to watch that happen and really to be able to take action and to make a difference,&rdquo; Dore said. Cmdr. Ryan Kelly, the ship's executive officer, said the crew quickly drew on their training. 'Everyone was cool under pressure, and they executed the mission just like we asked, every single time. And that was just another perfect example of being ready for anything,&rdquo; Kelly said. The Inouye returned home Friday to a crowd of cheering families holding signs, leis, and in one case, a Starbucks iced coffee with a curly straw. 'I've been a part of a lot of great crews before, but this team on board Daniel Inouye is one of the most special and unique groups of people that I've ever been a part of,&rdquo; Kelly said. 'Every challenge, every piece of adversity that we felt through an entire nine-month deployment, they just delivered every single time.&rdquo; The homecoming is a key milestone for the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, which was commissioned in 2021 and named for Sen. Daniel Inouye, who represented Hawaii in Congress from 1959, when it became a state, until his death in 2012. Inouye earned the Medal of Honor for his service in the Army's 442nd Regimental Combat Team during World War II. The destroyer served as the air and missile defense commander for the Roosevelt strike group during the deployment, and Dore said the ship's helicopter detachment did 'a massive amount of flight ops,&rdquo; the vast majority of which were at night. 'We asked a lot of them, and they delivered,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/destroyers-first-deployment-took-unexpected-turn/400083/	2024-10-06T08:19:55-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/06/The_Arleigh_Burke_cl_2500/large.jpg
Iran’s Oct. 1 strike on Israel had several meanings.	Israel and Iran are at war. In truth, the two sides have been fighting for decades, but the conflict has played out largely under the cover of covert and clandestine operations. The recent actions of both sides in this once 'shadow war&rdquo; have changed the nature of the conflict. It is not clear that de-escalation is on the horizon. On Oct 1, 2024, Iran launched a massive, direct attack against Israel notionally in retribution for Israel's dual assassinations of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah's chief, Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. It was the second such barrage in six months. By many accounts, the previous Iranian attack against Israel on April 13 &ndash; which consisted of over 300 ballistic and cruise missiles and attack drones &ndash; caused very little damage to Israel. Perhaps because of this, and likely in part due to U.S. encouragement of restraint, Israel's immediate military response then &ndash; an airstrike against a single advanced Iranian air defense system in the Isfahan province &ndash; was somewhat measured. Many onlookers saw the calibrated exchange in April as a possible indication that both sides would prefer to de-escalate rather than engage in ongoing open warfare. But further Israeli military operations since then have prompted escalatory Iranian military responses, forcing the conflict back out of the shadows. With Hamas' capabilities and leadership degraded in the Gaza Strip, Israel's military leaders announced in June that they were 'ready to face&rdquo; Hezbollah &ndash; the Iranian-backed Lebanese militant group whose persistent rocket attacks against northern Israel have caused tens of thousands to evacuate the area. Israel's pivot from Gaza toward Lebanon coincided with the July 31, 2024, assassination of Hamas' political bureau chairman, Haniyeh, during his stay in Tehran. The purported Israeli operation was seen as an affront to Iran's sovereignty. It was also an embarrassment that highlighted the vulnerability and permeability of Iran's internal security apparatus. Even though Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei vowed a 'harsh response&rdquo; against Israel, by September Iran had taken no action. Tehran's inaction caused many Middle East analysts to question if the Iranian response would ever materialize &ndash; and by extension, what that would mean for Khamenei's commitment to his proxy forces. If indeed Iran's leadership opted for restraint following the assassination of Hamas' top political leader, the same could not be said for its reaction to Israel's multiphase operation against Hezbollah in mid-September. Israel began with a clandestine operation to sow chaos and confusion in Hezbollah's command and control through the means of sabotaged explosive communications devices. Israel then carried out airstrikes eliminating Hezbollah's top leaders including Nasrallah. The Israeli military then launched what the country's leaders describe as a 'limited [ground] operation&rdquo; into southern Lebanon to remove Hezbollah positions along the northern border. Tehran's Oct 1. attack in response against Israel was, according to many Middle East experts and indeed Iranian military leaders, primarily a retaliation for the two high-profile assassinations against Hamas and Hezbollah leaders. These were certainly key factors. But as an expert on Iran's defense strategy, I argue that Iran's leaders also felt compelled to attack Israel for three equally, if not more important, reasons: to slow Israel's advance in Lebanon, to save face, and to restore deterrence. Iran hopes to slow and potentially reverse Israel's successes against Hezbollah, especially as Israel embarks on ground operations into southern Lebanon. Of course, Israeli ground troops must now deal with what is perhaps the world's most capable guerrilla fighting force &ndash; one that performed quite successfullyduring the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Nevertheless, Israel's ability to achieve a tactical surprise and eliminate Hezbollah's top leaders &ndash; even in the midst of an ongoing localized war, and even after Israel's leaders announced their intention to engage Hezbollah &ndash; reveals a far superior Israeli strategy and operational planning and execution capability than that of Hezbollah. And that presents a huge blow to what is seen in Iran as the Islamic Republic's crown jewel within its 'Axis of Resistance.&rdquo; In this respect, the Oct. 1 retaliatory strike by Iran can be seen as an attempt to afford Hezbollah time to appoint replacement leadership, regroup and organize against Israel's ground invasion. It also serves to help Iran save face, especially in how it's seen by other parts of its external proxy network. Orchestrated by the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, or IRGC &ndash; Tehran's primary arm for coordinating external operations &ndash; Iranian money, training, guidance and ideological support enabled and encouraged the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack against Israel &ndash; even, as it has claimed, Iran had no prior warning of the assault. Since then, Hamas fighters have received almost no real-time support from Tehran. This lack of support has no doubt contributed to Hamas being successfully degraded as a threat by Israel, with many of its members either dead or in hiding and unable to mount a coherent offensive campaign, leading Israel's military leaders to claim the group has been effectively defeated. Unsurprisingly, Iran is glad to enable Palestinians to fight Tehran's enemies and absorb the human costs of war, because this arrangement primarily benefits the Islamic Republic. Once the fighting in Gaza started, the IRGC was nowhere to be found. Now that Israel has shifted its attention to Lebanon and scored several initial tactical successes against Hezbollah, Iran cannot afford to stand back and watch for two main reasons. First, a year of fighting in Gaza has demonstrated that Israel is willing to do whatever it takes to eliminate threats along its borders &ndash; including a willingness to withstand international political pressure or operate within Iran's borders. And second, Iran's proxy groups elsewhere are watching to see if Tehran will continue supporting them &ndash; or will abandon them, as it seemingly has done with Hamas. Perhaps above all, in Tehran's calculus over how to respond is Iran's need to restore a deterrence. The two defining features of Iran's interrelated external, or 'forward defense,&rdquo; and deterrence strategies is its regional network of militant proxies and its long-range weapons arsenal, which includes a large number of advanced ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and attack-capable drones. These Iranian defense strategies seek to dissuade enemies from attacking Iran proper in two ways: first, by threatening Israel and other regional U.S. allies with punishment via proxy militia or long-range weapon attacks; and second, by offering scapegoat targets against which Iran's enemies can express their rage. In effect, Iran's proxy forces act as proxy targets that pay the costs for Iran's hostile policies. Israel's degradation of Hamas and ongoing operations against Hezbollah threaten to undermine Iran's ability to deter attacks against the homeland. For the Islamic Republic's leaders, this is an unacceptable risk. These interweaving imperatives likely prompted Iran's leaders to launch a second massive, direct missile attack on Oct. 1 against Israel. How effective the strike will be in achieving any of Tehran's aims is unknown. The Islamic Republic claimed that as many as 90% of the ballistic missiles reached their intended targets, while Israel and the United States characterize the attack as having been 'defeated and ineffective,&rdquo; despite unverified cellphone videos showing several ballistic missiles detonating after reaching land in Israel. What is almost certain, however, is that this will not be the last move in the conflict. Israel is unlikely to halt its Lebanon operation until it achieves its border security objectives. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed retaliation against Iran for its latest retaliatory attack. IRGC leaders met this warning with a counterthreat of their own that if Israel responds to the Oct. 1 attack militarily, Iran will again respond with unspecified 'crushing and destructive attacks.&rdquo; Rhetorically, neither side is backing down; militarily this may be true, too. The nature and scope of Israel's next move will dictate how the war with Iran develops &ndash; but make no mistake, it is a war.

The D Brief: Helene recovery; 100 new spy sats; Post-strike asses...	Hurricane Helene's death toll across the southern U.S. has now risen to 215, making it the deadliest storm to hit the mainland since Hurricane Katrina almost 20 years ago. (Hurricane Maria remains the deadliest, with nearly 3,000 who perished in Puerto Rico alone.) Just over a week after landfall, more than 740,000 people across five states are still without power. That includes 500,000 in the Carolinas and 200,000 in Georgia, according to PowerOutage.Us. For the U.S. military, 'More than 6,700 National Guardsmen from 16 states have been spearheading recovery efforts across the Southeast region in support of their governors, providing critical aid to those impacted by this storm's devastation,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Thursday. That includes service members who lost their homes but are still reporting for duty, according to Col. Paul Hollenack of the North Carolina National Guard. (Task & Purpose has more on that.) One thousand active duty troops from Army base Fort Liberty have also been tasked to assist with recovery efforts, Singh said. They'll be working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Volunteer pilots are bringing out their Cessnas to assist as well, with more than 350 flights ferrying supplies throughout the region via North Carolina's Concord-Padgett Regional Airport as of Thursday. 'Another 215 supply flights using helicopters have taken off from Hickory Regional Airport, which is about 60 miles northwest of Concord,&rdquo; NBC News reports.

On this day in 1957, the Soviets became the first to put a satellite into orbit with the successful launch of Sputnik 1, triggering what science historians refer to as the 'space race.&rdquo; Changing times in the spy satellite business: Until recent decades, the National Reconnaissance Office wouldn't acknowledge even one satellite it had in space. Now, the intelligence agency is speaking publicly about launching dozens in the past year and a half, Defense One's Audrey Decker reports. 'From last June to December of this year, we'll have probably launched 100 satellites,&rdquo; Christopher Scolese, director of the NRO, said at an event Thursday in Washington. The agency's first batch of operational satellites in this constellation launched in May, and the agency has since launched two more batches, Decker writes. But officials haven't disclosed the number of satellites in those first launches or how many the constellation will have in total. 'What are they going to be doing? They are part of the proliferated architecture to go off it and get us reasonably high-resolution imagery of the Earth at a high rate of speed,&rdquo; Scolese said. Continue reading, here. New: Despite an abnormality during launch, ULA sent its heavy-lift rocket into space Friday, declaring the second certification flight 'successful&rdquo; even though some material broke off one of its solid rocket boosters. Footage of the flight illustrated the anomaly, which could have changed the trajectory of the vehicle. Company CEO Tory Bruno said they did have 'an observation on SRB number one&rdquo; and will look into the abnormality. Background: ULA's much-anticipated rocket flew for the first time in January, but had to complete a second certification flight before it can start flying missions for the Space Force. The company is on a tight timeline to get Vulcan certified because it has to launch two Space Force missions, USSF-106 and USSF-87, by the end of the year. The problem with the booster could complicate Pentagon certification, depending on the investigation. Official reax: 'We are already starting to review the performance data from this launch, and we look forward to Vulcan meeting the certification requirements for a range of National Security Space missions,&rdquo; Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, Space System Command's Program Executive Officer for Assured Access to Space, and Commander of Space Launch Delta 45, said in a statement.

Iranian missile attack, post-strike assessment. While Israeli troops continue attacking alleged militants in southern Lebanon, satellite imagery released Thursday seems to suggest a key Israeli air base was particularly bombarded with Iranian ballistic missiles during Tehran's multi-wave barrage at about 7 p.m. local time Tuesday. AP on Thursday published imagery taken by the commercial firm Planet Labs over Israel the day prior&mdash;roughly 24 hours after the Iranian attack. At least three military and intelligence bases appear to have been hit, according to a Washington Post analysis of satellite imagery published Friday. That includes the southern Nevatim air base; Tel Nof base, in central Israel; and Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters, near Tel Aviv. Expert reax: 'Our first count is that 32 missiles struck Nevatim air base,&rdquo; which hosts Israeli F-35 jets, Jeffrey Lewis of the Middlebury Institute for Strategic Studies wrote on social media Thursday, illustrating those 32 apparent strikes with yellow pins. 'This should be no surprise,&rdquo; he said, noting, 'there is plenty of video showing the missiles raining down on Nevatim.&rdquo; 'They landed multiple hits in the area of F-35 hangers, with one possible direct hit, but not a lot of damage,&rdquo; said researcher Decker Eveleth. Why the apparent success rate? Hard to know for sure, Lewis notes. But he suggests a few possibilities, including Iran using 'Better missiles (more Fattah-1s instead of Emad).&rdquo; He also points to certain apparently 'exaggerated expectations for [U.S.-made] SM-3 and [Israeli] Arrow-2/3&rdquo; interceptors. 'They're good, but c'mon,&rdquo; Lewis writes. 'I don't think we've seen the maximum scale of [Iranian] attack by any means,&rdquo; another expert, Malcolm Davis of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Reuters this week. That's partly due to Iran's maneuverable warheads, as Lewis explained in a bit more detail, here. Also visible in satellite imagery: Apparent Iranian launch points, including from a missile base south of Shiraz, as Decker and researcher Sam Lair pointed out with supporting imagery. Big picture consideration: After recent success against Hezbollah, Israel's military appears to be caught in a 'long game&rdquo; with no clear outcome, the New York Times reported Thursday from Jerusalem, citing the opinion of retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Assaf Orion, now with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. For example, with history as a guide, 'After Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982, it took [Israel] 18 years to withdraw forces from the Lebanese side of the border,&rdquo; Isabel Kershner of the Times writes. But considering the even longer history of internecine warfare around Palestine, it's anyone's guess how long the present conflict will endure. 'We are still in the middle of the movie,&rdquo; Orion said. More, here.

You can’t hide': Spy agency will have 100 new sats on orbit by y...	Until recent decades, the National Reconnaissance Office wouldn't acknowledge even one satellite it had in space. Now, the intelligence agency is speaking publicly about launching dozens in the past year and a half. 'From last June to December of this year, we'll have probably launched 100 satellites. So we are going from the demo phase to the operational phase, where we're really going to be able to start testing all of this stuff out in a more operational way,&rdquo; Christopher Scolese, director of the NRO, said today at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic & International Studies. At least some of those 100 belong to a new network of satellites that will collect information for the Pentagon and intelligence community. The agency's first batch of operational satellites in this constellation launched in May, and the agency has since launched two more batches. But officials haven't disclosed the number of satellites in those first launches or how many the constellation will have in total. The agency has launched demonstration satellites over the last few years 'to verify cost and performance,&rdquo; according to officials, but this year's satellites will start being used for real-time missions. 'What are they going to be doing? They are part of the proliferated architecture to go off it and get us reasonably high-resolution imagery of the Earth at a high rate of speed,&rdquo; Scolese said. [[Related Posts]] Growing this constellation of intel-gathering satellites will enable the United States to keep a persistent gaze on a given point on Earth, Scolese said. 'Now you can't hide because you're constantly being looked at.&rdquo; The agency will continue launching new satellites into various orbits for this architecture through 2028, and aims to eventually quadruple the number of satellites it has in orbit over the next decade. 'The NRO continues to build and fortify the largest government satellite constellation in history which has been enabled by a dynamic 18-month period, ending late this year, where 10+ missions will have launched and delivered more than 100 payloads on orbit. The purpose of this proliferated architecture is to increase revisit rates, enhance NRO's coverage, and capture and deliver&mdash;by orders of magnitude&mdash;more data to our users than ever before,&rdquo; an NRO spokesperson said in an email. But with the influx of satellites on orbit, and the heaps of data coming from those satellites, humans can't keep up, Scolese said, so the agency will need help from artificial intelligence to manage its satellite constellations better. 'Operating a proliferated architecture means that it's no longer possible to go off and for an individual sitting at a control center to say, I know what the satellite is doing. So we have to have the machines to go off and help us there. We need artificial intelligence, machine learning, [and] automated processes to help us do that,&rdquo; he said. Separate from NRO's planned network of satellites, the Space Development Agency has been building out its own proliferated constellation of satellites, called the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture, or PWSA, which will start delivering operational capabilities for troops this year.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/you-cant-hide-spy-agency-will-have-100-new-sats-orbit-years-end/400047/	2024-10-03T14:00:05-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/GettyImages_2144495544/large.jpg
Senators want answers from DOD on quantum sensing efforts	Two U.S. senators are working across the aisle to get answers from the Pentagon about its efforts to advance quantum sensing&mdash;whose promises include jam-resistant position-navigation-timing systems&mdash;and whether the U.S. military can keep pace with China in the field. 'China is pursuing advances in quantum information science, some of which outstrip the efforts of the United States in scale and scope,&rdquo; Sens. Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., write in an Oct. 3 letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, obtained exclusively by Defense One. 'To ensure that the United States maintains its technological advantage, DOD must have a strategic plan to integrate quantum sensing into our national security efforts.&rdquo; Hassan and Blackburn cite a September report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, or ITIF, that finds 'China leads in quantum communications&hellip;and matches the United States in sensing, excelling in market-ready tech, while the United States dominates high-impact areas.&rdquo; This points to a big contrast in the way the two countries are pursuing quantum technology in general. The United States leads in quantum computing&mdash;but real-world quantum computing applications are years away, in part because of the challenge of building machines to handle large numbers of qubits&mdash;the basic unit of information in the field. For instance, IBM hopes to have three 100,000-qubit computers&mdash;capable of solving some of 'the world's most challenging problems&rdquo;&mdash;but not until 2033. But quantum communication and sensing is closer to real-world applications today. Instead of trying to get subatomic particles to work together to process information, quantum sensing involves the (relatively) simpler observation of them. Because all atoms behave the same way, and all have mass, they can, for instance, create precise measurement data for phenomena like acceleration, allowing for, say, a drone or an aircraft to understand where it is anywhere on earth without receiving a jammable or spoofable GPS signal. The Defense Department and the services have various investments in quantum sensing, including a $55 million effort to lay the groundwork for moving to quantum sensors. But as the ITIF report points out, China has a clear lead in quantum communication and there are some indications that it is leading in quantum sensing as well, due in part, to a focus on these more near-term applications over quantum computing hardware development. 'Overall, China's strategic focus on near-term quantum technologies enables it to lead in technologies that are closer to market readiness.&rdquo; it reads. In their letter, Hassan and Blackburn press Austin for more details about how the Pentagon is coordinating its efforts among various services and offices; how it is coordinating with other federal agencies, some of which are out-spending the Defense Department; and asks simply: does the Defense Department have a strategic plan for quantum science? 'To ensure that the United States maintains its technological advantage, DOD must have a strategic plan to integrate quantum sensing into our national security efforts,&rdquo; the letter reads. Among the questions: 'What emerging threats and areas of concern has DOD identified that quantum sensing may play a role in addressing? How has DOD already worked to use quantum sensing to address these threats?&rdquo; &rdquo;What is the current breakdown of quantum sensing efforts within DOD, including the offices responsible for managing and moving forward overall DOD quantum efforts?&rdquo; 'What does DOD need from Congress to support, sustain, and accelerate quantum sensing technology for national defense?&rdquo; The senators want the answers to the questions by November 15.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/senators-want-answers-dod-quantum-sensing-efforts/400036/	2024-10-03T11:31:18-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/Screenshot_2024_10_03_at_8.30.03AM-1/large.png
DOJ, Microsoft disrupt Russian hackers targeting civil society or...	Microsoft's digital crimes team and the Justice Department seized some 100 website domains belonging to a Russia-backed hacking gang that's built a reputation targeting civil society organizations around the world. A civil action unsealed Thursday afternoon authorized the tech giant's Digital Crimes Unit to take down some 66 websites belonging to the group, dubbed Star Blizzard. Another 41 websites used by the group were seized by the Justice Department, according to a statement issued by Microsoft. Star Blizzard &mdash; also known as Seaborgium and Callisto in the cybersecurity community &mdash; has been a thorn in the side of U.S. cyber officials and international intelligence partners for some time. The group, likely tied to Russia's Federal Security Service, has been launching cyberattacks against governmental orgs, NGOs, academia and other institutions since at least 2019, DHS's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said last year. The group's hacking activities expanded in 2022, targeting U.S. Department of Energy facilities, CISA said at the time. Microsoft said 82 of its customers were targeted by the hackers since January of last year, at a rate of around one attack per week. 'This frequency underscores the group's diligence in identifying high-value targets, crafting personalized phishing emails, and developing the necessary infrastructure for credential theft,&rdquo; said Steven Masada, the assistant general counsel for the company's Digital Crimes Unit. 'Their victims, often unaware of the malicious intent, unknowingly engage with these messages leading to the compromise of their credentials.&rdquo; Star Blizzard has been deemed a top antagonist for phishing cyberattacks that target victims through email communications containing links that can siphon sensitive data or load malware onto targets' devices. Specializing in email credential theft, the collective has aimed to exploit NGOs and think tanks supporting government employees, as well as military and intelligence officials, Masada said. Phishing schemes have been particularly harder to identify because generative artificial intelligence tools have allowed attackers to craft more realistic-sounding scam messages in languages not native to their upbringing, researchers say. CISA has previously released guidance for civil society groups, focusing on activists, journalists, human rights workers and others affiliated with organizations that may face cyberthreats.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/doj-microsoft-disrupt-russian-hackers-targeting-civil-society-orgs/400046/	2024-10-03T09:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/100224MicrosoftNG/large.jpg
The D Brief: Russia hacks Taiwan; Diego Garcia shocker; ‘Sunken n...	New: Russian hackers have turned their sights on Taiwan, Dmitri Alperovitch noted Thursday on social media. Targets include Taiwanese companies and government agencies. Why now? Possibly because just last month, Taiwan's new president said that if Chinese Communist Party leaders' dream of annexing Taiwan is (as they allege) about restoring territorial borders from a bygone era, then China should take back land ceded to Russia back in the 19th century 'in the Treaty of Aigun during the Qing Dynasty.&rdquo; 'This clearly shows that the intention to invade Taiwan is not about territorial concerns,&rdquo; Taipei's President Lai Ching-te said. Rhetoric alert: Chinese leader Xi Jinping echoed the arguments of one of the deadliest dictators in history on Monday when he asserted at a state banquet in Beijing's Great Hall of the People, 'Taiwan is China's sacred territory. Blood is thicker than water, and people on both sides of the strait are connected by blood,&rdquo; according to CNN, citing state-run Xinhua news. Former U.S. Navy submariner Tom Shugart pointed out the chilling similarities with Nazi leader Adolf Hitler, who wrote in Mein Kampf that the reunification of Germany and Austria 'is a life task to be carried out by all means! German-Austria must be restored to the great German Motherland&hellip; People of the same blood should be in the same REICH.&rdquo; Coverage continues below the fold&hellip; Welcome to this Thursday edition of The D Brief, brought to you by Ben Watson with Bradley Peniston.

On this day in 2015, the crew of a U.S. Air Force AC-130U gunship failed to consult their no-strike list for Kunduz, Afghanistan, and spent 30 minutes attacking a hospital operated by Doctors Without Borders. The early morning attack killed 42 people, including three doctors as well as others who were shot by U.S. gunners as they tried to flee the burning building. Officials later blamed a special operations commander on the ground, the gunship's aircrew, commanders at Bagram airbase, and a poorly-rigged antenna for contributing to the tragedy. Sixteen American troops were disciplined afterward, though none faced criminal charges. Leading U.S. security analyst: 'China Is Ready for War,&rdquo; Seth Jones of the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies argued this week in Foreign Affairs. However, he explained, thanks to America's 'crumbling&rdquo; defense industrial base, the U.S. appears to be nowhere nearly as prepared for a conflict with China. The gist: 'Despite the country's current economic challenges, its defense spending is soaring and its defense industry is on a wartime footing,&rdquo; Jones writes. 'China has already caught up to the United States in its ability to produce weapons at mass and scale,&rdquo; and it has 'become the world's largest shipbuilder by far, with a capacity roughly 230 times as large as that of the United States.&rdquo; A few areas the U.S. should improve upon in the months ahead, according to Jones: Its 'anachronistic contracting and acquisitions system that is much better suited for the leisurely pace of peacetime than for the urgency of wartime&rdquo;; U.S.-based production of certain 'solid rocket motors, processor assemblies, castings, forgings, ball bearings, microelectronics, and seekers for munitions&rdquo;; It will also need to shore up its 'advanced battery supply chain,&rdquo; since so many of the components are dominated by China; And U.S. shipyards need to somehow increase their supply of 'engineers, electricians, pipefitters, shipfitters, and metalworkers.&rdquo; Related analysis: 'What reports got wrong about China's &lsquo;sunken nuclear submarine,'&rdquo; via J. Michael Dahm of Blue Path Labs with Peter W. Singer, writing Wednesday in Defense One. For one thing, there's little actual evidence that the sub was nuclear. For another, the discussion of the sub in Chinese-language sources reveals interesting things about the state of the Chinese naval industrial base. Read on, here. Related reading: 'Why Can't the U.S. Build Ships?&rdquo; asked Brian Potter last month on his blog Construction Physics, answering with a 4,000-word run through history. 'In looking at the history of US shipbuilding, two major trends stand out,' he writes. 'The first is the high cost of inputs, particularly labor and steel.' But the other factor is cultural, he argues. While some nations have been driven to build ships for trade or survival, the United States 'never appears to have been strongly motivated to make its shipbuilding industry an international success. Historically it has been isolationist, trading much more with itself than it has with other countries.&rdquo; Read the rest, here. From the region: The Brits just announced a major change in how it manages a quietly-influential territorial relic from the colonial era. In a joint statement with Mauritius on Thursday, the two nations announced the Chagos Archipelago is Mauritius's sovereign territory. This includes the strategic Diego Garcia island, which the U.S. military has used to carry out its post-9/11 global war on terrorism. However, 'both our countries are committed to the need, and will agree in the treaty, to ensure the long-term, secure and effective operation of the existing base on Diego Garcia which plays a vital role in regional and global security,&rdquo; 10 Downing Street said Thursday. Fine print: 'For an initial period of 99 years, the United Kingdom will be authorised to exercise with respect to Diego Garcia the sovereign rights and authorities of Mauritius required to ensure the continued operation of the base well into the next century,&rdquo; the joint statement reads. The legal struggles of locals on Diego Garcia were thoroughly documented in a recent book from international law specialist ​​Philippe Joseph Sands entitled, 'The Last Colony: A Tale of Exile, Justice, and Courage.&rdquo; The Brits forcibly removed some 2,000 people from the island in 1973, diverting them to Mauritius and the Seychelles. Sands' account of that history is short but packed with emotion as he retraced just some of the lives disrupted by the Brits' determination to stay on Diego Garcia against the will of the UN General Assembly. 'The [new] treaty will address wrongs of the past and demonstrate the commitment of both parties to support the welfare of Chagossians,&rdquo; the joint statement reads. What's more, 'Mauritius will now be free to implement a programme of resettlement on the islands of the Chagos Archipelago, other than Diego Garcia, and the UK will capitalise a new trust fund, as well as separately provide other support, for the benefit of Chagossians.&rdquo; New small cruise missile slated for SOCOM gunship test. Leidos tells Defense One's Patrick Tucker that its Black Arrow, a relatively small cruise missile with a designed range of about 400 miles, passed preliminary tests that set it up for an actual test launch out the back of a U.S. Special Forces Command AC-140J gunship sometime this fall. Leidos, which is arguably better known for its weapons components than full-up rounds, exemplifies how digital engineering techniques are enabling the entry of new competitors in the missile market, and even the creation of new product categories.

Lastly today: The CIA is looking for informants from Iran, China and North Korea. The agency posted instructions Wednesday 'on how to securely contact us&rdquo; after it claimed unspecified success with the same approach targeting Russian speakers, Olivia Gazis of CBS News reported. 'We want to make sure individuals in other authoritarian regimes know that we're open for business,&rdquo; an agency spokesman said. According to NBC news, potential informants are advised 'not to use their home or work computer; employ only up-to-date web browsers; use the browser's private browser mode; delete computer searches and browser histories by following the CIA's instructions; use the Tor network or a trusted VPN service not headquartered in Russia, Iran or China or other country hostile to the U.S.; and use a &lsquo;kill switch' feature on the VPN service&rdquo; in case the VPN connection is lost.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/the-d-brief-october-03-2024/400025/	2024-10-03T08:25:53-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/03/DB_lander/large.png
New small cruise missile slated for SOCOM gunship test	An upcoming test-firing of a small cruise missile is a step toward filling a rising need for U.S. special operators&mdash;and perhaps allies around the globe. Sometime this fall, Leidos aims to launch its under-development Black Arrow missile from an AC-130J furnished by U.S. Special Operations Command, building on hitherto unrevealed captive-carry and safe-separation tests conducted last December, according to a company statement. The effort by Leidos, better known for its weapons components than entire missiles, shows how digital technologies and open, modular design are enabling new entrants to the missile market and clearing a path toward cheaper, easier-to-built weapons. The Black Arrow is designed to answer SOCOM's 2021 call for a small air-to-ground cruise missile that can fly about 400 nautical miles and hit targets even when GPS is down. SOCOM said it needed such a missile because more advanced air defense systems were putting U.S. forces at greater risk in more places. The same can be said of many partner militaries, such as Ukraine. In August, Digital Transformation Minister Mykhailo Fedorov invited inventors and companies to help the country develop new missiles. 'What are the next challenges where we need your help?&rdquo; Fedorov said at the GLOBSEC forum in Prague. 'How to invent effective laser guidance, how to develop AI for swarms of drones, how to produce Ukrainian HIMARS, how to develop cheap Ukrainian missiles to shoot down Shaheds?' But creating cruise missiles has generally required more money and time than outfits like SOCOM or Ukraine have to spend. SOCOM hired Leidos through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, or CRADA, that allowed the development process to move unusually quickly, a Leidos official told Defense One. The company spent more of its own money than usual on research and development, while the command furnished a test aircraft, range, and other resources. Leidos trimmed its own costs by using digital engineering techniques such as high-data modeling and digital twinning. 'We're circumventing the normal development time that can take a decade or more by accomplishing a lot of the work under the CRADA, and a key element of that is our reliance and confidence that we have on the digital models,&rdquo; the Leidos official said. 'We use [advanced digital modeling] in our hardware loop facility so that we can run literally hundreds of thousands and millions of trajectories and scenarios to make sure that not only do we fly well at the heart of the envelope that we understand, we've evaluated the corners of the fight envelope as well.&rdquo; But Leidos is not the only new entrant in the small-missile market. In September, Anduril announced its own family of small cruise missiles. And Y Combinator, the startup accelerator known for boosting small digital companies at their earliest stages, announced in August that they were backing Ares, their first cruise missile company. Leidos says they did extra work to ensure that their missile actually functions with the aircraft that the military wants to use. That digital modeling was key not just to designing the missile but also making sure that it could integrate with the NSWC Battle Management System and the AC-130. That's why the captive-carry and safe-separation tests were so important. With that done, they hope to move forward much more quickly with flight tests than is the norm for cruise missiles. 'And now, when we go in the fall, instead of an incremental buildup and test, we will move directly to a control-guided flight test relying on the fidelity and confidence that we have in the digital model,&rdquo; the official said. Digital modeling also makes it easier to modify the missile for more platforms, the official said. For example, a 400-mile cruise missile would give the slow, vulnerable MQ-9 drone more relevance in a high-end fight. 'It's 80 inches long, nine inches in diameter. So you could carry eight of these on an MQ-9, for instance. So now you start thinking about these MQ-9s that are vulnerable to enemy air defenses,&rdquo; said the official. 'It's sort of like a loaf of bread. It has various subsections that&hellip;we could lengthen the missile. We could shorten it. We could put a different front in it, on it. We could alter the body length.&rdquo; That could be a big huge advantage for militaries like Ukraine or other partners that are struggling to obtain and operate advanced fighter jets like F-16s but might be able to get other aircraft. 'You could put this on a C-138 that the Philippines have, all the hundreds of C-130s that our allied partners have, or other transport aircraft like the C-27. So the idea is simple, rapid integration.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/10/new-small-cruise-missile-slated-socom-gunship-test/400021/	2024-10-03T03:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/Screenshot_2024_10_02_at_11.20.27PM/large.png
Air Force taps Leidos to lead digital infrastructure for connect-...	The Air Force picked longtime defense IT contractor Leidos to develop and manage the guts of the service's next-gen command, control, and communications network Defense One has learned. The $303 million contract covers 'planning, analysis, and operations&rdquo; for the digital infrastructure network of the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System&mdash;a key component of the service's contribution to the Pentagon's connect-everything effort, called Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2. The Air Force also recently announced plans to bring more industry partners in to ABMS experiments. The Air Force's program executive office for command, control, communications and battle management runs point on ABMS and has been expanding its use of cloud-based command and control tools as part of its overall digital infrastructure plans for operators to improve battlefield communication. But the contract, which runs for three years with an option for two more, puts Leidos as the lead for stitching technologies together for ABMS' Digital Infrastructure Network. Defense One spoke with Chad Haferbier, who leads Leidos' multi-domain solutions division, to understand more about this largely classified initiative. He said the first order of business is sitting down with Air Force leadership to understand 'what they want to field, and how we can help them do that, and how we want to organize,&rdquo; then hiring more people to work on the solutions. What's the significance of this contract for the Air Force's Battle Network, the service's contribution to JADC2, and ABMS effort, which falls under that? The digital infrastructure is the backbone for the modernization aspects of battle management command and control. How do you start to connect things and share data and process that data? How do you build a network and manage that network and keep that operational and secure [while moving] data from tactical edge to operational, strategic decision makers? And if they're fielding elements of that network, we're going to be their partners to support them to make that vision a reality. What does that look like? This element is more focused on the infrastructure than it would be on the applications. [That means] supporting the Department of the Air Force in terms of where do we need to put this infrastructure to start to expose and share this data and keep it secure? And then move it to those, whether it be a tactical node or operational node or a tech or a strategic code&mdash;and that's all, speculation, I would say&mdash;and move that data to inform decision makers&hellip; in order to make those decisions in a timely manner. The DAF is really set out&mdash;and I'm super proud of that team, because they have actually turned all of these ideas and lightning bolts on PowerPoint charts into programs of record. And they've secured a budget from the Congress to go make investments to realize that connected-network vision. And the digital infrastructure is just a fundamental core element of that. How does this fold into the other work Leidos is doing in the JADC2 space, for the Air Force or elsewhere across the DOD? We're also making [independent research and development, or] IRAD investments in command and control applications, AI/[machine learning]-informed code generation. How do we start to bring in other domains in a meaningful way, and filter that data for the decision maker for what they need&hellip;so that we can be a preferred partner higher on the stack&hellip;as we start to bring all this data together. Have you been able to successfully do anything like this on the scale already? Even if it's in a lab where you're gathering a bunch of information from disparate locations. Proof points on our ability to be the integrator from the digital infrastructure side: The DISA contracts that we have and the Navy contracts. There are examples where we're showing our ability to make sense of all that data. A program that is also part of my team in [the Air Force's Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application, or] C2IMERA would be an example where we are collecting data from multiple sources to help assist base management in a crisis scenario. [During the] withdrawal from Afghanistan, C2IMERA was used pretty heavily to assist in those decision makers' ability to take all that data and make good decisions with the information. Let's say all of this goes well with the Air Force. This is a limited contract. How are you thinking about integrating and feeding into the bigger beast of combined joint all-domain command and control across the entire joint force? Because we're fully dedicated corporately to open architecture, not proprietary frameworks. What you've seen in the past are proprietary boundaries between systems, and so to have an integrator that is fully willing to tie their business strategy to being a trusted partner and deliver that open architecture and backwards compatibility. To me, that's why Leidos is a great selection to help with that. Even if there's open architecture, there can still be policy challenges when trying to link technologies. The recent news that [Maj. Gen.] Cropsey has become the executive agent for the Joint Fires Network in INDOPACOM is a great example of how a single acquisition entity can start to stitch together the services from a single service. You're always going to have to have an acquisition office to manage the procurement and the development with industry partners to realize the capability. And given the steps the Air Force has taken, the confidence that the DOD has now shown to them to give them the [Joint Fires Network] responsibility, I think that's huge in terms of progress towards a joint realization of that connectedness. Anything else? There are ongoing acquisition solicitations for mission partner environment networks that we are very interested in performing. [Such as] how do you use a software solution for [identity, credentialing, and access management, or] ICAM to adjudicate between NATO partners, what data they can see? Because right now, in the NATO environment, everyone has point-to-point networks, and so it's very manually intensive on how you share data. I believe the vision is to, how do you collapse that into a single network and then provide the security through software to rapidly enable allies and partners to to have access to the data that they can. We're investing in [independent research and development] to turn that data into information. We're also very interested in helping close the gap between the [intelligence community] and the DOD to expedite those data movements, and those information movements and decision abilities.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/air-force-taps-leidos-lead-digital-infrastructure-connect-everything-effort/400020/	2024-10-02T17:02:01-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/GettyImages_1661051950/large.jpg
Can ULA clear the final hurdle on Vulcan?	Despite delays, United Launch Alliance says its Vulcan heavy-lift rocket will still fly two missions for the Space Force before the end of the year&mdash;if the rocket's second flight goes smoothly. Vulcan had its maiden flight in January, years behind schedule. But ULA has to complete a second certification flight&mdash;scheduled to take off from Cape Canaveral this Friday&mdash;before the rocket can start flying operational missions for the Pentagon. So far, the second flight is on track to be 'another perfect launch like Cert-1,&rdquo; ULA CEO Tory Bruno told reporters Wednesday ahead of the launch. Bruno said he's confident that Vulcan will be certified in time to launch two Space Force missions, USSF-106 and USSF-87, by the end of the year&mdash;but that's a tight timeline considering that nine months passed between the first and second certification flights. Bruno didn't provide details on the service's certification timeline, but said 'as long as it's a very clean mission, it's a short number of weeks to get it all done.&rdquo; Pentagon officials have previously expressed concern over ULA's ability to ramp up its launch cadence essentially tenfold in the coming years. The company launched three rockets in 2023, but is slated to launch 25 national-security missions by the end of 2027. [[Related Posts]] In June, ULA co-owners Lockheed and Boeing formed an independent review team to keep Vulcan on track. Bruno said the team came up with 'great suggestions&rdquo; and tools for ULA to improve its production planning and management. 'I guess I'll say that everything that they brought to me as recommendations, I thought were great ideas, and I plan to do them,&rdquo; he said. ULA officials once hoped Vulcan would fly for the second time in April. But delays with the intended payload&mdash;Sierra Space's Dream Chaser space plane&mdash;pushed that timeline back. And since the Sierra payload still isn't ready, ULA will launch a dummy payload, plus some 'experiments and demonstrations,&rdquo; on the second certification flight, according to company officials. Since there isn't a customer for this second flight, ULA will eat the entire cost of the launch, which is in the 'high tens of millions of dollars,&rdquo; Bruno said. He admitted it won't be easy to get to 20 launches next year (split roughly half-and-half between the Vulcan and Atlas rockets), but said, 'I know how to do that, it needs to be done, and I'm not daunted at all.&rdquo; Vulcan is the centerpiece of ULA's plan to compete with Elon Musk's SpaceX, which upended the space launch market ULA had dominated for years. SpaceX is also developing its own heavy-lift rocket, Starship. ULA made a huge bet on Vulcan, expecting Pentagon and commercial contracts for years to come, and has invested '$5 to $7 billion&rdquo; on the rocket itself, as well as more than a billion on infrastructure, to support bigger factories, more tooling, and more capacity throughout the supply chain, Bruno said. ULA, SpaceX, and Blue Origin are competing for a slew of launches under the Space Force's new satellite launch competition, called National Security Space Launch Phase 3. The companies will vie for $5.6 billion worth of contracts over the next five years.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/10/can-ula-clear-final-hurdle-vulcan/400019/	2024-10-02T16:46:20-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/GettyImages_1908310728/large.jpg
The US military must prepare for a second Trump presidency	Nobody's talking about how the rapidly approaching presidential election might affect the state of civil-military relations in this country. But we should be. The military in particular should be hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. The election promises two possible outcomes, each with serious implications for the military, its relationship with the next commander-in-chief, and society as a whole: Either we will elect a commander-in-chief in the traditional mold&mdash;one who unselfishly respects norms and limits, seeks to preserve and protect the Constitution and the institutions of democracy, and exerts responsible civilian control over a professional military dedicated to serving the nation. Or we will usher back into office a commander-in-chief who regularly denigrates those in uniform, seeks to undermine and circumvent the Constitution and the institutions of democracy, and selfishly uses the military for personal and political gain rather than to serve the public or national interest. The former electoral outcome promises to ensure the sustainment of a more-or-less stable equilibrium in civil-military relations in which all parties involved, notwithstanding any differences they might have, honor their constitutional obligations and respect behavioral, political, and ideological boundaries for the greater good. The latter electoral outcome, by contrast, will ensure that self-absorption, self-indulgence, and self-aggrandizement on the part of the commander-in-chief are permanently arrayed against the self-sacrifice, self-discipline, and self-respect of the military, thereby producing a perpetual state of ethical tension and upheaval for those in uniform. Civil-military relations are grounded in a tacit but binding social contract of mutual rights, obligations, and expectations among the parties to the relationship. Perhaps the defining precept of sound civil-military relations is civilian control of the military, the understandable recognition that a profession that considers itself the Profession of Arms&mdash;whose distinguishing area of expertise is the management of violence&mdash;must be directed and overseen by duly elected and appointed civilian officials answerable to the people if it is to have legitimacy. All civilian officials and military officers have sworn an oath to unreservedly support and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. For those in uniform, that oath is further underlain by their original enlistment oath, which swears them to obey the lawful orders&mdash;not ethical, prudent, or competent, but lawful&mdash;of those appointed over them. The paramount motive force behind these oaths is respect for and adherence to the rule of law. Ironically, civilian control is neither defined nor even mentioned specifically in the Constitution. References to its purported Constitutional roots derive solely from the designation of the President as commander-in-chief in Article II, and, by implication, from the several enumerated military-related powers assigned to Congress in Article I. Civilian control, properly exercised for reasons of state rather than for personal gain, owes its democratic character in large part to two defining principles of the military ethos: obedience to properly constituted authority and political neutrality. A power-hungry, power-driven commander-in-chief, motivated solely by self-interest at the expense of all else, would unreservedly exploit these deeply ingrained military imperatives to his own advantage, thereby reinforcing the steady accretion of power that has otherwise increasingly muscularized the presidency over time. Historian Arthur Schlesinger first awakened us to the imperial nature of the presidency. Others since have embraced the all-encompassing power they believe inheres in the so-called unitary executive. It is more truth than truism that absolute power is likely to produce absolute corruption, and the concentration of power in any person or office is feedstock for tyranny. A thus-empowered commander-in-chief wouldn't hesitate to employ any instrumentality, legal or illegal, ethical or unethical, that best serves his personal interests while disguised as serving the national interest. And he almost assuredly would claim personal ownership of a supplicant military to do his bidding. Until recently, the quintessential vehicle for doing this was the Insurrection Act, which, because it doesn't define what constitutes insurrection and doesn't subject the president to checks by Congress, leaves him free to take unfettered action against political opponents easily labeled clear and present dangers and enemies of the state. Such individuals and groups are obvious targets for a military steeped in dutiful obedience to lawful orders and possessed of a penchant for defending the nation against internal and external threats. The recent Supreme Court decision granting the president immunity from criminal acts in the conduct of official duties takes such presidential license to a whole new level. Since it's almost impossible to conceive of any presidential use of the military as unofficial or private business, the military is left to ask itself whether the unquestioning obedience, compliance, and silence it has tacitly agreed to provide should continue to be unconditional, or whether such limitations and inhibitions should be conditioned on the public and private actions of the commander-in-chief. All of this is to suggest that, depending on the results of the upcoming election, the military should be prepared to 'lawyer up&rdquo; in defense of its honor, integrity, and rights; to concern itself not merely with the legality, but also with the ethicality of the direction it receives; to scrutinize the motive and intent behind all such direction; and to fundamentally rethink its past orientation toward dissent and disobedience. Only by doing so, can the military expect to maintain its dignity and self-respect as an institution, while also preserving the binding social contract of civil-military relations. Gregory D. Foster is a professor at the National Defense University, where he previously has served as J. Carlton Ward Distinguished Professor and Director of Research and as George C. Marshall Professor.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/10/us-military-must-prepare-second-trump-presidency/400006/	2024-10-02T12:23:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/02/Republican_president_2500/large.jpg
What reports got wrong about China’s ‘sunken nuclear submarine’	The purported sinking of a Chinese nuclear submarine at a Wuhan shipyard pier is the latest example of Western reporting on military developments in China that overlooks important details and context, or even takes the wrong lessons from the fragments of stories they tell. The incident, which took place in June, drew some mention the following month on social media and even in the defense press, but it went viral after a Sept. 26 report in the Wall Street Journal touched off coverage from Fox News to CBS. What apparently lit up the U.S. media landscape were the assertions, attributed to unnamed U.S. defense officials, that the submarine was nuclear-powered. Many of the subsequent reports suggested that the incident revealed safety concerns about a new class of PLA Navy nuclear submarine and a serious setback for China's military modernization. These are mischaracterizations. Moreover, the reporting actually buried the lead. The shipyard accident tells us very little about the future of PLA naval modernization, but the submarine itself does. The afflicted boat was said to be a 'Type 041 Zhou-class submarine&rdquo; powered by a nuclear reactor. But tracing that claim to its origins reveals the importance of context and of using varied sources. The designation seems to have first publicly appeared in Chinese media sources in late 2023, which identified the 'Type 041&rdquo; as an improved variant of the Type 039C Yuan-class submarine. Two of the submarines were said to be in production at the Wuhan shipyard with advanced air-independent propulsion engines, not nuclear reactors. In spring 2024, rumors began to emerge on the Chinese internet that China was developing a nuclear reactor for a 4,000-ton submarine the size of the Type 039/041. Most of the world's nuclear-powered submarines are significantly larger. The rumors took off when Du Wenlong, a PLA senior colonel-turned-state-television commentator, appeared to drop veiled hints. 'Some people say that China is making a &lsquo;Type 041' small nuclear submarine,&rdquo; Du wrote, going on to argue that the PLA should indeed invest in such technology. Rumors continued to percolate over the summer, even as some Chinese military forums pointed out that China's only known nuclear-capable shipyard is in Huludao, on the northern Bohai Gulf, and that there were no indications that the Wuhan shipyard had received certifications to produce nuclear submarines. While it is possible that the Wuhan shipyard built this 'Type 041&rdquo; submarine only to have its nuclear power plant or fuel installed elsewhere, reactors and fuel rods are not something one just drops into a pressure hull. Installing a nuclear reactor post-assembly would be inefficient and unlikely. Moreover, China's limited experience in building nuclear submarines suggests that it would more likely evolve its designs from conventional to nuclear rather than launch a revolutionary, keel-up nuclear design in Wuhan. Further context comes from a PLA officer who had recently written that China's navy will focus on building more nuclear-powered submarines. The expansion of the Huludao nuclear shipyard over the past several years supports that claim. However, given its relative dearth of nuclear submarine design experience and engineering talent, it would be difficult for China to increase nuclear-submarine production at two shipyards simultaneously. The point is that a preponderance of public sourcing indicates there is far more uncertainty about the ship itself than the headlines would have it. Indeed, there is nothing in the available reporting that indicates an actual nuclear incident. The satellite photos showed four crane barges that may have been deployed to raise a sunken object, but no nuclear-response efforts were detected. This was not Chernobyl. What was missed Even worse, the media reports focusing on the potential nuclear nature of the shipyard accident missed what this submarine actually does tell us about PLA naval modernization. Today's Chinese subs lack a vertical launch system, or VLS, limiting their ability to carry and quickly fire land-attack and anti-ship missiles. The ill-fated submarine, by contrast, had an extended hull with a section that appears to contain a VLS. Chinese language sources indicate it would accommodate long-range YJ-18 anti-ship missiles or CJ-10 land-attack missiles. Nuclear-powered or not, the prospect of numerous, difficult-to-locate submarines that can deliver a vastly larger salvo of weapons against ships or air bases would boost Chinese capability and complicate allied defense plans. This story highlights the risk of both dropping into a topic and relying too much on unnamed U.S. military officials, who bring biases along with perspectives and information. In this case, the source appears to have been happy to highlight a Chinese submarine accident and what the incident may say about PLA capability. Yet U.S. defense officials&mdash;and the subsequent media reports&mdash;have said relatively little about the PLA's announcement that it successfully test-launched an ICBM deep into the Pacific Ocean, the very same week of the reporting about this shipyard incident that happened months ago. This story also underlines a larger problem in Western media reporting on China's military in recent years: too often, it swings between two extremes that portray the PLA as either comically inept or ten feet tall. The ICBM test reminds us of a similar media frenzy sparked by a dubious claim earlier this year. In January, Western media aired claims by unnamed U.S. officials that corrupt PLA officers had filled their missiles with water. The reporting seemed to be unaware that the Chinese term 灌水 (gu&agrave;nshuǐ), which does mean 'to pour water into&rdquo; but also references unscrupulous butchers adding water to meat to increase its weight and price, used metaphorically to refer to corruption. Yes, the PLA Rocket Force has experienced a crisis of corruption. No, they do not fill their missiles with water to cover up that corruption. Media coverage of nuclear issues in particular often suffers from mischaracterization and hyperbole. In July, the North American Aerospace Defense Command issued a statement about a flight of Russian Tu-95s and PLA H-6 bombers near Alaska; they were not, NORAD took pains to point out, seen as a threat. Several media reports, however, heralded Chinese 'nuclear-capable bombers&rdquo; patrolling near the United States. A quick reference check of the H-6 tail numbers clearly visible in the NORAD photos indicates these were H-6K variants, part of the PLA's Eastern Theater Command 10th Air Division, 28th Air Regiment. These aircraft were not the PLA's nuclear-capable H-6Ns. Again, yes, China has nuclear-capable bombers and is building up that capability; no, they did not fly into a U.S. air defense identification zone. The issues in U.S.-China security are of growing domestic interest and political importance, especially during an election season. As such, it is ever more vital that mass media reporting on PLA capabilities avoids the temptation to hunt for 'clicks&rdquo; and 'eyeballs&rdquo; and instead seeks out the details and context necessary to fully understand the implications of China's military modernization.

The D Brief: Iran’s missile attack on Israel; Russia seizes town;...	Shortly after U.S. officials predicted it publicly, Iran launched more than 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday, with dozens flying over Jerusalem's Old City, a holy site for Muslims, Christians, and Jewish people around the world. Targets appear to have included Israel's Nevatim airbase (which was also attacked in April); the Tel Nof airbase; and possibly the Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, as well as locations around Tel Aviv, Matt Savill of the Royal United Services Institute said. A 38-year-old man from Gaza hit by debris was the only death from Iran's attack. Why it happened: An Israeli airstrike Friday killed Iran-backed terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah along with a top Iranian paramilitary commander (Abbas Nilforoushan) while meeting at an underground facility in southern Beirut. Iranian generals felt some kind of missile attack was necessary in order to save face and appear strong to the world, three Iranian officials told the New York Times. Israel's Arrow and David's Sling air defense systems played the largest role intercepting Tuesday's barrage. Raytheon and Israeli defense firm Rafael teamed up for David's Arrow; Boeing and Israel Aerospace Industries joined forces to develop the Arrow. 'Both systems along with the Iron Dome were utilized during Iran's attack on Israel last April when 99% of the more than 300 drones, ballistic and cruise missiles launched by Iran were intercepted,&rdquo; Luis Martinez of ABC News reports. Also pitching in: Two U.S. Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean Sea launched nearly a dozen interceptors at Iranian missiles headed toward Israel, Pentagon spokesman Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday. Those destroyers were the USS Bulkeley and the USS Cole. FWIW: 'The IDF and the U.S. Armed Forces cooperated together in defense several days before, during, and after the Iranian attack,&rdquo; the Israeli military said Wednesday morning, specifically noting Chief of the General Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi's conversations with U.S. Central Command's Michael Erik Kurilla. SecDef: 'I am deeply proud of the skill and the bravery of the U.S. troops who helped to save lives today from Iran's assault and who continue to support Israel's defense and to prevent a widening conflict or escalation,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement Tuesday evening. 'Our forces remain postured to protect U.S. troops and partners in the Middle East, and the Department maintains significant capability to defend our people, provide further support for Israel's self-defense, and deter further escalation,&rdquo; Austin added. Israeli reax: 'Iran made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it,&rdquo; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video posted to social media. Next steps: 'Israel will need to continue launching airstrikes further north if it wants to reduce further Hizballah's longer-range precision missile stockpile, or strike new leadership targets,&rdquo; RUSI's Savill says. 'The tempo of operations has already dropped off significantly from the first 48 hours of the Lebanon operation,&rdquo; Savill noted, 'but if it decides to launch a major strike against Iran in the near future, it might reprioritise aircraft away from Lebanon temporarily.&rdquo; Developing: Israeli ground troops are skirmishing with Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon, including around the border town of Maroun el-Ras, Reuters reports from Beirut. The fighting has already claimed the life of at least one Israeli team commander and seven others, the IDF announced Wednesday. Israeli jets have also renewed airstrikes against suspected targets inside Beirut. What might lie ahead: Here's a map of Lebanese towns Israel is targeting and has asked residents there to leave, via the New York Times graphics team. Bigger picture consideration: 'Nearly 1,900 people have been killed and more than 9,000 wounded in Lebanon in almost a year of cross-border fighting, with most of the deaths occurring in the past two weeks,&rdquo; Reuters reports, citing Lebanese government statistics. In addition, 'More than a million people have been forced to flee their homes,&rdquo; the wire service adds. For the latest, the BBC has a robust live blog you can review here. Related reading: 'As Crisis Builds, Lebanon's Government Is Nowhere to Be Found,&rdquo; former Beirut resident Vivian Yee of the NYTs reported Tuesday; And 'Lebanon's rescuers struggle to respond to Israeli offensive while under fire and using old equipment,&rdquo; the Associated Press reported Wednesday from Beirut.

After more than two years of attacks, Russian invasion forces have seized the small Ukrainian city of Vuhledar, a coal-mining town of about 10,000 people (before the war) along Ukraine's eastern front, the Institute for the Study of War reported Tuesday. Capturing the city could make it easier for Russia to advance on other two nearby cities occupying higher ground, Chasiv Yar and Toretsk, the Wall Street Journal reports. 'Over the past few days Ukrainian soldiers had to find their own way out of Vuhledar by foot as it was impossible to evacuate them otherwise,&rdquo; one soldier told the BBC. 'Many were wounded and killed by Russian drones and artillery as they tried to leave, another soldier, Roman, says. Many more are still missing.&rdquo; Meanwhile in Kyiv, nearly 300 companies from over 30 countries sent reps to the Ukrainian capital for the second International Defense Industries Forum, which President Volodymir Zelenskyy is hoping can boost Ukraine's domestic defense production. 'We need foreign expertise, access to supply chains, and technology to continue this growth,&rdquo; he said on social media Wednesday. In attendance: Reps from BAE Systems, KNDS, MBDA, D&M Holding Company, Amentum Services, Inc., AeroVironment, Inc., Kongsberg Defence & Aerospace, Romarm, CZ Colt Group, Quantum Systems, Hellenic Defence Systems, and the DI Danish Defence & Security Industries Association, according to Zelenskyy's office. In the first half of 2024, 'Ukraine produced 25 times more artillery and mortar ammunition than in the entire year of 2022,&rdquo; Zelenskyy told the audience gathered in Kyiv Tuesday. 'We are producing artillery, our &lsquo;Bohdana' howitzers, at a rate of 15 units monthly, and sometimes as many as 20,&rdquo; he continued. And 'The total number of drones we are now capable of producing annually in Ukraine is 4 million,&rdquo; he said. 'While years ago, the Ukrainian defense industry unfortunately looked helpless, today it is an industry that is on its way to leadership, at least in Europe,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. 'There is no state sovereignty without the ability to defend oneself&hellip;we are grateful for everything we can do together today and in the future,&rdquo; he told his audience.

Vance at the debate: 'Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully,&rdquo; he said, omitting Trump's exhortation to 'fight like hell' to stop the certification of the 2020 election results, his repeated false claims of election fraud, and his efforts to stoke the ire of his supporters at a rally that morning. Vance also omitted mention of Trump's refusal to send in the National Guard as hundreds of rioters overwhelmed police and violently forced their way into the Capitol with the aim of stopping the transfer of power.

US destroyers intercept Iranian missiles as Mideast crisis intens...	Two U.S. destroyers fired a dozen interceptors to help Israel ward off a barrage of some 180 Iranian ballistic missiles, about twice as many as Tehran launched in its previously unprecedented April 14 strike, Pentagon officials said Tuesday evening. Unlike April's strike, Tuesday evening's included no drones, and the damage on the ground was minimal, spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. 'You don't launch that many missiles at a target without the intent of hitting something. So absolutely, just like the last time, their intent is to cause destruction,&rdquo; Ryder said. 'Fortunately, you know, Israel has very significant air defense capabilities, and the U.S., of course, played a role in helping on that front as well.&rdquo; Working with Israeli air defenses, the U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers Bulkeley and Cole fired a dozen interceptor missiles during the strike, he said. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that the U.S. and Israel will work to impose 'severe consequences for the attack.&rdquo; 'This is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which no one was killed in this attack in Israel,' Sullivan told reporters during the press conference. The strike happened as Israel launched a ground offensive against Hezbollah targets in Lebanon, following Israel's killing of Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah last week. Ryder said Israel told the United States the offensive will be 'limited,&rdquo; and 'focused on dismantling facilities that Hezbollah has built along the border to stage attacks into Israel.&rdquo; Israel says 63,000 of its citizens have been displaced by Hezbollah rocket fire. At the same time, nearly one million Lebanese people have fled their homes to avoid Israeli attacks, the United Nations said yesterday. In discussions between United States and Israeli officials about the ground offensive, the U.S. wants to ensure 'there's an understanding as far as potential mission creep &hellip; as it relates to the broader tensions in the region,&rdquo; Ryder said. Israel media reported Tuesday that the Israeli military plans to conduct 'powerful strikes&rdquo; on targets across the Middle East in response to the Iranian attack. The U.S. is also sending more military assets to the Middle East. On Tuesday, U.S. CENTCOM announced that three additional squadrons of F-15Es, F-16s, and A-10s have already arrived in the region. 'Fighter aircraft can can perform a variety of missions, to include taking down drones, taking down missiles, particular kinds of missiles, as well as, you know, providing ISR electronic warfare and types of capabilities,&rdquo; Ryder said about the additional aircraft squadrons. 'So all of this comes together to provide us with options on how best to respond to any type of attack and to protect our forces.&rdquo; Ryder did not confirm Iranian reports that a Fattah-2 hypersonic missile was used and destroyed an Israeli Arrow battery, saying that the Pentagon is still assessing the strike.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/10/us-destroyers-fire-dozen-interceptors-against-iranian-missiles-middle-east-crisis-intensifies/399979/	2024-10-01T14:09:05-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/01/bulk_230120_N_TC847_1010/large.jpg
Two years after rollovers, Marines’ ACV is landing on Pacific bea...	The Marine Corps is gingerly introducing its new Amphibious Combat Vehicle to its intended habitat&mdash;the coasts of Asia&mdash;two years after two surf rollovers led the Corps to suspend the vehicle's water operations. One requirement: no big waves. Before using the ACV to land Marines in a combined U.S.-Korean exercise this summer, the Corps ran a 'detailed hydrographic study&rdquo; that assessed the beach, waves, current, and surf, a Marine Corps spokesperson said. After the Marines determined that there was a 'negligible surf zone&rdquo; on the planned beach, the ACV got the thumbs-up for the Aug. 26-Sept. 7 Exercise Ssang Yong 24. That marked the Korean peninsula debut for U.S. ACVs, which are also operated by South Korean forces. The careful use of the ACV, which followed a similar May exercise in the Philippines' Palawan province, was carefully monitored to glean data about how to safely operate the vehicle. The exercises are part of the first ACV's first deployment, with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which also included the vehicle's first overseas ship-to-shore operations. [[Related Posts]] 'Part of this deliberate fielding includes understanding how the ACV responds when operating in its intended environment,&rdquo; the spokesperson said. The use of the ACV in Korea comes nearly two years after the four-year-old vehicle rolled over in two different incidents in the surf zone near Camp Pendleton. While no Marines were injured in either incident, the Corps subsequently restricted operations to land or the Del Mar Boat Basin, which offers protection from waves. Subsequent Corps statements noted mechanical problems with the ACV design and cited a need to retrain crew members familiar with the Corps' previous system, the Amphibious Assault Vehicle. In July 2023, the first class of an improved version of ACV training graduated from their course. The Corps previously used the decades-old Assault Amphibious Vehicle for amphibious landings and operations. In 2020, one AAV sank during a training exercise off the coast of California, killing eight Marines and a sailor. Those Marines were preparing for a previous deployment with the 15th MEU.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/10/two-years-after-rollovers-marines-acv-landing-pacific-beaches/399962/	2024-10-01T11:41:55-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/10/01/U.S._Marine_Corps_Am_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: Israeli troops in Lebanon; More Red Sea ship attacks...	Israeli troops have launched additional ground operations inside Lebanon, advancing their gradual escalation northward to push Iran-backed terrorists out of weapons caches and hideouts across southern Lebanon. The Israeli military describes these latest maneuvers as 'limited, localized, targeted operations&rdquo; whose goals include 'dismantling Hamas, bringing our hostages back home and restoring security in northern Israel.&rdquo; Developing: Iran is allegedly preparing another ballistic missile attack on Israel, possibly similar to what it carried out in mid-April, Barak Ravid of Axios reported Tuesday, citing White House officials. 'We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack,&rdquo; the administration official said, and warned, 'A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.&rdquo; Rewind: Iran's April 13 attack on Israel featured an estimated 170 drones, 30 cruise missiles, and at least 120 ballistic missiles. After extensive interceptions by Israeli air defense systems&mdash;and by U.S., Saudi and Jordanian assets&mdash;those attacks resulted in no deaths, but more than two dozen people were reportedly injured from shrapnel and debris. Also new: Israeli jets allegedly struck several locations in southern Syria on Tuesday, including the al-Thaala Airbase, and early warning radar site in Tel al-Kharouf, an army base in al-Nahta, an airbase near Maliha al-Atrash, and the Syrian army's 7th Air Defense Brigade near al-Sanamayn, according to Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute in Washington. For what it's worth: Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin seems to have given his blessing to Israel's ground raids into southern Lebanon. After a call Monday with his Israeli counterpart, Austin wrote on social media that he 'agreed on the necessity of dismantling attack infrastructure along the border to ensure that Lebanese Hizballah cannot conduct October 7-style attacks on Israel's northern communities.&rdquo; He also 'reiterated the serious consequences for Iran in the event Iran chooses to launch a direct military attack against Israel,&rdquo; according to his statement. Update: There are now an estimated 43,000 American troops and at least a dozen U.S. ships in or near the Middle East after officials added troops and equipment over the past few days, the Associated Press reported following a tight-lipped briefing Monday at the Pentagon. What's new? 'A certain number of units already deployed to the Middle East&hellip;will be extended, and the forces due to rotate into theater to replace them will now instead augment the in-place forces,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said. 'I won't talk specific timelines or numbers for OpSec reasons, but I can tell you these augmented forces include F-16, F-15E, A-10, F-22 fighter aircraft and associated personnel,&rdquo; she added. Meanwhile near Yemen, a suspected Houthi drone boat attacked another commercial ship in the Red Sea, British maritime authorities reported Tuesday. That attack punctured a 'port ballast tank&rdquo; that helps the vessel to stay afloat and under control. A separate attack in a similar location by a single missile reportedly damaged a second commercial ship. The two vessels attacked: Panamanian-flagged crude tanker Cordelia Moon and Liberian-flagged bulk carrier Minoan Courage, according to industry-watcher Sal Mercogliano. Both vessels were heading north toward the Suez Canal, the Associated Press reports from Dubai. Worth noting: 'CORDELIA MOON is currently empty,&rdquo; which 'makes her MORE explosive&hellip;as well as a more attainable target due to her increased height above sea level,&rdquo; the monitoring account TankerTrackers reported after the strikes Tuesday. FWIW: The Houthis also claim to have shot down another U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone, according to allegations aired Monday. The Houthis have in the past shot down several MQ-9s over Yemen; but they've also made several similar claims without releasing any supporting evidence. So far there is no supporting evidence for this latest allegation. The October 7 attacks, one year on: Monday is the one-year anniversary of Hamas terrorists' surprise attack on Israel, which killed more than 1,100 Israelis and helped fan the flames of war that's swept through Gaza and now into southern Lebanon. Several U.S. think tanks are hosting panel discussions this week at least partly in an effort to envision what might lie ahead for the region and for U.S. interests throughout the Middle East. Questions include: What more can be done to prevent wider regional escalation? What is the likely trajectory over the next few months towards a durable ceasefire? What is the future of Israel's military presence in Gaza? Is a Palestinian state in the offing? Events have been planned at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, which invited Dana Stroul, the recently departed U.S. deputy assistant defense secretary for the Middle East, for a conversation that took place this morning. Washington's American Enterprise Institute invited former U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula for a discussion on the afternoon of Oct. 7. And London's Royal United Services Institute is hosting a panel with four of its experts next Monday as well at about 8 a.m. ET. Details and registration here.

On this day 100 years ago, the 39th President of the United States Jimmy Carter was born in Plains, Georgia. The former Navy submariner is the first U.S. president to live to 100. Replicator 2 effort aims to produce anti-drone defenses. Thirteen months after the Pentagon launched an attempt to buy small drones fast and cheap enough for an actual war, a second phase will try to do the same for anti-drone systems. 'Dubbed Replicator 2, the effort will focus on the threat to installations and 'force concentrations,&rdquo; according to a Sept. 27 memo released on Monday from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The Pentagon will ask for money for the effort in the fiscal 2026 budget request now under construction and that deliveries will be expected within 24 months of the budget's passage, reports Defense One's Sam Skove. By the way: The Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit is looking for help building the kind of drones that Replicator 2 aims to down. Read their request, issued Monday. Video: Russian fighter jet nearly sideswipes U.S. F-16. On Monday, U.S. aircraft intercepted Russian warplanes in the Alaskan air defense identification zone, said Gen. Gregory Guillot, who leads U.S. Northern Command. 'The conduct of one Russian Su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all&mdash;not what you'd see in a professional air force,&rdquo; Guillot said in a statement that accompanied cockpit video of the Russian maneuver. Watch, here. The Navy's new missile sub could cost 'hundreds of millions&rdquo; more than the service estimates, the Government Accountability Office says in a blunt report released on Monday. GAO says the Navy and General Dynamics Electric Boat, the prime contractor on the Columbia class, still haven't fixed the problems that drove the cost of the lead boat to an estimated $8.6 billion and put it 12 to 16 months behind schedule&mdash;even as they move into a complicated phase of construction that is likely to bring new challenges. Worse, neither the Navy nor Electric Boat fully understands why the problems happened in the first place, says the report. Don't miss the report's explanation of 'supplier development funding,&rdquo; the billions of dollars that the Navy has spent since 2018 to upgrade suppliers' factories and place advance orders in a bid to prop up the 3,500 companies that make components for submarines. Defense One's Lauren C. Williams reports, here. Can cellphones spot Russian jammers? A U.S. firm that's running experiments in Ukraine has found that phones can be networked together to reveal when one or more is under electronic threat, Sean Gorman, a founder of Zephr, tells Defense One's Patrick Tucker. Read on, here. Developing: More than 5,000 National Guard troops from at least nine different states have teamed up to help with Hurricane Helene relief efforts, the Pentagon said Monday. That includes troops from Connecticut, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Ohio, New York, South Carolina, Florida, and North Carolina. Florida alone has involved nearly 3,500 of its Guardsmen 'along with hundreds of tactical vehicles, and boats, and 11 rotary wing assets,&rdquo; Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has sent personnel to Georgia, as well as dam, levee and bridge inspection specialists to Tennessee and Kentucky while others are working to restore temporary power to North Carolina. 'Helene is already one of the deadliest, costliest storms to hit the US,&rdquo; USA Today reports. So far, more than 100 people have died from the powerful storm as it swept north from the Florida coast. 'Only eight hurricanes have killed more than 100 people since 1950, the last time a storm as deadly as Helene hit the US came in 2017, when Hurricane Harvey made landfall near Houston and was blamed for 103 deaths,&rdquo; USA Today writes.

He took the helm Tuesday after the departure of Norway's Jens Stoltenberg, who at 10 years was the alliance's second-longest serving secretary-general in its seven-and-a-half decade history. Rutte listed three goals for NATO at the outset of his new tenure: 'We must spend more. There is no cost-free alternative if we are to rise to the challenges ahead and keep our one billion people safe,&rdquo; he said; The alliance must 'Step up our support for Ukraine&hellip;because there can be no lasting security in Europe without a strong, independent Ukraine&rdquo;; And he intends to 'strengthen our partnerships&rdquo; with countries outside the 32-member alliance. 'Rutte has an impressive track record as a consensus-builder and decisive leader,&rdquo; U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement. He also shared his 'deep gratitude to Jens Stoltenberg, who led the Alliance through the most consequential decade for Euro-Atlantic security since World War II.&rdquo; Stoltenberg's parting thoughts: 'We have undergone the biggest transformation of NATO in a generation,&rdquo; rising from 'zero to eight NATO battlegroups, with tens of thousands of combat-ready NATO soldiers on our eastern flank,&rdquo; he said Tuesday in Brussels. 'We have gone from thousands to half a million troops on high readiness, and from three to twenty-three allies spending at least two percent of GDP on defence,&rdquo; he said.

The Navy’s new missile sub could cost ‘hundreds of millions’ extr...	The U.S. Navy's next ballistic-missile submarine is already late and over budget&mdash;and the actual overrun might nearly quintuple the service's projections, a government watchdog agency says. 'Our independent analysis calculated likely cost overruns that are more than six times higher than Electric Boat's estimates and almost five times more than the Navy's. As a result, the government could be responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional construction costs for the lead submarine,&rdquo; the Government Accountability Office wrote in a Sept. 30 report on the Columbia-class submarine program. Why the disparity? GAO says the Navy and General Dynamics Electric Boat, the prime contractor on the Columbia class, still haven't fixed the problems that drove the cost of the lead boat to an estimated $8.6 billion and put it 12 to 16 months behind schedule&mdash;even as they move into a complicated phase of construction that is likely to bring new challenges. Worse, neither the Navy nor Electric Boat fully understands why the problems happened in the first place, says the report, an unclassified version of a sensitive one produced in July. The Navy says Electric Boat 'needs to take swift and significant actions to address the causes of poor construction performance,&rdquo; says GAO, adding bleakly, 'However, the program has tried to mitigate some of these causes&mdash;such as late materials and detailed design products&mdash;for years.&rdquo; Electric Boat remains unjustifiably optimistic, the report says: the company's current estimate for cost and schedule 'assumes significant future improvement that GAO's past work suggests is unrealistic.&rdquo; The Navy has its own analytic problems, GAO says: it is pouring billions of dollars into the submarine industrial base without properly gauging the results. In the decades since the Cold War, the number of U.S. companies that make parts for Navy submarines has dwindled from about 17,000 to some 3,500, reducing competition and making some parts harder to get. Since 2018, the Navy and its shipbuilders have been trying to ensure that these second- and third-tier suppliers&mdash;some of whom are the last remaining source for specific parts&mdash;have the equipment, steady orders, and cash flow needed to preserve their expert workforces and continue to make their specialized products. (Examples include spherical air flasks, hull valves, and items for outfitting missile tubes, GAO writes.) To do this, the Navy and shipbuilders disburse 'supplier development funding,&rdquo; in two categories: 'direct investments in suppliers&rdquo; that pays for equipment, factory upgrades, and workforce development; and 'specialized purchases to signal demand&rdquo;: orders to help keep the companies able and willing to produce even when their products are not immediately needed. Most of this supplier development funding flows through the shipyards. Since last year, the non-profit startup BlueForge Alliance has helped the yards coordinate these disbursements, GAO writes. But the Navy isn't doing what's needed to assess whether it's spending the money wisely, GAO found. 'The Navy has not consistently defined information needed to determine whether investments made in the supplier base have increased supplier production or generated cost savings and how those results support the program's goals,&rdquo; the report says. 'Since 2018, the Navy reported receiving more than $2.6 billion to invest in the submarine supplier base and help achieve Columbia class construction goals. Without identifying consistent information, the Navy is not well positioned to ensure that these investments will effectively spur their intended benefits for the program.&rdquo; The Navy has increased its requests for supplier development and special purchases funding in recent years, from $326 million in fiscal year 2023 to $1.26 billion in fiscal year 2025, according to the report. The watchdog agency issued five recommendations for the Navy, including 'consistently identifying information needed to determine whether production improvements and cost savings from supplier development funding are sufficiently supporting Columbia class construction goals.&rdquo; The Navy agreed with all of GAO's recommendations, including ordering shipbuilders to redo their estimated costs, with analysis, at completion as well as spelling out what data is needed to 'determine whether investments in the supplier base support Columbia class construction goals.&rdquo; In response to the supplier development funding recommendation, the Navy said it would 'ensure supplier development funding contracts continue to require recipients to provide specific targets for cost savings, cost results following project completion to support analysis of return on investment and project impact.&rdquo; There's more at stake than just money; the program is in a race against time. The USS District of Columbia is supposed to enter service by 2027, when the first of the Ohio-class missile boats&mdash;the current bearer of America's undersea nuclear deterrent&mdash;reaches the end of its service life. The $130 billion effort to build one dozen Columbias is the Navy's highest-priority acquisition program.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/price-navys-new-missile-sub-might-skyrocket-gao-warns-scathing-report/399951/	2024-09-30T19:37:47-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/30/sub_DCS24_1_15_Edit/large.jpg
A group in Ukraine is testing the newest weapon against GPS jamme...	An American company working with the Ukrainian military is developing a cheap and easy-to-deploy solution to sophisticated Russian electronic warfare tactics: networks of regular cell phones running specialized software. The software allows the cell phones to locate enemies that are using jamming equipment, and if the experiment is successful, it could help operators on the ground regain at least some advantage against better-armed foes in the era of electromagnetic warfare. From there, it could change the way cell phone network providers ensure their devices can stand up to sophisticated attacks. Russian electronic warfare measures are having a deleterious effect on Ukrainian troops' ability to push out the Kremlin's invading forces&mdash;even if the Ukrainian troops are armed with high-end U.S. weapons. And it can be hard to even detect when drones or other pieces of equipment are failing because of signal jamming, GPS spoofing, or just internal problems. Detecting and finding adversary jamming devices usually requires high-end software-defined radios, the sort of equipment the United States and other well-funded militaries can issue to their troops, but that smaller militaries with constrained budgets, like Ukraine's, struggle to acquire in large numbers. Around Christmas, the Ukrainian military reached out to Sean Gorman and his group at Zephr, a company that specializes in making GPS-signal reception more resilient to interference. The group sent six Android Pixel phones loaded with Zephr's software to Ukraine in early 2024, and in April began conducting field tests near Ukraine's frontlines in Donetsk. 'We strapped those phones to drones. We put them in cars. We set up stationary stands for them and then we've also been doing controlled experiments where they use their own jammer, so we know the location of it,&rdquo; Gorman told Defense One. The first objective: see if regular consumer phones, working together in a network, could reveal the existence of an entity trying to jam GPS location data, even if that location data appeared to be correct on any one of the devices. They measured how well phones that were moving&mdash;strapped to a drone and carried by car&mdash;received GPS signals, compared to phones that were static. The findings: It's possible to detect when specific GPS receivers are experiencing an attack, by contrasting their GPS trace to that of other phones. 'We're basically exploiting the sensors on the phone,&rdquo; Gorman explained. 'The most helpful sensor on the phone is the raw [global navigation satellite system, or GNSS] measurements that the phone provides. So you have AGC, the automatic gain control, you have Doppler [sensor], you have carrier phase, you have code phase,&rdquo; and other data cell phones collect about their distance from satellites, cell towers, and other pieces of network equipment. Manufacturers put these sensors in cell phones so the phone can figure out how to optimize performance, for example by detecting where the nearest cell tower is. But these measurements all play a role in the GPS processing software phones use to tell the consumer where they are. When you can get that data from a wide variety of phones, you can figure out which ones are under attack. 'With the computational AI we're running on the back end, and the sophistication of how we're processing most signals and software, instead of just depending on sensors or really expensive antenna arrays, there's a heck of a lot you can do networking phones together as one big distributed antenna&rdquo; Gorman said. The tests also revealed new insights into Russian electronic warfare efforts. Russia is spoofing GPS signals in the Baltic Sea, causing what NATO officials have described as an unsafe situation for consumer aircraft. Spoofing GPS doesn't just block the signal. It tells the receiver that they are somewhere they are not. Most of the time, when adversaries try to spoof GPS locations for drones, they will tell the drone that it is actually at an airport, as most consumer drones are built to try to land or retreat from restricted airspace. On the frontlines in Donetsk, Ukraine's soldiers often report spoofing attacks aimed at their drones. But Gorman and his team found that much of this 'spoofing&rdquo; activity is actually just high-powered jamming attempts. Because those attempts are occurring in the same frequency bands as GPS or GNSS, they appear like satellite signals, effectively creating phantom or ghost satellites in places where they could not possibly exist and still provide signal, such as beneath the horizon. 'This noise doesn't resemble a typical GNSS signal, but it does contain energy at the frequencies where the receiver is looking for satellite signals. The receiver's signal processing algorithms use correlation techniques to identify and track satellite signals. When a strong jamming signal is present, it can cause false correlations, leading the receiver to &lsquo;think' it's detecting satellites that aren't actually visible,&rdquo; Gorman explained in a write up of the testing provided to Defense One. The group, now working under a contract with the Ukrainian government, is trying to take the research a step further to not just detect jammers but triangulate their positions so the jammer can be avoided (or eliminated). 'The new techniques we are building will estimate the location of signals of interest using three inputs: 1. localization by range inferred from power 2. localization by area of effect and 3. triangulation of jammers based on angle of arrival,&rdquo; Gorman said in an email. 'Each smartphone will detect the interference signal, log the last known position, and timestamp the reception, providing data points across the network. By aggregating and processing these signals centrally, the system will triangulate the jammer's position.&rdquo; The U.S. military is investing heavily in alternatives to GPS, usually referred to as alternative position, navigation, and timing&mdash;or Alt PNT&mdash;to help people, drones, etc. figure out where they are. But investments that haven't shown a great return in many cases. 'None of it works without an initial known position. And it's almost impossible to get an initial known position without having GPS,&rdquo; Gorman said. This networked approach won't replace other more expensive military systems for detecting and finding jammers, he said, but it does present a solution that can be deployed quickly and cheaply for militaries like Ukraine or other groups that could be disrupte by jamming activities, such as first responders. And while it won't replace efforts to develop alternative position, navigation and timing methods, it might make them more effective. 'Maybe there's a radically different way to think about this? Instead of throwing all the resources towards Alt PNT, GNSS resilience, which are all super helpful, maybe we can look at how this is now a reality? How well can we map all of this and understand an area back to where the emitters are so that we can dodge those areas and we can remove the emitters?&rdquo; Gorman said. But, he said, 'There isn't a [silver] bullet.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/group-ukraine-testing-newest-weapon-against-gps-jammers-cell-phones/399952/	2024-09-30T16:54:25-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/30/GettyImages_2153058214/large.jpg
VIDEO: Russian fighter jet nearly sideswipes US F-16	Cockpit footage released by the North American Aerospace Defense Command shows a Russian warplane closely buzzing by a U.S. F-16 fighter jet last week&mdash;a move U.S. officials have publicly called out as dangerous and unsafe. 'On Monday Sept. 23, NORAD aircraft flew a safe and disciplined intercept of Russian military aircraft in the Alaskan [air defense identification zone]. The conduct of one Russian Su-35 was unsafe, unprofessional, and endangered all&mdash;not what you'd see in a professional air force,&rdquo; Gen. Gregory Guillot, head of NORAD and U.S. Northern Command, said in a statement Monday. The footage shows the Russian fighter maneuvering into the F-16's path. The Russian fighter jet was one of two Su-35s that were escorting two Russian Tu-95 bombers in Alaska's air defense identification zone, a stretch of international airspace near North America. Russian aircraft fly in this airspace often, but the closeness of this encounter, and video release, is notable. Guillot has recently called for more domain awareness in the Arctic region, after Russian and Chinese aircraft were intercepted this summer in Alaska's ADIZ. NORAD officials said those aircraft came as close as 200 miles from the U.S. coast.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/watch-russian-su-35-nearly-collides-us-fighter-jet/399926/	2024-09-30T11:27:27-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/30/Screenshot_2024_09_30_at_8.14.26AM/large.png
Replicator 2 effort aims to produce anti-drone defenses	A second phase of Replicator&mdash;the Pentagon's year-old, high-profile effort to buy thousands of cheap-ish autonomous weapons&mdash;aims to procure defenses against small drones. Dubbed Replicator 2, the effort will focus on the threat to installations and 'force concentrations,&rdquo; according to a Sept. 27 memo from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. The memo, released on Monday, says the Pentagon will ask for money for the effort in the fiscal 2026 budget request now under construction and that deliveries will be expected within 24 months of the budget's passage. The memo directs Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Adm. Christopher Grady, 'working with Component heads through the Deputy's Innovation Steering Group,&rdquo; to 'oversee the development of a Replicator 2 plan.&rdquo; Its execution will be led by the Defense Innovation Unit, working with the defense undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, the Pentagon's point person on counter-UAS systems. The service branches will handle development, production, and fielding of systems. The setup mimics the first Replicator effort, whose initial contracts were awarded earlier this year, one Defense Department official told Defense One. 'Most of the work that's already being done has been headed up by the Army and the Marine Corps,&rdquo; the official said. 'Where [the Deputy Defense Secretary and Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff] are going to be able to help is bring some of the department's capabilities to bear in terms of scaling things up, clearing up some policy issues and authorities issues, especially when it comes to counter-UAS in the United States.&rdquo; The official added, 'We can cut red tape and make things move.&rdquo; A number of offices already pursue anti-drone work, such as the Army-led Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and the Marine Corps' Capabilities Development Directorate. And Austin has made counter-drone defenses a special focus, launching a counter-UAS working group in March. U.S. forces regularly fight off drones in the Middle East. The Army faces drone attacks against its bases there; in February, three Americans were killed and more than 40 wounded by drones in Jordan. The Navy, meanwhile, frequently shoots down drones launched from Yemen. Some of the most powerful drones faced by U.S. forces are variants of Iran's Shahed-136, a large one-way attack drone that can fly at 114 miles per hour and carry 110 pounds of explosives. Such drones are less powerful than cruise and ballistic missiles, which carry hundreds of pounds of explosives or more and fly hundreds of miles an hour. However, with comparable ranges of over 600 miles, the Shahed and its ilk offer U.S. adversaries a way to hit far-off targets on the cheap: a single Shahed can cost under $50,000, a fraction of the multi-million-dollar price of a cruise missile. The Army has said that a layered approach of multiple weapons and sensors is necessary for taking down drones. It has also praised the performance of Raytheon's Coyote counter-drone system, which uses loitering munitions to take out incoming loitering munitions. In its recent unfunded-priorities list, the Army said a $185 million purchase of Coyote anti-drone systems was an item that just barely missed being included in the 2024 budget request. At $125,000 per system, prices will need to come down to match the cost of the Shahed-like drones attacking U.S. forces. One possible option is Ukrainian forces' use of cheap sensors and machine guns. While effective, this low-budget approach allows enemy drones to get so close that friendly forces can get showered with debris. Alternative methods include electronic warfare or even capturing drones, via nets. Both systems have been tried in Ukraine. But if Replicator 2 is aimed at fending off the kind of drones that have threatened U.S. forces in the Middle East, the effort is unlikely to focus on one of the dominant scourges of the Ukrainian battlefield: first-person-view loitering munitions. FPVs are less relevant in the Middle East where U.S. bases are generally hardened, an officer in the 10th Mountain Division, which handles counter-drone operations in Iraq, previously told Defense One. Tools to deal with these threats, by contrast, are typically more affordable than solutions needed for large loitering munitions like Shaheds. Systems used against FPVs and quadcopters include backpack-portable jammers, wearable drone detectors, and even shotguns. Replicator 1 update The memo also said the first stage of Replicator, which focused on fielding cost-effective drones, is 'on track&rdquo; to hit a goal of fielding systems by next summer. The department said AeroEnvironment's Switchblade 600 loitering munition system was part of the program, but did not identify others. The Switchblade 600 costs 'less than a Javelin anti-tank weapon,&rdquo; a company representative said, which costs around $80,000. Many observers of the Defense Department have hailed the Replicator effort as a way to break the Pentagon's general practice of buying complicated, expensive weapons. Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks has sought to show the importance of Replicator not just for acquiring new, cheaper, faster-to-build drone tech but reforming the way the Pentagon does all of its building and buying.

The D Brief: Israel kills Hezbollah chief; $600M for Taiwan; DOD’...	After killing Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Iran-backed Hezbollah, in an airstrike in Beirut on Friday, the Israeli military is keeping up its pressure on high-level terrorist leaders in the region, including two commanders from Hamas and Hezbollah targeted in additional airstrikes over the weekend. Allegedly killed: 'Fateh Sherif, Head of the Lebanon Branch in the Hamas terrorist organization,&rdquo; and 'The Commander of Hezbollah's Preventative Security Unit and a member of their Executive Council, Nabil Qaouk,&rdquo; according to the Israeli Defense Forces. 'Sherif was responsible for coordinating Hamas' terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives, as well as Hamas' efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons.&rdquo; As for Qaouk, 'He joined Hezbollah in the 1980s and was regarded as an important source of expertise in his field, having served as the Deputy Commander of the southern region on the Operational Council, Commander of the southern region and Deputy Commander of the Operational Council,&rdquo; the IDF announced on social media Monday and Sunday, respectively. Israel said Monday it also recently killed two Lebanon-based officials from the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Nidal Abdel-Aal and Imad Odeh. The IDF said 'Abdel-Aal took part in planning and carrying out terror attacks against Israel and directed terror activities in Judea and Samaria,&rdquo; and he 'directed the bus bombing attack in Beitar Illit on March 9, 2023, and the shooting attack from a passing vehicle at the Huwara Junction on March 25, 2023.&rdquo; Not much is known yet about Odeh. Parallel to this: 'Israeli special forces have been carrying out small, targeted raids into southern Lebanon, gathering intelligence and probing ahead of a possible broader ground incursion that could come as soon as this week,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing former Israeli military officials. Driving this strategy: 'Israel's government is under pressure to create a buffer zone to stop Hezbollah attacks that have forced some 60,000 people from their homes in the north and prevent the sort of cross-border attack that Hamas led against Israel on Oct. 7, which many in the country still fear. Hezbollah has threatened for years to invade parts of northern Israel,&rdquo; the Journal writes. About that Nasrallah strike: It was most likely carried out using '2,000-pound bombs, including the American-manufactured BLU-109 with a JDAM kit,&rdquo; the New York Times reported after analyzing video released by the Israeli military. 'These bombs, a type of munition known as bunker busters, can penetrate underground before detonating,&rdquo; the Times writes. According to Israel, Nasrallah and about 20 of his followers 'were in Hezbollah's central headquarters, located in the heart of Beirut, embedded beneath civilian buildings&rdquo; when they were killed. That building was just 53 meters from a United Nations-run school, the IDF said with an accompanying map.

On this day in 1938, UK Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain returned from Nazi Germany to announce a new agreement that he said guaranteed 'peace in our time.&rdquo; Spoiler alert: It did not. The Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen attacked Israel with a ballistic missile on Saturday. Israel's military confirmed the attack afterward, and said they intercepted it before it could strike the Ben Gurion International Airport. In response, Israeli jets bombed the Houthi port of Hodeida, on Yemen's western coast, on Sunday. The targets included 'power plants and a seaport, which were used by the Houthis to transfer Iranian weapons to the region, in addition to military supplies and oil,&rdquo; the Israeli Defense Forces said on social media. The IDF also released video of the strikes Monday. Worth noting: This is not a first for Israel. Their jets attacked alleged Houthi targets at Hodeidah back in July, for example. The Houthis also say they targeted three U.S. Navy vessels in the Red Sea on Friday using 23 missiles and drones. Those would possibly be from the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group. See what other U.S. assets are reportedly in the region via this map from conflict-watcher Ian Ellis. And in case you missed it, Iran is allegedly 'brokering talks to send advanced Russian missiles to Yemen's Houthis,&rdquo; Reuters reported last week. The missiles, known as P-800 Oniks, have a range of about 180 miles. Russia is known to have previously sent them to Hezbollah as well. Amid all the airstrikes and missile attacks, the Pentagon reminded the world Sunday it has the authorization to deploy troops at short notice. The U.S. military 'continues to maintain a significant amount of capability in the region and to dynamically adjust our force posture based on the evolving security situation,&rdquo; Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder said in a statement. POTUS: 'I directed my Secretary of Defense to further enhance the defense posture of U.S. military forces in the Middle East region to deter aggression and reduce the risk of a broader regional war,&rdquo; President Joe Biden said in his own statement Saturday. 'Ultimately, our aim is to de-escalate the ongoing conflicts in both Gaza and Lebanon through diplomatic means,&rdquo; he added. SecDef Austin has ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln to 'remain in the USCENTCOM theater and that the USS Wasp Amphibious Ready Group / Marine Expeditionary Unit will continue to operate in the Eastern Mediterranean,&rdquo; Ryder said. Next up: 'We will further reinforce our defensive air-support capabilities in the coming days,&rdquo; said Ryder, without elaborating. Elsewhere in the region, U.S. troops in Syria are under attack again from Iran-backed proxies, Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute noted on social media Monday. 'Though the attacks were small in scale, they illustrate a clear escalation that's unlikely to calm,&rdquo; he predicted. And CENTCOM announced Sunday that it killed 37 ISIS and AQ-linked fighters in Syria with targeted airstrikes last week (Sept. 24) and the week prior (on Sept. 16). Those strikes took place in central and northwestern Syria, and are believed to have killed Marwan Bassam 'Abd-al-Ra'uf, a senior leader of the al-Qaeda-linked Hurras al-Din militants. The other strike occurred in the early morning 'on a remote ISIS training camp in central Syria, killing at least 28 ISIS operatives, including at least four [unspecified] senior leaders,&rdquo; CENTCOM said in its statement Sunday.

Is the U.S. military learning enough from Ukraine? Relatively few analysts are working full-time to glean lessons from the war at the services' doctrine organizations, which appear to treat the grinding yet tech-forward war with NATO's top potential adversary as just one topic among many. Defense One's Sam Skove reports. Aerojet digging &lsquo;out of this hole' as it clears rocket backlog, president says. The L3Harris subsidiary, which was thousands of motors behind schedule last year, says its deliveries are catching up again, company president Ross Niebergall told Defense One's Audrey Decker in an interview. The U.S. quietly announced almost $600 million in more military aid to Taiwan, according to a short notice from the White House Sunday. The president said he's authorized 'the drawdown of up to $567 million in defense articles and services of the Department of Defense, and military education and training&rdquo; for Taiwan&mdash;but there are no more details than that. For what it's worth: 'Taipei has complained of delayed U.S. arms deliveries, including for upgraded F-14 fighter jets,&rdquo; Reuters noted Sunday. An unprecedented media report from Diego Garcia. Few, if any, outsiders have set foot on the 12-square-mile atoll since the mid-1970s, when its inhabitants were deported so the U.S. and UK could build what has become a key logistics and bomber base in the Indian Ocean. (One of your D Brief-ers is among the many journalists so rebuffed.) But after months of effort, the BBC's Alice Cuddy obtained a court order compelling the militaries to allow her a five-day visit to cover a migrant-asylum case. They did so, grudgingly. 'But despite the constraints, I was still able to observe illuminating details, all of which helped to paint a picture of one of the most restricted locations in the world,&rdquo; Cuddy writes.

Is the US military learning enough from Ukraine?	The U.S. military speaks frequently about the lessons they're learning from the war in Ukraine. The Air Force has sought to evaluate the Ukrainian military's methods for detecting drones, while the Army has revamped training, fielded new drones, and re-evaluated its artillery stockpiles based on observations of the nearly three-year-old hot war there. The Army's various analytic outlets have produced report after report by officers, intelligence analysts, and academics on the conflict. But at some of the military's key centers for studying warfare, the services appear to treat the grinding yet tech-forward war with NATO's top potential adversary as just one topic among many. Few analysts are tasked to study the war full-time, according to a Defense One review of service staffing. The Joint Chiefs of Staff Joint Lessons Learned Division, which helps spread findings among the services, has no 'working groups or individuals&rdquo; who focus solely on Ukraine, a spokesman said. At the Army's Center for Lessons Learned, or CALL, four analysts on two teams focus on Ukraine, a spokesperson said in July. That's out of the roughly 45 analysts the center employs. A review of the reports on CALL's public-facing website showed few that exclusively cover lessons from Ukraine. At least one report focused on lessons from the command posts gleaned from a Ukrainian military manual. The spokesperson said CALL also interviews Ukrainian soldiers and commanders. Other services appear to devote fewer resources to gleaning lessons from the Ukraine war. The Air Force's Curtis E. LeMay Center, which develops air doctrine, has no single analyst dedicated to Ukraine, a spokesperson said in August. A spokesperson for the center said that 'every member of our organization&rdquo; has worked on assessing lessons from Ukraine, and said the center had worked with other organizations on more than five efforts focused on Ukraine. The Marine Corps likewise does not have a central body for exclusively evaluating lessons learned from Ukraine, a spokesperson said, although there are groups that study the war alongside other topics. The Corps has conducted four research efforts that sought to collect lessons learned from the war and will hold a follow-on study in fiscal year 2025. The spokesperson said that the Corps has not directly interviewed Ukrainian military personnel, relying instead on other services and U.S. allies and partners to gather first-hand information. The picture from the Navy is hazier. The service was not able to describe their approach after queries were sent in July and September. Public affairs officers were not able to provide updates by the time of publication. Answers may yet be forthcoming. In April, the Defense Department's Inspector General announced it would audit the Defense Department's success in studying and applying lessons from the war to 'doctrine, planning, training, and equipping.&rdquo; The announcement of a study is not necessarily evidence that the Defense Department has made a misstep. The Inspector General has not yet released its report. Some Army officers have argued that observations from the war, while useful, are not always relevant to the U.S. military, which expects to fight with multi-service operations backed by highly trained soldiers funded by a military budget many times Ukraine's gross domestic product. 'If you look at the fight that's going on in Ukraine, you've got a large Soviet army fighting a small Soviet army, right? That is defensive-oriented, [artillery]-oriented.&rdquo; said 101st Airborne Division commander Maj. Gen. Brett Sylvia in an August interview. 'That's not our fight.&rdquo; Anthony Tingle, formerly a program director at the Air Force Academy's the Institute for Future Conflict and now an independent researcher who has spent time in Ukraine, said he could not say whether the Army's four analysts were sufficient. CALL could be working with other academic institutions to analyze the war, he said. However, any U.S. observations of the war are ultimately limited by the U.S. military's minimal presence in Ukraine, said Tingle. 'How many U.S. government employees have been to Donbass recording the electromagnetic spectrum or sitting down with the drone operators to say, &lsquo;Well, okay, how do they frequency-hop? How do they try to thwart our drones?&rdquo; said Tingle. 'This is all stuff we're gonna have to relearn the first week of a war with anybody.&rdquo; The U.S. has repeatedly said it will not send military advisors to Ukraine, and maintains an even smaller presence in Kyiv than before the war. The Defense Department also maintains travel restrictions within Ukraine that prevent at least some staff from getting within a certain distance of the front line, according to a January report from the Inspector General. The academic community is similarly limited in the analysis it can provide, Tingle added, saying the number of academics with experience on the frontline was in the single digits. Tingle believes the military branches are at least partially writing off the conflict based on assumptions that the U.S. would not struggle with the same types of problems as Ukraine, such as establishing air dominance over Russia. Those assumptions may be true, Tingle said, but that doesn't mean the war has nothing to teach. 'There are lessons about modern warfare in general that we are not getting because of that attitude.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/us-military-learning-enough-ukraine/399893/	2024-09-29T05:00:00-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/27/Ukrainian_soldiers_i_2500/large.jpg
Aerojet digging ‘out of this hole’ as it clears rocket backlog, p...	When L3Harris Technologies bought Aerojet Rocketdyne for $4.7 billion last year, the rocket-motor-builder was thousands of motors behind schedule. Now, just over a year into the acquisition, Aerojet says it's getting back on track. The company has previously struggled to deliver solid rocket motors for key weapons, frustrating customers like Lockheed Martin and RTX. Although the company reported progress in delivery rates over the past year, RTX officials said this summer that it's still a 'mixed bag&rdquo; when getting on-time deliveries. 'I don't blame the primes for still kind of being in that &lsquo;show me' mode, where they're waiting for us to absolutely demonstrate consistently that we're delivering,&rdquo; Ross Niebergall, president of Aerojet Rocketdyne, said in an interview. The company has made strides to improve delivery times, Niebergall said. Last year, Aerojet was 'thousands of motors behind contract,&rdquo; across 15 to 20 programs, he said. But they've cut that in half, and project a 60-percent reduction by the end of the year. 'On several of those programs that we call &lsquo;red,' the ones that we were behind on, we've actually now achieved multiple months of record deliveries on these programs. So I think we're in a pretty good clip to dig ourselves out of this hole. Obviously, still more work to do, but I think we're on the right track,&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] The challenges facing Aerojet's 'red programs&rdquo; mainly come down to getting components from sub-tier suppliers, like cases, nozzles, igniters, and valves, Niebergall said. They've found single points of failure in the supply chain, he said, so the company has invested over $25 million into smaller companies to boost production. Northrop Grumman, the other main U.S. supplier of solid rocket motors, uses the same sub-tier supplier for many products so 'we're all tapping into that supply chain to a great extent,&rdquo; Niebergall said. Northrop and the L3Harris subsidiary have been the only two companies producing rocket motors in the U.S., but with new entrants breaking into the business, like Ursa Major and X-Bow Systems, and prime contractors hunting for their own supply of SRMs, like the recent teaming agreement between Lockheed and General Dynamics, the competition field may expand in the coming years. Niebergall said Aerojet is bracing for stronger competition by 'making sure that we get back on track&rdquo; and meet its commitments to customers. But he also said it will be a while before any of these new companies will rival his own. 'Overall, I think that we have to recognize that creating one or two solid rocket motors or a low production rate may not be all that challenging, but as you get into very large production, this doesn't happen overnight, and it's going to take a while and ultimately, it's a fairly significant investment as well,&rdquo; he said. Demand for solid rocket motors has skyrocketed over the past two years as wars have depleted many countries' weapons stockpiles. Now that more companies are jumping into the market, it remains to be seen whether demand will be sufficient for the companies to thrive. 'Ultimately, the strong will be the ones who survive and right now, I'm still in a wait-and-see mode on that, quite honestly. There's been a lot of attention to the industry. A lot of new entrants have jumped into it. We'll just have to see how demand plays out. Supplementals, as a result of Ukraine and Israel, have certainly had a short-term impact on the industry. But how does this settle out in the long term, as we continue to pivot to peer threats?&rdquo; Niebergall said. Last year, Aerojet received $216 million from the Defense Department through the Defense Production Act to expand and modernize its facilities in Arkansas, Alabama, and Virginia to increase the production of rocket motors for key weapons systems being sent to Ukraine, like the Javelin, Stinger, and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System. With the funding, Aerojet will build additional facilities in Camden, Arkansas, and Orange County, Virginia. The applications for environmental approvals are 'nearing completion,&rdquo; officials said. The Huntsville, Alabama, location is focused on inert production&mdash;that is, cases, nozzles, and other parts that aren't explosive. Aerojet recently leased an additional facility in Huntsville to triple its working space, Niebergall said. Aerojet doesn't have a specific date for when all these new buildings will come online, he said, but added: 'We're already ramping up production as a result of the [Defense Production Act] and I would say that that is going to continue, really, over the next year-plus, as we get completion of that project.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/aerojet-digging-out-hole-it-clears-rocket-backlog-president-says/399905/	2024-09-27T12:32:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/27/GettyImages_1235564512/large.jpg
The D Brief: SECDEF on subs; Shipyard sabotage?; US, Ukraine ‘mis...	SECDEF in London: U.S. is making progress on boosting submarine production. 'What I'm seeing is that we're investing in the right things, and we will be able to expand the capacity going forward and to meet our objectives,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday after meeting his UK and Australian counterparts to discuss the trilateral AUKUS defense-technology pact. Austin was answering a question put to Australian Deputy Defense Prime Minister Richard Marles, who declined to say whether Australia was worried that U.S. shipyards&mdash;already years behind on U.S. orders&mdash;would be able to supply the three Virginia-class attack boats promised to his country under AUKUS. The U.S. has plans to spend up to $17.5 billion over five years to boost sub construction, including up to $4 billion routed through third parties Deloitte and BlueForce Alliance. (As it happens, $17.5 billion is the current estimated price tag for the first Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine; it's also close to one estimate for the Navy's total projected cost overrun for sub-building efforts through 2030.) Australia will make its first payment of $3 billion next year, two-thirds of which the U.S. will put toward the 16,000 American companies that make parts for submarines, a defense official said ahead of the meeting. Defense One's Lauren C. Williams reports from London, here. Shipyard sabotage? A leading U.S. shipyard found faulty welds in submarines and aircraft carriers with 'early indication that some of the welding errors were intentional,&rdquo; USNI News reported Thursday, citing a Tuesday memo from Navy acquisition chief Nickolas Guertin to the Navy secretary and chief of naval operations. Newport News Shipbuilding reported the welds to the Justice Department, which has declined immediate comment. Read on, here. And: a new Chinese sub sank pierside earlier this year. That's the word from 'a senior U.S. defense official,&rdquo; who told reporters that the Zhao, the first of a class of nuclear-powered attack submarines, sank alongside a pier sometime between May and June. Here's a photo of the purported sunk sub at a shipyard near Wuhan, taken by Planet Labs and published by the Wall Street Journal, which has more, here.

And if you're not already subscribed, you can do that here. On this day in 1944, the U.S. Army Air Force suffered its largest loss from a single mission during WWII after a navigational error separated a bomber group from its fighter escort. In a very short period of time, Nazi pilots shot down 31 U.S. B-24 Liberator bombers and one P-51 Mustang, killing 118 Americans. The New Zealand, Australian and Japanese navies transited the Taiwan Strait together on Wednesday and were followed by five Chinese navy vessels in a 'pincer-style maneuver,&rdquo; according to Taiwan's RW News and the BBC. Why it matters: 'For decades the US Pacific fleet was the only foreign navy that regularly transited the strait,&rdquo; the BBC reports. 'But recently, it was joined by Canada and Australia, Britain and France. [And] Two weeks ago Germany sailed two navy ships through the strait for the first time in decades.&rdquo; Taiwan, meanwhile, has seen 84 Chinese aircraft flying around the self-governing island over the past two days. 'This is a very notable increase in activity compared to the previous week,&rdquo; said regional observer Ben Lewis. Sixty-six of those aircraft crossed over the median line, entering Taiwan's northern, central, southwestern, and eastern ADIZ. Update: The Navy's USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier visited Guam recently, as the crew's staff noted in a timelapse video on social media Friday. The Roosevelt, based out of San Diego, had been in the Middle East in support of and in defense of commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea between June and August. ATACMS? U.S. intelligence officials think the risks aren't worth the rewards when it comes to authorizing Ukraine's use of long-range weapons to hit military targets inside Russia, the New York Times reported Thursday. Despite the nearly $8 billion in U.S. support for Ukraine announced Thursday, the two countries are still missing 'consensus on a strategy to end this war on terms favorable to Ukraine,&rdquo; said John Hardie of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington. 'The disagreement over missile strikes in Russia is a symptom of this disconnect,&rdquo; he added. To that end, Ukraine's president says he 'shared the details of the Victory Plan with Vice President Kamala Harris&rdquo; Thursday at the White House, seeming to confirm what Ukrainian officials teased late last week as Zelenskyy was traveling to the U.S. 'It is very important for us to be fully understandable and work in full coordination with the United States,&rdquo; he wrote on social media. By the way: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Zelenskyy's so-called victory plan did not impress White House officials who saw it as 'little more than a repackaged request for more weapons and the lifting of restrictions on long-range missiles.&rdquo; New: Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump in New York City, following days of rumors the meeting might or might not happen. The former U.S. president told reporters afterward he had a 'very good relationship&rdquo; with the Ukrainian leader. He noted quickly afterward, 'I also have a very good relationship with President Putin.&rdquo; According to the Guardian, 'Zelenskyy immediately responded to Trump's comments about his positive relationship with Putin, and said that he hopes that he and Trump have a better relationship than the one between Putin and Trump.&rdquo; Rewind: Trump was impeached in 2020 for withholding aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extort political dirt from Zelenskyy. He was impeached again in 2021 for his role in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. On Thursday, Trump lied about that latter episode on social media, claiming he'd dispatched National Guard troops to respond to the insurrection; he did not in fact dispatch the Guard, according to congressional investigators. This afternoon in Washington: Top Army acquisition official Doug Bush joins Gen. James Rainey of Army Futures Command to discuss the evolving nature of drones in service. That conversation will be moderated by Cynthia Cook of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. You can stream that online at 3 p.m. ET. Details, here. And lastly this week: Recall a naval era long past with this almost-anachronistic video of the recent Thames River transit of Spanish galleon Andaluc&iacute;a beneath London's Tower Bridge on Monday. 'The ship is a replica of the famous 15th century ship that was part of the galleons used by the Spanish to explore America and parts of Asia up until the 18th century,&rdquo; wrote south London's Sutton & Croydon Guardian local newspaper. 'The ship will be docked at St Katharine Docks from September 24 to October 6, with visitors able to go aboard the ship,&rdquo; the paper reports. 'Tickets are priced at &pound;12 for adults, &pound;6 for children and &pound;30 for a family of 5.&rdquo; You can read more from the company responsible for building the vessel, which has been used in several films and commercials.

Is Australia worried about US submarine production? Over to you, ...	LONDON&mdash;When defense chiefs from the U.S., UK and Australia met reporters after their AUKUS meeting here on Thursday, they touted an agreement to share a submarine-hunting torpedo. But when asked whether Australia was concerned about the U.S. ability to produce its promised submarines, Australian Deputy Defense Prime Minister Richard Marles had little to say. Instead, he deferred to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'First of all, in terms of our ability to meet the production objectives, of course we're concerned about that, and that's why we're investing more in the submarine industrial base, so that they can continue to expand capacity and place our efforts on a ramp that ensures that we can meet the objectives,&rdquo; said Austin, who added that he has met with U.S. industry leaders to talk about how they're using new funds intended to boost the submarine industrial base. 'What I'm seeing is that we're investing in the right things, and we will be able to expand the capacity going forward and to meet our objectives.&rdquo; U.S. shipyards are up to three years behind on orders, according to a recent U.S. Navy study, which has cast some doubt on their ability to backfill the U.S. end of an agreement to sell Australia three Virginia-class submarines&mdash;with an option for two more&mdash;in the next decade. The sub purchase is part of the three-year-old U.S.-UK-Australia agreement known as AUKUS, an effort to foster cooperative technology development. Australia has committed to an initial payment of $3 billion&mdash;perhaps one percent of the total it expects to spend to buy, support, and eventually build its own nuclear subs through the 2050s. That $3 billion is expected to start flowing next year into a special U.S. Treasury account, and the U.S. intends to invest two-thirds of it in its submarine industrial base, a senior U.S. military official told reporters ahead of the meeting. The money&mdash;alongside the $17.5 billion the U.S. has committed over five years to improve its submarine production&mdash;won't go to shipbuilders directly. Instead, it will fund six areas that will produce 'maximum return on investment&rdquo; in the 16,000 companies that form the submarine industrial base. 'Things that take a long time in terms of infrastructure, in terms of long-lead items, in terms of vendor uplift, in terms of overall supply base management,&rdquo; the official said. Getting the bulk of those funds upfront will 'allow us to maximize the return on investment such that when we're at the point in the 2030s to where we are selling ships, that we're back at the appropriate cadence. The Australians have helped us re-achieve the appropriate cadence, along with our congressional partnerships that have put a substantial amount of support behind that,&rdquo; the official said. It's not clear that the cadence has been re-achieved just yet. In recent years, U.S. submarine production has failed to meet the demands of its own Navy, largely due to supply chain problems and a dwindling trained workforce. It's a conundrum that has prompted the Navy to back splashy advertising campaigns and free training courses. Unusually, the Pentagon and Navy have committed up to $4 billion to two third-party firms&mdash;the consulting giant Deloitte and the nonprofit startup BlueForge Alliance&mdash;that have been hired to boot sub-building into a higher gear. AUKUS progress On Thursday, the defense chiefs also announced an agreement to equip all three nations' sub-hunting P-8 maritime patrol jets with Sting Ray torpedoes. John Healey, the UK's defense secretary, also said the UK agreed to keep training Australian sailors on how to use and maintain nuclear submarines, and to continue negotiating with Australia on their own bilateral treaty to bolster the AUKUS agreement. 'After the first course of 250 Australians was completed this month, and as part of that work, I can announce that Deputy Prime Minister Marles and I have agreed that negotiations will soon be underway for a new bilateral treaty to bind our AUKUS collaboration into law. This not only reflects our commitment to secure a secure Indo-Pacific region where international rules are respected. It also sends a very strong message that our defense alliance is one that will endure for many decades to come,&rdquo; Healey said. This agreement, if finalized, will foster submarine production plans between Australia and the UK as the two nations work to develop the SSN-AUKUS type submarine. Marles said Australia has already obtained a site for his country's future sub-building yard. 'In South Australia, we have seen land swaps take place with the South Australian government, such that we now have the site on which a production line will be established to build the future nuclear-powered submarines in Australia, the AUKUS variant, a variant that we will operate in tandem with the United Kingdom,&rdquo; he said. Marles also noted last month's work done in Perth on the Virginia-class submarine USS Hawaii, the first time a U.S. nuclear attack sub has been maintained outside the U.S. or an American base, and by non-U.S. citizens. 'All of this is happening under the banner of the AUKUS arrangement,&rdquo; he said. Last year, the U.S. and British defense leaders announced plans to increase deployments of SSNs to Australia starting in 2027, and to embed Australian military and civilian workers in the American and UK industrial bases. Those plans are all on track, Marles said. 'The very first step in what we announced in March of last year was an increased tempo of visits of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. That is happening. The submarine rotational force west, which will take place from 2027, is on track. And we are working very closely with both our partners, along with the Western Australian government, to see that that is happening as well,&rdquo; Marles said. Each of the defense leaders touted the submarine training as a progressing initiative. Australia has sent hundreds of sailors to the UK and U.S. nuclear-power schools to learn about how to operate undersea vessels in the future. The nation is also funding universities to add 4,000 slots for AUKUS-related disciplines, 'to make sure that we are building the skills that are needed to deliver this project,&rdquo; Marles said. Healey stressed the technical complexity that goes into building a submarine, which contributes to how long they take to build&mdash;and makes the early steps each nation takes critical. 'This is the, perhaps the most complex engineering and technologies on the planet, but there is an imperative to see every day counts. Because it's what we do now&mdash;and in the weeks and months ahead now&mdash;that will determine whether or not, to time, towards the end of the 2030s, the first AUKUS submarines are built and put into operation,&rdquo; Healey said. 'And in our discussions, that theme ran throughout: timescales are tough, but they are essential. And that together, we are absolutely determined that we will deliver.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/australia-worried-about-us-submarine-production-over-you-secdef/399882/	2024-09-27T07:05:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/27/A_sailor_aboard_the_2500/large.jpg
The Army wants to roboticize forklifts	Add forklift operator to the list of jobs that might soon fall to machines. The Army Applications Laboratory is working on a way to convert just about any human-driven forklift to autonomous operation. 'When you think about a potential future conflict and the amount of supplies that are going to have to flow from the [United States] and allied partners to places forward, it's going to be immense,&rdquo; Casey Perley, executive director of the Army Applications Laboratory, said this week during a Defense One Genius Machines broadcast. 'One of the things we're looking at is autonomy for forklifts. So essentially, how can they work in pairs where one forklift loads the other; they both go to where you're dropping it off, you drop it off, you go back for more.&rdquo; A few companies sell autonomous forklifts, but Perley said what the Army really needs is a way to convert the ones it already has. 'This type of technology is designed to not be, like, vendor- or model-specific on the forklift; it's designed to work with multiple types of systems. So the idea being: you invest in the AI and the autonomy versus a whole lot of hardware, and then you can just take that AI and autonomy and put it on different systems.&rdquo; The lab has hired a company called TracksNA to develop the self-operating forklift software. In late October, soldiers and engineers will get together to run forklifts through their paces. Such 'touchpoints&rdquo; are critical to building the brains for robotic forklifts, she said. It's not like autonomous vehicles on streets which can all access similar data repositories. The training of robot forklifts requires a lot of interaction with human operators. 'The more of these [touchpoint opportunities] you get in the Army, and the more [repetitions] that our soldiers can get with them, the more we're going to learn the types of experiences we are going to need to train these forklifts, the type of data that we're going to need to ensure is fed into the models. So that is why soldier touchpoints are so critically important, is it really teaches us the type of stuff we're going to need to teach the vehicles.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/army-wants-roboticize-forklifts/399879/	2024-09-26T16:35:46-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/GettyImages_2150166810/large.jpg
Increased efforts, lower goal help Army end recruiting slump	The Army beat its recruiting goal this year through a combination of lowered targets and increased efforts, after failing to hit higher goals in 2022 and 2023. The service recruited 55,300 soldiers against a goal of 55,000 in fiscal 2024, the service said Thursday. The service also saw 11,000 people commit to enlist in fiscal year 2025 under the Delayed Entry Program, more than double last year's total. The service also enlisted 6,000 more soldiers in specialties it deems critical this year compared to last, said U.S. Army Recruiting Command chief, Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, speaking at a Thursday media roundtable. Last year&mdash;fiscal 2023&mdash;the service recruited 50,181 soldiers against a 'stretch goal&rdquo; of 65,000, as Army Secretary Christine Wormuth put it, with 4,611 signing up for deferred entry. At the time, the Army presented the Delayed Entry Program numbers as part of its overall recruiting contracts, leading to reporting that the Army had hit 55,000 contracts. In 2022, the Army recruited 44,901 new members, well short of its goal of 60,000. The Army's press release did not say why the service sought 55,000 recruits in 2024 after seeking 60,000 and 65,000 in previous years. But the lowered target comes as the service works to consolidate undermanned formations created by past recruiting shortfalls. The Army has blamed poor recruiting numbers in part on the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as more prosaic issues like obesity, a strong U.S. economy, and the failure to meet the Army's drug policy. One major contributor to this year's success was the Army's 'Future Soldier Preparatory Course,&rdquo; a two-year-old initiative to prepare prospective soldiers for the Army's required physical and academic tests. In fiscal year 2024, 13,206 soldiers passed from the course to basic training. The course has taken over 28,000 recruits since it was launched, with over 90 percent of those recruits graduating, said Brig. Gen. Jennifer Walkawicz of Army Training and Doctrine Command. The Army expanded the course earlier this year, adding a total of four training companies. Other measures included a major new recruiting campaign that revived an 80's-era slogan, 'Be All You Can Be,&rdquo; which launched in March 2023. The Army also temporarily increased medical personnel at intake centers to make the onboarding process more efficient, according to an Army press release. The Army announced structural reforms to recruiting last October. New initiatives include establishing recruiting as a separate military occupational specialty, creating a recruitment experimentation group, and setting a goal to rely less on high-school recruiting. In August, the Army graduated its first class of recruiters under the new specialty. The service also launched an AI program in the last two months to identify potential recruits. Army leaders were cautious about declaring an end to their recruiting struggles, though. 'We're going to have to kind of keep fighting hard for our new recruits,&rdquo; said Wormuth, citing low employment and an expected decrease in the population as factors working against Army recruiters.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/increased-efforts-lower-goal-help-army-end-recruiting-slump/399870/	2024-09-26T13:16:07-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/U.S._Army_soldiers_w_2500/large.jpg
Companies that left Russia after 2022 invasion saw reputation boo...	Western companies that pulled out of Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022&mdash;even ones that hesitated&mdash;have generally seen their reputations rise, according to a new study that suggests that firms can use geopolitical crises to burnish their brands. Firms with strong environmental, social, and governance reputations saw more pronounced net buzz, according to Shankar Ganesan from the University of Notre Dame and Girish Mallapragada from Indiana University, whose paper went online in March and will appear in the forthcoming edition of the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing. The authors conclude that companies known for ethical governance were rewarded more when they aligned their actions with those values. Interestingly, the study also uncovered that companies who hesitated, then pulled out after public pressure weren't penalized for their cold feet. Firms that withdrew from Russia after their peers also saw increases in net buzz, meaning that the decision to exit later&mdash;rather than being seen as reactive or reluctant&mdash;helped them maintain or even boost public support. In short, it always pays to do the right thing even if it seems frightening at first. The concept of 'doing the right thing&rdquo; also ties into national security. In an era of great state competition, as outlined in the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy, the global reputation of U.S. firms is linked to perceptions of American leadership and values. Companies looking to sell dual-use technologies to the government and consumer, for example, may find that their standing with both the public and government stakeholders depends on how their corporate actions align with ethical governance&mdash;particularly in regions where political conflict and public scrutiny are high. 'Our findings highlight that corporate decisions made in response to geopolitical crises, such as withdrawing from Russia, do not occur in isolation,&rdquo; Ganesan told Defense One in an email. 'As U.S. companies face growing competition from Chinese firms, which may not adhere to the same geopolitical or ethical standards, the reputational benefits of socially responsible actions become even more pronounced. While firms from China and Russia may prioritize short-term economic gains, U.S. companies that align with stakeholder values, especially in the context of ESG, are likely to enjoy longer-term consumer loyalty and trust. This differentiation not only strengthens U.S. corporate positioning but also reinforces the country's broader strategic objectives of promoting democracy, human rights, and global stability in competition with non-democratic regimes.' Another conclusion is that these sorts of moves pay off much more in situations where the conflict is broadly known and understood by the public. As the authors note in their paper, 'If a conflict garners significant international attention, like the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war, the impact on brand buzz and consumer perceptions could follow patterns observed in this study. Second, the severity and scale of conflict could also matter. Firms' actions might elicit strong consumer reactions in situations as severe and impactful as the Russia&ndash;Ukraine conflict. However, the reactions may be less intense or clear-cut in less pronounced conflicts.&rdquo; This is where the Biden administration's response to the Ukraine conflict becomes significant. By declassifying intelligence and publicly revealing Russia's invasion plans, the U.S. government helped shape global public opinion and build a coalition of democratic allies to support Ukraine.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/companies-left-russia-after-2022-invasion-saw-reputation-boost-study-shows/399865/	2024-09-26T12:07:22-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: New bomb for Ukraine; Congress averts shutdown; Army...	White House's race against the clock on Ukraine aid: President Joe Biden says he's routing some $7.9 billion in military support to Ukraine, including $5.5 billion in congressionally-authorized funds that are set to expire if not accessed by the end of the month. That also includes a $2.4 billion commitment to buy weapons from American manufacturers (instead of reducing U.S. military stockpiles) as well as money to help build up Ukraine's defense industrial base, the president said in a statement Thursday. And in a new first, Biden authorized Ukraine's use of the Joint Standoff Weapon long-range munition as part of a $375 million arms package announced Wednesday by the Defense Department. The JSOW weapons are also known as glide bombs. They have a range of around 75 miles, and can be launched from the F-16s now flown by some of Ukraine's pilots, ABC News reported Wednesday. He also wants to send Ukraine another Patriot air defense battery, which Biden said 'builds on my decision earlier this year to divert U.S. air defense exports to Ukraine&rdquo; ahead of other customers around the world. And Biden authorized expanded training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, adding 18 training slots for 2025. 'My message is clear: The United States will provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war,&rdquo; the president said. One catch for that nearly $6 billion set to expire on Monday: 'The U.S. won't be allowed to introduce new types of equipment that haven't been in previous shipments,&rdquo; Politico reported Wednesday with the fine print. Not included in these new announcements: Permission to attack targets inside Russia using U.S.-provided weapons, which Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy has been requesting for several months as his troops occupy a small foothold in Russia's western Kursk region. Zelenskyy thanked Biden and 'both parties, Republicans and Democrats, as well as the entire American people&hellip;for finding a way to allocate the remaining security assistance to Ukraine and ensure that the Presidential authority is not expired by the end of the US financial year,&rdquo; he wrote on social media Thursday. Additional reading: 'Meet Bradley, the U.S. Army Veteran Ukrainian Soldiers Love,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday; 'UK weapon stockpiles &lsquo;threadbare' after arming Ukraine,&rdquo; the British Times reported Wednesday. Elsewhere in Washington: GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson told Zelenskyy to 'immediately fire&rdquo; his U.S. ambassador because the Ukrainian president visited an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Sunday. The House Speaker made his demand in a Wednesday letter to Zelenskyy, arguing that the visit 'in a politically contested battleground state&rdquo; was 'clearly election interference.&rdquo; The GOP-led House Oversight Committee also said it's opened an investigation into the Scranton trip. The visit 'was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican,&rdquo; Johnson said in his letter. 'Additionally, as I have clearly stated in the past, all foreign nations should avoid opining on or interfering in American domestic politics,&rdquo; the House Speaker wrote. Worth noting: Zelenskyy visited Utah's Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in July. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited former President Trump at his resort in Mar-a-Lago in late July and Johnson similarly had no objections. Nor did Johnson object when Hungary's far-right Viktor Orban visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago immediately after the NATO summit in mid-July. Meanwhile, Trump said Wednesday the Ukrainian people are 'dead&rdquo; and the country is 'demolished&rdquo; as he addressed voters at a campaign stop in North Carolina. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,&rdquo; GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said, according to the Associated Press. 'If they made a bad deal [that is, not fighting back] it would've been much better,&rdquo; he said. 'They would've given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years,&rdquo; Trump said, and claimed, 'What deal can we make? It's demolished. The people are dead. The country is in rubble.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Republicans follow Trump's lead of icing out Zelensky,&rdquo; CNN reported Wednesday; 'Anti-U.S. axis divided over Trump vs. Harris,&rdquo; Axios reported Thursday; 'How Russia's RT went from a cable news clone to covert operator,&rdquo; NPR reported Thursday; 'Russian Missiles Strike Kyiv for 5 Hours Hitting Ukraine's Power Grid,&rdquo; Newsweek reported Thursday; And 'Putin proposes new rules for using nuclear weapons,&rdquo; the BBC reported Thursday; for some clear-eyed expert reax, try nuclear policy researcher Fabian Hoffmann.

On this day in 1931, the keel of USS Ranger (CV-4), the first American purpose-built aircraft carrier, was laid down in Newport News, Virginia. Lawmakers avert a shutdown, for now. The U.S. government will now stay open at least through Dec. 20 under the stopgap funding bill passed Wednesday in both the House and the Senate, which gives Congress until then to pass funding bills for the 2025 fiscal year that begins in five days. Also included: $231 million for the Secret Service following the two recent assassination attempts on Trump. The bill passed the lower chamber in a 341-82 vote, with Speaker Johnson needing the support of 209 Democrats with 132 Republicans to advance the measure. It then advanced through the upper chamber in a 78-18 vote. Additional reading: 'How every senator voted on the stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown,&rdquo; via the Washington Post. New: The U.S. Army finally reached its yearly recruiting goal, officials announced Thursday in a razor-thin confirmation of what Army leaders said they were anticipating in April. The service added 55,300 new soldiers during the current fiscal year, which ends in just five days; that's 300 above the Army's target for FY24. That total includes 12,000 soldiers processed through a preparatory course designed to assist volunteers who do not initially meet all the requirements to enlist. Reminder: The Army failed to meet its recruiting goals for the last two years as the service (and the world) gradually emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. (The Navy and Air Force also fell short in 2023.) Trendspotting: 'We're seeing an increase in the enlistment age,&rdquo; one official said Thursday. That shows how the service has looked beyond the typical high school graduate to Americans working in the private sector. That includes outreach to digital job boards, for example, and emphasizing benefits like the G.I. Bill, officials said. ICYMI: The Army is advancing its ground robot plans after awarding Rheinmetall and HDT a contract to make a robotic transport vehicle for small units on Tuesday. Breaking Defense has more. Also: The INDOPACOM commander recently met with his Chinese counterpart. Defense One's Jennifer Hlad interviewed Adm. Samuel Paparo at the recent Indo-Pacific Chiefs of Defense Conference in Hawaii. Read, here. Lastly today: Officials tout AI-powered sub-hunting as AUKUS defense chiefs converge. A collaborative, AI-powered effort to hunt enemy submarines shows that AUKUS is working, U.S. defense officials said ahead of a meeting of the U.S., UK, and Australian defense chiefs in London. 'It's a change in how we do things and how we're doing it with allies and partners,&rdquo; a defense official said Tuesday at the Pentagon. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in London for a Thursday meeting with his counterparts to review progress and planning for various tech-development projects, just days after the three-year anniversary of the trilateral defense-cooperation pact. Defense One's Lauren C. Williams, who is traveling with the secretary, filed this report.
