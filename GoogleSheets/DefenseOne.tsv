Biden allows Ukraine to use ATACMS to strike Russia	Ukraine can now use long-range ATACMS missiles for some strikes inside Russia, the Biden administration said Sunday, a development that Ukrainians had been seeking for years. Administration officials told The New York Times the missiles would 'likely&rdquo; first be used against Russian and North Korean forces battling Ukrainians in Kursk, but noted that Biden may allow them to be used elsewhere. Army Tactical Missile System missiles, or ATACMS, were one of many weapons Ukraine requested at the outset of Russia's 2022 attack on Ukraine. The missiles, which can be fired from High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HIMARS, can fly as far as 190 miles, potentially allowing Ukraine to strike Russian resupply routes or even Moscow. The United States has supplied HIMARS since the first few months of the war, but has been reluctant to provide the longer-range ATACMS, saying it could prompt Russia to escalate hostilities. Russian doctrine allows for the country's military to treat a threat to the capital or even a supply route far from the border as 'existential,&rdquo; and Russian officials had said even giving Ukrainians the missiles&mdash;much less allowing them for targets inside Russia&mdash;was a 'red line.&rdquo; However, in March, Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. C.Q. Brown said the risk of escalation was 'not as high,&rdquo; and that same month, the White House began to send some of the longer-range missiles to Ukraine&mdash;albeit with strict limits on their use. [[Related Posts]] The Institute for the Study of War published a series of maps to illustrate how the White House restrictions have hampered Ukraine's ability to target Russian forces that were directly attacking Ukraine. The decision to loosen those restrictions comes after reports that North Korea may send as many as 100,000 troops to Russia to fight Ukrainians, and after Russia launched a brutal missile assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and other targets. 'Reminder that there are hundreds of valid, legal, legitimate, and operationally consequential military targets in range of Ukrainian ATACMS. The Biden Administration's shift to allow ATACMS use in Russia is a good thing, but it must extend beyond Kursk Oblast,&rdquo; George Barros, leader of the Russia team and GEOINT team at the Institute, said on X. Andriy Zagorodnyuk, a former Ukrainian defense minister, told The Financial Times that ATACMS will greatly improve Ukraine's ability to strike Russian forces as they prepare to attack Ukraine: 'There are targets which can only be addressed by high payload missiles such as ATACMS or equivalent aerial missiles. This is, of course, a decision giving Ukraine troops a chance, though as with many previous decisions, coming after a significant and extremely painful delay.&rdquo; The move also follows a decision by the French and British governments to allow Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with SCALP/Storm Shadow missiles, according to La Figaro. It also signals a shift in Washington's risk calculus&mdash;a shift that many, like Zagorodnyuk, argue should have come sooner. Rep. Roger Wicker, the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is one of several Republicans who have been pressuring the administration for more than a year to give Ukraine the missiles and lift the restrictions. 'If initial press reports are true, I am encouraged at the prospect of allowing Ukraine to use long-range ATACM missiles supplied by the U.S. This does not excuse the administration's deliberate slow-walking of items and assistance long authorized by Congress for use against Putin's illegal aggression,&rdquo; Wicker, of Mississippi, said in a statement. 'This devastating conflict could have been ended on terms benefiting the U.S. and NATO if Mr. Biden had listened to the counsel of bipartisan majorities in the House and Senate.&rdquo; But others in the party, such as David Sacks, a close ally of Elon Musk and Trump donor who spoke at the Republican National Convention, have taken a much different stance. 'President Trump won a clear mandate to end the war in Ukraine. So what does Biden do in his final two months in office? Massively escalate it. Is his goal to hand Trump the worst situation possible?&rdquo; Sacks wrote on X on Sunday.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/biden-allows-ukraine-use-atacms-strike-russia/401101/	2024-11-17T17:06:38-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/17/GettyImages_2030058326/large.jpg

US, Australia, Japan deepen defense cooperation	DARWIN, Australia&mdash;Japan, Australia, and the United States are strengthening their three-way defense cooperation&mdash;vowing, among other things, to consult with each other in military planning and regional crises, defense leaders from the countries said Sunday. The leaders also discussed prospects for increased cooperation under AUKUS and their views on the incoming Trump administration. The increased coordination will take place under a new structure called the Trilateral Defense Consultations, Richard Marles, Australia's deputy prime minister and minister for defence, told reporters at the naval base here. 'It provides a substance and a structure to the trilateral meeting of our three countries which has not been there before, and it represents the ambition that all of us have about taking this architecture of our three countries even further,&rdquo; Marles said. Marles spoke after an annual meeting with his U.S. and Japanese counterparts&mdash;Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani&mdash;that produced a slew of other announcements, including: Japan's new Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade will join annual U.S.-Australian exercises held by the Marine Rotational Force&ndash;Darwin, starting with Talisman Sabre 2025 and building toward the countries' first air- and missile-defense live-fire training event in the exercise's 2027 edition. Australian forces will join U.S.-Japanese exercises, beginning with Orient Shield 2025, and increase its participation in others, including Yama Sakura, Keen Edge, and Keen Sword. The three nations will look for ways to increase Australian participation in the U.S.-Japanese Bilateral Information Analysis Cell. [[Related Posts]] India, too, got a nod: Marles said the three nations will deepen their cooperation with the Indian military in the realm of maritime domain awareness, building on a 'maritime patrol aircraft collaboration activity with India&rdquo; on the sidelines of September's Exercise Kakadu. AUKUS Just as in Austin's trip to London in September, local press wanted to know whether U.S. shipbuilding troubles would delay or boost the price tag of the Virginia-class attack submarines promised to Australia under AUKUS Pillar I. Replied Austin: 'I'm confident that we're going to be able to provide the capabilities that we set out to provide. Now, we recognize that there are challenges in the industrial base, and we're doing things to address those challenges. We're investing more so that, you know, we can speed up the production to meet our objectives going forward. And you know, I've met with the leadership of the companies that are producing submarines, and I'm encouraged by what they're doing and their focus to get this done, and they will get it done.&rdquo; And Marles: 'We do have a sense of confidence about the fulfillment of the timelines that we articulated when we announced the optimal pathway back in March of last year.&rdquo; As for AUKUS Pillar II, the effort to jointly develop various 'advanced military capabilities,&rdquo; the leaders said they 'look forward to continued consultations with Japan,&rdquo; whose first contribution is expected to be in maritime autonomous systems. In October, Japanese officials attended Exercise Autonomous Warrior as observers. Trump, incoming Reporters also asked whether AUKUS and the plans for increased cooperation could be expected to survive the incoming administration of Donald Trump, who has unexpectedly shut down multinational exercises and often expressed contempt for U.S. alliances. 'I think the answer to that is yes,&rdquo; Marles said. 'This time last year, legislation passed the U.S. Congress&mdash;with the support of Democrats, Republicans, Trump Republicans&mdash;which saw the legislative underpinning of the sale of Virginia-class submarines to Australia... 'The basis of the alliance is shared values, but it's a shared strategic objective and shared strategic advantage. And AUKUS is in the strategic interest of both the United States and Australia, and that's the fundamental here, as it is for Britain. And so we are seeing AUKUS survive change of governments in Australia, in United Kingdom&mdash;and it will happen in America as well.&rdquo; He added, 'Everything that I've heard about Pete Hegseth since his name became public, in the context of becoming the secretary of defense, has been positive, and I approach the prospect of getting to know Pete Hegseth and working with him with enormous optimism.&rdquo; And Austin: 'It's the prerogative of the president-elect to nominate whoever he deems appropriate to serve on his cabinet. As far as DOD is concerned, we remain focused on a smooth and effective transition to the next administration...I would just say that this is a large enterprise, DOD, and it often involves making life-and-death decisions on a near-daily basis, and accounting for and taking care of some 2.7 million soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, guardians and really remaining focused on protecting the country and protecting our interests around the world.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/us-australia-japan-deepen-defense-cooperation/401099/	2024-11-16T22:44:08-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/17/IMG_3154/large.jpg
‘Extraordinarily dangerous’: Intelligence community insiders warn...	Former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for director of national intelligence, lacks experience, and her record of Russia-aligned public statements could undermine the ability of the United States to acquire intelligence from allies and partners, current and former intelligence officials say. Trump on Wednesday announced his intention to put Gabbard, who served in Congress as a Democrat from Hawaii, in charge of the national intelligence office. The office coordinates intelligence efforts across the entire government, forges intelligence-sharing relationships with other countries, and shapes the way the public and the White House understand threats to U.S. interests. The office takes a leading role in assembling the daily brief for the president, which the White House uses to understand how adversaries are working against the United States, and in telling the public about threats Americans face. Gabbard, an Iraq war veteran and lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, has military experience but not a deep background in intelligence. One former senior intelligence official told Defense One that such experience is vital to making sense of the wide variety of intelligence pieces that compose a picture of current or future threats. 'What people don't understand about intelligence is, if it's known, it's not intelligence. It's that assessment that you make. It has uncertainty, and the craft of understanding that uncertainty has nothing to do with opinion but rather has to do with trust, integrity and independence,&rdquo; the former official said. But intelligence community veterans are more concerned with her past actions and public statements&mdash;particularly those that aligned with Kremlin propaganda&mdash;than her resume. [[Related Posts]] In 2022, as Russian forces were launching an illegal expansion of their war against Ukraine, Gabbard said the U.S. was to blame, echoing a claim Russian President Vladimir Putin made to justify his invasion&mdash;but that NATO and the United Nations fully reject. Putin later said the war was actually a means to reconstitute the territorial empire of Catherine II. Gabbard has echoed other Russian talking points as well, including one that came directly from Kremlin information operations. Beyond Ukraine, Gabbard met with Syrian dictator and Russian ally Bashar Al-Assad in 2017. Assad continued to target civilians with chemical attacks after meeting Gabbard. But two years after the meeting, she refused to say whether he was a war criminal&mdash;despite clear evidence that he had killed some 1,400 people in Syria in a chemical weapons attack in 2013, among other crimes. Gabbard's pattern of publicly taking positions that are not supported by fact but do match up with narratives out of Moscow is going to hurt U.S. intelligence-sharing relationships with partner militaries and governments, the former senior official said. Many allies are already wary of Trump because of actions during his first term in the White House, such as abandoning Kurdish fighters in Syria in 2018&mdash;a move that prompted the resignation of several members of Trump's first cabinet, including then-Defense Secretary James Mattis and anti-ISIS coalition envoy Brett McGurk. 'They're watching. Remember, there are a whole bunch of people that already, from [Trump's] first term, are not comfortable with Trump because he was willing to throw allies and partners on a whim under the bus&hellip;So [allies] are already worried. And now this is a pertinent person who has basically said, &lsquo;Hey, I think these bad guys are good guys.'&rdquo; Gabbard's past public statements will also hurt her ability to earn trust among rank-and-file intelligence workers in the United States, said one current intelligence official. 'Tulsi's history of irresponsibly promoting misinformation and giving comfort to some of America's most aggressive adversaries is counter to the values of the intelligence community. If confirmed, she'll have a steep hill to climb to earn the trust and respect of the community,&rdquo; the official told Defense One. As DNI, Gabbard would be ultimately responsible for protecting U.S. intelligence operations and people from adversaries. She also would be the one to make the call on things like the 2022 decision to declassify intelligence analyses of Russia's intentions in Ukraine, which helped marshal allies to Ukraine's cause. 'That decision was an ODNI decision,&rdquo; said the former senior intelligence official. 'It is reflective of a new world order where we don't have absolute trust and you do need to be able to build coalitions&hellip; Alliances, friendships have always been one of the real elements of our strength. And it's imperiled.&rdquo; Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., a former CIA officer, echoed this sentiment on MSNBC on Thursday. 'The idea that someone who has aligned herself with and defended Vladimir Putin could potentially have information related to the sources and methods of how it is that we knew that Russia was going to have invaded Ukraine&hellip;helps illuminate why this is so extraordinarily dangerous.&rdquo; Because of her past statements, intelligence professionals are also worried that she could alter analysis to fit a political narrative, which would leave the president or the public in the dark about key threats. Said the current intelligence official: 'Intelligence is conducted in the service of the nation, without regard for political parties or motives, and we are typically the bearers of bad news. Will she champion the professionalism and apolitical nature of what we gather and assess, and speak truth to power, or disregard our work to convey what power wants to hear?&rdquo; Gabbard may also face an additional challenge when building trust within the community: The Trump administration decided to forgo the traditional FBI vetting of nominees to top posts, including Gabbard, CNN reported Friday.

The D Brief: Austin to the Pacific; North Korean drones; Reformin...	SecDef Austin's last Pacific swing. Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin took off this morning for his 12th and presumably final trip as U.S. defense secretary to the Asia-Pacific region. It starts with a visit to Darwin, Australia, for a trilateral meeting with Australian and Japanese officials&mdash;the latter of whom is expected to announce that Japan will start to integrate forces into U.S.-Australian exercises held by Marine Rotational Force-Darwin, senior defense officials said. Then it's over to the Philippines to meet President Bongbong Marcos and Secretary of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro and mark the opening of a new U.S.-funded intel fusion center. Next is a visit to Laos for the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting Plus, a meeting that every U.S. defense secretary has attended since its inception in 2010, and finally to Fiji, to kick off negotiations for a status-of-forces agreement intended to lay the foundation for more defense cooperation. D Brief-er Bradley Peniston is traveling with the SecDef; stay tuned for more coverage. North Korea has ordered 'full-scale mass production&rdquo; of so-called 'suicide attack drones,&rdquo; state run media KCNA reported Friday. The country's dictator Kim Jong-un called the drones 'an essential requirement in military aspects&rdquo; and said North Korean production facilities have the 'potentiality to produce and introduce various types of drones&rdquo; in the months ahead. At least three different kinds of North Korean drones were demonstrated Thursday, according to selectively blurry photos posted at the Pyongyang Times. One was a smaller fixed-wing drone; another was a larger model similar in appearance to Russia's Ranchet 3; and the third, larger one was reportedly designed for long-range strikes, one South Korea-based analyst told the Wall Street Journal. Rewind: 'In July 2023, North Korea unveiled two types of new reconnaissance and multi-purpose attack drones at an arms exhibition and a military parade,&rdquo; South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. 'The North also sent five drones across the border with South Korea in December 2022, with one of them penetrating a no-fly zone close to Seoul's presidential office.&rdquo; From the region: 'Taiwan president plans Hawaii visit on sensitive trip to Pacific, sources say,&rdquo; Reuters reported Friday; 'Beijing is already preparing to retaliate in a second Trump era,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Friday; 'China Coped With Trump's First Trade War. A Second One Will Be Tougher,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Friday; 'Trump's &lsquo;America First' foreign policy will accelerate China's push for global leadership,&rdquo; William Matthews of Chatham House argued in an essay published Thursday; And 'Ex-Trump envoy on N. Korea says Kim Jong-un won't negotiate denuclearization,&rdquo; Yonhap reported Friday from Seoul. And ICYMI: U.S. authorities uncovered 'a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign&rdquo; carried out by China-affiliated actors, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a statement Wednesday. The operation hit 'multiple telecommunications companies&rdquo; and 'enable[d] the theft of customer call records data, the compromise of private communications of a limited number of individuals who are primarily involved in government or political activity, and the copying of certain information that was subject to U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders,&rdquo; according to the statement. That latter detail could refer to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which allows U.S. authorities to spy on the communications of individuals suspected of working for a foreign country. 'We expect our understanding of these compromises to grow as the investigation continues,&rdquo; the FBI and CISA said. Developing: CISA is under threat under new Republican leadership. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky, who is about to take over as the Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, which oversees CISA, told Politico he would like to 'eliminate&rdquo; it due to the work they do calling out foreign election interference particularly from Russia. You may recall President-elect Donald Trump clashed with CISA over its monitoring of the 2020 election. (CISA has said both the 2020 and 2024 elections were secure, despite foreign influence efforts.) While Trump can't just close CISA outright, Democratic lawmakers are reportedly worried he could weaken it through staffing decisions.

On this day in 2012, Xi Jinping took office as General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, beginning what has since become at least 12 years of consecutive rule. The long-rumored prospect of a future U.S.-China war has prompted Air Force officials to change how they buy weapons, and that is driving defense companies to pursue new ways of making money, Defense One's Audrey Decker reported Thursday. Since the U.S. military will need to operate thousands of connected systems across vast distances in a Pacific conflict, those dynamics are posing new challenges for the Pentagon's acquisition community, Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said at an event hosted Wednesday by Defense One in Washington. For example, the service is investing in the mission systems of an aircraft or platform first, and building direct relationships with suppliers instead of working through the major defense companies to manage suppliers. This means prime contractors, who have historically profited from controlling the entire architecture, are having to relinquish some control, Decker writes. Consider: 'Every time we persuade ourselves that, Hey, we found a program [where] the risk is actually so small that we can probably use fixed price contracting here, even during the development phase, we end up finding risks we didn't appreciate,&rdquo; Hunter said. He pointed to two Boeing programs where the service massively underestimated development risks: the T-7 trainer and the KC-46 tanker. Both fixed-price contracts resulted in huge losses for Boeing and delayed capability for the Air Force. Continue reading, here. Suicides across the Army, Navy, and Air Force continued to rise in 2023, according to the latest annual report (PDF) published Thursday by the Defense Department. During that 12-month period, '523 Service members died by suicide, which is more than the previous year (493),&rdquo; the Pentagon said. That included 363 on the active duty side; 69 in the Reserves; and 91 among the National Guard. 'Young enlisted males accounted for the largest number of suicide deaths,&rdquo; and they most often used a firearm in the completed act, which is consistent with prior years, according to the report (poisoning is the most common way service members attempt suicide). The highest rates were among men under the age of 30; and overall, more than 9 out of 10 who died from suicide were men compared to less than 7% for females. While the Marine Corps' suicide rate did not rise in 2023, the service still has the highest rate among all the branches, U.S. Naval Institute News reports with accompanying slide data. However, 'In short-term comparisons, between 2023 and 2022, no service was found to have had a statistically significant difference in suicide rates,&rdquo; the report's authors write. The Associated Press has more.

Etc. Report: Israeli forces struck an Iranian nuclear weapons research facility in October. Sources within the Israeli military told Axios that they hit the Taleghan 2 facility, some 20 miles south Tehran, during the October 25 strike on Iranian targets. US and Israeli government sources said that they began detecting new activity at the site earlier this year and the work 'could lay the ground for the production of a nuclear weapon.&rdquo; The program was so secret that many in the Iranian government didn't even know about, the officials said. And lastly, DHS just released guidance for the use of AI in critical infrastructure. Nextgov/FCW report that the new voluntary guidance helps infrastructure operators design AI models for security and operation, deploy them and monitor them safely. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters the framework provides 'specific recommendations that each participant in the ecosystem can and should implement to ensure the safe and secure deployment of AI in critical infrastructure.&rdquo; More here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/the-d-brief-november-15-2024/401072/	2024-11-15T08:07:09-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/15/DB_lander/large.png
DHS releases guidance for AI in critical infrastructure	The Department of Homeland Security unveiled a new series of recommendations for the safe use of artificial intelligence tools in U.S. critical infrastructure, breaking down flexible guidance by each sector included in the broader AI supply chain. Unveiled on Thursday, the Roles and Responsibilities Framework for Artificial Intelligence in Critical Infrastructure &mdash; created in consultation with Homeland's internal Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board &mdash; tailors recommended actions to specific sectors key to the AI industry. These include cloud and compute infrastructure providers, AI developers, critical infrastructure owners and operators, civil society and public sector entities. DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said this guidance is 'groundbreaking&rdquo; in regards to being the first such document that was created through 'extensive collaboration&rdquo; with a board that included AI developers themselves to help civil society responsibly deploy these softwares. 'The framework, if widely adopted, will go a long way to better ensure the safety and security of critical services that deliver clean water, consistent power, internet access and so much more,&rdquo; Mayorkas said during a Thursday press call. 'It is, quite frankly, exceedingly rare to have leading AI developers engaged directly with civil society on issues that are at the forefront of today's AI debates, and [it] presents such a collaborative framework.&rdquo; He added that the framework acts as a new model of shared responsibility and governance to safeguard critical infrastructure with AI technologies. The report goes on to identify specific recommendations that every individual stakeholder can adopt within their existing AI governance protocols. 'It is descriptive and not prescriptive,&rdquo; Mayorkas said. 'The evolution of the technology is still rapidly advancing, and to be particularly prescriptive would not necessarily capture that evolution. And we intend the framework to be, frankly, a living document and to change as developments in the industry change as well.&rdquo; The voluntary guidance for stakeholders working at the intersection of AI and critical infrastructure includes five steps: securing environments, driving responsible model design, implementing data governance, ensuring safe and secure deployment and monitoring performance and impact. Different stakeholders will have different tasks within these steps. An AI software developer, for example, would be responsible for managing access to models and data to secure a given environment, whereas a critical infrastructure owner and operator would be responsible for securing existing IT infrastructure. Given that the report's contents are voluntary, Mayorkas noted that he expects board members to help evangelize the guidance into practice across their industries, especially ahead of an incoming Trump administration that stands to change current tech and AI policy. 'There is a great push for the promulgation of regulations, the enactment of legislation in the AI sphere,&rdquo; he said. 'We are leading the world in innovation in AI and broader technologies and this framework, if, in fact, adopted and implemented as broadly as we envision it will be &ndash;&ndash; and the board members envision it should be &ndash;&ndash; will and could ward off precipitous regulation, legislation that that does not move at the speed of business and debt and does not embrace and support our innovative leadership.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/dhs-releases-guidance-ai-critical-infrastructure/401066/	2024-11-14T16:17:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/14/111424cityNG-1/large.jpg
How the Air Force is revamping acquisition to prepare for a Pacif...	The prospect of a fight with China has prompted the U.S. Air Force to change how it buys weapons&mdash;driving defense companies to pursue new ways of making money. The military will need to operate thousands of connected systems across vast distances if war breaks out in the Pacific, which poses new challenges for the Pentagon's acquisition community, Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said at Defense One's State of Defense Business event. 'If you think of the typical acquisition approach: cost, schedule, performance; see the fighter, buy the fighter, operate the fighter. This is more complicated than that. It's about how these things interact together effectively to achieve a warfighting outcome in a particular mission. So we've tried to engineer our acquisition tool set, which is not radically different from tools of the past, but to solve this particular problem, which is our pacing challenge,&rdquo; Hunter said. To do this, the service is investing in the mission systems of an aircraft or platform first, and building direct relationships with suppliers instead of working through the major defense companies to manage suppliers. This means prime contractors, who have historically profited from controlling the entire architecture, are having to relinquish some control. The Air Force still needs traditional defense primes to integrate the systems on a platform, Hunter said, but future money will flow to those who have the 'best of breed in missions systems,&rdquo; in addition to integration work. 'Now they're things that [traditional defense primes] would have thought of as their competitor's systems, there's more opportunity for them in that space as well. More competition. And then for the smaller providers, an opportunity to get in the game more easily and to have a direct relationship&hellip;with the government, and that is crucial, to have that engagement with the mission system providers as well,&rdquo; Hunter said. [[Related Posts]] Hunter pointed to the collaborative combat aircraft program as an example of their new approach to acquisition. The program was set up to allow companies to bid on future tranches if they miss out on the first one, creating a more dynamic relationship with industry. The service has also learned, through trial and error, that putting all of the risk on industry in the development stage of programs drives companies to ignore potential risks, which can hurt the service down the line, he said. 'Every time we persuade ourselves that, Hey, we found a program [where] the risk is actually so small that we can probably use fixed price contracting here, even during the development phase, we end up finding risks we didn't appreciate,&rdquo; Hunter said. He pointed to two Boeing programs where the service massively underestimated development risks: the T-7 trainer and the KC-46 tanker. Both fixed-price contracts resulted in huge losses for Boeing and delayed capability for the Air Force. Hunter remained fairly confident that Boeing will be able to turn things around, despite the company's defense arm bleeding billions and a recently concluded seven-week strike that put near-term deliveries on hold. 'I am confident that Boeing can still deliver quality aircraft. I think the record shows that &lsquo;on time' has been a bit of a question mark in recent years, and we'd like to see them get back there,&rdquo; Hunter said. While Boeing is still behind on a few programs, when they do deliver, they're 'effective combat aircraft,&rdquo; Hunter said, so the engineering talent is 'very much still there.&rdquo; The Pentagon needs a healthy industrial base that makes a profit, Hunter said, because without that, companies won't be able to retain a talented workforce. 'We need the best of the best, because the things that we're doing are really hard. So it's in our interest for industry to be profitable within reasonable bounds. And I think by and large, we achieve that, and we need to be careful not to push an industry to a place where they are unprofitable, unattractive to capital, and unattractive to human talent,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/how-air-force-revamping-acquisition-prepare-pacific-fight/401060/	2024-11-14T16:13:19-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/14/8217842/large.jpg
The D Brief: Trump’s DNI, AG picks; China’s improved bomber; USAF...	Trump's cabinet of loyalists, cont. Gabbard for Director of National Intelligence. A former Army Reserve lieutenant colonel, Tulsi Gabbard served as a Democratic U.S. representative from Hawaii for eight years, during which she criticized then-President Donald Trump for his approach to the Middle East and other matters. She ran for president, withdrew, and endorsed Joe Biden. But she subsequently switched to the Republican Party, denouncing her former colleagues as an 'elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness,&rdquo; and endorsed Donald Trump for a second presidential term. On Wednesday, the president-elect announced that he intends to nominate her to lead the nation's intelligence community. Gabbard, 43, has no direct experience in intelligence work, nor in running large organizations, and has held no senior government roles. She served two years on the House Committee on Homeland Security. She has been noted for speeches and social-media posts that align with Russian propaganda and espouse conspiracy theories. Also: Gaetz for AG. Trump on Wednesday also nominated Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz to be Attorney General. Gaetz, 42, is a relatively young but seasoned GOP operative, and the son of a prominent Florida politician Don Gaetz, who is likewise the son of former North Dakota Republican Jerry Gaetz. Rep. Matt Gaetz's Florida district spans the state's western panhandle, which includes the seaport of Pensacola. Gaetz has represented Florida's first congressional district since 2017. He's since risen among Republicans as a particularly rancorous lawmaker&mdash;the New York Times describes him as a 'right-wing provocateur&rdquo;&mdash;so much so that former GOP House Speaker Kevin McCarthy blamed for costing him his speakership role in October 2023. Another thing: As the Pensacola News Journal reminded readers, Gaetz is 'the subject of an ongoing Conservative-led House Ethics Committee investigation regarding sexual misconduct allegations&rdquo; as well as alleged illicit drug use. The Times reports that the investigative work concluded in 2023, but the findings were never released publicly. Gaetz's nomination Wednesday came just two days before the House Ethics Committee was set to vote on making that report public, Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News reported Wednesday evening. Shortly Trump nominated Gaetz, House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that the congressman had resigned&mdash;which means the House Ethics Committee no longer has jurisdiction over his actions, effectively ending the investigations. According to Trump, 'Matt is a deeply gifted and tenacious attorney, trained at the William & Mary College of Law, who has distinguished himself in Congress through his focus on achieving desperately needed reform at the Department of Justice.&rdquo; 'Few issues in America are more important than ending the partisan Weaponization of our Justice System,&rdquo; Trump wrote in a statement Wednesday. 'Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans' badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department.&rdquo; For what it's worth: 'Gaetz is married to Ginger Luckey, the sister of Oculus V.R. founder Palmer Luckey,&rdquo; the Pensacola News Journal reports. Palmer Luckey founded the defense startup Anduril, which has been working hard lately to diversify its drone offerings for Pentagon contracts, as Defense One has covered extensively. The idea of Gaetz as AG came up 'just hours before it was announced,&rdquo; Politico reports. 'It was hatched aboard Trump's airplane en route to Washington, on which Gaetz was a passenger,&rdquo; according to Playbook, which poses four related questions about the nomination, including, 'Can Gaetz actually get the Senate votes to be confirmed?&rdquo; It's obviously too soon to know; but 'Republicans will have a three-seat majority&rdquo; in the Senate, 'so if four senators bounce, it's a wrap&rdquo; and Gaetz won't be confirmed. But that's a long way off right now. Additional reading: 'Trump Sends Shock Waves Through Washington With Gaetz Pick,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday; 'House Ethics Panel Was Set to Vote to Release Report Critical of Matt Gaetz,&rdquo; the New York Times reported Wednesday; 'Gaetz pick shows value Trump places on loyalty and retribution,&rdquo; the Associated Press reported Thursday; 'Trump opts for personal ties and TV chops in choosing his team,&rdquo; Reuters reported Thursday&mdash;with a side report entitled, 'Expect to hear the F-word a lot in Senate&rdquo;; And 'Top Senate Democrat calls on House to release ethics report on Gaetz,&rdquo; the BBC reported Thursday from Capitol Hill.

Reporter Joseph Galloway, who documented the Ia Drang action in We Were Soldiers Once...and Young, later called it 'the battle that convinced Ho Chi Minh he could win.' Ukraine developments Update: The U.S. defense industrial base is now cranking out 50,000 or so 155mm artillery rounds each month, and will allegedly be able to double that rate sometime next year, Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment William LaPlante said at an event hosted by Axios Wednesday in Washington. Similar advances could be made in the Patriot missile defense interceptor production line, he argued. His advice: Appropriate more for production in the U.S. industrial base. 'We still have situations where, at the end of the budget, to balance the budget people lower production numbers, because that's where the money is. We have to stop that,&rdquo; LaPlante said. Ukraine's big problem: Not enough troops. Dara Massicot of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace unpacked why in a social media thread Wednesday following her recent trip to Ukraine.

Military bases can use private 5G networks, Pentagon says	The Defense Department has released a new strategy document that gives global military installations the ability to use private 5G networks if such solutions best meet their mission needs. The Pentagon's private 5G deployment strategy, which was signed on Oct. 16 and publicly released on Tuesday, outlined the operational requirements that must be met for DOD bases to embrace private networks instead of commercial high-speed solutions. In a forward to the guidance, DOD Acting Chief Information Officer Leslie Beavers called the new document an addendum to the department's 5G strategy and implementation plan that were released in 2020. That previously issued guidance outlined the need for DOD to leverage the use of 'private, hybrid and public 5G networks' to enhance its operational and data-sharing capabilities across the globe. Beavers said DOD 'will leverage commercial networks to the maximum extent possible,&rdquo; but added that the department 'acknowledges that under certain circumstances, commercial networks may not fulfill an installation's requirements.&rdquo; In a Tuesday press release announcing the strategy, DOD also said it anticipates most military installations will use commercial networks but that private 5G solutions 'may augment or supplement commercial services because they are tailored to each installation's mission needs, security and military-unique capabilities.&rdquo; The document outlined three strategic objectives when it comes to deploying private 5G capabilities, including: aligning 5G networks with each military installation's unique needs; accelerating DOD's 'acquisition, development and secure deployment of 5G;&rdquo; and expanding an Open Radio Access Network &mdash; or Open RAN &mdash; ecosystem, which helps enhance interoperability between multiple capabilities. The strategy said DOD should incorporate Open RAN solutions 'in both commercial and government-owned models unless there are specific operational, technical or business concerns that make this approach impractical or cost prohibitive.&rdquo; The Pentagon has been working to adopt and deploy 5G that can offer warfighters the secure broadband capabilities needed to complete their missions, including through its combined joint all-domain command and control initiative. Known as CJADC2, the approach is designed to enhance communication across disparate military environments. The release of the private 5G deployment strategy comes after the fiscal year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the Pentagon develop guidance for deploying 5G networks across DOD installations. The department said it will roll out additional implementation documents 'in the coming months&rdquo; to further guide the military's implementation of both private and commercial 5G networks.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/dod-issues-private-5g-deployment-guide-military-bases/401032/	2024-11-13T15:52:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/13/1113245GNG-1/large.jpg
Air Force ordering more robot wingmen for its experimentation uni...	The Air Force is buying more drones for its collaborative combat aircraft experimentation unit in Nevada to test out how the service will use these robot wingmen in a potential fight. 'One thing that I recently did was approve some additional CCA purchases to equip the experimental operations unit in order to enable that experimentation to happen using real assets,&rdquo; Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief, said today at Defense One's State of Defense Business event. The service will buy additional prototypes from both vendors building 'increment one&rdquo; CCAs&mdash;General Atomics and Anduril&mdash;for the experimental operations unit, Hunter said. The service has been setting up the unit at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to test how it might use CCAs in operations and how the drones will pair with manned fighters. Hunter did not say how many drones the service will buy, or when these test assets will get to the Nevada unit. The additional buy will help 'ensure that warfighters will have ample opportunity for experimentation to support operational fielding before the end of the decade,&rdquo; Diem Salmon, Anduril's vice president for air dominance and strike, said in a statement. [[Related Posts]] The experimental operations unit will help the Air Force build trust with the autonomous fighters, and formulate tactics, techniques, and procedures, said General Atomics spokesman C. Mark Brinkley. 'Supplying them with actual CCAs is an important step to that. We're happy to support them in any way,&rdquo; Brinkley said. Both companies' CCA designs recently cleared a key milestone, called critical design review, Col. Timothy Helfrich, senior materiel leader for the advanced aircraft division at Air Force Materiel Command said today at the Mitchell Institute's Airpower Futures Forum. The service has been able to keep the program on track by stopping when it's 'good enough,&rdquo; Helfrich said, instead of going after a highly exquisite system. 'If we are to continue to add capability and gold plate things, we're going to miss out on our costs and most importantly our schedule targets. And so making some of those tough trades. To say this is good enough and moving on has been a challenge, because we want a lot, but we are making those decisions,&rdquo; Helfrich said. General Atomics and Anduril expect to fly their drone offerings sometime next year, after which service officials will decide whether to build one or both of the companies' offerings in increment one. This decision hinges on first flight&mdash;but also each company's production capability, Hunter said. 'It's the approach to production, right? It's the people demonstrating that they can scale to the rates that we envision for this platform and that are necessary for it to be affordable mass. So I think both vendors have an opportunity to succeed, and it is entirely conceivable that we could move forward with both,&rdquo; Hunter said. The Air Force has emphasized that CCAs need to be cheap enough to buy en masse, and while service officials haven't disclosed the exact price, Hunter reiterated that a CCA will be a fraction of the cost of an F-35 fighter jet, and that he's 'feeling good&rdquo; about the figure they reached. Along with CCAs, the Air Force is devising plans for two key modernization programs: a sixth-generation fighter jet, called Next Generation Air Dominance, and a next-generation tanker. The designs of all three new programs are tied together, both from an operational and cost perspective. But, there's not enough money to pursue all three programs as the plans stand today, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said recently. Kendall's comments were a signal to the acquisition community to focus on affordability from the start, Hunter said, which is why the service baked affordability into its approach to CCAs. 'We need to be doing that with all of our programs. We need to do it with the Next Generation Air Refueling System, the NGAS program. We need to do it with our solution for our air dominance going forward. Affordability has to be a key component,&rdquo; Hunter said. All of these modernization plans will likely change under a Trump presidency, but asked about how the service will fare under the new administration, Hunter didn't say much. 'A lot depends on what is the strategy that the incoming administration adopts, and I'll be looking to see that as well as the rest of you. I think if the strategy remains similar, I think you're going to see that Air Force systems are well designed to address the challenges of the strategy,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/air-force-ordering-more-robot-wingmen-its-experimentation-unit/401030/	2024-11-13T15:37:42-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/13/7668885/large.jpg
Newest Replicator drones proven on battlefields of Ukraine	A new tranche of drones&mdash;incuding at least one being used against Russia in Ukraine&mdash;will join the Pentagon's Replicator effort to accelerate the deployment of cheap autonomous systems, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks announced Wednesday. Tranche 1.2 'will include systems in the air and maritime domains, as well as integrated software enablers that will enhance the autonomy and resilience of other Replicator systems,&rdquo; the Defense Department said in a statement. Among them: Anduril Industries' Ghost-X and the Performance Drone Works C-100 UAS, as well as classified drones that include 'low-cost long-range strike capabilities and maritime uncrewed systems,&rdquo; according to the release. Ghost-X and the C-100 UAS are already part of the Army's company-level Small UAS effort, a program inspired in part by observations from the war in Ukraine. Army Chief Gen. Randy George said in a statement that 'Ukraine has demonstrated the value of small, attritable drones on the battlefield.&rdquo; Ukrainian fighters have been using Ghost-X since the first weeks of Russia's expanded 2022 invasion, said a source familiar with the matter. Having to face off against advanced Russian EW has helped Anduril evolve techniques that could be applicable against similar high-tech adversaries like China. For instance, the source said, Anduril has developed flying mesh networks to enable drone swarms to swap data even amid heavy electromagnetic warfare interference, 'relaying that data along multiple UAS[es] so that they can have long data-chain links.&rdquo; The drones' high level of autonomy also helps them evade EW effects and interceptor missiles, the source said. 'Let's say that I'm relaying comms, and then all of a sudden, the Russians pop up an EW bubble. The drone can say, &lsquo;OK, I expected that. I'm not even going to go to my fallback positions. I'm gonna fly over here. I'm gonna go into a place where their jammer&mdash;which I can triangulate&mdash;is not affecting my link anymore.' So you get all these networks that physically reconfigure their geometry to be robust to jamming.&rdquo; Replicator is pushing more than just drones to the front lines. Software to enable better data collection and collaboration between drones is also essential to the effort&mdash;potentially more important than the individual systems themselves. The Defense Innovation Unit, or DIU, has played a key role bringing new systems as well as the underlying software into the Replicator program, to make sure that as new drone types are added they all work together to achieve a combined effect. 'Combining cutting-edge hardware with cutting-edge software&mdash;the capabilities and needs of each pushing the bounds of what is possible with the other&mdash;is at the heart of the very best of technology in the commercial sector,&rdquo; DIU Director Doug Beck said in a statement. 'Replicator is harnessing this same synergy, ensuring we can adopt commercial best practices to iteratively develop, test, and ultimately field autonomous systems, both individually and collectively, at scale.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/newest-replicator-drones-proven-battlefields-ukraine/400997/	2024-11-13T07:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/12/Screenshot_2024_11_12_at_10.17.55PM/large.png
The D Brief: TV host tapped as SecDef; Flag-officer firings, mull...	Trump selects TV personality for SecDef President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday evening that he intends to nominate Pete Hegseth, 44, to be defense secretary at the start of his second term in office. Hegseth, a host on 'Fox & Friends Weekend,&rdquo; served in Afghanistan and Iraq but has run nothing larger than a political advocacy organization. As a civilian, he's advocated for privatizing veterans' health care, written books arguing that diversity initiatives have weakened the military, and, last week, denounced the opening of combat roles to women. After graduating from Princeton University in 2003, Hegseth took a job with the Bear Stearns investment bank and a commission in the Minnesota National Guard. He later led an infantry platoon at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, then served as a platoon commander in Baghdad and as a civil-military operations officer in Samarra, Iraq. From 2012 to 2015, Hegseth was CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers' network. Among its top priorities was privatizing Veterans Administration health care. Hegseth became a Fox contributor in 2014, and a co-host of FOX & Friends Weekend two years later. In 2019, Hegseth successfully lobbied Trump to pardon three service members convicted or accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. Last week, he told an interviewer: 'I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.&rdquo; Read more from Defense One's Bradley Peniston, here. Expert reax: ​​'I think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,&rdquo; Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Associated Press. And: 'It's clear that President-elect Trump wants to go to war with the Pentagon. He wants to put a former major with no experience running a large organization in charge of the 2+ million Department of Defense,&rdquo; said Charles Stevenson, author of SECDEF: The Nearly Impossible Job of Secretary of Defense. 'Instead of organizing a team effort to challenge U.S. adversaries, he seems destined to impose a hostile takeover for a culture war.&rdquo; And: 'Hegseth is undoubtedly the least qualified nominee for SecDef in American history. And the most overtly political. Brace yourself, America,&rdquo; Paul Rieckhoff, founder of Independent Veterans of America, tweeted Tuesday night. Panning out: Hegseth's nomination followed a slew of others for Trump's intended national-security team, including former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem atop the Department of Homeland Security, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be ambassador to Israel. Fine print: Filling these positions requires a formal nomination after the inauguration, and typically, Senate confirmation under the Constitution's Article II, which was written to give the upper house a check on, among other things, manifestly unqualified candidates. But the president-elect is pressing the senators vying to lead the newly GOP-controlled Senate to call a recess in the new year that would allow him to appoint anyone he likes to serve through the two-year congressional term. A bit more on former DNI John Ratcliffe as CIA director: When Trump first tapped Ratcliffe to run America's intelligence community in 2016, the Texas politician withdrew after Democrat and Republican senators alike looked askance at his evidently 'exaggerated&rdquo; resume. When Trump tried again in 2020, Ratcliffe won approval after vowing to be apolitical. But that didn't last; within a few months, Ratcliffe 'approved selective declassifications of intelligence that aim to score political points, left Democratic lawmakers out of briefings, accused congressional opponents of leaks, offered Republican operatives top spots in his headquarters and made public assertions that contradicted professional intelligence assessments,&rdquo; as the New York Times reported. For what it's worth: In his Tuesday announcement, Trump touted Ratcliffe as a 'warrior for Truth and Honesty&rdquo; who had debunked allegations of Russian collusion.

Attention at the Pentagon Trump's transition team is considering creating an advisory board 'with the power to review three- and four-star officers and to recommend removals of any deemed unfit for leadership,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. The idea has been formulated in a draft executive order that aligns with a campaign promise to fire 'failed&rdquo; and 'woke generals&rdquo; in the U.S. military. The board would be staffed by retired generals and noncommissioned officers. But 'The draft doesn't specify what officers need to do or present to show if they meet those standards,&rdquo; the Journal reports. 'The potential for this to go wrong is infinite,&rdquo; one former senior Pentagon official told the Journal. Expert reax: 'If you are looking to fire officers who might say no because of the law or their ethics, you set up a system with completely arbitrary standards,&rdquo; one former Army lawyer warned. Read more, here. Also coming soon: Space Command HQs will move back to Alabama. House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mike Rogers says Trump will sign an executive order within his first week of office to move U.S. Space Command headquarters to Alabama, clearing the way for construction to start as soon as next year, Defense One's Audrey Decker reported Tuesday. Background: Space Command has been based in Colorado at Peterson Space Force Base since its inception in 2019, but the decision on a forever home has been the subject of a years-long debate. The Biden administration in 2023 reversed a decision Trump made in his last days in office to move the command's permanent headquarters to Huntsville, Alabama. Biden officials have argued that the command should stay in Colorado to maintain readiness and prevent the loss of civilian workers, who make up 60 percent of its workforce. 'I've told y'all since Biden made that crooked decision, it wasn't going to work,&rdquo; Rogers said during an interview on Alabama radio station FM Talk 106.5 that aired on Monday. 'As you know, on the [House] Armed Services Committee, I put a hold on any money being spent in Colorado Springs after President Biden came in and stole that mission away, and I told everybody then that Colorado Springs will not be the future location of Space Command, it will be Huntsville, Alabama, who won at fair and square.&rdquo; Read on, here. Trump's cabinet, cont. Trump has nominated New York real estate tycoon Steven Witkoff to be Special Envoy to the Middle East. Witkoff is a golf partner and campaign donor to Trump, though it's unclear if he will be subject to Senate confirmation, Politico reports. Witkoff has no Middle East experience to speak of, but Trump called him an 'unrelenting voice for peace,&rdquo; in his Tuesday announcement. Regarding Trump's appointment of Mike Huckabee as Ambassador to Israel, the president-elect cited Huckabee's 'love&rdquo; for Israel and 'the people of Israel, and likewise, the people of Israel love him,&rdquo; he said in a statement. 'Mike will work tirelessly to bring about Peace in the Middle East,&rdquo; Trump said. For what it's worth, Huckabee admitted recently, 'I never use the term West Bank, I find it offensive. We're talking about Judea and Samaria.&rdquo; Think tank reax: Allison McManus of the Center for American Progress called Huckabee's appointment 'a sign that [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu can act with impunity.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Eyeing Trump support, Israeli minister pushes for West Bank settlement annexation,&rdquo; CNN reported Tuesday; And 'Israel's Netanyahu acknowledges pager attack, says he sees &lsquo;eye-to-eye' with Trump on Iran,&rdquo; CNN reported Sunday. More Mideast developments The Iran-backed Houthis attacked U.S. forces in the Red Sea off Yemen's coast, the Pentagon confirmed Tuesday. 'During the transit, the Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers USS Stockdale and USS Spruance were attacked by at least eight one-way attack uncrewed aerial systems, five anti-ship ballistic missiles, and three anti-ship cruise missiles, which were successfully engaged and defeated,&rdquo; Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters. 'The vessels were not damaged; no personnel were hurt,&rdquo; Ryder said. ICYMI: The U.S. carried out strikes against Houthi weapons-storage sites inside Yemen over the weekend. 'The operation involved US Air Force and US Navy assets to include F-35C fighter aircraft,&rdquo; Ryder said. U.S. troops also attacked 'an Iranian-backed militia group's weapons storage and logistics headquarters facility&rdquo; inside Syria on Tuesday, officials at Central Command said. Those strikes came in response to a rocket attack on coalition troops at Patrol Base Shaddadi; no one was harmed in that attack, CENTCOM said. On Monday, U.S. forces conducted airstrikes 'against nine targets in two locations associated with Iranian groups in Syria,&rdquo; CENTCOM said Tuesday. Those strikes were in response to 'several attacks on U.S. personnel in Syria over the last 24 hours,&rdquo; according to CENTCOM, which did not say whether any U.S. forces were harmed. Trendspotting: 'There've been 25 attacks in 2 months & dozens of US artillery strikes&rdquo; in Syria, Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute wrote Tuesday on social media. Etc.

Trump taps Fox host Pete Hegseth to be defense secretary	A former Army National Guard major who has led two political advocacy organizations has been tapped for the 'nearly impossible job&rdquo; of U.S. defense secretary. President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday that he intends to nominate Pete Hegseth, 44, to be the first Pentagon chief of his second term in office. Hegseth, a host on 'Fox & Friends Weekend,&rdquo; served in Afghanistan and Iraq, receiving the Combat Infantryman Badge. In civilian life, he has advocated for privatizing veterans' health care and written books arguing that diversity initiatives have weakened the military. The announcement followed a slew of others about Trump's intended national-security team, including former Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to run the Department of Homeland Security, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee to be ambassador to Israel. Should Trump formally submit their nominations after he is inaugurated, they would require Senate confirmation. Hegseth has 'an excellent background as a junior officer but does not have the senior national security experience that secretaries need,&rdquo; Mark Cancian, a senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told the Associated Press. After graduating from Princeton University in 2003, Hegseth took a job with the Bear Stearns investment bank and a commission in the Minnesota National Guard. He led an infantry platoon at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, then served as a platoon commander in Baghdad and a civil-military operations officer in Samarra, Iraq. By 2007, Hegseth had joined Vets for Freedom, a political advocacy group that, as NPR put it, 'supports current U.S. policy in Iraq and promotes continuing the war until &lsquo;victory'.&rdquo; He later became its executive director and served with the group until 2012, according to his LinkedIn page. In 2011 and 2012, he deployed to Afghanistan for 10 months with the Minnesota Guard, serving as a senior instructor at Counterinsurgency Training Center Afghanistan at Camp Julien in Kabul. In 2012, he helped found a political action committee, MN PAC, which was noted for spending one-third of its $15,000 in funds on Christmas parties for families and friends. From 2012 to 2015, Hegseth was CEO of Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group funded by the Koch brothers' network; among its top priorities was privatizing Veterans Administration health care. Hegseth became a Fox contributor in 2014, and a co-host of FOX & Friends Weekend two years later. During the 2016 Republican presidential primaries, he backed Marco Rubio, then Ted Cruz, and ultimately became a vocal supporter of Trump, whom he got to know during the candidate's frequent appearances on his show. When reports surfaced that the new 45th president was considering Hegseth to be secretary of veterans affairs, the nation's largest veterans groups rose in intense opposition and scuttled the idea. When Trump's first VA secretary moved on in 2018, Hegseth was again considered for the job. But news of his acrimonious second divorce&mdash;two years after he argued in a book that 'family policy&rdquo; should focus on 'preventing divorce of parents with kids&rdquo;&mdash;and nepotism at his advocacy group broke just as Trump was taking fire for his own rumored infidelities and family members in White House roles. In 2019, Hegseth successfully lobbied Trump to pardon three service members convicted or accused of war crimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. He was also temporarily banned from Twitter after he posted the manifesto of the Saudi Air Force student who killed three and injured eight more in a terrorist attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida. Hegseth said he wanted to expose the shooter's Islamist ideology; Twitter officials said posting the manifesto violated their content standards. This year, Hegseth&mdash;long outspoken about 'woke-ness&rdquo; in the military&mdash;released his fourth book: The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free. In an interview posted to YouTube last week, he said he was among a dozen National Guard members who had been removed from security duties related to President Joe Biden's inauguration after vetting by the FBI. He also said that putting women in combat roles 'hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated.&rdquo; Trump's first presidential term was noted for the turnover in the Defense Department's top job. Only Jim Mattis and Mark Esper lasted more than a year, and three other men served as acting SecDef. 'I think Trump was tired of fighting with his secretaries of defense and picked one who would be loyal to him,&rdquo; Cancian told AP, adding that Hegseth's inexperience might hinder his path through Senate confirmation.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/trump-taps-fox-host-pete-hegseth-be-defense-secretary/400999/	2024-11-12T19:46:32-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/12/GettyImages_11275941911/large.jpg
HASC chair: Trump will move Space Command HQ to Alabama immediate...	President-elect Donald Trump will sign an executive order within his first week of office to move U.S. Space Command headquarters to Alabama, clearing the way for construction to start as soon as next year, according to Alabama congressman Mike Rogers. Space Command has been based in Colorado at Peterson Space Force Base since its inception in 2019, but the decision on a forever home has been the subject of a years-long debate. The Biden administration in 2023 reversed a decision Trump made in his last days in office to move the command's permanent headquarters to Huntsville, Alabama. 'I've told y'all since Biden made that crooked decision, it wasn't going to work. As you know, on the [House] Armed Services Committee, I put a hold on any money being spent in Colorado Springs after President Biden came in and stole that mission away, and I told everybody then that Colorado Springs will not be the future location of Space Command, it will be Huntsville, Alabama, who won at fair and square,&rdquo; Rogers said during an interview on Alabama radio station FM Talk 106.5 that aired on Monday. The 2024 defense policy bill put a freeze on SPACECOM headquarters construction until two government watchdog agencies evaluate Biden's decision to keep it in Colorado. The two investigations will wrap up in December or January, Rogers said, and would have 'reversed the president's decision anyway.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] 'It's going to be a big point now because President Trump's already announced it, and I think you'll see in the first week that he's in office, he'll sign an executive order reversing Biden's directive. And we will start construction next year in Huntsville,&rdquo; Rogers said. Biden officials have argued that the command should stay in Colorado to maintain readiness and prevent the loss of civilian workers, who make up 60 percent of its workforce. But Rogers said the new Trump administration is unlikely to see any pushback from Democrats on HASC. 'I have every confidence that if for some reason we didn't take control of the House, [HASC ranking member] Adam Smith and the Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee would do nothing to try to interfere with the U.S. Space Command being constructed in Huntsville,' Rogers said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/hasc-chair-trump-will-move-space-command-hq-alabama-immediately/400986/	2024-11-12T12:28:58-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/12/GettyImages_1241860686/large.jpg
The D Brief: Trump’s picks; GOP takes House; Chinese airshow’s dr...	Trump cabinet staffs up on loyalists President-elect Donald Trump has named nearly a half dozen insiders and officials to his White House staff and cabinet well ahead of Inauguration Day, though some will require Senate confirmation. Here's a running list of those who have made the cut so far: Tom Homan as top border-enforcement official. According to Trump, Homan will oversee the 'Nation's Borders,&rdquo; which includes 'the Southern Border, the Northern Border, all Maritime, and Aviation Security,&rdquo; the president-elect announced Sunday on social media, referring to Homan as his 'Border Czar.&rdquo; Worth noting: 'Homan will be in charge of all Deportation of Illegal Aliens back to their Country of Origin,&rdquo; Trump said in his statement, and added, 'I have no doubt he will do a fantastic, and long awaited for, job.&rdquo; Trump said in the spring he expected between 15 to 20 million undocumented people to be deported, though more credible estimates (Pew in 2021, e.g.) put the number of undocumented migrants in the U.S. closer to 10 million. Relatedly, Trump's famously nativist first-term aide Stephen Miller is set to serve as Homan's deputy chief of staff. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem for Homeland Security secretary, which CNN reports, 'signal[s] Trump is serious about his promise to crack down on his immigration pledges&rdquo; and 'ensur[es] a loyalist will head an agency he prioritizes and that is key to his domestic agenda.&rdquo; Florida Rep. Mike Waltz as national security advisor, according to the Wall Street Journal, which calls him 'among the most hawkish members of Congress on China.&rdquo; Waltz is a former Army Green Beret who, like most Republicans, has lost patience with prolonged U.S. support for Ukraine. He has, however, threatened to 'tak[e] the handcuffs off of the long-range weapons we provided Ukraine&rdquo; should Russian leader Vladimir Putin not cooperate with Trump in potential future negotiations over the fate of the invaded country. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state, as the New York Times first reported. Like Waltz, Rubio is a Ukraine-aid skeptic; unlike Waltz, he used to call Trump a 'con artist.&rdquo; Rubio rose to prominence in the so-called Tea Party wave of conservative politics nearly 15 years ago. More recently, he's fashioned himself as a China hawk and an advocate for more aggressive U.S. policy toward Venezuela, which the Trump administration reportedly tried but failed to overthrow in the months of his first term. Also from Florida politics: Susie Wiles, who will serve as Trump's chief of staff following a very successful stint as his 2024 co-campaign manager. 'She's credited with running a disciplined, professionalized campaign&rdquo; and 'has demonstrated an ability to help control Trump's impulses &mdash; to the extent that's possible &mdash; in a way few others have,&rdquo; Politico reported last week. New York Rep. Elise Stefanik as United Nations ambassador. Stefanik is a stalwart Trump loyalist, as the president-elect noted in his announcement Monday, and comes with experience in the House Intelligence and Armed Services Committees. Others appointees include early Trump loyalist and former New York Rep. Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protective Agency. With Zeldin at the helm, Trump predicted 'fair and swift deregulatory decisions&rdquo; that will 'unleash the power of American businesses.&rdquo; According to Zeldin, 'We will restore US energy dominance, revitalize our auto industry to bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI. We will do so while protecting access to clean air and water,&rdquo; he said Monday in a statement on social media. Critics say Zeldin's nomination underscores Trump's record of policies that deepen the climate crisis&mdash;and likely cedes a key global leadership role to China. By the way: Trump's Republicans have formally clinched control of all levers of U.S. power&mdash;including the White House, Senate, and most recently the House of Representatives, in addition to their 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. In this way, the autocrat-friendly Trump will have virtually no first-year obstacles to pursue an agenda decidedly different from the Biden administration in most every way, as Trump and JD Vance promised in their campaign. Given the open admiration for Hungary's authoritarian leader Viktor Orban among many in Trump's orbit, one big question for the months to come is just how much the GOP levers of power permit Trump to copy Orban's playbook of eroding checks on his power. Why bring it up: As the New York Times explained late last week, after ascending to office in 2010, Orban 'changed the electoral rules to better suit his party, throttled the free press and cracked down on nonprofit organizations.&rdquo; In the years since, 'With the state apparatus rebuilt in his favor, Mr. Orban has continued to win elections, lending an air of legitimacy to what he calls the &lsquo;illiberal state,' in which Mr. Orban rules like an elected autocrat.&rdquo; And like Trump, Orban, too, is openly fond of Russian despot Putin. On the other hand, former Air Force Lt. Col. and Illinois Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, wrote on social media Friday, 'I have absolutely no fear of Trump. Honest to God&hellip;Trump himself is weak and scared. Don't be intimidated, I'm absolutely not, and you shouldn't be either.&rdquo; Kinzinger, of course, announced his retirement from Congress in late 2021 after a redistricting effort&mdash;along with his public opposition to Trump&mdash;cost him too many constituents. As for the Pentagon and U.S. military, the same rules as always are expected to apply in the months ahead. That is, 'As it always has, the U.S. military will stand ready to carry out the policy choices of its next Commander in Chief, and to obey all lawful orders from its civilian chain of command,&rdquo; outgoing Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in a statement to all Defense Department personnel last week. 'The U.S. military will also continue to stand apart from the political arena; to stand guard over our republic with principle and professionalism; and to stand together with the valued allies and partners who deepen our security,&rdquo; Austin wrote. 'America's Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Guardians swear an oath to &lsquo;support and defend the Constitution of the United States'&mdash;-and that is precisely what you will continue to do,&rdquo; he added.

The service has received no new KC-46s since late September, when a strike by thousands of machinists at the aerospace company shut down production lines, and officials say they don't know when deliveries will restart. But they say they aren't worried: Boeing is on the hook for 15 tankers in the fiscal year that began on Oct. 1, and even if they're off the pace, they expect the company to hew to its contract.

Pacific partnerships are key to preventing war, Army leaders say	FORT SHAFTER, Hawaii&mdash;The personal relationships soldiers are building in dozens of training exercises each year with partners throughout the Indo-Pacific are the true strength of U.S. Army Pacific, the command's new leader said Friday, pledging to continue the initiatives championed by outgoing commander Gen. Charles Flynn. 'It's those relationships, built on a bedrock of trust, that really give our adversaries pause. They can plan for, or resource against, technical or procedural advantage that we may have, but they can't undo relationships,&rdquo; said Gen. Ronald Clark, adding that Flynn 'has made the region safer and our Army stronger.&rdquo; Clark has served here multiple times before. He is returning to Hawaii after two years as the senior military assistant to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin&mdash;a role that prompted Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., to hold up Clark's promotion for weeks. He took command from Flynn on Friday in a rainy ceremony attended by senior military leaders from across the region. Flynn used his last speech in uniform to discuss key events and themes that made a difference in his life, to recognize family and friends, and to thank U.S. partners in the region for underscoring what he calls 'the strategic land power network&hellip;a great counterweight to all the things that are happening out here every day that are dangerous and aggressive.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] The way to 'maintain peace and stability, protect everyone's freedoms and prosperity, and ultimately&hellip;our highest duty, as [INDOPACOM's Adm.] Sam Paparo says, is to deter and prevent a way from going on. So the goal here is to have no war.&rdquo; Flynn has been a passionate champion of the Army's role in the Pacific&mdash;which he calls 'vital and central to success&rdquo;&mdash;and regularly highlights the importance of Operation Pathways, a series of more than 40 joint and partner exercises across the region. Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said at the ceremony that Army's Pacific forces have during Flynn's tenure 'planned, coordinated, and executed more than 200 bilateral military exercises in more than 90 countries,&rdquo; as they 'built a formation that is lethal and cohesive.&rdquo; U.S. Army Pacific 'is gritty, determined, smart, creative, and a spirited team, because they have taken on the traits of their commander,&rdquo; George said. 'Your genuine and sincere appreciation for our partners and allies has laid the foundation of trust and respect we enjoy today and must have to win tomorrow.&rdquo; There is no mission more important for the Army, George said, directing his comments to Clark. 'Today, our adversaries are working together to challenge us in every theater. Russia, China, Iran and North Korea represent an axis of upheaval that is increasingly collaborating to threaten the free world.&rdquo; Paparo, leader of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, noted that 'the security environment has worsened&rdquo; since Clark was last stationed in the theater, in 2021. 'Given this dangerous security environment, the connected, transactional symbiosis of our would-be adversaries, the [People's Republic of China's] increasingly aggressive behavior, the increasing connections between Russia and North Korea, we need to the team to be ready. You are precisely the right leader for this assignment,&rdquo; Paparo said. Still, Clark told reporters he is not overly concerned by news that North Korean troops are fighting alongside Russians in Ukraine. 'It really doesn't give me pause&hellip; because on, as you know, on the Korean peninsula, we're ready to fight tonight,&rdquo; he said. 'The proliferation of combat capabilities across the world is something that happens at breathtaking speed now, given automation, the internet, AI, machine learning. So our expectation is&hellip; that our adversaries are going to learn quickly. We also have to learn quickly, and quicker, from ongoing conflicts.

Trump’s climate skepticism could hurt military operations	The U.S. military would be weakened by Trump-ally proposals to break up the federal government's main weather-monitoring agency and roll back efforts to reduce Pentagon dependence on fossil fuel, DOD leaders and former national-security officials say. 'I think it would be a real mistake to pivot,&rdquo; Brendan Owens, assistant defense secretary for energy, installations, and environment, told reporters on Friday&mdash;a mistake, he said, that China or Russia could exploit in wartime. Project 2025&mdash;the Heritage Foundation's policy plan for a Trump presidency&mdash;says the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, 'should be dismantled and many of its functions eliminated, sent to other agencies, privatized, or placed under the control of states and territories.&rdquo; Trump has attempted to distance himself from the document, which was largely produced by his former appointees and staff. But during his first term as president, he lashed out at NOAA after its scientists contradicted a false statement of his, and, more generally, attempted to squelch scientific reporting on climate change. While Project 2025 calls for privatizing the provision of weather-service data, Owens said, 'I don't know any alternative&rdquo; to the capability NOAA provides. The agency operates 18 satellites that track weather patterns and other atmospheric phenomena, including three that are part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. Without them, he said, 'We would lose the ability to inform our combatant commanders and our installation commanders of risk. As a result of that&hellip;We'd be creating a blind spot, which we currently don't have.&rdquo; Owens is hardly alone in pointing out the danger to operations from shuttering NOAA. It would introduce 'a huge risk,&rdquo; said Erin Sikorsky, a former member of the U.S. National Intelligence Council who now leads the Center for Climate and Security. 'We know that China is investing a huge amount in their capabilities for weather prediction, not just in the short term but in the sub-seasonal forecasts. I don't think we want to be in a situation where our adversaries have better information than we do.&rdquo; In July, the deputy assistant defense secretary for Arctic and global resilience enumerated the various ways the military works with the weather-monitoring agency. 'We do lean on NOAA pretty heavily right now with our Arctic weather forecasting. We work very closely with our Air Force weather community, but also our naval weather community, works closely with NOAA to detect weather forecasting and for ice forecasting,&rdquo; Iris Ferguson told reporters. Scientific weather forecasting has long been a key to battlefield success. In the run-up to D-Day, the most important beach landing in modern military history, German and allied forces alike sought to divine when favorable weather might allow a successful assault. Enter Norwegian forecaster Sverre Petterssen, serving under Gen. Dwight Eisenhower's head of meteorology. Petterssen was a fan of the new approach that tracked masses of cold and warm air, or 'fronts,&rdquo; colliding miles above the earth's surface. The fluid dynamics of these fronts, movement, pressure, etc., could provide more information than the customary statistical regressions based on averages. Using that insight, Eisenhower's team pinpointed a brief weather break that would allow an invasion, information the Germans didn't have. Today, data from NOAA and other sources helps the Pentagon&mdash;and U.S. allies&mdash;plan operations via the Defense Department Climate Assessment Tool or DCAT. Said Owens: 'Climate wargaming is something that the Defense Department is doing actively, right now. It is changing the way that we look at various different [combatant command] plans. It's informing that and the rate at which we are doing contested logistics assessments and how those are coming into operational planning, how we're looking at extreme weather, and our ability to fight through any of those.&rdquo; Would DCAT suffer if deprived of NOAA data? 'Yeah, it would,&rdquo; Owens said. 'It would affect our ability to improve them and make them better decision-making tools.&rdquo; Shedding dependence The Pentagon has increased its efforts in recent years to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, such as moving toward electric vehicles and exploring alternative means for powering installations. Owens framed those efforts as essential to future military operations. Owens was confident, or at least optimistic, that some of those efforts, like nuclear power for installations and bases, would survive the Trump administration. 'Nuclear meets a need and a level of resilience that we have to maintain to be able to deploy in certain circumstances,&rdquo; he said. But other initiatives are more vulnerable. Trump has expressed concerns about the military use of electric vehicles, concerns not always based in fact. Owens said the practical, operational case for more electric vehicles is clear. The same fuel and supply vulnerabilities incurred by running diesel generators on bases also apply to the fuel to run vehicles. Owens is hoping that military leaders will make that case to keep the department's electric-vehicle efforts alive. 'I think the department's going to say, &lsquo;Look, this is our reality. We need this stuff. It makes us better warfighters,'&rdquo; he said, adding that it happens, 'it's going to help them sustain a lot of the momentum that has been built over the course of the last and not just this administration.&rdquo; Sikorsky is less sure. 'The foot will not be on the gas, right, the same way,&rdquo; she said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/trumps-climate-skepticism-could-hurt-military-operations/400961/	2024-11-08T18:55:15-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/08/sharpiegate_GettyImages_1172289651/large.jpg
Air Force waits for tankers in wake of Boeing strike	Six weeks into the new fiscal year, Boeing has yet to deliver any of the 15 KC-46 tankers it owes the service by next September. Service officials did not say when they expect the deliveries, which were disrupted by a recently concluded seven-week strike, but said they expect the company to hew to its contract. Thus far, 'no KC-46s have been delivered in FY 25,&rdquo; an Air Force spokesperson said. The final tanker of fiscal 2024 was delivered on Sept. 27, completed check-outs, and was ferried to an operational unit on Oct. 4, the spokesperson said. Tanker production was stalled when thousands of Boeing workers went on strike in September. After weeks of negotiations, union workers voted on Monday to end the strike, clearing the company to restart aircraft production on lines that build commercially derived military aircraft such as the 767-based tanker and the Navy's 737-based P-8 maritime aircraft. Some employees could resume work as early as this week, but the company said production might not restart for weeks. The strike hit Boeing's finances in the third quarter and contributed to $6 billion in losses, including $2 billion on the defense side. A Boeing spokesperson, asked about the company's timeline to restart production and deliveries of KC-46s, said, 'We'll have more to share in the coming days.&rdquo; As Air Force units wait for tankers to arrive, service officials said this week that they may extend the KC-46 program two years beyond initial projections, to 2031, after repeated pauses on deliveries. Schedules have also slipped for several key fixes for the tanker, which has been plagued with development problems. Those problems have already caused the company to lose more than $8 billion on the program, and new challenges with the tanker are still popping up. It's unclear when Boeing's fixed-price contracts will start to bring in profits, but in the meantime, the company has said it will try to improve its numbers by 'doing less&rdquo; and cutting non-core defense programs, possibly its space business. 'I think that we're better off doing less and doing it better than doing more and not doing it well, so we're in the process of taking an evaluation of the portfolio,&rdquo; Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg told investors in October. The company also announced in October that it would cut 10 percent of its workforce, roughly 17,000 people, in order to 'position&rdquo; itself for the future.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/11/air-force-waits-tankers-wake-boeing-strike/400960/	2024-11-08T16:32:24-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/08/Workers_stand_near_a_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: DOD shakeup expected; Russian barrage; N. Koreans fi...	How Trump may shake up DOD, according to Chris Miller, who was the last person to occupy the U.S. defense secretary's office during the first Trump administration, and whose name tops the defense chapter of Project 2025. The retired Special Forces colonel wants irregular warfare to have a larger, even predominant, role in implementing U.S. policy in South and Central America and Africa&mdash;and a smaller one in the Pacific. 'Let Special Operations Command, irregular warfare command, handle Latin America and AFRICOM. Let them compete against whoever it is out there. Let the services just focus on INDOPACOM and the Russian bear,&rdquo; Miller told Defense One's Patrick Tucker in June. Miller also wants more money to flow to innovative ideas, particularly ones that come from operators, and downplays fears that Trump will withdraw from alliances. 'Everybody is concerned that he means a wholesale pullout of NATO or other organizations. I find that probably a stretch. The ultimate point is better burden-sharing.&rdquo; Read on, here. Trump's record and own words suggest much bigger changes are coming, 'amid fears that the once and future commander in chief will follow through on vows to deploy the military domestically against American citizens, demand fealty from key leaders and attempt to remake the nonpartisan institution into one explicitly loyal to him,&rdquo; writes the Washington Post, with plenty of links out to previous coverage. Project 2025 and the GOP party platform also highlight culture-war issues, The Hill notes in its own article. The next administration will also try 'reducing wasteful defense spending and decreasing the number of generals in the military, although it also includes less divisive measures, such as enhancing nuclear strategy, prioritizing China and building a resilient military.&rdquo; The article links back to the GOP party platform, which says: 'We will invest in cutting-edge research and advanced technologies, including an Iron Dome Missile Defense Shield, support our troops with higher pay,&rdquo; the platform reads, and 'get woke leftwing Democrats fired as soon as possible.&rdquo; Read, here. Quote: 'The greatest danger the military faces&rdquo; under a second Trump presidency is a 'rapid erosion of its professionalism, which would undermine its status and respect from the American people,&rdquo; said Richard Kohn, a professor and military historian at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 'Mr. Trump does not have a real understanding of civil-military relations, or the importance of a nonpartisan, nonpolitical military.&rdquo; A spokeswoman for Trump, Karoline Leavitt, said that with Tuesday's vote, the American public had given him 'a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.&rdquo; Meanwhile: Pentagon puts a dent in cyber workforce vacancies. The department is still short nearly 30,000 cyber workers, but 'The civilian vacancy rate is now down to 16 percent&mdash;that is a 4.8 percent decrease from last year,&rdquo; Mark Gorak, principal director for resources & analysis, the Pentagon's office of the chief information officer, told reporters Thursday. 'In order to get there, believe it or not, we had to hire about 14,000 additional civilians, and we lost or turned over about 6,000 civilians&rdquo; to jobs outside the department.

Mark Kimmitt explains how Ukraine's military is 'bleeding out&rdquo; against Russia in an eight-minute video published Friday by the Wall Street Journal. Early-morning Russian missile and drone strikes across Ukraine killed at least nine people and injured more than 60 others Friday, President Volodymir Zelenskyy said on X. Ukrainian troops claim to have shot down four missiles and around 60 drones from the overnight barrage. 'Air defense, long-range capabilities, weapons packages, and sanctions against the aggressor&mdash;these are the actions required, not just words,&rdquo; Zelenskyy said. Update: The lame-duck Biden administration still has $4 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine and another $2 billion from the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. However, it's not clear exactly how much more support the U.S. military can provide before Donald Trump takes office in mid-January. 'Some things can arrive within days and weeks. Some items in those packages take longer,&rdquo; Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Thursday. 'It does matter what's available on our stock, on our shelves. You're going to see us continue to draw that down pretty frequently. Could there be things that go out beyond Jan. 20? I can't say for certain right now.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Europe cannot finance Ukraine war if Trump pulls U.S. out of the conflict, Hungary's Orban warns,&rdquo; CNBC reported Friday; 'Hungary's leader Orb&aacute;n predicts Trump will end support for Ukraine in comments before EU summit,&rdquo; AP reported Friday; And 'Putin is ready to talk to Trump but his Ukraine demands are unchanged, Kremlin says,&rdquo; Reuters reported Friday. North Koreans in Russia Developing: Russian and North Korean troops have allegedly begun their counteroffensive to recapture territory in Kursk, the region Ukrainian troops entered in a surprise offensive of their own back in August. According to one official on Ukraine's Defense Council writing Thursday on Telegram, 'DPRK troops have been deployed to the contact line in Kursk,&rdquo; and are 'embedded in Russian units fighting on the Lyubimovka-Novoivanovka line, as well as near Pogrebki.&rdquo; According to Ukrainian military chief Rustem Umerov, a 'small group&rdquo; of North Koreans were first attacked earlier this week in the vicinity of Kursk, South Korean media reported on Tuesday. An anonymous U.S. official confirmed the allegation to the New York Times on Tuesday, and said North Koreans were killed in the incident, but no date for the actual incident was provided. More North Korean casualties could be coming soon, the Ukrainian defense official said. That's because 'the positions of the Russian units, in which the North Korean troops are present, regularly come under artillery fire. Our UAVs engage them, too,&rdquo; he said Thursday on Telegram. New: South Korea says pro-Russia hackers have stepped up cyber attacks against military, government, and judicial websites, Yonhap news agency reported Friday. Those attacks seem to largely involve distributed denial-of-service efforts, which have so far caused 'temporary delays or disruptions,&rdquo; but little else. Related reading: 'S.

Pentagon puts a dent in cyber workforce vacancies	The Pentagon still needs nearly 30,000 cyber workers, but the number of open positions has gone down significantly since last year, defense officials said Thursday. 'The civilian vacancy rate is now down to 16 percent&mdash;that is a 4.8 percent decrease from last year,&rdquo; Mark Gorak, principal director for resources & analysis, the Pentagon's office of the chief information officer, told reporters Thursday. 'In order to get there, believe it or not, we had to hire about 14,000 additional civilians, and we lost or turned over about 6,000 civilians&rdquo; to jobs outside the department. Cyber workers are in high demand across the federal government and in industry, making it difficult for the Pentagon to attract and keep its cyber workforce, which is composed of about 75,000 civilians, 25,000 troops, and 75,000 contractors. Last year, about 24 percent of DOD cyber jobs were vacant. That vacancy rate dropped to 16 percent, which amounts to about 28,000 unfilled military and civilian cyber roles, Gorak said. Moreover, the Pentagon is still tallying attrition for military cyber workers, but estimates that 4,000 troops left their cyber jobs in 2024. 'We still have a long way to go to get to our closure here, but we're getting better, and I think that's one of some of the key metrics of success of this program,&rdquo; he said. [[Related Posts]] Money was the top reason cyber workers left their DOD roles, and the Pentagon must increase pay incentives to improve retention, Gorak said. 'We're addressing that with [cyber excepted service] and target local market supplement,&rdquo; he said. 'I'm also working with [the Office of Personnel Management] and [the Office of Management and Budget] on the levels of pay that were authorized to pay, and the caps that we have within the federal government. So we're trying to work for cyber and digital to increase those. But again, there's guard rails and lots of obstacles for us to make that happen.&rdquo; In addition to reducing the number of cyber vacancies, the Pentagon named five key initiatives to focus on in 2025: new standards for role qualifications; developing a skills-based assessment for hiring; increasing use of apprenticeship programs; and improving pay. Another target is growing the Pentagon's congressionally mandated cyber academic engagement office, which Gorak leads and was created this year. But DOD missed one goal it slated for 2024: creating a fund for defense and cyber workforce development, Gorak said. That effort won't mature until 2027. 'The one initiative we didn't get to that we had focused on for FY24 was the establishing of a dedicated fund for the defense and cyber workforce. And now we took a closer look at that, and we're going to need a lot more support on that, so we've actually changed the timeline,&rdquo; Gorak said. The fund is similar to others in the department and would be used to help with recruitment, retention, and placing interns or individuals on assignment, Gorak said. 'I can use some of this fund to actually have a two-year internship program where they have two years to bring them in, test them out, train them, develop them, and then have that flexibility in that timeline to then hire as authorizations become open,&rdquo; he said. The money could also be used to train employees on new skills. 'So if part of the segment of the workforce isn't qualified in a certain skill, then this fund would actually pay for that centralized training so that we can make sure that our readiness is increased,&rdquo; he said. 'And again, this isn't new, but actually centralizing this and actually getting the funding to support this is the challenge to make this happen.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/pentagon-puts-dent-cyber-workforce-vacancies/400932/	2024-11-07T18:16:03-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/07/Screenshot_2024_11_07_at_4.14.22PM/large.png

How Trump may shake up DOD: an insider’s view	Few, if anyone, has a better window into Donald Trump's plans for the Pentagon than Christopher Miller, the final acting defense secretary of Trump's first term and architect of the defense chapter of the Project 2025 document. Two people with knowledge of the Trump campaign's internal deliberations told Defense One that Miller is well-placed to play a key role in the next White House's national security apparatus. And while Trump sought to distance himself from the Heritage Foundation document after its many controversial elements rose to public attention, it was written largely by his former appointees and staff and mirrors many of his key policy proposals. Although he has acted as one, Chris Miller is no one's idea of a defense secretary&mdash;not even Chris Miller's. A retired Army Special Forces colonel who later ran the National Counterterrorism Center, he lacks the defining qualities of a Washington political operator. He shows no enthusiasm for delivering talking points or speeches; takes no joy in commanding large budgets; expresses no interest in waging culture-war battles in front of cameras. He shares Trump's extemporaneous, unscripted speaking style but none of his former boss's vindictiveness. Miller is far more likely to extend praise to those in the security space whose work he admires than complain about people. (Although he is quick to condemn what he sees as bad ideas and failures, particularly the 2021 Afghanistan pullout.) In a town that runs on political ambition, Miller displays annoyance both at the question of what role he might play in a future Trump administration and, it seemed, at the very possibility. He's most at home in the attire of a man about to go fishing for the day and many, especially Miller himself, consider him too unpolished to make it through a Senate confirmation hearing. But given Trump's expressed preference for acting cabinet secretaries rather than confirmed ones, that is not the barrier it once was. And Miller's low-ego personality could serve him well in an Oval Office run by a man with ego to spare. We caught up with Miller in June to discuss how the Defense Department might change in a second Trump term and to hear his own priorities and thoughts on the future of U.S. defense. In the interview, he said the Project 2025 defense chapter was a collaborative work, involving multiple contributors and committees. He described his role as 'herding cats.&rdquo; Regardless, Miller was happy to endorse and expound on several of its key provisions, many of which did originate from him. Innovation Unlike many of the better-known, more partisan parts of the Heritage Foundation's voluminous Project 2025 document, the chapter on defense contains points and proposals that echo what many national security professionals have been urging for years, and many that the Biden White House has itself attempted to implement. One of these is a core focus on innovating and deploying new weapons far more quickly. He's main complaint of current innovation efforts like the Replicator program and even the Defense Innovation Unit is that such efforts aren't matched with real dollars. Miller's approach, however, differs from the current status quo, placing far greater emphasis on ideas and innovations that emerge from within the department, particularly at the operator level. 'Here's my idea, push down to every battalion-sized unit across all of the services an innovation fund..and let's go bottom up,&rdquo; he said in the interview. '​​Push decentralized innovation down to the kids in the field. Provide them some seed money.&rdquo; Miller also wants to tackle the culture of risk aversion that especially permeates the middle tier of the services by prodding inspectors general to better monitor how innovation funds are spent. 'They go in each year and guarantee that the money is being spent appropriately, that it's tied to the commander's vision and all that. Then we just institutionalize it across the force,&rdquo; he said. Irregular warfare Unsurprisingly, Miller, a former Army Green Beret who first arrived in Afghanistan in December 2001, does not agree with the service's plan to cut U.S. special operations forces. Miller wants irregular warfare to have a larger, even predominant, role in implementing U.S. policy in South and Central America and Africa&mdash;and a smaller one in the Pacific. 'Let Special Operations Command, irregular warfare command, handle Latin America and AFRICOM. Let them compete against whoever it is out there. Let the services just focus on INDOPACOM and the Russian bear.&rdquo; It's a new version of an idea that won serious consideration in the early days of the 2001 operations in the Middle East. Ultimately, combatant commanders killed it, he said. 'All the geographic combat commanders just crushed that because of their authorities and their prerogatives.&rdquo; Defense intelligence The Project 2025 document calls for substantial reform of the defense intelligence apparatus, away from 'peripheral intelligence obligations that do not advance military readiness,&rdquo; including screening people for security clearances. Miller sees a possible combined role for defense intelligence and special operations, in effect transforming the latter into a quasi-intelligence service in order to better anticipate rapidly shifting geopolitical crises. It's a vision similar to that espoused in 2016 by then-SOCOM commander Gen. Tony Thomas. 'This is nothing new. It's been kicked around for ages,&rdquo; Miller said 'There's this almost knee-jerk reaction to it related to civil liberties, that if you have an operational element and an intelligence element working together somehow you might violate American civil liberties. I don't see that. It requires cognizant oversight and serious attention. But we know how to do that.&rdquo; Miller would also place more emphasis on rapid collection and analysis of open-source intelligence. 'We haven't even scratched the surface of the power of open-source intelligence, and we're still kind of stuck in these silos,&rdquo; he said. Space and tactical nuclear weapons The Project 2025 document calls on the United States to 'develop a nuclear arsenal with the size, sophistication, and tailoring&mdash;including new capabilities at the theater level&mdash;to ensure that there is no circumstance in which America is exposed to serious nuclear coercion.&rdquo; Miller said that the issue of low-yield tactical nuclear weapons was a heated one during the Project 2025 committee deliberations and would likely continue to be. But he's willing to consider adding them to America's nuclear arsenal. On space, Miller said the Pentagon can't simply rely on an abundance of cheap, low-earth orbit satellites for resilience. 'Obviously, treaty restrictions for weaponizing space have to be considered. A lot of that is talking about not just space-based weapons, but also cyber effects, other effects,&rdquo; he said. National Guard Miller expressed little enthusiasm for a proposal by former Trump advisor Stephen Miller to send the National Guard into American cities to help deport people. 'I think the risks are a little hyperbolic,&rdquo; he said of the notion sending National Guard units from state to another, even against the will of governors. 'There are enough fire breaks in there&rdquo; to prevent misuse. But he believes that border security is a natural fit for the Guard, which has been helping there for years. Beyond that, he said individual governors should determine the duties of their state's Guard units, while the Pentagon trains and equips Guard units to help deter potential foreign adversaries. Alliances The public perception of Trump as eager to abandon NATO&mdash;a perception Trump himself has at times advanced&mdash;doesn't represent his previous administration's actual policy or current thinking, which primarily emphasizes a need for NATO nations to spend more on collective defense, an idea that alliance officials have also supported. Miller, too, dismissed the notion that Trump was preparing to storm out of the alliance. 'Everybody is concerned that [Trump] means a wholesale pullout of NATO or other organizations. I find that probably a stretch. The ultimate point is better burden-sharing.&rdquo; That expectation for greater individual defense spending by partner militaries would also extend to other countries, such as South Korea. On the topic of joint development, particularly of ships, Miller sounds more like the present Defense Department than the next one. The United States alone just doesn't have the ship-building capabilities to meet the former Trump administration goal of a 350-ship Navy, let alone the service's current stated goal of 381. 'The prohibition against U.S. Navy ships being built in foreign shipyards&mdash;I understand the reason for that, but there are national-security waivers. So why don't we have a serious conversation about shipbuilding capacity in Japan, South Korea? There are other places. You can probably get the Philippines. Australia as well.&rdquo; That opinion, he said, was very much a personal one. 'This is where I am, not where Heritage is. Freaking, I have no idea where the Trump campaign is.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/how-trump-may-shake-dod-insiders-view/400911/	2024-11-07T10:10:50-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/07/GettyImages_1285484786/large.jpg
The D Brief: Russia’s long barrage; Hasty training for Ukrainian ...	Russian drones attacked Ukraine's capital city for eight consecutive hours, injuring at least two people, the Associated Press reported Thursday from Kyiv. Russian forces launched more than 100 Iranian-designed 'Shahed&rdquo; drones at various targets across Ukraine, Kyiv's military said Thursday on Facebook. At least 74 of those were allegedly shot down over Ukraine's Odesa, Mykolaiv, Kherson, Kyiv, Sumy, Poltava, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Zhytomyr, Cherkasy, and Chernihiv regions. Another 25 were marked as 'lost,&rdquo; according to Ukraine's General Staff. Three dozen drones were shot down over Kyiv, 'but falling debris caused damage to a hospital as well as residential and office buildings,&rdquo; AP reports. New: Russia is using decoy drones without warheads to overwhelm Ukraine's air defenses, the New York Times reports. Ukraine's president congratulated Donald Trump 'on his historic landslide victory&rdquo; on Wednesday. 'Strong and unwavering U.S. leadership is vital for the world and for a just peace,&rdquo; Volodymir Zelenskyy wrote on Trump ally Elon Musk's social-media platform. Trump's 'tremendous campaign made this result possible,&rdquo; and Zelenskyy 'praised his family and team for their great work,&rdquo; he said. The pace of war has shortened EU-based training for Ukrainian troops, Sam Skove reported for Defense One weeks after a late-August reporting trip to Poland. Instruction has been trimmed down to the basics in everything from combined arms to officer training, he learned. Ukraine is in desperate need of experienced soldiers. 'Western military training, like that seen in Poland, could be the answer. Western officers say their high-quality training, which emphasizes initiative, is a key advantage that their armies have over Russia. Polish staff, Ukrainian trainers, and Ukrainian soldiers say the effort is bearing fruit,&rdquo; Skove writes. But: 'With Kyiv straining to hold a 600-mile front line against Russian assaults, Ukrainian and Polish officers said soldiers must be rushed through training cycles to get them back to the front. Ukraine's system for selecting soldiers for training, meanwhile, is plagued by inefficiencies that keeps trainers and trainees in a constant scramble to adjust.&rdquo; Story, here.

On this day in 1918, the United States stood up the Third Army&mdash;today's U.S. Army Central&mdash;to disarm and disband German forces during World War I. Europe Germany's government collapsed Wednesday, prompting snap elections and a new wave of uncertainty for a country with the world's third-largest economy. 'The collapse of [Chancellor Olaf] Scholz's three-way alliance caps months of wrangling over budget policy and Germany's economic direction, with the government's popularity sinking and far-right and far-left forces surging,&rdquo; Reuters reported from Berlin. 'With France also facing political uncertainty after snap elections this year, turmoil in the European Union's two largest economies could hamper efforts to deepen the bloc's integration at a time when it is facing challenges from east and west,&rdquo; the wire service reports. The Brits just sanctioned 56 people and organizations linked to Russia, 'including those in the Wagner mercenary group that operates unofficially on Vladimir Putin's behalf, and companies based in China, Turkey and central Asia supplying parts to Russia,&rdquo; Sky News reported Thursday. One of those sanctioned includes a military officer believed to have helped poison former double agent Sergei Skripal back in 2018. Around the Defense Department What the Army learned from its first all-digital ground vehicle design. The XM-30&mdash;once known as the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle&mdash;'is being built through a modular open standard that allows us, in theory, to more rapidly replace components, which allows us to modernize more quickly,&rdquo; Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean, the program executive officer for ground combat systems. Read the story and watch the interview by Defense One's Lauren C. Williams. This afternoon in Washington, Jason Rathje of the Pentagon's Office of Strategic Capital is set to speak at a panel discussion themed around 'Funding Allied Innovation: Ensuring Advanced Capabilities for the Future Warfighter,&rdquo; hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Rathje will be joined by NATO defense startup official Barbara McQuiston, and alliance innovation official Dame Fiona Murray. That event is slated for 1 p.m. ET. Details and livestream here.

European Union climate monitors say they are &lsquo;virtually certain' that 2024 will become the warmest year on record, and like that it will be 'the first full calendar year when temperatures rose more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial average &mdash; a critical line signaling that Earth is crossing into territory where some extreme climate effects may be irreversible,&rdquo; writes the Washington Post. What that means: 'Scientists have long warned what would happen if Earth consistently stayed at 1.5 degrees Celsius above the preindustrial era: heavier precipitation, more extreme temperatures, more intense and frequent droughts, an ice-free summer in the Arctic and more. Exceeding 1.5 degrees could cause an irreversible collapse of some places on Earth, such as our ocean circulation systems and coral reefs, and thawing permafrost.&rdquo; More, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/the-d-brief-november-07-2024/400908/	2024-11-07T08:16:10-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/07/DB_lander/large.png
Pace of war shortens EU-based training for Ukrainian troops	AT A TRAINING SITE IN POLAND&mdash;On the monitor, a row of drone feeds piped in live footage from a war zone: Russia's Kursk province, where Ukrainian forces have been fighting since August. Sitting in front of the monitor, an Ukrainian officer kept an eye on the feed. Just behind him, officers clustered around an enormous paper map, on which Ukrainian and Russian forces sprawled in long sinuous lines. The drone stream was real. The battle on the map wasn't. The officer watching the drone feed had no soldiers to control, nor did the busy officers bustling behind him and manning computers. The eager Ukrainian brigade staff were instead focused on a training exercise, part of a 21-day crash course run in Poland as part of the EU mission for training Ukraine's army. The drone streams were being incorporated into the fictional exercise&mdash;although Ukrainian officers wouldn't say how, citing operational security. As the Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine grinds into its third year, Ukraine is in desperate need of experienced troops. Western military training, like that seen in Poland, could be the answer. Western officers say their high-quality training, which emphasizes initiative, is a key advantage that their armies have over Russia. Polish staff, Ukrainian trainers, and Ukrainian soldiers say the effort is bearing fruit. Per a request from the Polish training effort, all soldiers are referred to only by their nationality and occupation to preserve their anonymity amid Russian sabotage efforts targeting Poland. However, it's no easy task to fight an existential war while training up new troops, as seen by Defense One during a visit in late August to Poland. [[Related Posts]] With Kyiv straining to hold a 600-mile front line against Russian assaults, Ukrainian and Polish officers said soldiers must be rushed through training cycles to get them back to the front. Ukraine's system for selecting soldiers for training, meanwhile, is plagued by inefficiencies that keeps trainers and trainees in a constant scramble to adjust. The EU Mission Russia has lost as many as 600,000 soldiers, wounded and dead. That figure exceeds the Russian army's estimated ground strength at the beginning of the war&mdash;360,000 troops&mdash; and is the most casualties Moscow's armies have suffered since Soviet losses in World War II. But Ukraine's losses have also been high, with an estimated 80,000 dead and 400,000 wounded, the Wall Street Journal reported. Many units are exhausted, operating with fewer troops than they need and desperate for ammunition. Russia, meanwhile, is using its superiority in munitions and personnel to break through Ukrainian lines in areas that had once been secure. The U.S. and its allies in NATO have worked to replenish Ukraine's losses through training. Among the largest efforts is the EU Military Assistance Mission (EUMAM) Ukraine, which coordinates EU member states' efforts to train soldiers. Speaking from a conference room on a military base, where upbeat music played incongruously on hallway speakers, Polish staff detailed a sweeping mission that's training a large percentage of the EU total. In 2023, EUMAM's staff in Poland trained 10,528 troops. Poland is aiming to train some12,000 in 2024, one-fifth of the EU's overall goal of 60,000. The multinational mission in Poland runs specialist training, in which medics, sappers, artillerymen, tank crews, and other specialized soldiers refine their skills or gain new ones. It also operates leadership courses, including training for platoon leaders, non-commissioned officers, battalion staff officers, and brigade staff. Western officials sometimes frame non-commissioned leadership training in particular as the secret ingredient in Ukraine's successful defense early in the war. The EUMAM mission in Poland also runs collective training for squads, platoons, and companies, in which soldiers learn to work with each other and other types of units, like mortars. The mission also began running basic training courses in August. Speaking from his office, the Polish deputy commander of the training effort said that Ukraine saw particular value in learning NATO-standard methods of doing battle damage assessment and in civil-military relations, as well as in specialized courses like electronic warfare and emergency medical training. The Polish side also gets to see modern warfare nearly first-hand. Ukrainian troops train on real combat scenarios, some of them drawn from battles they actually fought in. They also bring along with them drones, including armed ones. But Ukraine's desperate need for more troops warps training in ways that weaken their effectiveness. Most courses run for just a month, or slightly longer&mdash;far shorter than the multiple months that Western militaries devote to similar types of training, according to a briefing slide. Collective training for squads, platoons, and companies runs for one week each. Ukraine sets those timetables based on their needs, the deputy commander of the Polish EUMAM mission said. But the EU can't train all the necessary skills in just a month, the commander said. Consequently, training must focus on what the soldiers 'need to have,&rdquo; he said. 'If we could have more time, then we will provide more types of training, and it will be more complex.&rdquo; Programs to train Ukrainian soldiers as instructors who can then work in Ukraine under a program dubbed 'train the trainers&rdquo; also struggle in Ukraine's high intensity conflict. Ukraine will use such soldiers for training for a few months, and then be forced to send them into battle, where their skills are lost if they're killed, the deputy commander said. 'He will go to the battle, and he will disappear somewhere,&rdquo; said the deputy. 'And we need to train another guy.&rdquo; Ukraine will also split up battalions trained in Poland into their component companies, the deputy said. 'Even if you are providing the collective training for the battalion after that, when they are coming back to Ukraine, they are coming for the two places, and they will be split and they will join the different brigades,&rdquo; he said. Although the center trains both brigade staff and the battalions that theoretically fight under them, in reality it's a 'luxury&rdquo; situation when a brigade and battalion from the same unit are present at the same time, he added. Communication between the incoming Ukrainian units and the trainers is another challenge, added a Ukrainian liaison officer, echoing statements by American forces involved in training Ukraine. Often, trainers won't know their trainees' level of experience until they arrive. 'Instructors have to be very, very flexible,&rdquo; he said. Some of this is down to bureaucratic inefficiency. For instance, Ukrainian officers told to send sappers to Poland for further training will identify candidates based on their qualifications on paper. However, in reality that candidate's training may be years out of date, or not to the standard that trainers are expecting. Trainers must then spend time rejigging coursework. And even if these soldiers have some experience from prior service, their experiences may not be relevant in today's modern battlefield. 'Twenty years ago, nobody [was] thinking about drones, nobody [was] thinking about software,&rdquo; said the liaison officer. Ukraine's need for infantry also means that it must retrain soldiers from other parts of the Army, like logistics. Those soldiers are better than raw recruits as they already have experience of being shelled, but it still takes time to train them to lead infantry, he said. 'For us, it's much better if he has participated in the war and he knows what war&rdquo; is. Brigade training Later that day at the brigade staff training, at least some of the officers were exactly that: experienced soldiers with ample time on the battlefield. The commander of the brigade, a flint-eyed colonel who preferred cigarettes to the vapes often seen in the hands of Ukrainian soldiers, had previously fought in Ukraine's liberation on Kharkiv province in its 2022 campaign. The colonel was already well acquainted with how technology has changed the battlefield. Thanks to Russian drones and anti-tank strikes, he said he must keep command vehicles up to 10 kilometers from the front to avoid being targeted. He has other ways of keeping touch, though. During Ukraine's major counter-offensive in Kharkiv, the colonel said, he used a commercial Starlink satellite dish to keep in touch with soldiers who, due to the speed of their advance, were as far as 62 miles away. Much of the training at the brigade staff headquarters is run by Ukrainian trainers, who praised the EUMAM mission for providing them with the logistics, housing, food, safety necessary to run their training. The training process typically starts when the trainers make contact with the incoming unit and learn what skills it wants to focus on, said one trainer. That typically happens just a few days before the new brigade staff arrives, giving the trainers little time to prepare. With a full-scale war on, though, there's little choice. Ukraine needs new staff officers, a deficiency that think tank RUSI has identified as one of the key problems facing Ukraine's army and a factor in its failed summer counter-offensive in 2023. Part of the training involves familiarizing officers with the range of home-brewed battlefield intelligence platforms that Ukraine uses, like the battlefield-mapping software Kropyva and the intelligence platform Delta. Just like the U.S. Army, the units also train on paper maps, which can show data even when the power goes out, the trainer said. The trainer said that an emphasis is placed on using drones. Ukraine operates a broad range of drones, including small first-person-view suicide drones, quadcopter observation drones, drone bombers, and fixed-wing surveillance drones. The units also benefit by getting to use real data from past battles. As with everything in Ukraine, though, manpower is a major factor. Parts of the training are drawn from the U.S.'s Military Decision-Making Process, a guideline for managing staff. The process rests in part on the U.S. Army's practice of mission command, in which soldiers are given objectives and given broad authority to achieve them in whatever way they see fit. Its effectiveness relies in part on trust that soldiers are well-trained enough to make decisions on their own. The practice contrasts with historic Ukraine military doctrine, which emphasizes detailed command, in which commanders are expected to plan military operations down to the last detail and soldiers are given less initiative. The U.S. system requires highly trained soldiers to operate effectively, said the Ukrainian brigade staff trainer. Soldiers in the U.S. system rely on years of training, particularly for the non-commissioned officers and officers who spearhead military operations. Ukraine, though, has only weeks or at most months to train soldiers, and brigade staff training is just 21 days. The units the brigade will lead have just a few weeks to train in complex combined arms operations. MDMP works when armies have experienced sergeant or commanders, the trainer said. 'But when you have a lot of casualties, such a system can break,&rdquo; he said. Consequently, Ukrainian trainers teach a blend of the two styles, he said. A handful of brigades staffed by experienced soldiers do use organizational strategies that are closer to MDMP, he said. Combined-arms training Later the next day, Defense One arrived at a sprawling training base designed for collective training. Poland works with Ukraine to make the training as realistic as possible, said the Polish deputy commander of the training unit, pointing to how Ukrainian engineers had advised them on building trenches. The double line of trenches were covered in the remains of blue plastic practice grenades. Unit training there included a battalion training in combined arms maneuvers, as well as others learning how to operate new weapons, like sniper rifles and Javelins. Crowded into a small room on the base, a group of soldiers from a specialized unit that focuses on assaults were practicing their skills using the U.S. made Javelin anti-tank missile using an electronic simulator. Others outside practiced their skill in identifying enemy vehicles, using a combination of binoculars and small plastic models of tanks set on a table some distance away. The men were experienced, having fought in the intense fighting around Chasiv Yar during the last year. In keeping with Ukrainian struggles to attract younger soldiers, though, many appeared above the average age of 40, including one soldier with a beard like Santa Claus. Their senior non-commissioned officer, a lean former construction worker, said that the unit operated along mission command principles that favor initiative. The soldier said he had joined a local territorial defense unit in the first days of the war, then transitioned to a regular military unit later once he was formally drafted. Now, he said he saw the Army as a career, and intended to become a professional soldier. His unit, he said, operated according to NATO principles that gave more autonomy to lower ranked soldiers. The non-commissioned officer wasn't alone. A battalion commander of another reconnaissance unit out practicing rifle skills said similarly that his battalion was run according to mission command principles. In a reflection of Western slowness in arming Ukraine &mdash; stemming from both production problems and political infighting &mdash; units sometimes had relatively little live ammunition to train with, said one Ukrainian training officer. Other problems were simpler, but no less hard to fix. Poland uses a laser-tag like system similar to the U.S. MILES system for training troops, but Ukraine uses a different type of rifle that's not compatible with the system, the liaison officer said. The Ukrainian battalion in training did, however, have its full complement of over 200 soldiers which is in keeping with U.S. estimates of Ukraine's battalion sizes. But manpower isn't the only issue for Ukraine, noted the Ukrainian liaison officer at the EUMAM headquarters. Perhaps the greatest challenge, though, is the supply of equipment, they said. Ukraine can draft&mdash;and send&ndash;many more of its men. But without more weapons and vehicles to replace those lost in the war, Ukraine would not actually be able to arm them. 'If you see how the war goes, everyday we have losses not only in soldiers, but in equipment,&rdquo; he said. 'And there's only one way which we have to [replace] what is damaged. That means [deliveries from] partner nations, or our industry&rdquo; he said. 'Our industry, it's not very big.&rdquo; This article was completed with support from the Transatlantic Media Fellowship grant from the Heinrich B&ouml;ll Foundation.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/pace-war-shortens-eu-based-training-ukrainian-troops/400895/	2024-11-06T14:34:53-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/06/Screenshot_2024_11_06_at_12.31.19PM/large.png
What the Army learned from its first all-digital ground vehicle d...	The Army is betting on digital engineering to save time and money as it develops its new infantry combat vehicle. 'XM-30 is being built through a modular open standard that allows us, in theory, to more rapidly replace components, which allows us to modernize more quickly,&rdquo; Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean, the program executive officer for ground combat systems, told Defense One during an interview. The Army has traditionally deployed an updated combat vehicle 'about every 10 years,&rdquo; Dean said. 'Some of that's driven by the industrial timelines of what it takes to stand up the supply chain in the factory and building the vehicle, but some of that's because the way we have architected software in the past is not as flexible.&rdquo; By leaning on digital engineering&mdash;a practice the Army has been embracing more broadly&mdash;the Army can spot deficiencies in vehicle designs sooner. The XM-30 is the service's latest effort to replace the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicle. The Army in 2023 selected two contractors, Rheinmetall Vehicles and General Dynamics Land Systems, to produce prototypes for the XM-30. The contracts are worth about $1.6 billion. The XM-30 program, formerly called the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, is the Army's first ground combat vehicle designed completely digitally, Dean said. And by using modular open system architecture, different systems from different vendors can be put together&mdash;and work seamlessly&mdash;on the same platform. [[Related Posts]] 'We are actually building the stand-in capability. So it's not the final XM-30, but it's a surrogate for it that will allow us to test that,&rdquo; Dean said. That demonstrator platform will allow each contractor to install and change out their systems to see how quickly it can be done. 'And that's tied to our digital acquisition, digital engineering effort, which XM-30 is a born-digital program. All of its design work is essentially being done in the cloud, tied to model-based assessment,&rdquo; he said. 'We have unprecedented insight into [the] level of design, level of detail, level of interaction between the components and the design, all the way from preliminary design through how we validate and test whether all the performance parameters we specify we are actually going to achieve.&rdquo; But before contractors can build physical XM-30 prototypes to test, the Army needs to finalize the vehicle's design through a critical design review in fiscal year 2025. 'This is the first time we've taken a complete system through that level of design in a purely digital space,&rdquo; he said. 'We've learned quite a bit based on the amount of insight we're getting through that digital process. A little bit frightening, because we learn we know a lot more than we ever did before. Before we do these design reviews, everybody would get in the room for a week, and we'd go through the 500-PowerPoint slide presentation about every system on the platform. And you thought you saw how everything interrelated. Now, we're seeing we didn't. There's a lot of holes in our knowledge that we now actually can see live in real time. And so we believe we're getting to the end product, a better end product sooner than we were before.&rdquo; Dean said there's still work to be done to realize digital engineering's benefits, but the goal is for the combat vehicle industrial base to 'match what we've seen in the commercial space.&rdquo; 'We're building new tools. We're building new relationships. XM-30 is kind of unique in that in some ways, it's highly joint&mdash;they are using Air Force software development tools in the Space Force cloud, using a bunch of best practices that we adopted from some Navy development programs. So we've really benefited from the total force modernization,&rdquo; Dean said. 'We're training, now, people to operate in a digital environment, and that, I think, is going to pay us forward for generations.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/11/what-army-learned-its-first-all-digital-ground-vehicle-design/400857/	2024-11-06T10:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/06/Screenshot_2024_11_05_at_10.40.29PM/large.png
The D Brief: Trump wins; Israel fires defense minister; China’s n...	Trump win shakes up U.S. and its role in the world He's back: Donald Trump secured enough Electoral College votes to emerge victorious following Tuesday's historic American election, giving the 45th and now 47th president what he called an 'unprecedented and powerful mandate&rdquo; to carry out his policies in the months to come. With his win, Trump also becomes the first U.S. president with a felony conviction and just the second ever (joining Grover Cleveland of the Gilded Age) to return to the White House after an election loss. What mattered to voters: Immigration and the economy were the top concerns heading into the polls. The Trump campaign promised dramatic changes on both fronts, including mass deportations using National Guard troops in an effort that could forcibly remove an estimated one million people per year, according to his running mate, JD Vance. Trump also promised travel bans, as in 2016, for people from countries including Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, as well as Gaza. And just like in 2016, Trump has promised to continue building a wall along the southern border with Mexico, an effort that was ultimately slowed by a lack of federal funding. With wins in Ohio, Montana, and West Virginia, the election also handed Republicans control of the Senate. As a result, few observers expect significant obstacles to most of Trump's plans, and a conservative 6-3 majority in the Supreme Court further reinforces these projections. One X factor in Trump's power forecast: Control in the House of Representatives is still undecided as of early Wednesday, with around 50 races yet to be called, according to the Associated Press. Another win for Trump: At least two ongoing criminal prosecutions of the president-elect are likely to end, as he will control the Department of Justice. Those include pending federal cases regarding his retention of classified information after leaving office, and his efforts to block the 2020 election. As one lawyer from Protect Democracy told Reuters, just because Trump will almost certainly shut those cases down 'won't mean it was the right thing.&rdquo; The future of Ukraine? Trump's stated desire to broker a quick deal between the leaders of Kyiv and Moscow likely means Russia keeps most if not all of its invaded territory. And ahead of Inauguration Day, 'Russia will see [Trump's win] as an incentive to keep on pressing home its advantage in numbers,' predicts Matthew Savill of the London-based Royal United Services Institute. President Biden still has more than $5 billion in Presidential Drawdown Authority for Ukraine; so the weeks ahead could see a significant portion of that pledged or distributed&mdash;though precisely how and in what form remains unclear. As for NATO and Europe, both face 'a series of compounding problems,&rdquo; Savill's RUSI colleague Ed Arnold writes. The alliance 'will have to put all its energy into keeping the organization together in close to its current form, shifting the focus to internal management, rather than the growing external threat of Russia,&rdquo; he says. In addition to Trump-promised universal tariffs of at least 10%, the European Union will need to forge 'coalitions of the willing&hellip;requiring bold leadership which has been lacking for several years,&rdquo; says Arnold. And according to Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy, And the Middle East? 'Gulf states, chiefly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, likely believe there is more to be gained under the second Trump presidency, such as US security guarantees, arm deals, and a tougher stance on Iran,&rdquo; RUSI's Burcu Ozcelik writes. 'It is difficult to see how a Trump administration will pivot to improve the situation for Palestinians,&rdquo; he adds. But in large part, 'Many in the region will be readying for a return to Trump's transactional diplomacy&mdash;a tit-for-tat, business-deal-making approach&mdash;that the regional political elite will be familiar with from the previous Trump administration,&rdquo; he says. As for China and the economy, Trump promised tariffs as high as 60% on incoming Chinese products. Germany's Kiel Institute for the World Economy forecasts 'profound economic losses&rdquo; from Trump's economic plans, including a 0.5% decline in the European Union's GDP, and more than a 3% drop in German productivity; however, 'China would bear the greatest losses,&rdquo; Kiel wrote in October. Relatedly, Trump's promised domestic tax cuts are expected to raise the U.S. debt by nearly $8 trillion through 2035. Big picture: 'We do not know what will happen to the US,&rdquo; British academic Renaud Foucart writes in The Conversation. 'Maybe prohibitive tariffs or destroying the institutions that made the US such an economic powerhouse will make the US economy less relevant. But this is something Americans have chosen, and something the rest of the world simply has to live with.&rdquo; Welcome to this Wednesday edition of The D Brief, brought to you by Ben Watson and Bradley Peniston.

What Trump’s win means for the federal workforce	Donald Trump is projected to return to the White House next January, according to the Associated Press, and is poised to spur the most dramatic reimagining of the staffing of government in more than a century. That's because Trump has vowed to revive Schedule F, a controversial abortive effort at the end of his first term to strip the civil service protections of potentially tens of thousands of career federal workers in 'policy-related&rdquo; positions, effectively making them at-will employees. Trump and many of his former staffers have frequently bemoaned that 'rogue bureaucrats&rdquo; inhibited his policymaking power during his first stint in the White House. Though President Biden quickly rescinded Schedule F when he took office in 2021&mdash;before any positions could be converted out of the federal government's competitive service&mdash;that hasn't stopped Trump and his allies from working on the initiative in absentia. Both the Heritage Foundation and America First Policy Institute, which have organized dueling unofficial transition projects have endorsed reviving Schedule F, going so far as to creating lists of upwards of 50,000 current career civil servants to strip of their removal protections and threaten with termination. And the America First Policy Institute, which The New York Times reported last month has recently gained favor with Trump after Heritage's Project 2025 transition project and policy playbook proved unpopular with voters, has called for more sweeping changes, such as converting the entire federal workforce into at-will employees and outlawing collective bargaining at federal agencies altogether. Though Biden has sought to install new safeguards against politicizing the federal workforce via Office of Personnel Management regulations defining 'policy-related&rdquo; workers as political appointees and requiring agencies that convert employees out of the competitive service to allow current workers to retain their civil service protections. But in interviews earlier this year, experts described the effort as akin to a speed bump. 'Of course, any effort to try to launch Schedule F again would immediately be met with an effort to stop it in courts,&rdquo; Kettl told Government Executive in September. 'But my conclusion is that it is probably constitutional. If unions and Democrats challenge it, they will probably lose. That path also would require finding a plaintiff with standing&mdash;someone who can prove they've been injured. It would take time to find the right plaintiff and to wait for the Trump administration to take action that frames the issues in just the right way . . . and then it goes through a tremendous maze of a process. It would probably take at least two years to resolve the constitutional questions, which at that point, even if Schedule F loses, it would provide two years for the administration to establish a new pattern of practice.&rdquo; On labor issues, Trump is likely to revive a series of executive orders making it easier to fire federal workers and severely curtailing union access to the workplace, both by evicting labor officials from agency office space and cutting access to official time, a practice by which federal workers who serve as union leaders are compensated by the government for time spent on representational activities, such as collective bargaining negotiations and representing employees in disciplinary hearings and litigation. Union officials say that their members are in a much stronger position than they were entering Trump's first term, thanks in no small part to a series of Biden administration edicts encouraging agencies to work collaboratively with labor partners and expanding what topics unions may negotiate over with management. Over the last four years, many unions have negotiated contracts whose terms run until after the 2028 presidential election, making it harder for agencies to implement workforce policy changes unilaterally on their bargaining units, and unions representing workers at agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency secured 'scientific integrity&rdquo; provisions to protect employees from being retaliated against for doing their jobs. But like with Schedule F, they acknowledged that in an all-out assault on organized labor in government, these provisions may not be foolproof. 'If they're just going to disregard the rules, there isn't going to be anything to protect anyone&mdash;not even just scientists, but anyone,&rdquo; said Nicole Cantello, legislative and political coordinator for the American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, which represents EPA workers, in June. 'Sure, that could definitely happen. That's a concern for every federal employee, that they don't know what [a second Trump] administration would put into action against feds.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]]	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/what-trumps-win-means-federal-workforce/400873/	2024-11-06T07:00:34-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/06/Donald_Trump_thanks_2500/large.jpg
Is Europe prepared for the U.S. election outcome?	Earlier this year, we emphasized the need&mdash;and increasing urgency&mdash;for Europe to improve its defense capabilities and create a degree of independence from the United States. It is not clear what progress NATO, and European member states specifically, have made. While a victory by Donald Trump can be expected to more drastically shift Washington's efforts away from European defense, even the Biden/Harris administration prioritized reprioritization of the Middle East and a 'pivot&rdquo; toward Asia. European states do appear to be reprioritizing their collective security and capabilities, particularly as they face a multiplicity of threats and an uncertain future with its U.S. partner. The alliance's choice for its new secretary general&mdash;Mark Rutte, a former prime minister of the Netherlands known for his pragmatic and consensus-driven leadership&mdash;suggests that members sought a leader who will not only staunchly back Ukraine, but also bolster its defense in the face of an emboldened Russia. Over the summer, NATO also concluded its largest military exercise since the Cold War, which saw over 90,000 troops engaged, practicing rapid deployment across the Atlantic and Europe. At the NATO Washington Summit in July, member countries pledged to provide long-term support for Ukraine and adopted numerous policies and strategies on pressing issues. Notably, the alliance updated its Policy Guidelines on Counter-Terrorism and NATO leaders also endorsed a revised AI strategy to accelerate the responsible use of AI within the alliance. NATO also announced in August it is working on adopting emerging and disruptive technologies and establishing principles regarding responsible use. These recent initiatives respond to some of the biggest challenges the alliance faces: Russia's aggression and hybrid activities, a proliferation of cyber threats from foreign interference to hacking, a rise in violent extremism and terrorism, including far-right and Salafi-jihadism, and the role of emerging technologies in amplifying and compounding many of these issues. However, such progress may not be enough to respond to an uncertain future partnership with the White House, particularly with the potential of a Russia-sympathetic administration, a protracted conflict in the Middle East, or the changing dynamics on the continent itself, such as the rise of far-right parties, many of whom have pro-Russian stances and have sought to shift security priorities. [[Related Posts]] The concept of 'Trump-proofing&rdquo; the alliance has been previously discussed, including at the Washington Summit in July, where leaders brainstormed ways to safeguard the alliance and the international security order from potential disruptions resulting from a change in administrations. Yet, in reality, not much can be done to ensure the alliance's vitality through pre-emptive action. Some NATO allies are reaching out to individuals close to the former president to mitigate risk. Others are pushing for the establishment of a NATO bank, that would support defense spending and safeguard collective security. These efforts mean little without future U.S. support for the transatlantic project. Moreover, the concept of 'trump-proofing&rdquo; itself may be considered antidemocratic and reinforce the skepticism of and distrust in international institutions that is increasingly common among the Western electorate. While examining the implications for European security strategy and the future of the Alliance under each presidential candidate is important, it's clear that U.S. priorities will increasingly shift back toward the Middle East as the Israel-Hamas conflict continues and widens, regardless of the election outcome. Resources may also be redirected toward international counterterrorism efforts alongside strategic competition priorities. FBI Director Christopher Wray highlighted earlier this year an unprecedented number of simultaneous threats to the United States, including terrorism from across the ideological spectrum, foreign election interference, espionage, among others. Further, although the much-discussed U.S. pivot to the Indo-Pacific has yet to fully materialize, it would be shortsighted to ignore the potential for increased U.S. engagement in that region, especially given the strengthening alliance among hostile authoritarian regimes, including Iran, North Korea, Russia, and China. Despite the small victories NATO has achieved in recent months, Europe must not be na&iuml;ve about its future security and should reconsider its overreliance on the United States. A Harris administration would likely provide continuity with its predecessor in its policies around NATO and Europe. Although Harris may be less marked by Cold War-era security politics, she has explicitly vowed to continue supporting Ukraine against Russian aggression and building international alliances to safeguard U.S. interests against authoritarian regimes. During her speech to the Democratic National Convention in August, she explicitly stated her administration would stand with NATO allies and Ukraine if she became president, emphasizing this commitment. That leaders are trying to 'Trump-proof&rdquo; NATO is a testimony to lessons learned during the former president's tenure. Trump frequently called the alliance obsolete and suggested that U.S. commitment to NATO's mutual defense clause would depend on whether individual member states met their financial obligations. Nevertheless, the former administration was all bark, no bite: the U.S. did not reduce its military presence in Europe, while Trump participated in diplomatic engagements with NATO leaders albeit with a more transactional and finance-oriented focus. His presidency, when looked at in terms of European spending on defense, was in some respects a relative success, seemingly catalyzing increased investment by the Europeans in their own defense. With a picture emerging of what a second Trump administration's potential NATO policy would look like, all signs point to the former president remaining NATO-skeptical, with an increasingly transactional policy toward the continent. This could perhaps be a positive development for accelerating European Strategic Autonomy, were it not coupled with Trump's propensity to side with Russia. Trump is considering cutting back on intelligence-sharing with European NATO member states. Without the full weight of the U.S. intelligence apparatus, Europe's situational awareness on Russia&mdash;and its ability to counter ever-increasing Russian aggression and interference on European soil&mdash;is bound to decrease drastically. Moreover, Trump has stated he could resolve the conflict between Ukraine and Russia in a day, implying a settlement rather than the full restoration of Ukraine's borders. At a February rally in South Carolina, Trump said he would encourage Russia to do 'whatever the hell they want&rdquo; to any NATO member country that doesn't meet spending guidelines on defense. Former President Trump has also allegedly continued conversations with President Vladimir Putin after he left office, including one conversation where Trump discouraged U.S. military aid for Ukraine, according to journalist Bob Woodward. If true, coupled with Trump's public statements on Russia and European alliances, a bleak picture emerges for the future of NATO. While it seems that the United States would not exit the Alliance, it could potentially become a quid-pro-quo driven organization, severely tarnished by perceived sympathy for Russia by its primary benefactor. The outcome of the U.S. presidential election will not only affect NATO and European defense more broadly, but also serve to fuse with and embolden forces currently at work on the continent itself. The rise of far-right populist parties in Europe&mdash;that are often both Euroskeptic and pro-Russian&mdash;has translated into notable electoral successes in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, France, among others. These leaders represent a growing faction within the European Parliament&mdash;particularly among Central European populists&mdash;that have advocated for decreasing support for Ukraine and aligning more closely with Russian interests. Not only could a Trump presidency strengthen these groups, and vice versa, at the national and the EU levels, but also weaken the Alliance and other security institutions, particularly in the face of an emboldened Russia. Although Russia's largely successful influence over the European far-right has been demonstrated, the increasing convergence of the continent's far-right and far-left populist forces means that the threat to European security does not cut neatly across ideological lines, as seen in joint protests in the Czech Republic. Slovakia's left-wing, pro-Russian Prime Minister Robert Fico&mdash;who pledged earlier this month he will 'never agree to Ukraine joining NATO&rdquo;&mdash;is also an apt example. As these parties continue to capitalize on the war in Ukraine, energy prices, and the cost-of-living crisis, coupled with institutional grievances amongst some in the European electorate, a Trump administration could potentially strengthen the hand of these parties and substantially shift European security priorities, weakening the continent's ability to defend itself against foreign interference and aggression. The impact of U.S. leadership on European security is far more nuanced than a simple good-bad dichotomy. While it is clear that Trump's pro-Russian inclinations would wreak significant havoc on the Alliance, European security cannot be tied to the health of NATO regardless of who will be in charge across the Atlantic. The United States currently has its eyes re-fixed on the Middle East, and as the war shows no signs of abating and a ceasefire seemingly out of reach, expecting a Harris Administration to fully hedge Europe's security and future is naive at best. As rising European populist forces demonstrate, failing to strengthen Europe's strategic autonomy and defenses will likely weaken its overall security regardless of who occupies the White House. The German newspaper Die Welt recently examined NATO's updated military plans and discovered a significant increase in demands placed on member states since 2022. In addition to calling for an increase in the number of troops ready to fight against a Russia, NATO military leaders are urging for a rapid increase in anti-aircraft and anti-missile defense capabilities. Playtime is over; it's time to view NATO as a complement rather than the backbone of a robust European security apparatus.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/11/europe-prepared-us-election-outcome/400841/	2024-11-05T13:03:51-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/05/GettyImages_2182379630/large.jpg
FBI: 'Not credible' bomb threats tied to Russian email addresses	Bomb threats that have slowed or delayed polling processes around the nation appear to be tied to a slew of Russian email addresses, the FBI said in a Tuesday afternoon statement. 'The FBI is aware of bomb threats to polling locations in several states, many of which appear to originate from Russian email domains. None of the threats have been determined to be credible thus far,&rdquo; the statement reads. Russia propagated a fake bomb threat targeting a polling place in Georgia, whose Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Tuesday such a threat was not credible. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has not observed any sustained, coordinated influence operation that's been built on the bomb threats, though agency senior advisor Cait Conley said, 'We should not be surprised if we do, because, as we've been saying for months, our foreign adversaries will seek out opportunities and capitalize on those opportunities&rdquo; to undermine confidence in the administration of the election. Moscow has backed election-disinformation efforts over the past several months, aiming to tip the election to GOP candidate Donald Trump, previous intelligence assessments have stated. Kremlin spin doctors also created a video purporting to show a person from Haiti claiming to have fraudulently voted several times in counties around Georgia, the U.S. intelligence community said Friday. Russia's foreign ministry did not return a request for comment on Tuesday afternoon's FBI attribution. 'We are in communication with impacted entities and will continue to provide support as possible,&rdquo; said Conley in a Tuesday afternoon briefing with reporters. 'While incidents may occur and things like this may cause temporary disruptions to the process, there are measures in place that election officials have implemented to ensure the security and resilience of the overall election administration process.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] Broadly speaking, America's cyber and infrastructure defense agency still isn't clocking any serious national-level threats to election security as of 2:30 p.m. EST, as most polls around the nation have opened. Myriad technical incidents have surfaced throughout Election Day. Voters in Pennsylvania's Cambria and Bedford counties reported software glitches with their voting machines. A court order issued in Cambria extended open voting times to allow for affected individuals to cast their ballot. In New York City, some Queens-based polling sites faced ballot-scanning issues, though the city's Board of Elections said that 'voters have not been impacted beyond additional attempts to scan their ballot&rdquo; and some have placed them into a back-up bin to be counted later, according to a post on X. Various scanning glitches have been observed in Virginia, Alabama, Minnesota, and a handful of other states, though volunteers at polling sites are working to ensure those ballots are cast and counted, according to a statement from Verified Voting, a group focused on mitigating technology risks in the administration of U.S. elections.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russian-email-domains-sent-uncredible-bomb-threats-polling-places-fbi-says/400843/	2024-11-05T12:10:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/05/110524georgiaNG-1/large.jpg
So far, no 'national-level significant incidents' on Election Day...	The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is tracking no 'national-level significant incidents&rdquo; that would affect the security of today's presidential election, a top agency official said Tuesday morning. Cait Conley, a CISA senior advisor focused on election infrastructure security, told reporters that the DHS agency is 'tracking instances of extreme weather&rdquo; and minor infrastructure disruptions that are largely expected and tend to be routine for election officials. Conley did not say where these were occurring. 'We are not currently tracking any national-level significant incidents impacting the security of our election infrastructure,&rdquo; she said in a briefing. The remarks come as Americans go to the polls to cast their vote in what's expected to be a deadlocked election between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. Last night, the intelligence community said that it was tracking a slew of Russian and Iranian-affiliated online activity that's seeking to turn the tide of the election. 'Russia is the most active threat. Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences, judging from information available to the IC,&rdquo; the statement says. This morning, the FBI warned of instances in which its name and authoritative status was being exploited to peddle false narratives about the safety of the election. One case involves a fabricated newsclip purporting to show a terrorist threat warning, while another is a sham statement saying Americans should 'vote remotely&rdquo; because of terrorism risks at polling stations. 'This video is not authentic and does not accurately represent the current threat posture or polling location safety,&rdquo; FBI said in a statement. CISA is running an election-operations room in Arlington, Virginia, where the agency has gathered election coordinating partners plus federal entities, including Postal Service officials and the FBI, Conley said. There are also ten regional election-security advisors on site that represent different parts of the country. The operations center has lines of communication with the intelligence community. Most of the operations nexus functions in an unclassified manner, but there are classified sections made available in the event staff need briefings on nation-state or cybercriminal operatives seeking to meddle in the election process, she added. [[Related Posts]] CISA is notably not in active communication with social media firms, a dynamic born out of what eventually became a Supreme Court case that considered whether Biden administration agencies have the ability to stay in contact with social media platforms about removing posts that could contain disinformation. The court sided with the Biden White House in June, providing agencies a form of legal cover to help take down mis- and disinformation. But CISA has still taken a more cautious approach amid prevailing GOP concerns of content censorship. 'As we've said in previous statements, we are not engaging directly with social media companies, but if a threat were to arise that would necessitate us to do so, we would absolutely reach out,&rdquo; Conley said. 'With respect to when we engage [with social platforms], in terms of foreign malign influence or disinformation &mdash; at the federal-government level &mdash; there is a process that is outlined to do so.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/cisa-has-not-clocked-any-national-level-significant-incidents-impacting-election-official-says/400833/	2024-11-05T10:02:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/05/110524ConleyNG-1/large.jpg
The D Brief: National Guard on alert; Russian bomb plot?; USAF’s ...	Hundreds of National Guard troops are activated or on standby as Election Day begins. About 125 guardsmen are currently activated for operations across 10 states 'in general support or in supporting cyber networks,&rdquo; Ellis Hopkins, deputy division chief for National Guard current operations, told reporters at the Pentagon on Monday. None are in 'a civil disturbance or civil response mode.&rdquo; More states and Washington, D.C., have put units on stand-by and plan to activate them on Tuesday or later in the week, increasing the total number of guardsmen to roughly 250 total, according to a defense official. The states with current missions include Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington state. Units are on standby in Colorado, D.C., Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia. Oregon also has some more on standby. U.S. intelligence agencies have warned of potential civil unrest on and after Election Day. Oregon and Washington began activating guardsmen after ballot boxes were set on fire in their states. As well, the National Guard has been stepping up its cyber support during recent elections to ward off potential attacks. Defense One's Audrey Decker has a bit more, here. Why might there be civil unrest? For one thing, Russia is pushing lies about potential election fraud in swing states, the intel community says. The effort aims to 'undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans,&rdquo; according to a joint statement released Monday evening by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Academic researchers are seeing the same thing. Several groups that traffic in pro-Kremlin stories across social media shifted their focus in recent months from attacking the Ukrainian government to undermining the Democratic nominee for president, according to a recent report from Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub. The report looks at the network behind Storm-1516, an pro-Russian disinformation campaign that is trying to shift Western public opinion on Ukraine and NATO. More, here. For another, GOP candidate Donald Trump has been lying about the integrity of the electoral process ever since he lost the 2020 election, pushing false claims about electoral fraud to the heart of his campaign. His efforts to sow these doubts have found an increasingly enthusiastic helper in Elon Musk, whose election-doubting posts on his X social network are shared 9 times more than his less extreme election content. 'That's despite many of Musk's claims &mdash; like alleged noncitizen voting &mdash; being false,&rdquo; NBC News reports after analyzing hundreds of the billionaire's posts. Read, here. One more thing: A 24-year-old white supremacist was arrested Saturday while trying to 'attack Nashville's power grid using a drone carrying an explosive device,&rdquo; the Department of Justice announced Monday. His violent plotting appears to have begun in June, when he told someone he wanted to commit a mass shooting at a YMCA facility. But the following month, he shifted his attention to attacking large interstate substations because, as he told an undercover informant, 'if you want to do the most damage as an accelerationist, attack high economic, high tax, political zones in every major metropolis.&rdquo; The day of the attack, he 'participated in a Nordic ritual, which included reciting a Nordic prayer and discussing the Norse god Odin,&rdquo; the Justice Department says. Shortly afterward, he 'was at the rear of the vehicle, with the drone powered up, and the explosive device was armed and located next to the drone&rdquo; when agents arrested him and took him into custody. 'If convicted, he faces a maximum penalty of life in prison,&rdquo; the Department of Justice said. Read more, here.

On this day in 2017, a troubled Air Force veteran killed 26 people and wounded nearly two dozen others in a mass shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas. Suspected Russian sabotage Russia's military spies were behind a plot to place bombs on cargo planes flying to the U.S. and Canada this summer, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing European security officials. The incendiary devices were mailed in July via a DHL facility in Lithuania, and eventually caught fire at a different facility in Leipzig, Germany, as well as in Birmingham, England, triggering a multinational investigation. The BBC reports a third fire ignited at a transport company in Jablonow, Poland, near Warsaw; that incident took two hours to extinguish. The fires began in electric massage machines containing a magnesium-based substance. 'Magnesium-based fires are hard to put out, especially on board a plane,&rdquo; the BBC reports. The efforts appear to have been a 'test run,&rdquo; Polish officials allege. What's more, 'An aircraft far from land and over an ocean would have been at risk of going down,&rdquo; German authorities said, according to the Journal. The latest: 'Polish authorities have arrested four people and are searching for two more in connection with the case,&rdquo; NBC News reports. More, here. Around the services Air Force hedges on next-gen tanker plans: The U.S. Air Force has been devising plans to develop a future tanker called the Next Generation Air Refueling System, or NGAS, to use in contested operations in the Indo-Pacific, as China develops new counter-air systems that can threaten tankers at longer ranges. The problem: Building a new tanker from scratch doesn't look possible any time soon, so the service might resort to simply enhancing its current fleet of tankers, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said Friday at the service's annual Airlift/Tanker Association Symposium. 'Unfortunately, any new design cannot be fielded for several years at best, even if affordable,&rdquo; Kendall said. Coming soon: The service plans to wrap up a study on NGAS and finish a review of the service's sixth-generation fighter jet program, called Next Generation Air Dominance, by the end of the year, to inform the service's 2026 budget request. Leaders paused the next-gen fighter program so they can take another look at cost projections, new threats, and the advent of other technologies, like new robot wingmen called collaborative combat aircraft. Defense One's Audrey Decker has more, here. Update: An American soldier injured while working to build a pier for residents in Gaza passed away on Thursday, CNN reported Monday. His name is Quandarius Davon Stanley, and he was a 23-year-old sergeant from a transportation brigade based at Virginia's Joint Base Langley-Eustis. Stanley and two others were 'injured out on a ship at sea&rdquo; in May, though not from a combat-related incident, according to Central Command officials. The two others 'were immediately returned to duty after suffering minor injuries,&rdquo; but Stanley was transferred to medical facilities first in Israel, and later to Texas in June.

Russia is pushing election-fraud lies in swing states, US intelli...	Hours before millions of Americans head to the polls on Tuesday, the U.S. intelligence community said Russia is spreading fake news stories to create the perception that officials in key swing states are preparing to commit various acts of election fraud. 'Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences, judging from information available to the IC,&rdquo; says a joint statement released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI, and DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close.&rdquo; The fake article, posted and amplified by Russian influence operators, claims that U.S. officials across swing states are planning to stuff ballots, conduct cyber attacks against election infrastructure, and use a 'range of tactics&rdquo; to 'undermine public confidence in the integrity of U.S. elections and stoke divisions among Americans,&rdquo; the statement said. The Russian actors aim, in part, to convince the American public that election-related violence is spreading and to frighten voters, it said. In Arizona, Russian actors created and spread a fake news article depicting an interview claiming that state officials created fake ballots and changed voter rolls in order to favor Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. 'The Arizona Secretary of State has already refuted the video's claim as false,&rdquo; the statement said. 'We anticipate Russian actors will release additional manufactured content with these themes through election day and in the days and weeks after polls close,&rdquo; it said. [[Related Posts]] Iran also continues to be a 'foreign influence threat&rdquo; to U.S. elections, the statement said: 'As noted in a prior update, we have assessed that Iran has conducted malicious cyber activities to compromise former President Trump's campaign. Iranian influence actors may also seek to create fake media content intended to suppress voting or stoke violence, as they have done in past election cycles.&rdquo; The announcement came just hours after CISA Director Jen Easterly told reporters that 'our election infrastructure has never been more secure and that the election community has never been better prepared to deliver safe, secure, free, and fair elections.'	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/russia-pushing-election-fraud-lies-swing-states-us-intelligence-community-says/400814/	2024-11-04T19:48:28-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/GettyImages_2179051502/large.jpg
Hundreds of National Guard troops are activated or on standby ahe...	The National Guard has hundreds of troops activated or on standby across the country to defend against cyber attacks and support operations during Tuesday's presidential election. About 125 guardsmen are currently working on operations across 10 states. More states and Washington, D.C., have put units on stand-by and plan to activate them on Tuesday or later in the week, increasing the total number of guardsmen to roughly 250 total, according to a defense official. The states with current missions include Alabama, Arizona, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, North Carolina, New Mexico, Oregon, Wisconsin, and Washington state. Units are on standby in Colorado, Florida, Hawaii, Nevada, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, D.C., and West Virginia. Oregon also has some on standby. States are preparing for all possibilities as U.S. intelligence agencies warn of potential civil unrest on and after Election Day. Oregon and Washington began activating guardsmen after ballot boxes were set on fire in their states. But as of now, none of the National Guard units are in 'a civil disturbance or civil response mode. They're in general support or in supporting cyber networks,&rdquo; said Ellis Hopkins, deputy division chief for NGB current operations. [[Related Posts]] In recent years, the National Guard has been stepping up its cyber support around election time to ward off potential attacks. The guardsmen will only be activated or on standby during election week, Hopkins said. In January, the National Guard will send troops to support the presidential inauguration; more than two dozen states have signed up to send help, said Col. Jean Paul Laurenceau, NGB's chief of future operations. The Bureau hasn't received an official request for assistance from the DC Guard for the inauguration, but historically they've activated about 4,000 to 6,000 troops for the event, he said. When a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as Congress certified the election on Jan. 6, 2021, it took the National Guard hours to help Capitol Police restore order&mdash;due to miscommunication and confusion over whether the Guard could deploy. Laurenceau said the Guard still hasn't planned for the 'rules of the use of force&rdquo; in 2025 because they haven't received the request for assistance yet, which will dictate what they're able to do. 'One of the things we'll do is publish that rule on the use of force to all our soldiers, and that's one of the key training that they will go through as they make their way into D.C. But the No. 1 thing is that part of that rules on the use of force is that this is a civilian-supported mission, and so when you start talking about what you're able to do [and] where, it really is very important to us that we understand that, and that's what we'll understand and adhere specifically to that,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/hundreds-national-guard-troops-are-activated-or-standby-ahead-election-day/400813/	2024-11-04T16:59:43-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/GettyImages_1712521807/large.jpg
Report shows how Kremlin-linked group ramped up US election inter...	Several groups that traffic in pro-Kremlin stories across social media shifted their focus in recent months from undermining the Ukrainian government to undermining Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Kamala Harris, according to a new report from Clemson University. The report, released Friday by Clemson's Media Forensics Hub, looks at the network behind Storm-1516, an ongoing pro-Russian disinformation campaign targeting Western public opinion on Ukraine and NATO. The research, led by professors Patrick Warren and Darren Linvill, builds on the early investigative work on the Internet Research Agency to uncover the interconnected web of organizations and individuals supporting Storm-1516. That group, well known by watchers of Western disinformation, has a lot in common with other Russian-linked entities that are less well-known, like the Russian Foundation to Battle Injustice, or R-FBI, and the BRICS Journalist Association. The groups coordinate to amplify stories in order to hurt perceptions of Ukraine among Western audiences, which they refer to as 'narrative laundering&rdquo; or 'a process with the goal to conceal the origins and sourcing of false or misleading information,&rdquo; say the researchers. The groups use similar tactics, such as fabricating local news publications to make disinformation seem more credible. And there are big overlaps in the online networks that spread their stories. Storm-1516 and R-FBI both 'employed West African diaspora actors to play the role of Black Americans.&rdquo; 'We believe&hellip;that Storm-1516 and the R-FBI are part of a common structure. The R-FBI and BJA maintain a distribution network for the wider organization, to distribute both their content and the content attributed to Storm-1516,&rdquo; the report's authors wrote. [[Related Posts]] R-FBI's stories&mdash;52 between August 2023 and October 2024&mdash;can be very successful. A narrative, about Ukraine's first lady Olena Zelenska using Western aid money to buy jewelry from Cartier, had 52,732 posts on X within a week of it the group first publishing on it, meaning that X users had created 52,732 separate X posts off the story , the researchers said, accounting for '10.6% of the total conversation addressing Zelensky or Zelenska in that week.&rdquo; R-FBI recently turned their attention to the U.S. presidential election, to push false stories about Harris and running-mate Tim Walz, such as a discredited claim that Walz sexually abused a minor, and that Harris hit a child with a car and fled the scene, among others. The report comes as officials have flagged Russian election interference across the globe. In Moldova's recent election, officials called out Russian vote-buying and anonymous bomb threats to polling stations. In the country of Georgia, officials have blamed the Kremlin for massive voter intimidation efforts. The Russian government has on-going military operations in both countries.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/11/report-shows-how-kremlin-linked-group-ramped-us-election-interference-efforts/400812/	2024-11-04T16:27:19-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/GettyImages_2181096933/large.jpg
Federal agencies are ready for the transition. Trump hasn't done ...	Federal agencies across government have met the statutory deadline to prepare their materials for whoever wins this week's election, though Donald Trump may be delayed in accessing them due to his ongoing refusal to participate in the formal transition process. The Biden administration met its Nov. 1 deadline to finalize the briefing documents that agencies will offer to the winning side's transition team when designated career staff begin meeting as soon as this week, a General Services Administration spokesperson said on Monday. The materials outline the basics of that agency's operations and include some detail on ongoing and future projects. Unlike Vice President Kamala Harris' team, Trump's team has signed no agreement to work with the current administration, which could bog down the process if he wins, former Trump and federal transition officials said. Even if the election remains too close for the General Services Administration to make an official declaration&mdash;or 'ascertainment,&rdquo; as it is referred to in federal statute&mdash;of who won and is therefore eligible to proceed into the second, post-election phase of the transition, a reform President Biden signed into law would enable both Harris and Trump to receive the newly finalized materials and send their 'landing teams&rdquo; into agencies. Trump's decision not to sign a memorandum of understanding with GSA and the White House could cause delays, as agencies may not have the required heads-up from his team of which individuals will deploy into their offices. Typically, the screening to provide access to agencies takes place before polls close. 'Agencies want to know who is coming in on the days after the election,&rdquo; said Rich Bagger, who led Trump's transition team in 2016. 'They need to know who to let in&hellip;they wanted that information from us by Election Day.&rdquo; Bagger added that the exchange of information might be possible even without Trump's participation in the pre-election transition process, but the vast scope of the federal government would make that unwieldy without going through official channels. 'Because there were so many touch points, it was easier to do it in the official fashion,&rdquo; Bagger said. A former federal transition official told Government Executive that GSA is currently having discussions over how to handle access to buildings and classified materials for landing team members who have not been cleared. Under law, the official said, those individuals must be publicly disclosed and their ethics agreements posted in order to participate. Harris has already released her team's ethics agreement as part of its White House memorandum of understanding. There is a new wrinkle this cycle, under to a 2022 law giving both candidates access to transition funds and materials if neither one has conceded within five days of the election. Trump never conceded the election in 2020 and GSA waited weeks until it gave the official green light for transition activities to begin, which caused delays to Biden's transition efforts. This time around, under a similar circumstance, both Harris and Trump would have access to a segment of GSA's transition funds and be able to start working with agencies directly after five days. Once GSA designates that one side has won, the other team would have to cease its transition efforts. Trump's post-election transition planning was delayed in 2016 because he abandoned the efforts that Bagger and former Gov. Chris Christie, R-N.J., had led, opting to essentially start from scratch after his victory. Bagger said that the Trump team would have been prepared more quickly if it had used his work, noting that he had met before the election with the White House Transition Coordinating Council to go over big-picture steps and had participated in the Agency Directors Transition Council discussions each month that included what information each candidate's team wanted in their initial briefing materials. The team also engaged with the FBI on security clearances&mdash;a process Trump's team is now considering eschewing altogether&mdash;and coordinated with the Office of Government Ethics on what steps would be expected of potential political appointees. 'It seems it would be difficult to do [all of] that sitting completely outside that official process,&rdquo; Bagger said. Because Biden had engaged in that work, his team was setting up meetings within two hours of GSA's ascertainment in mid-November, the former federal transition official said. 'We had everything ready and the emails all set up,&rdquo; the former official said, referring to the .gov email addresses Biden transition team members received from the agencies to which they would be deploying. 'We just pressed the buttons.&rdquo; There is now a question of how quickly and even whether Trump could get his teams in place at agencies in the intervening period between the election and the new president's inauguration, as is customary. 'If they aren't submitting information, they can't get cleared,&rdquo; the official said. 'A lot of stuff that is normally happening that is not happening.&rdquo; GSA is gaming out its plans to be prepared for whatever outcome follows the election, the former federal transition official said. The agency has solicited input from its own and White House counsel. 'They have worked every scenario you can think of, and some you cannot think of,&rdquo; that person said.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/11/agencies-have-completed-their-pre-election-transition-briefings-trump-may-still-not-get-them-time/400811/	2024-11-04T16:00:00-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/Republican_president_2500/large.jpg
Air Force hedges on next-gen tanker plans	Tomorrow's tankers might just be today's tankers with self-protection gear, Air Force officials say&mdash;because the service can't afford to pursue all its next-generation plans. The Air Force has been devising plans to develop a future tanker called the Next Generation Air Refueling System, or NGAS, to use in contested operations in the Indo-Pacific, as China develops new counter-air systems that can threaten tankers at longer ranges. But building a new tanker from scratch doesn't look possible any time soon, so the service might resort to simply enhancing its current fleet of tankers, said Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. 'Unfortunately, any new design cannot be fielded for several years at best, even if affordable. Other options include various ways of increasing the resilience of the current force. The need for improved connectivity and some degree of enhanced self-protection measure appears to be attractive from both an affordability and cost-effectiveness perspective. It's also something that can be accomplished in relatively short time frames at relatively low cost,&rdquo; Kendall said Friday at the service's annual Airlift/Tanker Association Symposium. The service plans to wrap up a study on NGAS and finish a review of the service's sixth-generation fighter jet program, called Next Generation Air Dominance, by the end of the year, to inform the service's 2026 budget request. Leaders paused the next-gen fighter program so they can take another look at cost projections, new threats, and the advent of other technologies, like new robot wingmen called collaborative combat aircraft. [[Related Posts]] The designs of all three of these new programs&mdash;NGAS, NGAD, and CCAs&mdash;are tied together, from an operational and cost perspective, Kendall said. But as things stand today, he said, there's not enough money to buy them all. 'The variable that concerns me most as we go through this analysis and produce a range of alternatives is going to be the availability of adequate resources to pursue any combination of those new designs. Right now, given our commitments, our resources and strategic priorities, it's hard for me to see how we can afford any combination of those new designs,&rdquo; Kendall said. Officials have warned that the 2026 budget will be even tighter than 2025, as other programs like the Sentinel ICBM replacement, are costing far more than initially projected, creating uncertainty around the service's next-gen aircraft programs. Funding the Space Force, modernizing both Air Force legs of the nuclear triad, building robust air base defense, and attacking adversaries' long-range kill chains are the service's top budget priorities, Kendall said. 'All of these are absolutely essential for the success of the Air Force and Space Force and the joint force, and all of them require substantial increased investments&hellip;notice that I haven't mentioned either NGAS or NGAD yet,&rdquo; Kendall said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/11/air-force-hedges-next-gen-tanker-plans/400805/	2024-11-04T13:49:29-08:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/11/04/Screenshot_2024_11_04_at_11.48.20AM/large.png
The D Brief: B-52s head to the Mideast; Russia’s progress, charte...	The Pentagon ordered more ships, fighter jets, and B-52 bombers to the Middle East this weekend, Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder announced Friday evening. The bombers arrived in the region Sunday, officials at Central Command said on social media. However, the full package won't arrive terribly quickly, Ryder said. Instead, 'These forces will begin to arrive in coming months as the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group prepares to depart,&rdquo; he said. The Lincoln strike group has been in the region since August supporting Israel and U.S. forces nearby after pivoting away from an assignment in the Pacific over the summer. Talking points: 'These movements demonstrate the flexible nature of U.S. global defense posture and U.S. capability to deploy world-wide on short notice to meet evolving national security threats,&rdquo; Ryder said in a statement. 'Secretary Austin continues to make clear that should Iran, its partners, or its proxies use this moment to target American personnel or interests in the region, the United States will take every measure necessary to defend our people,&rdquo; he warned. In case you missed it: Israel's military warned officials in Baghdad it may attack Iran-backed militias inside Iraq if nothing is done to suppress their recent attacks on Israel, Axios reported last week. Worth noting: The rate of strikes against Israel from Iraqi militias has sharply increased, 'from six attacks in August, to 37 in September, to 111 in October,&rdquo; according to the Washington Institute, which is tracking the allegations here. Israel's use of air-launched ballistic missiles in its recent strikes inside Iran have piqued others' interest in the weapon, Reuters says. 'The main advantage of an ALBM over an [air-launched cruise missile] is speed to penetrate defences,' said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Centre for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California. 'The downside&mdash;accuracy&mdash;looks to have been largely solved.' Read on, here.

Russia's Ukraine invasion Ukrainian forces allegedly struck a Russian S-300/400 air defense system southeast of Donetsk City, in occupied eastern Ukraine, using a half dozen or so U.S.-provided ATACMS missiles on Saturday. The Washington-based Institute for the Study of War tallied six more alleged strikes on Russian air defense systems (often Buk M2s and M3s) across occupied Ukraine over the past two weeks. Why bring it up: 'Russia has struggled to source the microelectronic components&rdquo; critical for these air defense systems 'due to Western sanctions,&rdquo; ISW wrote Saturday evening. If those attacks persist, 'Russia may not be able to produce or repair a sufficient number of air defense systems to maintain the current density of Russia's air defense coverage.&rdquo; Similar Ukrainian strikes could also affect Russian air force targeting and glide bomb strikes in the weeks ahead, ISW said. Update: Russia has reportedly armed North Korean soldiers with AK-12 assault rifles, RPK/PKM machine guns, SVD/SVCh sniper rifles, Phoenix anti-tank guided missiles, 60mm mortars, and RPG-7 anti-tank rocket launchers, Ukrainian officials said Saturday. Others may have night vision equipment, thermal imagers, and other optics including more traditional binoculars. Russian forces are increasingly targeting Ukrainian medics, according to the Economist, which reports that in some frontline locations, 'If you put a red cross on a car, you'll be fired on within 15 minutes.&rdquo; Accelerating invasion, charted: Compare Russia's month-to-month territorial gains in a recent illustration from conflict analyst War Mapper, posted Saturday on social media. October 'was Russia's largest monthly net gain since the start of the war, surpassing last month's 467.7km&sup2;,&rdquo; he writes. Election Day preparations The National Guard has been put on standby in the Pacific Northwest in case of unrest on Election Day, CNN reported Saturday. That includes troops in Oregon, Washington, and Nevada. 'Based upon general and specific information and concerns regarding the potential for violence or other unlawful activity related to the 2024 general election, I want to ensure we are fully prepared to respond to any potential additional civil unrest,&rdquo; Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Friday. Coming soon: Pentagon officials are set to brief the media on the Guard's 'various election support roles&rdquo; Monday afternoon. Developing: Far-right groups are ready to dispute votes in Democratic areas, the New York Times reports after analyzing more than a million messages across almost 50 Telegram channels. 'Some posted images of armed men standing up for their rights to recruit for their cause. Others spread conspiracy theories that anything less than a Trump victory on Tuesday would be a miscarriage of justice worthy of revolt.&rdquo; Additional reading: 'Russia feigns indifference over U.S. election but roots quietly for Trump,&rdquo; the Washington Post reported Sunday from Moscow; '&lsquo;Every single American' a target of election interference, former DHS official says,&rdquo; Nextgov reported last week from a panel discussion with Suzanne Spaulding, who led the predecessor organization to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency; And 'Russia produced fake video of immigrant election fraud in Georgia, officials say,&rdquo; Nextgov reported late last week. Navy cruisers New: The Navy says it will extend the lives of three cruisers. The USS Gettysburg (CG 64), Chosin (CG 65), and Cape St. George (CG 71) will each receive maintenance and modifications to give them a total of ten years of extra service life, with the first of these expected in 2026, the service announced Monday. Those 30-plus-year-old ships are the youngest of the Ticonderoga class, whose oldest members the Navy has sought for years to retire, arguing that the money sunk into keeping them battle-ready would be better spent on new ships. In 2022, half of the Navy's unexpected maintenance days were due to Tico problems. Congress has generally refused, saying that the nation needs the cruisers' missile capacity tubes and accusing the Navy of slow-walking repairs. Last year, Navy Times offered a status report they called 'The Navy's continuing cruiser debacle.&rdquo; That makes 15 ships the Navy has recently announced will operate beyond their design lifespan. A dozen destroyers will also operate beyond their 35-year windows, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro announced last week. That plan was finalized after a 10-month evaluation conducted this calendar year amid what officials say is a shipbuilding budget shortfall. Expert reax: 'If we're going to have the Navy we need to counter the threats we face,&rdquo; retired Rear Adm. Mark Montgomery told Defense One, 'you're going to have to change the top line on Navy ship building in a fairly dramatic way&hellip;or you're going to have to reimagine where you build things at a labor cost you can afford.&rdquo; What are your thoughts on the state of U.S. Navy shipbuilding?
