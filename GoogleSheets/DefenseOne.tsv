The D Brief: SECDEF on subs; Shipyard sabotage?; US, Ukraine ‘mis...	SECDEF in London: U.S. is making progress on boosting submarine production. 'What I'm seeing is that we're investing in the right things, and we will be able to expand the capacity going forward and to meet our objectives,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Thursday after meeting his UK and Australian counterparts to discuss the trilateral AUKUS defense-technology pact. Austin was answering a question put to Australian Deputy Defense Prime Minister Richard Marles, who declined to say whether Australia was worried that U.S. shipyards&mdash;already years behind on U.S. orders&mdash;would be able to supply the three Virginia-class attack boats promised to his country under AUKUS. The U.S. has plans to spend up to $17.5 billion over five years to boost sub construction, including up to $4 billion routed through third parties Deloitte and BlueForce Alliance. (As it happens, $17.5 billion is the current estimated price tag for the first Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine; it's also close to one estimate for the Navy's total projected cost overrun for sub-building efforts through 2030.) Australia will make its first payment of $3 billion next year, two-thirds of which the U.S. will put toward the 16,000 American companies that make parts for submarines, a defense official said ahead of the meeting. Defense One's Lauren C. Williams reports from London, here. Shipyard sabotage? A leading U.S. shipyard found faulty welds in submarines and aircraft carriers with 'early indication that some of the welding errors were intentional,&rdquo; USNI News reported Thursday, citing a Tuesday memo from Navy acquisition chief Nickolas Guertin to the Navy secretary and chief of naval operations. Newport News Shipbuilding reported the welds to the Justice Department, which has declined immediate comment. Read on, here. And: a new Chinese sub sank pierside earlier this year. That's the word from 'a senior U.S. defense official,&rdquo; who told reporters that the Zhao, the first of a class of nuclear-powered attack submarines, sank alongside a pier sometime between May and June. Here's a photo of the purported sunk sub at a shipyard near Wuhan, taken by Planet Labs and published by the Wall Street Journal, which has more, here.

On this day in 1944, the U.S. Army Air Force suffered its largest loss from a single mission during WWII after a navigational error separated a bomber group from its fighter escort. In a very short period of time, Nazi pilots shot down 31 U.S. B-24 Liberator bombers and one P-51 Mustang, killing 118 Americans. The New Zealand, Australian and Japanese navies transited the Taiwan Strait together on Wednesday and were followed by five Chinese navy vessels in a 'pincer-style maneuver,&rdquo; according to Taiwan's RW News and the BBC. Why it matters: 'For decades the US Pacific fleet was the only foreign navy that regularly transited the strait,&rdquo; the BBC reports. 'But recently, it was joined by Canada and Australia, Britain and France. [And] Two weeks ago Germany sailed two navy ships through the strait for the first time in decades.&rdquo; Taiwan, meanwhile, has seen 84 Chinese aircraft flying around the self-governing island over the past two days. 'This is a very notable increase in activity compared to the previous week,&rdquo; said regional observer Ben Lewis. Sixty-six of those aircraft crossed over the median line, entering Taiwan's northern, central, southwestern, and eastern ADIZ. Update: The Navy's USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier visited Guam recently, as the crew's staff noted in a timelapse video on social media Friday. The Roosevelt, based out of San Diego, had been in the Middle East in support of and in defense of commercial vessels transiting the Red Sea between June and August. ATACMS? U.S. intelligence officials think the risks aren't worth the rewards when it comes to authorizing Ukraine's use of long-range weapons to hit military targets inside Russia, the New York Times reported Thursday. Despite the nearly $8 billion in U.S. support for Ukraine announced Thursday, the two countries are still missing 'consensus on a strategy to end this war on terms favorable to Ukraine,&rdquo; said John Hardie of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank in Washington. 'The disagreement over missile strikes in Russia is a symptom of this disconnect,&rdquo; he added. To that end, Ukraine's president says he 'shared the details of the Victory Plan with Vice President Kamala Harris&rdquo; Thursday at the White House, seeming to confirm what Ukrainian officials teased late last week as Zelenskyy was traveling to the U.S. 'It is very important for us to be fully understandable and work in full coordination with the United States,&rdquo; he wrote on social media. By the way: The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday that Zelenskyy's so-called victory plan did not impress White House officials who saw it as 'little more than a repackaged request for more weapons and the lifting of restrictions on long-range missiles.&rdquo; New: Zelenskyy met with Donald Trump in New York City, following days of rumors the meeting might or might not happen. The former U.S. president told reporters afterward he had a 'very good relationship&rdquo; with the Ukrainian leader. He noted quickly afterward, 'I also have a very good relationship with President Putin.&rdquo; According to the Guardian, 'Zelenskyy immediately responded to Trump's comments about his positive relationship with Putin, and said that he hopes that he and Trump have a better relationship than the one between Putin and Trump.&rdquo; Rewind: Trump was impeached in 2020 for withholding aid to Ukraine in an attempt to extort political dirt from Zelenskyy. He was impeached again in 2021 for his role in the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol. On Thursday, Trump lied about that latter episode on social media, claiming he'd dispatched National Guard troops to respond to the insurrection; he did not in fact dispatch the Guard, according to congressional investigators. This afternoon in Washington: Top Army acquisition official Doug Bush joins Gen. James Rainey of Army Futures Command to discuss the evolving nature of drones in service. That conversation will be moderated by Cynthia Cook of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. You can stream that online at 3 p.m. ET. Details, here. And lastly this week: Recall a naval era long past with this almost-anachronistic video of the recent Thames River transit of Spanish galleon Andaluc&iacute;a beneath London's Tower Bridge on Monday. 'The ship is a replica of the famous 15th century ship that was part of the galleons used by the Spanish to explore America and parts of Asia up until the 18th century,&rdquo; wrote south London's Sutton & Croydon Guardian local newspaper. 'The ship will be docked at St Katharine Docks from September 24 to October 6, with visitors able to go aboard the ship,&rdquo; the paper reports. 'Tickets are priced at &pound;12 for adults, &pound;6 for children and &pound;30 for a family of 5.&rdquo; You can read more from the company responsible for building the vessel, which has been used in several films and commercials.

Is Australia worried about US submarine production? Over to you, ...	LONDON&mdash;When defense chiefs from the U.S., UK and Australia met reporters after their AUKUS meeting here on Thursday, they touted an agreement to share a submarine-hunting torpedo. But when asked whether Australia was concerned about the U.S. ability to produce its promised submarines, Australian Deputy Defense Prime Minister Richard Marles had little to say. Instead, he deferred to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. 'First of all, in terms of our ability to meet the production objectives, of course we're concerned about that, and that's why we're investing more in the submarine industrial base, so that they can continue to expand capacity and place our efforts on a ramp that ensures that we can meet the objectives,&rdquo; said Austin, who added that he has met with U.S. industry leaders to talk about how they're using new funds intended to boost the submarine industrial base. 'What I'm seeing is that we're investing in the right things, and we will be able to expand the capacity going forward and to meet our objectives.&rdquo; U.S. shipyards are up to three years behind on orders, according to a recent U.S. Navy study, which has cast some doubt on their ability to backfill the U.S. end of an agreement to sell Australia three Virginia-class submarines&mdash;with an option for two more&mdash;in the next decade. The sub purchase is part of the three-year-old U.S.-UK-Australia agreement known as AUKUS, an effort to foster cooperative technology development. Australia has committed to an initial payment of $3 billion&mdash;perhaps one percent of the total it expects to spend to buy, support, and eventually build its own nuclear subs through the 2050s. That $3 billion is expected to start flowing next year into a special U.S. Treasury account, and the U.S. intends to invest two-thirds of it in its submarine industrial base, a senior U.S. military official told reporters ahead of the meeting. The money&mdash;alongside the $17.5 billion the U.S. has committed over five years to improve its submarine production&mdash;won't go to shipbuilders directly. Instead, it will fund six areas that will produce 'maximum return on investment&rdquo; in the 16,000 companies that form the submarine industrial base. 'Things that take a long time in terms of infrastructure, in terms of long-lead items, in terms of vendor uplift, in terms of overall supply base management,&rdquo; the official said. Getting the bulk of those funds upfront will 'allow us to maximize the return on investment such that when we're at the point in the 2030s to where we are selling ships, that we're back at the appropriate cadence. The Australians have helped us re-achieve the appropriate cadence, along with our congressional partnerships that have put a substantial amount of support behind that,&rdquo; the official said. It's not clear that the cadence has been re-achieved just yet. In recent years, U.S. submarine production has failed to meet the demands of its own Navy, largely due to supply chain problems and a dwindling trained workforce. It's a conundrum that has prompted the Navy to back splashy advertising campaigns and free training courses. Unusually, the Pentagon and Navy have committed up to $4 billion to two third-party firms&mdash;the consulting giant Deloitte and the nonprofit startup BlueForge Alliance&mdash;that have been hired to boot sub-building into a higher gear. AUKUS progress On Thursday, the defense chiefs also announced an agreement to equip all three nations' sub-hunting P-8 maritime patrol jets with Sting Ray torpedoes. John Healey, the UK's defense secretary, also said the UK agreed to keep training Australian sailors on how to use and maintain nuclear submarines, and to continue negotiating with Australia on their own bilateral treaty to bolster the AUKUS agreement. 'After the first course of 250 Australians was completed this month, and as part of that work, I can announce that Deputy Prime Minister Marles and I have agreed that negotiations will soon be underway for a new bilateral treaty to bind our AUKUS collaboration into law. This not only reflects our commitment to secure a secure Indo-Pacific region where international rules are respected. It also sends a very strong message that our defense alliance is one that will endure for many decades to come,&rdquo; Healey said. This agreement, if finalized, will foster submarine production plans between Australia and the UK as the two nations work to develop the SSN-AUKUS type submarine. Marles said Australia has already obtained a site for his country's future sub-building yard. 'In South Australia, we have seen land swaps take place with the South Australian government, such that we now have the site on which a production line will be established to build the future nuclear-powered submarines in Australia, the AUKUS variant, a variant that we will operate in tandem with the United Kingdom,&rdquo; he said. Marles also noted last month's work done in Perth on the Virginia-class submarine USS Hawaii, the first time a U.S. nuclear attack sub has been maintained outside the U.S. or an American base, and by non-U.S. citizens. 'All of this is happening under the banner of the AUKUS arrangement,&rdquo; he said. Last year, the U.S. and British defense leaders announced plans to increase deployments of SSNs to Australia starting in 2027, and to embed Australian military and civilian workers in the American and UK industrial bases. Those plans are all on track, Marles said. 'The very first step in what we announced in March of last year was an increased tempo of visits of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia. That is happening. The submarine rotational force west, which will take place from 2027, is on track. And we are working very closely with both our partners, along with the Western Australian government, to see that that is happening as well,&rdquo; Marles said. Each of the defense leaders touted the submarine training as a progressing initiative. Australia has sent hundreds of sailors to the UK and U.S. nuclear-power schools to learn about how to operate undersea vessels in the future. The nation is also funding universities to add 4,000 slots for AUKUS-related disciplines, 'to make sure that we are building the skills that are needed to deliver this project,&rdquo; Marles said. Healey stressed the technical complexity that goes into building a submarine, which contributes to how long they take to build&mdash;and makes the early steps each nation takes critical. 'This is the, perhaps the most complex engineering and technologies on the planet, but there is an imperative to see every day counts. Because it's what we do now&mdash;and in the weeks and months ahead now&mdash;that will determine whether or not, to time, towards the end of the 2030s, the first AUKUS submarines are built and put into operation,&rdquo; Healey said. 'And in our discussions, that theme ran throughout: timescales are tough, but they are essential. And that together, we are absolutely determined that we will deliver.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/australia-worried-about-us-submarine-production-over-you-secdef/399882/	2024-09-27T07:05:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/27/A_sailor_aboard_the_2500/large.jpg
The Army wants to roboticize forklifts	Add forklift operator to the list of jobs that might soon fall to machines. The Army Applications Laboratory is working on a way to convert just about any human-driven forklift to autonomous operation. 'When you think about a potential future conflict and the amount of supplies that are going to have to flow from the [United States] and allied partners to places forward, it's going to be immense,&rdquo; Casey Perley, executive director of the Army Applications Laboratory, said this week during a Defense One Genius Machines broadcast. 'One of the things we're looking at is autonomy for forklifts. So essentially, how can they work in pairs where one forklift loads the other; they both go to where you're dropping it off, you drop it off, you go back for more.&rdquo; A few companies sell autonomous forklifts, but Perley said what the Army really needs is a way to convert the ones it already has. 'This type of technology is designed to not be, like, vendor- or model-specific on the forklift; it's designed to work with multiple types of systems. So the idea being: you invest in the AI and the autonomy versus a whole lot of hardware, and then you can just take that AI and autonomy and put it on different systems.&rdquo; The lab has hired a company called TracksNA to develop the self-operating forklift software. In late October, soldiers and engineers will get together to run forklifts through their paces. Such 'touchpoints&rdquo; are critical to building the brains for robotic forklifts, she said. It's not like autonomous vehicles on streets which can all access similar data repositories. The training of robot forklifts requires a lot of interaction with human operators. 'The more of these [touchpoint opportunities] you get in the Army, and the more [repetitions] that our soldiers can get with them, the more we're going to learn the types of experiences we are going to need to train these forklifts, the type of data that we're going to need to ensure is fed into the models. So that is why soldier touchpoints are so critically important, is it really teaches us the type of stuff we're going to need to teach the vehicles.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/army-wants-roboticize-forklifts/399879/	2024-09-26T16:35:46-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/GettyImages_2150166810/large.jpg
Increased efforts, lower goal help Army end recruiting slump	The Army beat its recruiting goal this year through a combination of lowered targets and increased efforts, after failing to hit higher goals in 2022 and 2023. The service recruited 55,300 soldiers against a goal of 55,000 in fiscal 2024, the service said Thursday. The service also saw 11,000 people commit to enlist in fiscal year 2025 under the Delayed Entry Program, more than double last year's total. The service also enlisted 6,000 more soldiers in specialties it deems critical this year compared to last, said U.S. Army Recruiting Command chief, Maj. Gen. Johnny Davis, speaking at a Thursday media roundtable. Last year&mdash;fiscal 2023&mdash;the service recruited 50,181 soldiers against a 'stretch goal&rdquo; of 65,000, as Army Secretary Christine Wormuth put it, with 4,611 signing up for deferred entry. At the time, the Army presented the Delayed Entry Program numbers as part of its overall recruiting contracts, leading to reporting that the Army had hit 55,000 contracts. In 2022, the Army recruited 44,901 new members, well short of its goal of 60,000. The Army's press release did not say why the service sought 55,000 recruits in 2024 after seeking 60,000 and 65,000 in previous years. But the lowered target comes as the service works to consolidate undermanned formations created by past recruiting shortfalls. The Army has blamed poor recruiting numbers in part on the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as more prosaic issues like obesity, a strong U.S. economy, and the failure to meet the Army's drug policy. One major contributor to this year's success was the Army's 'Future Soldier Preparatory Course,&rdquo; a two-year-old initiative to prepare prospective soldiers for the Army's required physical and academic tests. In fiscal year 2024, 13,206 soldiers passed from the course to basic training. The course has taken over 28,000 recruits since it was launched, with over 90 percent of those recruits graduating, said Brig. Gen. Jennifer Walkawicz of Army Training and Doctrine Command. The Army expanded the course earlier this year, adding a total of four training companies. Other measures included a major new recruiting campaign that revived an 80's-era slogan, 'Be All You Can Be,&rdquo; which launched in March 2023. The Army also temporarily increased medical personnel at intake centers to make the onboarding process more efficient, according to an Army press release. The Army announced structural reforms to recruiting last October. New initiatives include establishing recruiting as a separate military occupational specialty, creating a recruitment experimentation group, and setting a goal to rely less on high-school recruiting. In August, the Army graduated its first class of recruiters under the new specialty. The service also launched an AI program in the last two months to identify potential recruits. Army leaders were cautious about declaring an end to their recruiting struggles, though. 'We're going to have to kind of keep fighting hard for our new recruits,&rdquo; said Wormuth, citing low employment and an expected decrease in the population as factors working against Army recruiters.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/increased-efforts-lower-goal-help-army-end-recruiting-slump/399870/	2024-09-26T13:16:07-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/U.S._Army_soldiers_w_2500/large.jpg
Companies that left Russia after 2022 invasion saw reputation boo...	Western companies that pulled out of Russia after it invaded Ukraine in 2022&mdash;even ones that hesitated&mdash;have generally seen their reputations rise, according to a new study that suggests that firms can use geopolitical crises to burnish their brands. Firms with strong environmental, social, and governance reputations saw more pronounced net buzz, according to Shankar Ganesan from the University of Notre Dame and Girish Mallapragada from Indiana University, whose paper went online in March and will appear in the forthcoming edition of the Journal of Public Policy and Marketing. The authors conclude that companies known for ethical governance were rewarded more when they aligned their actions with those values. Interestingly, the study also uncovered that companies who hesitated, then pulled out after public pressure weren't penalized for their cold feet. Firms that withdrew from Russia after their peers also saw increases in net buzz, meaning that the decision to exit later&mdash;rather than being seen as reactive or reluctant&mdash;helped them maintain or even boost public support. In short, it always pays to do the right thing even if it seems frightening at first. The concept of 'doing the right thing&rdquo; also ties into national security. In an era of great state competition, as outlined in the 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy, the global reputation of U.S. firms is linked to perceptions of American leadership and values. Companies looking to sell dual-use technologies to the government and consumer, for example, may find that their standing with both the public and government stakeholders depends on how their corporate actions align with ethical governance&mdash;particularly in regions where political conflict and public scrutiny are high. 'Our findings highlight that corporate decisions made in response to geopolitical crises, such as withdrawing from Russia, do not occur in isolation,&rdquo; Ganesan told Defense One in an email. 'As U.S. companies face growing competition from Chinese firms, which may not adhere to the same geopolitical or ethical standards, the reputational benefits of socially responsible actions become even more pronounced. While firms from China and Russia may prioritize short-term economic gains, U.S. companies that align with stakeholder values, especially in the context of ESG, are likely to enjoy longer-term consumer loyalty and trust. This differentiation not only strengthens U.S. corporate positioning but also reinforces the country's broader strategic objectives of promoting democracy, human rights, and global stability in competition with non-democratic regimes.' Another conclusion is that these sorts of moves pay off much more in situations where the conflict is broadly known and understood by the public. As the authors note in their paper, 'If a conflict garners significant international attention, like the Russia&ndash;Ukraine war, the impact on brand buzz and consumer perceptions could follow patterns observed in this study. Second, the severity and scale of conflict could also matter. Firms' actions might elicit strong consumer reactions in situations as severe and impactful as the Russia&ndash;Ukraine conflict. However, the reactions may be less intense or clear-cut in less pronounced conflicts.&rdquo; This is where the Biden administration's response to the Ukraine conflict becomes significant. By declassifying intelligence and publicly revealing Russia's invasion plans, the U.S. government helped shape global public opinion and build a coalition of democratic allies to support Ukraine.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/companies-left-russia-after-2022-invasion-saw-reputation-boost-study-shows/399865/	2024-09-26T12:07:22-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/26/_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: New bomb for Ukraine; Congress averts shutdown; Army...	White House's race against the clock on Ukraine aid: President Joe Biden says he's routing some $7.9 billion in military support to Ukraine, including $5.5 billion in congressionally-authorized funds that are set to expire if not accessed by the end of the month. That also includes a $2.4 billion commitment to buy weapons from American manufacturers (instead of reducing U.S. military stockpiles) as well as money to help build up Ukraine's defense industrial base, the president said in a statement Thursday. And in a new first, Biden authorized Ukraine's use of the Joint Standoff Weapon long-range munition as part of a $375 million arms package announced Wednesday by the Defense Department. The JSOW weapons are also known as glide bombs. They have a range of around 75 miles, and can be launched from the F-16s now flown by some of Ukraine's pilots, ABC News reported Wednesday. He also wants to send Ukraine another Patriot air defense battery, which Biden said 'builds on my decision earlier this year to divert U.S. air defense exports to Ukraine&rdquo; ahead of other customers around the world. And Biden authorized expanded training for Ukrainian F-16 pilots, adding 18 training slots for 2025. 'My message is clear: The United States will provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win this war,&rdquo; the president said. One catch for that nearly $6 billion set to expire on Monday: 'The U.S. won't be allowed to introduce new types of equipment that haven't been in previous shipments,&rdquo; Politico reported Wednesday with the fine print. Not included in these new announcements: Permission to attack targets inside Russia using U.S.-provided weapons, which Ukrainian President Volodymir Zelenskyy has been requesting for several months as his troops occupy a small foothold in Russia's western Kursk region. Zelenskyy thanked Biden and 'both parties, Republicans and Democrats, as well as the entire American people&hellip;for finding a way to allocate the remaining security assistance to Ukraine and ensure that the Presidential authority is not expired by the end of the US financial year,&rdquo; he wrote on social media Thursday. Additional reading: 'Meet Bradley, the U.S. Army Veteran Ukrainian Soldiers Love,&rdquo; the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday; 'UK weapon stockpiles &lsquo;threadbare' after arming Ukraine,&rdquo; the British Times reported Wednesday. Elsewhere in Washington: GOP House Speaker Mike Johnson told Zelenskyy to 'immediately fire&rdquo; his U.S. ambassador because the Ukrainian president visited an ammunition factory in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Sunday. The House Speaker made his demand in a Wednesday letter to Zelenskyy, arguing that the visit 'in a politically contested battleground state&rdquo; was 'clearly election interference.&rdquo; The GOP-led House Oversight Committee also said it's opened an investigation into the Scranton trip. The visit 'was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican,&rdquo; Johnson said in his letter. 'Additionally, as I have clearly stated in the past, all foreign nations should avoid opining on or interfering in American domestic politics,&rdquo; the House Speaker wrote. Worth noting: Zelenskyy visited Utah's Republican Gov. Spencer Cox in July. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited former President Trump at his resort in Mar-a-Lago in late July and Johnson similarly had no objections. Nor did Johnson object when Hungary's far-right Viktor Orban visited Trump at Mar-a-Lago immediately after the NATO summit in mid-July. Meanwhile, Trump said Wednesday the Ukrainian people are 'dead&rdquo; and the country is 'demolished&rdquo; as he addressed voters at a campaign stop in North Carolina. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,&rdquo; GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump said, according to the Associated Press. 'If they made a bad deal [that is, not fighting back] it would've been much better,&rdquo; he said. 'They would've given up a little bit and everybody would be living and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years,&rdquo; Trump said, and claimed, 'What deal can we make? It's demolished. The people are dead. The country is in rubble.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Republicans follow Trump's lead of icing out Zelensky,&rdquo; CNN reported Wednesday; 'Anti-U.S. axis divided over Trump vs. Harris,&rdquo; Axios reported Thursday; 'How Russia's RT went from a cable news clone to covert operator,&rdquo; NPR reported Thursday; 'Russian Missiles Strike Kyiv for 5 Hours Hitting Ukraine's Power Grid,&rdquo; Newsweek reported Thursday; And 'Putin proposes new rules for using nuclear weapons,&rdquo; the BBC reported Thursday; for some clear-eyed expert reax, try nuclear policy researcher Fabian Hoffmann.

On this day in 1931, the keel of USS Ranger (CV-4), the first American purpose-built aircraft carrier, was laid down in Newport News, Virginia. Lawmakers avert a shutdown, for now. The U.S. government will now stay open at least through Dec. 20 under the stopgap funding bill passed Wednesday in both the House and the Senate, which gives Congress until then to pass funding bills for the 2025 fiscal year that begins in five days. Also included: $231 million for the Secret Service following the two recent assassination attempts on Trump. The bill passed the lower chamber in a 341-82 vote, with Speaker Johnson needing the support of 209 Democrats with 132 Republicans to advance the measure. It then advanced through the upper chamber in a 78-18 vote. Additional reading: 'How every senator voted on the stopgap bill to avert a government shutdown,&rdquo; via the Washington Post. New: The U.S. Army finally reached its yearly recruiting goal, officials announced Thursday in a razor-thin confirmation of what Army leaders said they were anticipating in April. The service added 55,300 new soldiers during the current fiscal year, which ends in just five days; that's 300 above the Army's target for FY24. That total includes 12,000 soldiers processed through a preparatory course designed to assist volunteers who do not initially meet all the requirements to enlist. Reminder: The Army failed to meet its recruiting goals for the last two years as the service (and the world) gradually emerged from the Covid-19 pandemic. (The Navy and Air Force also fell short in 2023.) Trendspotting: 'We're seeing an increase in the enlistment age,&rdquo; one official said Thursday. That shows how the service has looked beyond the typical high school graduate to Americans working in the private sector. That includes outreach to digital job boards, for example, and emphasizing benefits like the G.I. Bill, officials said.

It was&hellip;get some common gear in place, move the algorithm, be able to share algorithms and move the data. And now you're in continuous-improvement mode,&rdquo; the defense official said. [[Related Posts]] Officials touted the sub-hunting experiments as a banner display of how AUKUS has produced technological advancement through collaboration&mdash;instead of the U.S., typically companies, developing solutions and then selling them to other nations. 'It is one of the ways that we're increasing our own ability to leverage each other's assets to rapidly process information, to have increased maritime domain awareness, to provide advantage to our warfighters by gaining that insight through collaboration and leveraging the most advanced technologies as in the algorithms that we've trained that allow us to do that processing,&rdquo; a defense official said. 'That's, to me, what's different here: even if you're not seeing some big project that everybody can point to. It's a change in how we do things and how we're doing it with allies and partners.&rdquo; The White House recently announced that Japan would join work on maritime autonomy under AUKUS Pillar 2, and that Canada, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand might as well. Officials also hailed proposed reforms to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that could ease cooperation. 'The Australians and UK are two of our closest partners and so there are challenges, but we're working through those at pace and with a degree of commitment to break down those stovepipes and those barriers that might exist such as IT barriers to make sure that we can do what we need to do,&rdquo; a defense official said. This is particularly important when it comes to Pillar 2 developments in cyber and electronic warfare. 'We have many platforms in common when it comes to [electronic warfare], which helps. And we also have agreements in place to share information at the appropriate levels as well, which helps,&rdquo; another official said. And when it comes to cyber, 'information sharing is a standard thing and you see it here too just inside the US system. There are certain tools you need to have in place for convenience of use, trading against surety of protecting that information,&rdquo; the official said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/officials-tout-ai-powered-sub-hunting-aukus-defense-chiefs-converge/399836/	2024-09-25T15:50:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/Screenshot_2024_09_25_at_12.31.39PM/large.png
‘Every lever of statecraft’ needed to overcome Pacific threats, c...	KONA, Hawaii&mdash;The U.S. military services are 'doing everything that's possible within the laws of physics&rdquo; in the Indo-Pacific right now, but the region's challenges require 'every lever of statecraft, not just the military lever,&rdquo; Adm. Samuel Paparo told Defense One in an interview. On a balcony overlooking the ocean at the Indo-Pacific Chiefs of Defense Conference, the leader of Indo-Pacific Command called the region 'the key strategic problem to the United States,&rdquo; and said all-domain operations 'are a requirement&rdquo; in the theater. 'This is a time for agnosticism in all-domain operations. Every formation is applicable in every domain. So, you know, we are open to every formation that can operate in every domain&hellip; and all units are required to operate in all domains. Not encouraged&mdash;required,&rdquo; Paparo said. Paparo met with senior military leaders from 23 countries and NATO at the conference, whose theme was 'The future Indo-Pacific: Building a resilient and interconnected region.&rdquo; Among them was Gen. Wu Yanan, who leads the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command. Their in-person meeting continued a conversation begun in a Sept. 9 video call between the U.S. and Chinese commanders. [[Related Posts]] Only 'time will tell&rdquo; whether the communication will continue, Paparo said, but the video call 'was a professional and courteous exchange of information, where I began by urging safe and professional conduct of forces, by pointing out a number of occasions where the [People's Republic of China] hazarded U.S. and allied and partner forces throughout the theater.&rdquo; Wu 'then made expressions of [China's] own policy, none of which were a surprise,&rdquo; Paparo said, after which he suggested that the two 'could have a channel of communication unaffected by policy&hellip;where he and I could ensure that there were no miscalculations.&rdquo; Wu was 'positive, but non-committal&rdquo; on the idea of a regular communication channel, Paparo said, adding that his attendance at the conference 'was a very positive sign.&rdquo; A press release issued by INDOPACOM after the conference noted that Paparo 'underscored the importance of sustained lines of communication between the U.S. military and the PLA&rdquo; in the in-person meeting. China, of late, has been having fewer run-ins with the U.S., but more with allies, which is 'why this channel is so important,&rdquo; Paparo said. Many of the recent aggressions have targeted Philippine vessels in the South China Sea, including a June attack by the Chinese coast guard on a Filipino naval craft involving an ax. 'This is how the gray zone is defined&hellip;actions by a state actor, where they use aggression in such a way&hellip;that achieves ends with violence, in a way that minimizes the risk of open, acknowledged armed conflict. There's always a risk of employing gray zone operation, but an &lsquo;armed attack' is amorphously defined,&rdquo; Paparo said. 'An ax is a dangerous weapon. And it's, there's a Philippine sailor minus a thumb. His name's Jeffrey. There's a human side to this. And that human side, it also includes the Philippine fisher folk, who are poor, whose livelihood depends on fishing these waters.&rdquo; Amid the escalating tensions, Paparo said in August that the U.S. is open to the idea of the U.S. escorting Philippine ships in the region. But, he clarified to Defense One, he was merely saying INDOPACOM is prepared to do so if asked. 'That's my duty as a commander, and it's my duty to have options prepared to cross the range of military operations,&rdquo; he said. Tensions have also escalated on the Korean peninsula, with North Korea launching multiple short-range ballistic weapons last week. North Korea's actions 'bear watching,&rdquo; Paparo said. 'We're deeply concerned with the growing numbers of deepening partnerships among North Korea-Russia, PRC-Russia.&rdquo; He added, 'While we remain concerned, we also remain confident in our ability to deter and respond to aggression in the north.&rdquo; China and Russia 'are demonstrating their ability to cooperate, and they're demonstrating their, quote, no limits partnership,&rdquo; he said. &hellip;'Having foreseen this, we have a significant, significant deterrent and response posture partnership ongoing with Indo-PACOM and NORTHCOM ongoing presently that's ready to intercept, ID, escort forces, and respond to forces&hellip;to ensure there's no seams.&rdquo; For the conference, Paparo said the greatest possible outcome could be that 'we come out of it with a common understanding of the environment, and we leave with a greater trust, so that when a problem arises, you have a baseline of trust, so that you can pick up the phone immediately and you can solve problems. And that's the greatest currency there is: Trust.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/every-lever-statecraft-needed-overcome-pacific-threats-commander-says/399830/	2024-09-25T13:34:56-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/Paparo_CHODs/large.jpg
Can AI predict if a Marine will quit? Corps wants to know	The U.S. Marine Corps isn't for everyone, but there's no real process for weeding out folks who sign the enlistment paperwork but are unlikely to make it through their four-year contract. A new experiential initiative uses artificial intelligence to predict whether a Marine recruit will complete their full term and, more importantly, pinpoint the factors that might get in the way of that goal, said the AI lead for the U.S. Marine Corps. 'We are using artificial intelligence to look at how we can recruit Marines, and we're looking at how we can retain them specifically,&rdquo; Capt. Chris Clark said during a Defense One Genius Machines event that aired Tuesday. 'We can assess what attributes might&hellip;first predict whether that Marine will complete that four-year term or not, and then go back and look at what attributes might be impacting that prediction. So then we can inform the recruiters. And they can use that to better prepare these Marines in different ways so that they can go out into the Marine Corps, do&hellip;great and amazing things, complete their four-year term, and then decide if they want to stay in or if they want to go on and do something else.&rdquo; The Marine Corps doesn't regularly publish figures for Marines who leave the service before their contract is up. But in 2017, the number was 5 percent of the entire active component, comprising 27 percent of all departures. The Corps has started offering new incentives to retain their people, particularly after their contract ends. But there are a lot of other factors that can contribute to quitting&mdash;things like fitness, exhaustion, personal or family stress, and other factors that wouldn't be affected by the promise of a bonus check. It's data the Marines can start to collect during recruitment, to predict the likelihood of recruits finishing a four-year tour. 'How can we understand a Marine when they're a poolee, so before they go to boot camp and become a Marine, how can we use different factors to be able to understand if they're going to complete their first fully four-year term, right?&rdquo; The 'retention prediction network,&rdquo; as Clark calls it, is still in an experimental phase. The use of artificial intelligence in employee recruitment and employee management is a controversial area, ripe with potential for lawsuits. But officials in the military and national security space have had the opportunity to experiment with AI for management for years to detect or predict emerging insider threat issues that could affect national security. A 2019 experimental program from the Defense Security Service sought to help managers better predict when an employee might be facing problems&mdash;not to push people out of the service, but to better anticipate when an employee is having challenges that affect their performance, so that a conversation could occur early, before the resignation letter. The value of the Marines' prediction network is similar, Clark said. It's not a replacement for human judgment, but a possible tool to allow recruiters or trainers to see something they might be missing. 'You know, a prediction is a prediction. It's not always right, but what it does is it gives us information that we can then use to inform those recruiters where they, you know, currently, don't have a lot to go on,&rdquo; he said. The Marines are using a similar tool to better plan exercises and operations&mdash; a large language model specifically applied to the vast repository of text the Marine Corps has amassed on various engagements over the years. The hope is to create a tool that can provide 'critical information for Marines to make decisions on how to plan that next exercise, operation, deployment, whatever it is that they're doing. They're able to take that data and do a lot with it, whether it's summarizing decades of information into a concise report, or just find key pieces of information and trends within that data,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/marine-corps-exploring-ai-predict-when-recruits-might-quit/399817/	2024-09-25T12:12:39-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/GettyImages_2157425285/large.jpg
FBI’s Carahsoft raid comes amid allegations of price-fixing	Editor's note: This story has been updated to affirm that it is unknown whether the raid was related to the ongoing civil court case. The FBI and Defense Criminal Investigative Service launched a joint raid Tuesday morning at Carahsoft's Reston, Va. headquarters. Law enforcement officials confirmed the raid but have yet to share details on what prompted the seizure of company records. 'We can confirm that DCIS executed a joint search warrant operation with the FBI in northern Virginia yesterday morning. We have nothing further to add, as this is an open investigation,&rdquo; a spokesperson for the Defense Department's audit office said in a statement. Richard Conway, an attorney for Carahsoft, did not return a request for comment. A company spokesperson also did not comment on the new details of the raid. News of the raid prompted speculation about possible &mdash; but thus far unsubstantiated &mdash; links to an ongoing court case that was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland last year and involved efforts to defraud government agencies. The names of the vendors allegedly involved in the scheme were redacted. A report in Bloomberg, citing an unredacted filing, named SAP and noted that prosecutors were also examining other resellers and a unit of Accenture. Both companies issued statements to Nextgov/FCW indicating they were cooperating with the U.S. Department of Justice in a civil investigation. Carahsoft employees were told Tuesday the raid was 'part of an investigation into a company with which Carahsoft has done business in the past&rdquo; and that the company is fully cooperating and 'operating business as usual,&rdquo; according to an email sent by Carahsoft President Craig Abod and obtained by Nextgov/FCW. Carahsoft is a leading IT vendor and reseller of technology products and services to public sector organizations, with prime spots on key federal governmentwide acquisition contracts such as NASA's Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement and the General Services Administration's Multiple Award Schedule. The raid occurred during the busiest time of the year for federal contractors. The U.S. government's fiscal year ends Sept. 30, where agencies have to finalize budgets, allocate remaining funds and push through last-minute contracts before the deadline. A Carahsoft employee, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, said that account representatives handling client relationships were directed by team leads to calm down vendors and assure them that there was nothing to fear. The ongoing civil case Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland last year indicate that the U.S. is looking into 'whether Carahsoft conspired with other companies to rig bids, inflate prices, overcharge, and defraud the Department of Defense (DoD), among other federal government agencies&rdquo; when it resold the products. The specific companies in question were redacted in the documents that Nextgov/FCW had retrieved. For a year, Carahsoft 'had not produced the full set of transaction records (including but not limited to the communications, solicitations, proposals, quotes, bids, award notices, orders, purchase orders, and invoices) for even a single project&rdquo; for the Justice Department and others involved. For months, frustration had mounted among DOJ lawyers, who claimed in court proceedings that the government's document requests and inquiries appeared to be delayed or unfulfilled by Carahsoft. 'We have offered to rewrite the question, but the response we've gotten from Carahsoft is saying that they don't want to answer the question,&rdquo; Justice Department trial attorney Samson Asiyanbi said. 'And it seems to us that they just don't want to answer it. And rather &mdash; because they don't want to answer it, they are coming up with all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't be required to do so.&rdquo; Carahsoft paid a $75 million fine to the government in 2015 to settle claims that the company and partner firm VMWare overcharged the government and concealed commercial pricing arrangements. Carahsoft did not admit wrongdoing in the settlement. GovExec's Frank Konkel and Washington Technology's Nick Wakeman and Ross Wilkers contributed to this report.

FBI’s Carahsoft raid tied to price-fixing allegations	Yesterday's FBI raid of Carahsoft was linked to allegations that the Pentagon contractor had for years worked with ostensible competitors to illegally fix prices for their services, according to documents filed in federal court. SAP, Accenture, and other firms are also under investigation for alleged violations of the False Claims Act that involved efforts to defraud government agencies, Bloomberg News reported. On Tuesday morning, the FBI and Defense Criminal Investigative Service launched a joint raid on the company's Reston, Va., headquarters, Nextgov/FCW first reported. Documents filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland last year indicate that the U.S. is looking into 'whether Carahsoft conspired with other companies to rig bids, inflate prices, overcharge, and defraud the Department of Defense (DoD), among other federal government agencies&rdquo; when it resold the products.

And rather &mdash; because they don't want to answer it, they are coming up with all sorts of reasons why they shouldn't be required to do so.&rdquo; The Justice Department may have reached a tipping point in its investigation and decided the best course of action was to raid the company in order to preserve evidence, said Jay Holland, a principal attorney at Joseph, Greenwald & Laake, a law firm based in Maryland. False Claims Act investigations vary by case, but if a raid was launched, it likely reflects earlier investigative work, Holland said. 'They're not going to start out by raiding companies' headquarters,&rdquo; he said in a phone interview. The DOJ 'would have done a significant amount of investigation&hellip;and determined that the gravity of the case warranted it.&rdquo; Carahsoft is a leading IT vendor and reseller of technology products and services to public-sector organizations, with prime spots on key federal governmentwide acquisition contracts such as NASA's Solutions for Enterprise-Wide Procurement and the General Services Administration's Multiple Award Schedule.

The D Brief: Pleas at the UN; Russia-China drone project?; China ...	Zelenskyy at the United Nations: 'Russia's war against Ukraine will end because the UN Charter will work. It must work. Our Ukrainian right to self-defense must prevail,&rdquo; Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy told the UN General Assembly on Tuesday. He also asked the international community not to 'tire&rdquo; of Russia's war on his country, nor to imagine that 'peace talks&rdquo; would bring peace. 'From the very first second of this war, Russia has been doing things that cannot possibly be justified under the UN Charter. Every destroyed Ukrainian city, every burned village, and there are already hundreds and hundreds, serves as proof that Russia is committing an international crime. And that's why this war can't simply &lsquo;fade away.' That's why this war can't be calmed by talks,&rdquo; he said. Notable: Zelenskyy's speech was a tentpole of his multi-day visit to the United States. The other will be a White House meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden in which the Ukrainian is slated to formally present a plan for stepped-up action and ultimately victory. Biden's final UNGA address. The U.S. president sounded a hopeful note and reiterated many of his administration's foreign-policy themes, including continued support for Ukraine and strengthening alliances in Europe and the Indo-Pacific. He said China has restarted its cooperation on stemming the global flow of deadly synthetic narcotics, and said the U.S. will continue to oppose unfair economic competition and coercion in the South China Sea. He also urged Israel and Hamas to finalize the ceasefire-and hostage deal put forth by the U.S., Qatar, and Egypt and endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. Here's a transcript from the White House. Speaking of the UN, Taiwan wants in. In a Defense One oped, Foreign Minister Lin Chia-Lung says his country and its citizens are unjustly excluded from UN activities, in part because of Beijing's misportrayal of the assembly's 1972 resolution recognizing the People's Republic of China. The false claim is 'one of the key elements in a campaign to establish the legal basis for justifying a future armed invasion of Taiwan,&rdquo; Lin writes, arguing that now is the time for the UN to push back.

New: Russia is allegedly operating a 'secret war drones project&rdquo; inside China, two European intelligence sources tell Reuters. Using apparent copies of two invoices from a Russian intermediary, the sources say Moscow's state-run arms firm Almaz-Antey is working with a subsidiary named IEMZ Kupol to test a Chinese-made drone with a range of over 1,200 miles known as Garpiya-3, or G3. Kupol has been under U.S. sanctions since last December. At least two of those G3 drones were delivered to Russia at unspecified dates, according to the invoices, which themselves were created over the summer. Five other 'military drones&rdquo; made in China were also delivered, but it's unclear what those five were. Why it matters: 'The two intelligence sources said the delivery of the sample drones to Kupol was the first concrete evidence their agency had found of whole UAVs manufactured in China being delivered to Russia since the Ukraine war began in February 2022,&rdquo; Reuters writes. Worth noting: Reuters says it was 'unable to determine whether the [Russian] defence ministry gave the company the green light to proceed with the serial production proposed.&rdquo; Expert reax: I would like a lot more information before jumping to any conclusions, researcher Sam Bendett of CNA said. That's at least partly because it's not clear why China would risk such an arrangement, he explained. 'For a factory to exist officially that builds UAVs for the Russians exposes China to some of the more severe effects of the sanctions, so it's not clear the extent to which China would be willing to expose itself.&rdquo; But that's not all: Another document lays out plans for 'a joint Russian-Chinese drone research and production centre in the Kashgar special economic zone in China's Xinjiang province,&rdquo; Reuters reports. Read more, including allegations China is building a drone similar to the U.S.-made Reaper, here. Meanwhile in the Russian motherland, authorities just released a postage stamp in an effort 'to popularize drones and UAVs across the country,&rdquo; Sam Bendett noticed and shared on social media Tuesday. Back in the U.S. on the campaign trail, former President Trump praised Russia's military as he argued Tuesday against giving Ukraine more military aid, the Associated Press reported from Savannah, Georgia. 'What happens if [the Russians] win? That's what they do, is they fight wars,&rdquo; Trump told his audience. 'As somebody told me the other day, they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon. That's what they do. They fight. And it's not pleasant.&rdquo; Trump also mocked Ukrainian President Zelenskyy as 'the greatest salesman on Earth,&rdquo; and lied about the amount of U.S. aid given to Ukraine. In a correction to his remarks, AP noted, 'The U.S. has provided more than $56 billion in security assistance since Russia invaded in 2022,&rdquo; citing State Department figures. New: China's military says it just launched an unarmed ICBM in what the BBC reports would be the first time since 1980. According to Beijing's Defense Ministry: 'The PLA Rocket Force launched an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) carrying a dummy warhead to the high seas in the Pacific Ocean at 08:44 on September 25th, and the missile fell into expected sea areas. This test launch is a routine arrangement in our annual training plan. It is in line with international law and international practice and is not directed against any country or target.&rdquo; Pertinent info: 'From Navigational Warnings and NOTAM's, it was fired from Hainan with a ~11 700 km range and RV impact near 10.4 S, 146.5 W,&rdquo; astronomer Marco Langbroek reports with supporting imagery and approximate 3D flight path. 'The Rv impact area was some 700 km from Nuku Hiva in French Polynesia, and some 875 km from Bora Bora,&rdquo; he writes. Expert reax: 'This launch is a powerful signal intended to intimidate everyone,&rdquo; said former Pentagon official Drew Thompson, now a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore. 'China chose to launch an ICBM during the United Nations General Assembly,&rdquo; Thompon noted, adding, 'This is not just a signal to the U.S., Japan, Philippines and Taiwan.&rdquo; New: The Philippines' military chief says he wants to host America's mid-range Typhon missile system 'forever,&rdquo; Chief of Staff Romeo Brawner Jr. said Wednesday at the 5th Asian Defense, Security, and Crisis Management Exhibition and Conference in Manila. Background: The U.S. brought the system to the Philippines in April for exercises, but it will now remain 'indefinitely,&rdquo; AP reported Wednesday, citing two Filipino officials. Worth noting: China's Foreign Ministry has protested the system for months, accusing the U.S. of undermining regional security. That's partly because the U.S. system can launch Tomahawk missiles, which have a range of 1,000 or so miles&mdash;putting China within reach. 'Don't throw stones when you live in a glass house,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. said at the conference. 'Why don't they lead by example?&rdquo; he said. 'Destroy their nuclear arsenal, remove all their ballistic missile capabilities, get out of the West Philippines Sea and get out of Mischief Reef.&rdquo; Read more, here.

Christopher Norrie, 3rd Infantry Division commander, said at a recent media roundtable. Deception is no less vital than ever.

Defense One's Patrick Tucker reports. Air Force debuts 'next-gen acquisition model.&rdquo; Long accustomed to buying its aircraft with everything included, the service is moving toward ordering the mission systems separately, acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said last week. An 'element of our next-generation acquisition model is having direct relationships, where it makes sense and where we can, with our mission system providers, and not simply working through a prime on individual platforms,&rdquo; Hunter said 'The reason why is: your mission systems have to integrate across a broad swath of our force in order to accomplish the missions that we have to do, the complex mission threads that go into high-intensity conflict with a peer competitor.&rdquo; Defense One's Audrey Decker has more, here. And lastly: The family of a Black World War II combat medic receives his medal for heroism. Waverly B. Woodson Jr. went ashore on D-Day with the 320th Barrage Balloon Battalion, the only African American combat unit assigned to the invasion by the still-segregated U.S. military. The medic spent 30 hours on the beach treating wounded troops, initially under heavy German fire that wounded him as well. Woodson, who was soon awarded the Bronze Star, died in 2005. But his family campaigned for greater recognition, and on Tuesday accepted his posthumous Distinguished Service Medal.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-25-2024/399811/	2024-09-25T08:47:12-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/DB_lander-1/large.png
China's satellites are dodging US eyes in space	The Pentagon has long been closed-mouthed about a family of U.S. spy satellites that since 2014 have kept an eye on foreign spacecraft in geosynchronous orbits. That hasn't stopped Chinese satellites from dodging them. U.S. officials declassified the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program a decade ago to show that they had eyes on high-Earth orbit, but they have rarely discussed the the six GSSAP satellites themselves, and they do not publish the standard location data meant to reduce collisions. Now, a new paper from the U.S. Air Force's China Aerospace Studies Institute explores what the Chinese know about GSSAP&mdash;and what they're doing about it. 'GSSAP's mission and the orbital elements of its current location are not classified; U.S. government and Western experts just don't often talk about it,&rdquo; wrote Kristin Burke, the institute's senior space and counterspace researcher. 'Consequently, the Chinese and others are filling the vacuum.&rdquo; U.S. military space leaders have said the GSSAP satellites perform rendezvous and proximity maneuvers to allow close-up looks at spacecraft in geosynchronous orbits, some 36,000 kilometers above Earth's surface. They've described the mission as a kind of 'neighborhood watch.&rdquo; In a Sept. 7 paper titled 'China Can Track GSSAP,&rdquo; Burke said that while U.S. officials may not want to discuss GSSAP, Chinese astronomers are carefully parsing data about where it flies and assembling a dossier on the GSSAP satellites' patterns. That means they know where to look and what to expect from the satellite. It also means, she wrote, that China is likely working on ways 'to autonomously detect and command [a Chinese] satellite to maneuver when its sensors notice anything similar to GSSAP's historical approaches.&rdquo; In other words, to scatter before the U.S. gets a closer look at it. 'We have seen Chinese satellites maneuvering and very clearly demonstrating that they know what the GSSAP is, what it's doing, changing their orbital trajectories, either to put them into position to keep an eye on them, or to make it harder for us to keep an eye on [a Chinese satellite],&rdquo; said Brendan Mulvaney, the director of the China Aerospace Studies Institute. 'China is out there developing the techniques, tactics, the procedures to be able to do orbital warfare. They're practicing.&rdquo; All of this creates a game of cat-and-mouse. In the paper, Burke points to an instance in February 2022 when two Chinese satellites predicted the third GSSAP satellite was approaching. As a result, one of the Chinese satellites repositioned itself and likely took a picture of the U.S. satellite in more favorable lighting conditions. In addition, Burke wrote that by using data from the International Scientific Optical Network, research organizations associated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the China Academy of Space Technology had determined which satellites GSSAP was scouting. The list included a 2017 approach of Russia's Luch satellite, which had frustrated commercial and government leaders with its own close approaches. Burke, who speaks and reads Mandarin, also offers further details about GSSAP's movements in the paper. For example, she explained that a Chinese military report in 2021 showed that a year earlier a GSSAP-2 satellite moved within 8.71 kilometers of another satellite. For perspective, a CSIS study found that the median distance between satellites in geosynchronous orbit is 207 kilometers. 'There's not a whole lot of reason to get that close other than to demonstrate, &lsquo;I'm going to get this close and you're not going to do anything about it,'&rdquo; Mulvaney said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/one-way-learn-about-us-spy-satellites-china/399816/	2024-09-25T08:14:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/25/In_August_2016_a_De_2500-1/large.jpg
Can AI predict if a Marine will quit? Corps wants to know	The U.S. Marine Corps isn't for everyone, but there's no real process for weeding out folks who sign the enlistment paperwork but are unlikely to make it through their four-year contract. A new experiential initiative uses artificial intelligence to predict whether a Marine recruit will complete their full term and, more importantly, to pinpoint the factors that might get in the way of that goal, the Corps' AI lead says. 'We are using artificial intelligence to look at how we can recruit Marines, and we're looking at how we can retain them specifically,&rdquo; Capt. Chris Clark said during a Defense One Genius Machines event that aired Tuesday. 'We can assess what attributes might&hellip;first predict whether that Marine will complete that four-year term or not, and then go back and look at what attributes might be impacting that prediction. So then we can inform the recruiters. And they can use that to better prepare these Marines in different ways so that they can go out into the Marine Corps, do&hellip;great and amazing things, complete their four-year term, and then decide if they want to stay in or if they want to go on and do something else.&rdquo; The serivce doesn't regularly say what percentage of Marines leave before their first contract is up. But in 2017, the number was 5 percent of the active component, comprising 27 percent of all departures. The Corps has started offering new incentives to retain their people, particularly after their contract ends. But there are a lot of other factors that can contribute to quitting&mdash;things like fitness, exhaustion, personal or family stress, and other factors that wouldn't be affected by the promise of a bonus check. It's data the Marines can start to collect during recruitment, to predict the likelihood of recruits finishing a four-year tour. 'How can we understand a Marine when they're a poolee, so before they go to boot camp and become a Marine, how can we use different factors to be able to understand if they're going to complete their first fully four-year term, right?&rdquo; The 'retention prediction network,&rdquo; as Clark calls it, is still in an experimental phase. The use of artificial intelligence in employee recruitment and employee management is a controversial area, ripe with potential for lawsuits. But officials in the military and national security space have had the opportunity to experiment with AI for management for years to detect or predict emerging insider threat issues that could affect national security. A 2019 experimental program from the Defense Security Service sought to help managers better predict when an employee might be facing problems&mdash;not to push people out of the service, but to better anticipate when an employee is having challenges that affect their performance, so that a conversation could occur early, before the resignation letter. The value of the Marines' prediction network is similar, Clark said. It's not a replacement for human judgment, but a possible tool to allow recruiters or trainers to see something they might be missing. 'You know, a prediction is a prediction. It's not always right, but what it does is it gives us information that we can then use to inform those recruiters where they, you know, currently, don't have a lot to go on,&rdquo; he said. The Marines are using a similar tool to better plan exercises and operations&mdash; a large language model specifically applied to the vast repository of text that the Marine Corps has amassed on various engagements over the years. The hope is to create a tool that can provide 'critical information for Marines to make decisions on how to plan that next exercise, operation, deployment, whatever it is that they're doing. They're able to take that data and do a lot with it, whether it's summarizing decades of information into a concise report, or just find key pieces of information and trends within that data,&rdquo; he said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/marine-corps-exploring-ai-predict-when-recruits-might-quit/399798/	2024-09-24T16:25:10-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/GettyImages_2157425285-4/large.jpg
Mission systems sold separately: Air Force debuts ‘next-gen acqui...	The Air Force, long accustomed to buying its aircraft with everything included, is moving toward ordering the mission systems separately. An 'element of our next-generation acquisition model is having direct relationships, where it makes sense and where we can, with our mission system providers, and not simply working through a prime on individual platforms,&rdquo; said Andrew Hunter, the service's acquisition chief. 'The reason why is: your mission systems have to integrate across a broad swath of our force in order to accomplish the missions that we have to do, the complex mission threads that go into high-intensity conflict with a peer competitor.&rdquo; The Air Force is using this approach for its next-generation tanker, called Next-Generation Aerial Refueling System, or NGAS, Hunter said, pointing to a recent call to industry for information on the new plane's mission systems. 'We want to engage industry early [and] have them help us inform our requirements-generation process and do it in an iterative fashion. We don't want to do it with just one part of industry,&rdquo; Hunter told reporters last week at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. By year's end, the service aims to wrap up an analysis of alternatives that should give officials a better sense of future refueling needs and when the NGAS plane might arrive. If the next tanker takes longer than expected to be fielded, the service will need to buy more near-term refueling aircraft to serve the fleet. Hunter has previously said that interim buy will likely, but not definitely, be the Boeing KC-46. 'We're going to need to buy something to cover down continued tanker production. That construct is still the case, but it's critically dependent on getting after NGAS and how quickly we can get to NGAS,&rdquo; Hunter said last week. The Air Force is trying to measure-twice-cut-once for both NGAS and its Next-Generation Air Dominance program, which has been paused as the service mulls the cost and design of the sixth-generation fighter. These future programs are intertwined, officials say, as previous concepts of air dominance have evolved. 'We are looking at not just the NGAD platform. We're also looking at NGAS, using the AOA as a big input on that, and also the work we've been doing on [collaborative combat aircraft] increment two, so those are all kind of coming together. We're going to have, hopefully, decisions on what that package of capability is going to look like. Then, by the way, we've got to figure out how we pay for it, which I think may, at the end of the day, be our biggest problem,&rdquo; Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said last week.	https://www.defenseone.com/policy/2024/09/mission-systems-sold-separately-air-force-debuts-next-gen-acquisition-model/399783/	2024-09-24T13:13:19-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/mission_systems_160519_F_OE991_102/large.jpg
Armored unit adapts old tech to lessons from Ukraine	Even as the U.S. Army works to modernize its light infantry brigades, one armored brigade is also pushing to adapt&mdash;with the tech they already have on hand, service officers said this month. 'We've been transforming both in how we approach training and then how we're innovating in the realm of [unmanned aerial systems], counter [drone], and electromagnetic [warfare],&rdquo; Maj. Gen. Christopher Norrie, 3rd Infantry Division commander, said at a media roundtable Friday. 'Much of what we're doing right now is just using what we have better.&rdquo; In July, the division's 1st Armored Brigade Combat Team got to test out these new tactics, some drawn from observations of Ukraine, at a rotation through the Army's National Training Center. The center, located at Fort Irwin, California, pits incoming brigades against the highly trained Blackhorse unit in hyper-realistic simulations of actual combat. Before going to the training center, electronic warfare soldiers first spent time monitoring the 1st Brigade's command posts and then briefed commanders on what their electronic signature looked like, said Col. Jim Armstrong, the brigade's commander. 'Every time the battalion [tactical operations center] or the brigade [tactical operations center] went out for training, our [electronic warfare] platoon went out there and mapped them in the spectrum,&rdquo; he said, speaking at the Fort Moore Maneuver Conference earlier in September. The electronic warfare platoon was also given commercially available direction-finding equipment to locate enemy positions, and they trained with the unit's reconnaissance squadron, Armstrong added. [[Related Posts]] The desert environment of NTC gave the unit no room to hide&mdash;if the soldiers who play the enemy saw a cellphone signal, there'd be little doubt it belonged to someone in the 3rd Infantry Division. So Armstrong brought in fake devices that he hoped would deceive any watchful observers. 'Instead of hiding in the clutter, we knew we would have to bring our own clutter to hide in,&rdquo; he said. As part of this effort, the unit used the knowledge they'd gained from monitoring the brigade's command post to set up a decoy command post, complete with tents and their actual satellite trailer. The unit was able to stock the site with its own gear because the soldiers were running their real command post over new Starlink satellite terminals that offer better speeds. The soldiers then keyed the fake command post's communications network to emit transmissions as though it was a real command post. The unit also placed cell phones and WiFi pucks in the fake post. The trick worked: the soldiers who play the enemy jammed the fake command post and also hit the fake site with simulated indirect fire, exposing their own position, Armstrong said. Still, the experience revealed challenges with the concept, including how to make a fake command post appear to have realistic signs of life. Having soldiers move back and forth across the site would be more realistic, but would open those soldiers up to enemy attack. 'How do you create a footprint out of that without having a soldier there?&rdquo; Armstrong said. The unit also struggled to maintain deception planning as the exercise went on, he said. The unit brought 90 drones to the exercise, Norrie said during the media roundtable. While 70 of these drones were small Black Hornets, used by infantry squads, the remaining 20 drones were larger quadcopters or tethered drones, which can fly longer because of their connection to electricity. The brigade found the drones useful for artillery target correction and reconnaissance, Armstrong said, as well as helping to monitor the amount of smoke needed to obscure large armored vehicles as they prepared to assault enemy positions. The unit organized some of its drones into a drone team, said Armstrong, who compared the practice to how the 101st Airborne's 2nd brigade manages its drones. 'We're in close coordination with folks like the [2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division],' said Armstrong, speaking at the media roundtable. The 101st's 2nd Brigade is one of three light infantry brigades that are testing new equipment and developing new tactics as part of an Army modernization effort called 'transforming in contact.&rdquo; Rather than try to constantly deconflict airspace for drones and helicopters, the unit also established that drones could fly any time, as long as they were under 150 feet, Armstrong said during his presentation at the Maneuver Conference. One-way attack drones should be thought of as munitions for airspace-deconfliction purposes, Armstrong said. 'If you're going to fire a 203 grenade round, you don't call the brigade aviation element&rdquo; for airspace deconfliction&hellip;It's a mortar round with a camera that can fly.&rdquo; In addition to drone operations, the brigade also practiced counter-drone procedures ahead of their training, said Command Sgt. Maj. Ryan Roush. The drills teach a simple lesson, Armstrong said: 'If you're sitting in the open, you're dying,&rdquo; Amid all the adaptation, soldiers also grappled with how the elements could quickly negate their tech. As daytime temperatures hit 110 degrees, the brigade's vehicles got so hot that their artillery coordination software slowed to a crawl for hours. 'The only variant of the [Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle] that has any climate control is the medical variant,&rdquo; Armstrong said.	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/armored-unit-adapts-old-tech-lessons-ukraine/399785/	2024-09-24T11:32:58-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/Screenshot_2024_09_24_at_8.32.13AM/large.png
FBI raids defense contractor Carahsoft	The FBI has raided the headquarters of Carahsoft Technology Corp., a provider of IT, software, and cybersecurity services to the Pentagon and others, according to two people familiar with the matter. The raid was conducted in Reston, Virginia, sometime Tuesday morning, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified due to the matter's sensitivity. 'We can confirm that the FBI conducted court-authorized law enforcement activity on Sunset Hills Road this morning. We decline to comment further,&rdquo; an FBI spokesperson said in a statement. Carahsoft is a privately held provider of IT services and software to the Pentagon and other public-sector clients. It has secured billions of dollars in contracts with agencies like the Social Security Administration, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Treasury, according to GovTribe, a federal market intelligence platform owned by Nextgov/FCW parent company GovExec. Carahsoft CEO Craig Abod and a company spokesperson did not immediately return requests for comment. Several notes and images of what appeared to be the raid were posted in a Reddit channel purportedly used by company employees. Nextgov/FCW could not immediately verify the contents of the images, though one appeared to show a group of FBI agents dressed in uniform walking through the office. Another image obtained separately by Nextgov/FCW showed a trio of FBI agents dressed in uniform walking into a building entrance.

Want peace in the Pacific? Bring Taiwan into the UN system	Large parts of the world&mdash;and billions of people&mdash;have enjoyed great prosperity thanks to the peace and stability that prevail across the 97-mile strait separating China from Taiwan. Our island is an indispensable partner in global supply chains, producing more than 90 percent of the world's high-end semiconductors, including many of the advanced chips that are driving the AI revolution. And half of the world's seaborne trade passes through the Taiwan Strait, making it a key international waterway. All this is threatened by Beijing's attempts to change the status quo across the strait and to expand authoritarianism throughout the Indo-Pacific region. In recent years, global leaders have used bilateral and multilateral occasions&mdash;including G7, EU, NATO, and ASEAN meetings&mdash;to highlight the importance of maintaining peace and stability across the strait. Now is the time for the largest international organization of all, the United Nations, to rethink unjustified policies that exclude Taiwan. The UN should begin by resisting PRC pressure to distort UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, the 1971 decision 'to recognize the representatives of [the PRC] Government as the only legitimate representatives of China to the United Nations, and to expel forthwith the representatives of Chiang Kai-shek from the place which they unlawfully occupy at the United Nations and in all the organizations related to it.&rdquo; China has since willfully misrepresented Resolution 2758, citing it in assertions that Taiwan is part of the PRC and has no legitimate right to meaningfully participate in the UN and its specialized agencies. This misrepresentation has far-reaching consequences beyond denying Taiwanese citizens and journalists access to UN premises and preventing them from visiting, attending meetings, and engaging in newsgathering. Beijing's weaponization of Resolution 2758 is one of the key elements in a campaign to establish the legal basis for justifying a future armed invasion of Taiwan. But in fact, Resolution 2758 addresses only China's representation in the UN. It does not mention Taiwan. It neither states that Taiwan is part of the PRC nor ascribes to the PRC any right to represent Taiwan in the UN system. In other words, the resolution has nothing to do with Taiwan. This case is illustrative of the PRC's growing assertiveness in imposing its will on the international stage. If left unchallenged and uncorrected, Beijing will alter the status quo across the Taiwan Strait, jeopardize peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific, and threaten the rules-based international order. Thankfully, in recent months, several senior U.S. officials have criticized the PRC's distortion of Resolution 2758 to justify its spurious claim over Taiwan. Furthermore, on July 30, the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, an international organization comprising over 250 lawmakers from 38 countries and the EU, demonstrated their support for Taiwan by passing a model resolution on Resolution 2758. The UN should follow suit. The PRC's expansionism will not stop at Taiwan. Other efforts to chip away at long-settled international claims include, for example, the recent regulations introduced by the China Coast Guard. By introducing rules that justify the boarding and detaining of vessels and allow individuals to enter disputed maritime areas, Beijing aims to assert control over international waters and challenge global norms and claims. History has shown that democratic resolve must be demonstrated ahead of time&mdash;before it is too late. As the world's foremost forum for international cooperation, the UN system is ideally positioned to address regional security challenges and support global economic stability. The ongoing 79th UNGA and its upcoming Summit of the Future present a timely opportunity to address key security concerns while advancing the broader goals of global sustainable development and building a more resilient global community for current and future generations. Over many decades, Taiwan has proven to be a responsible and reliable partner to those it has worked with. More recently, we have also made significant contributions to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Embracing Taiwan's meaningful participation in the UN system would be the UN's best option for heading off regional crises, maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, and spurring global prosperity.	https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2024/09/want-peace-pacific-bring-taiwan-un-system/399772/	2024-09-24T09:28:33-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: US troops to Mideast; Navy oiler aground; US sets da...	Developing: The U.S. is sending a 'small number&rdquo; of additional troops to the Middle East, the Pentagon said in a short statement Monday, capping a weekend of Israeli-Hezbollah attacks that resulted in Lebanon's largest one-day death toll in more than 30 years, with more than 550 people killed from Israeli strikes, according to the BBC. Several U.S. warships departed their home port in Norfolk on Monday, including the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, two destroyers (DDG-55 and DDG-109) and a cruiser (CG-64). First Ike, now Truman. Truman is set to join the USS Abraham Lincoln (out of San Diego), which was diverted from its Pacific mission to the Middle East to support Israel and U.S. forces nearby. It arrived last month to relieve the USS Theodore Roosevelt carrier (also from San Diego), which had been in the region since June. Roosevelt had replaced the Norfolk-based USS Dwight D. Eisenhower after its 'unprecedented&rdquo; eight-month mission that began immediately after Hamas's Oct. 7 attacks that killed more than 1,000 Israelis and triggered supporting attacks by other militants in the region: the Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen, Iranian proxies in Iraq and eastern Syria, Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Iran itself in mid-April. By the way: U.S. Navy replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn 'ran aground&rdquo; and is now 'partially flooded off the coast of Oman,&rdquo; according to industry watcher gCaptain. The situation now leaves the Lincoln carrier group 'without its primary fuel source.&rdquo; Why it matters: 'The Big Horn is the only oiler the Navy has in the Middle East,&rdquo; gCaptain reports. See leaked video and photos seeming to illustrate a damaged rudder post as well as flooding in a mechanical space here and here, respectively. Q. Does the Pentagon view the latest Israeli-Hezbollah exchanges as a spreading war? 'No, I don't think we've gotten to that point,&rdquo; Press Secretary Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Monday. 'I mean, what you don't see is multiple nations conducting operations against one another in the region and you know, in protracted, sustained operations,&rdquo; Ryder explained, in what sounded just a bit like a straw-man rebuttal. In video: 60 seconds of Israel's Iron Dome intercepting missiles fired from Lebanon over Haifa on Monday, via the Associated Press. An Israeli strike on a purported Hezbollah weapons cache in southern Lebanon. The 3:50 mark of this video shows the immediate aftermath of an Israeli strike on an apparently ordinary home, which appears to have set off dozens of secondary explosions you can see in an extended clip here. Israeli PM Netanyahu's warning: 'Anyone who has a missile in their living room and a rocket in their garage will not have a home,&rdquo; the prime minister said in a video posted to social media on Tuesday. New today: Israel says it killed Hezbollah's missile chief, a man named Ibrahim Muhammad al-Qubasi, in a targeted strike inside southern Beirut on Tuesday. 'Al-Qubaysi was responsible for Hezbollah's various missile units, including precision-guided missile units,&rdquo; Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee said. 'At the time of the raid, al-Qubaisi was accompanied by a number of senior Hezbollah missile system commanders,&rdquo; he said without elaborating.

Developing: U.S. and Iraqi officials appear to have agreed to a new timeline for the exit of most American forces, U.S. defense officials said over the weekend while being careful to avoid pretty much any specifics yet again. 'This month marks the 10th anniversary of the formation of the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, and after a decade of that coalition, and particularly the defeat of the territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria, there have been discussions going on really over the last year about the evolution of the coalition and the mission,&rdquo; a senior White House official told reporters Friday. 'We will be transitioning away from the coalition military mission in Iraq more to enduring bilateral security partnerships,&rdquo; the official said while adding moments later, 'we haven't reached any final conclusions.&rdquo; U.S. defense officials are eyeing the end of 2026 to withdraw most coalition troops from Iraq, the Wall Street Journal reported Friday. But 'Even after 2026, a small U.S. force is likely to remain in an advisory capacity and for logistical support for American troops based in Syria under a new bilateral security agreement with Iraq.&rdquo; That agreement is expected to be announced as soon as this week, just ahead of the next counter-ISIS coalition meeting on September 30. For what it's worth: State Secretary Antony Blinken met with Iraqi PM Mohammed Shia' Al Sudani Monday in New York on the sidelines of this week's United Nations General Assembly. The two officials 'reaffirmed our enduring bilateral security partnership to ensure regional stability, the defeat of ISIS, and ongoing efforts to advance a secure and sovereign Iraq,&rdquo; according to Blinken's spokesman. Also from the region: The Houthi takeover of Yemen's capital of Sana'a is now 10 years old, Mike Knights of the Washington Institute wrote last week in an extended note of caution. After enumerating policy stumbles from Washington and London, he warns, 'Removing the Houthis from power will now require a new multi-year, or even multi-decade effort, including a probable return to war inside Yemen.&rdquo; Read more, here. Lastly: Dueling robot wingmen took the stage at last week's AFA conference. But questions of survivability, missions, and sustainment of the Air Force's planned collaborative combat aircraft still linger. Last week, Anduril Industries and General Atomics carefully wheeled their drones into a Maryland convention center for the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference, where industry executives and military officials eagerly discussed how these collaborative combat aircraft might shape the future of air superiority, what missions and roles they might fill, and how they will balance survivability and affordability. Defense One's Audrey Decker reports.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-24-2024/399769/	2024-09-24T08:30:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/24/DB_lander/large.png
Dueling robot wingmen take the stage	Two years ago, autonomous drones designed to fly and fight alongside fighter jets were just a gleam in Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall's eye. Now, full-scale mock-ups of the robot wingmen are here&mdash;and made a splashy appearance at the service's mainstay conference. Last week, Anduril Industries and General Atomics carefully wheeled their drones into a Maryland convention center for the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference, where industry executives and military officials eagerly discussed how these collaborative combat aircraft might shape the future of air superiority, what missions and roles they might fill, and how they will balance survivability and affordability. The two companies beat out three defense giants earlier this year&mdash;Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Boeing&mdash;to win development contracts for their CCAs. Service leaders want to see flying versions next year, and plan to decide in 2026 whether to build one or both of the companies' offerings as 'increment one,&rdquo; the first tranche of CCAs. The seven-year-old Anduril is pitching its Fury drone, which the company absorbed with its 2023 purchase of autonomous drone maker Blue Force Technologies. General Atomics is offering a version of its Gambit family of aircraft. In addition to the full-scale CCA mockup, the venerable dronemaker also showed off the XQ-67 aircraft, which officials described as a potential 'sensor&rdquo; to the CCA's 'shooter.&rdquo; The XQ-67, which first flew in February, was developed through the Air Force's secretive Off-Board Sensing Station program and helped shape the company's armed CCA concept. The Fury mock-up on the show floor was slightly smaller than General Atomics' offering, and showed external weapons storage, which could make it the less stealthy of the two. (Both may be less stealthy than the tailless UCAVs that China is developing.) The increment-one CCAs will essentially act as missile trucks that haul air-to-air missiles for manned fighters. Increment two will kick off next year, and while requirements are still being worked out, are slated to add mission sets like electronic attack, resilient sensing, and different types of weapons, said Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, Air Force director of force design, integration and wargaming. Future versions could also feature different styles of sustainment and takeoff and landing, Kunkel said, perhaps runaway-independent drones. A key consideration while industry develops their CCA offerings is how survivable the drones should be, given the Air Force's desire to keep the new drones' price tags under $30 million&mdash;roughly, one-third as much as an F-35. The CCAs need to be survivable enough to reach their weapons launch point, but cheap enough to be procured in mass, officials say. 'Obviously, you don't want to have these aircraft get out there and just all get shot down, and obviously, you don't want them to be silver bullets where they cost so much that you can't afford to lose them,&rdquo; said Dave Alexander, president of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems. Alexander said his company's offering hits a price/survivability 'sweet spot,&rdquo; in part because it can carry defensive systems he did not name. But officials with Lockheed Martin, whose design wasn't selected for the first tranche of CCAs, say the notion of a non-stealthy sweet spot was illusory. The company's operational analysis indicates that unstealthy robot wingmen are very unlikely to return from combat, and at $15 or $20 million a pop, that is a 'losing proposition,&rdquo; said John Clark, vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works division. With that analysis in hand, Clark said, Lockheed had submitted a stealthier design than its rivals. 'I think, hindsight 20/20, we could certainly armchair quarterback and say, well, the Air Force isn't valuing survivability right now, so we gold-plated something that they didn't need gold-plating,&rdquo; he said. Clark said Lockheed is changing its approach for increment two: The company will offer a more expendable design 'at a much, much lower cost point,&rdquo; he said. The Air Force's Kunkel dismissed such concerns, saying that the service has a 'very solid understanding&rdquo; of how survivable it needs its CCAs to be. What it doesn't yet understand is how to keep them flying without an 8,000-mile supply chain. 'We've got to build in these systems, the ability to have a limited signature, to be small enough, to be mobile enough, to have a sustainment pipeline that doesn't go all the way back to Marietta, Georgia. You've got to be able to sustain these things in the combat zone, to frankly, put them in multiple places that creates multiple dilemmas for our adversary when they're on the ground,&rdquo; Kunkel said. The Air Force is already gearing up for the first delivery of these aircraft, and are virtually testing how these drones will pair with manned fighters. The service is setting up an experimental operations unit to test CCA concepts at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada, and is plugging the CCAs into the Joint Simulation Environment, a next-gen flight simulator that holds virtual F-35 and F-22 cockpits, Gen. Kenneth Wilsbach, commander of Air Combat Command, said during the conference. The first CCAs will go to Creech Air Force Base for testing, Wilsbach said, a base known for its drone operations. 'We're starting to learn more in the virtual environment on how we might use these and then ultimately we'll have iron on the ramp at Creech Air Force Base. We have a team of people already at Nellis starting to work,&rdquo; Wilsbach said.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/dueling-robot-wingmen-take-stage/399746/	2024-09-23T14:28:11-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/23/cca_tilt2/large.jpg

The Space Force is halfway through its two-year experiment of monitoring fitness via smartwatches instead of physical fitness tests. The service's top enlisted leader recently shared his experience with the program&mdash;and how he envisions health data intersecting with troop readiness. Air Force Research Laboratory began the two-year, all-volunteer study in May 2023 as part of its Holistic Health Approach. Volunteers must wear their Garmin smartwatches when exercising and fill out questionnaires that are submitted to AFRL's 711th Human Performance Wing. 'Right now, we're in a study period with [the] Air Force Research Lab. So because we're in a study period, I'm a little limited on not only the information that I have access to, what I'm able to talk about, so I can share with you my personal journey,&rdquo; Space Force Chief Master Sgt. John Bentivegna, told reporters during the annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Last year, the Space Force got about 6,000 Garmin smartwatches to dole out to participants in the experiment, which tracks cardio fitness and physical activity. [[Related Posts]] Bentivegna's exercise goal is to hit '150 intensity minutes a week,&rdquo; and he posts updates and his workouts to his personal social media account for additional accountability. The program lets guardians choose their favorite activities. 'I prefer biking, it's what I like to do,&rdquo; he said. 'But it gives flexibility to the [service member] to do the exercise that suits them&hellip;and it's trackable.&rdquo; Exercising regularly and providing feedback through the questionnaires are mandatory for study participants, Air & Space Forces Magazine previously reported. Failure to do either could get participants dismissed from the program, which would mean they'd have to go back to taking regular physical fitness tests. But if the program is broadly adopted, it could be used to improve human performance, or the data could be used in conjunction with other fitness data the military collects, such as the Air Force's mandatory waist-to-height measurement for body composition, to see how it correlates. 'We have individuals who are doing all their intensity minutes, but what's your body composition? Are they aligned, right? Is this working out the right way?&rdquo; Bentivegna said. Study volunteers' data isn't shared with senior leaders. But Bentivegna, as the Space Force's top enlisted leader, said he could envision the program eventually giving leaders better insights into troops' overall wellness. 'So if I have a guardian who's constantly exercising, and has healthy lifestyles, making healthy choices. And I pull up my dashboard and I see that someone has a change in their behavior, a change in their routine, I have an opportunity to engage early. Is everything OK? Are you hurt, or am I working you too hard that you don't have the time now that you need to dedicate to yourself for your fitness and your health, right?&rdquo; he said. 'I like it, because in the long run&mdash;and this is my vision as a leader&mdash;I want to be able to collect the data, because I want it to be a leading indicator to understand the health of the force.&rdquo; But the watches do have a downside: even though they're cleared to go in secure locations, they can't go overseas, Bentivegna said. 'If it's a Department of the Air Force accredited SCIF, I can bring it in, as long as I don't bring it overseas. And like three days after I became chief master sergeant of the Space Force, I traveled to Japan with Gen. [B. Chance] Saltzman, and I brought my watch with me so I was no longer accredited, so I couldn't wear it to work all the time,&rdquo; he said. 'There are some guardians that can wear them to work, others that can't. So, we're working through some of that. But again, it's a study. We're collecting data.&rdquo; AFRL didn't return requests for comment before publication.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/space-force-issued-thousands-smartwatches-replace-pt-tests/399762/	2024-09-23T13:44:28-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/23/Screenshot_2024_09_23_at_10.43.15AM/large.png
The D Brief: ‘Staggering’ toll in Lebanon; Deal averts shutdown; ...	For the fourth consecutive day, Israeli warplanes are attacking suspected Hezbollah positions across Lebanon in a series of strikes that have killed at least 274 people so far, according to Lebanon's Ministry of Health. 'For context, that's ~20% of the total death toll from the entire 2006 [Israeli-Hezbollah] war, which lasted 34 days,&rdquo; says Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute. Reuters describes the attacks as the most intense since the end of Lebanon's civil war in 1990. (For a longer history of Israel-Lebanon violence stretching back more than 75 years, Reuters offers this abbreviated timeline.) More than 1,000 others have been wounded in the Israeli air attacks, which the Associated Press describes as 'a staggering one-day toll for a country still reeling from a deadly attack on communication devices last week.&rdquo; The weekend strikes have targeted more than 400 rocket launchers, thousands of rocket barrels, and suspected Hezbollah facilities in multiple waves of airstrikes that have continued through Monday morning, according to the Israeli military. But Hezbollah militants continue to launch rockets into northern Israel, including another barrage Monday around the northern city of Haifa. The Iran-backed terrorists launched at least three separate rocket attacks Saturday, with targets including Israel's northernmost Ramat David airbase. Nearly 90 more short- and medium-range Hezbollah rockets targeted Israeli defense firm Rafael Advanced Defense Systems near Haifa on Sunday as well. (Rafael makes the Iron Dome air defense system.) For what it's worth, 'these latest Hezbollah attacks are slightly smaller in scale than previous retaliatory attacks the group has conducted,&rdquo; analysts at the Institute for the Study of War, based in Washington, said Sunday evening. During one recent such attack, 'Hezbollah fired between 200 and 300 projectiles, including around 20 one-way attack drones, on August 24 in retaliation to Israel killing [a] top Hezbollah commander.&rdquo; Israel's stated goal with these attacks: Degrade Hezbollah enough to allow 60,000 people who have been displaced from northern Israel to return to their homes. It's not at all clear how soon that goal could be achieved, as the BBC's Daniel De Simone notes from Jerusalem. The Israelis say Hezbollah has turned several homes across southern Lebanon into storage sites for weapons, including one house that allegedly hid a Russian-made cruise missile before it was blown up in an Israeli strike several weeks ago. Here's a video illustrating that allegation. Bibi: 'No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities,&rdquo; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video Sunday evening. 'We will take whatever action is necessary to restore security and to bring our people safe back to their homes,&rdquo; he promised. SecDef Austin's calls with Gallant: Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin rang his Israeli counterpart twice over the course of Israel's hectic weekend, with calls on Saturday and Sunday. In both calls, Austin conveyed U.S. support for Israel's right to defend itself and he 'stressed the importance of finding a path to a diplomatic solution&rdquo; as well as a ceasefire eventually. Austin also rang Saudi military chief Khalid bin Salman on Friday to chat about 'reducing tensions across the region.&rdquo; Tiny bit more in the Pentagon's readout, here. Developing: World leaders are en route to the United Nations HQs in New York for the annual General Assembly, with six days of major speeches scheduled to begin Tuesday. Reminder: Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza is still ongoing, and has created an enormous challenge for aid workers in the region, UN agency chiefs said in a joint statement Monday. 'These atrocities must end,&rdquo; they pleaded. 'Allowing the abhorrent, downward spiral caused by this war in the Occupied Palestinian Territory to continue will have unimaginable, global consequences,&rdquo; they warned.

Ukrainian President Zelenskyy visited an artillery production factory in Pennsylvania on Sunday. His message: 'I am grateful to the people of Scranton, Pennsylvania, and all the states where Americans are building this incredible arsenal of global freedom,&rdquo; he said on social media, with video of his trip. 'I emphasized the dedication of the workers, which is truly inspiring&mdash;they are helping Ukraine stand strong in our fight for freedom,&rdquo; Zelenskyy wrote. Zelenskyy is visiting the U.S. for the UN General Assembly this week in New York. Zelenskyy's also reportedly carrying a 'victory plan&rdquo; for his visit with President Biden and VP Harris on Thursday, Reuters reported Monday from Kyiv. During that meeting, 'The leaders will discuss the state of the war between Russia and Ukraine, including Ukraine's strategic planning and U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression,&rdquo; the White House said last week.

Like most continuing resolutions&mdash;the legislation Congress uses to fund government operations after it fails to approve a budget on time&mdash;this one prevents new program starts and holds funding to 2024 levels, with a few exceptions. The big one is adding $240 million for the Secret Service in the wake of two apparent assassination attempts on GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. Also: 'additional money was added to aid with the presidential transition, among other things,&rdquo; AP reports. The deal pushes the deadline for negotiations on 2025 spending past the November election&mdash;but not into the new calendar year, as House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, had wanted. That lengthier timeline would have hindered national security, CSIS' Seamus P. Daniels and AEIs' Todd Harris argued last week. It also represents a defeat for Trump, who loudly pushed vote-fraud myths as he pressed Johnson and House GOPers to allow a shutdown unless a controversial voting law were passed. Update: The U.S. Army lifted its stop work order on a $990 million contract for loitering munitions from AeroVironment, according to a filing on Monday by the company. The Army had briefly stopped work due to a protest from Mistral, an industry executive previously told Defense One's Sam Skove. From Defense One's Lauren C.

'For that reason, connected vehicles and the technology they use bring new vulnerabilities and threats, especially in the case of vehicles or components developed in the P.R.C. and other countries of concern,&rdquo; he said. 'It doesn't take much imagination to understand how a foreign adversary with access to this information could pose a serious risk to both our national security and the privacy of U.S. citizens,&rdquo; Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement. About the ban, according to the New York Times: It 'would apply to all wheeled vehicles on the road, including cars, trucks and buses. It would exclude vehicles not used on public roads, like those for agriculture or mining.&rdquo; And 'The ban on Chinese- or Russian-origin software in connected and autonomous vehicles would start in model year 2027,&rdquo; and 'would also ban hardware integrated into vehicle connectivity systems beginning in model year 2030.&rdquo; Read more in the White House's fact sheet, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-23-2024/399739/	2024-09-23T08:59:07-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/23/DB_lander/large.png
The Air Force wants to expand cloud-based comms, official says	The Air Force's top tech integration office has been busy deploying cloud-based command and communications tools for air defense. Now, the goal is to take them to operational systems while expanding use of tactical kits, said Brig. Gen. Luke Cropsey, program executive officer for Command, Control, Communications and Battle Management, or C3BM. 'I told you a year ago that we were deploying capability out, from a cloud-based command and control perspective, to air defense sectors. It's out, it's at all of them. It's running, they're using it. It's active,&rdquo; Cropsey told reporters at the annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Pentagon leaders have tasked each of the services with developing their own contribution for unified communications across platforms. The tech C3BM fields will feed the Air Force's portion, called the Advanced Battle Management System, or ABMS. 'These software-defined, hardware-enabled kinds of programs are never really done. You're in continuous integration, continuous development all the time. So the team is running at speed and scale on the software app side of this with regards to how we think about the homeland defense mission with [North American Aerospace Defense Command], [U.S. Northern Command],&rdquo; Cropsey said. The Air Force has also deployed 16 kits called tactical operations center-light, or TOC-L, with plans to expand their use in 2025. [[Related Posts]] 'The teams are operationally beating the snot out of them right now. And they're doing that intentionally so that we can understand better, from an operational use context, what works and what doesn't work,&rdquo; Cropsey said. 'And then we're going to fold that immediately into the next iteration on those kits.&rdquo; Cropsey announced plans last year to first introduce cloud-based command and control tools to air defense sectors before pushing them to larger command theaters. Now, the goal is to add those tools and a common user experience to the systems that air operations centers use to plan and execute major operations. 'The historical echelons that we've created between tactical, operational, and strategic are getting blurred more and more as the speed and the scale of conflict accelerates,&rdquo; Cropsey said. 'And so now, when we start talking about what that looks like as we're moving forward into the future, now we start talking about a common battle management interface capability, or CBI, that's taking that core [user interface and user experience] that's been built inside CBC2, and now starts to extend it into that operational layer.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/air-force-wants-expand-cloud-based-comms-official-says/399732/	2024-09-22T18:12:26-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/22/Screenshot_2024_09_22_at_3.07.25PM/large.png

This ‘cloud in a box’ could save Air Force maintainers years of p...	Every time a KC-135 lands, it's greeted by a swarm of maintainers armed with three-ring binders and stacks of paper forms, sometimes tablets or laptops&mdash;all necessary to determine and document the plane's readiness to fly again. Converting that information into a readable format to update commanders can take 14 hours. To shrink that turnaround time, the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office is developing a prototyped 'cloud in a box&rdquo;&mdash;a portable data and compute center that can effectively hold the maintenance records of every aircraft the service has in a container the size of a window A/C unit. 'The goal is digitizing the flight line,&rdquo; Col. Nathan Stuckey, military department program executive officer at the Air Force Rapid Sustainment Office, told Defense One. 'Having that maintainer, having that digital assistance &hellip; to help them maintain and repair our aircraft.&rdquo; The product hits a trifecta: it's a digital, cloud-based dashboard that displays maintenance data from disparate systems, a ruggedized box with compute and storage, and it offers the ability to access everything from a mobile device. Users can also load the cloud-based platform onto the box, called Google Distributed Air-Gapped Appliance, which can operate even when disconnected from networks. By teaming up with Google, the Air Force designed 'a marketplace of data input and output&rdquo; from several systems with 'real time readiness reporting&rdquo; so the data never needs to be manually re-entered at a workstation, said Josh Marcuse, director of strategic initiatives at Google Public Sector. And the system doesn't have to be hooked up to the internet to function. 'We have to have systems that will still work when our networks are attacked,&rdquo; Stuckey said. 'If you're in the Pacific trying to fix an airplane and your location loses all internet connectivity, this system's still got to work.&rdquo; Maintainers will be able to do their work and then reconnect the box to the network to update headquarters with essential mission data, like parts that are needed, which is available in seconds instead of hours. Less important information, like a video to assist in a repair, are deprioritized, Stuckey said. 'Information that higher headquarters needs to plan the fight, know what aircraft are available. That kind of data can be prioritized, so the second you get that connection, it's immediately seen by higher level. If it is lower priority data, you know, that might take a little bit &hellip; to see, but we're doing it in such a way that the most important data is available immediately,&rdquo; Stuckey said. The other feature with potential to change how maintainers work is the ability to securely connect with personal devices, Stuckey said. 'During a demo, I was able to use my personal phone and log into the device and get that dashboard. And that's the way. The vision is that a maintainer will be able to use their mobile devices, tablets, phones, to be able to access what they need at their fingertips.&rdquo; Current demonstrations of the 'cloud in a box&rdquo; have been limited to a handful or users over a handful of days. But the goal is for the tech to be a trusty digital assistant for maintainers, starting with select units. The plan is to launch the prototype at Nellis Air Force Base, Nev. and Minot Air Force Base, S.D. and do initial concept work in the coming months. But Stuckey was hesitant to give a more specific timeline because the product is going through the Defense Department's cybersecurity certification process, called authority to operate. 'We're in a state where getting those approvals is very soon&hellip;we're starting to talk months instead of years on when we're ready to go live&rdquo; with the first and then expanded demonstrations, Stuckey said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/cloud-box-could-save-air-force-maintainers-years-paperwork/399722/	2024-09-20T15:36:52-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/20/Screenshot_2024_09_20_at_12.34.27PM/large.png
Protest puts US Army’s $990M loitering-munition contract on hold	The U.S. Army has stopped work on an up-to-$990 million contract to buy AeroVironment Switchblade loitering munitions after a second company lodged a protest, according to an AeroVironment filing published Monday. The U.S. Government Accountability Office is to issue a decision on the protest by Dec. 16. It is not publicly known who filed the protest. The Army awarded AeroVironment the five-year, sole-source contract on Aug. 27 to fill a need for 'organic, stand-off capability to dismounted infantry formations capable of destroying tanks, light armored vehicles, hardened targets, defilade and personnel targets.&rdquo; At the time, AeroVironment said it would begin filling the order for Switchblades within months. In a research note cited by MarketWatch, analysts at William Blair wrote that the original contract winner generally retains 95 percent of these types of protests. The award serves the Army's lethal unmanned systems, or LUS, requirement, according to AeroVironment. More specifically, it is part of the Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance, or LASSO, program, which seeks to supply infantry brigade combat teams with loitering munitions to take out tanks, an Army spokesperson told Janes. Switchblades are used by, among others, newly created units in the 101st Airborne's second brigade such as the LUS platoon and the Multi-Functional Reconnaissance Company. The United States has also sent AeroVironment's Switchblade 300 and 600 systems to Ukraine. The larger Switchblade 600 is designed to take out hardened targets, like tanks. In May, the Defense Department announced that it would 'accelerate fielding&rdquo; of the Switchblade 600 to U.S. troops under the Replicator program. The program is an effort to field multiple thousands of affordable autonomous systems such as drones by August 2025. 'U.S.-supplied Switchblade drones have already demonstrated their utility in Ukraine, and this system will provide additional capability to U.S. forces,&rdquo; the Defense Department said.	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/protest-puts-us-armys-990m-loitering-munition-contract-hold/399708/	2024-09-20T10:37:15-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/20/Marine_Corps_Lance_C_2500/large.jpg

After suffering two major device attacks this week, Hezbollah terrorists attacked northern Israel with 140 rockets on Friday&mdash;while Israeli jets targeted a Hezbollah leader again in Beirut, AP and Reuters report from the city formerly known as the Paris of the Middle East. '​​120 missiles were launched at areas of the Golan Heights, Safed and the Upper Galilee,&rdquo; while '20 missiles were shot at the areas of Meron and Netua,&rdquo; according to the Israeli military, which didn't say whether the attack caused any casualties. As for the Beirut strike, at least three people were killed and 17 others wounded in the city's southern suburbs, AP reports. Among those reportedly killed: Ibrahim Aqil, who 'commanded Hezbollah's operations in Syria for years and built a tight-knit operational relationship with Russia's Spetsnaz,&rdquo; said Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute. He was allegedly 'killed alongside members of Hezbollah's elite Radwan unit as they were holding a meeting,&rdquo; according to a Reuters spot report. Update: Israeli intelligence officials made the pagers that detonated across Lebanon and Syria, killing more than a dozen people and wounding more than 2,700 others on Tuesday, the New York Times reported late Wednesday, citing '12 current and former defense and intelligence officials.&rdquo; Related reading: 'Hezbollah handed out pagers hours before blasts - even after checks,&rdquo; Reuters reported separately.

Air Force braces for new nuclear-war scenarios	The Air Force is planning a tabletop exercise to gauge U.S. readiness to react to a wide spectrum of nuclear-related scenarios, part of a larger effort to prepare for them, a service leader said on Wednesday. 'What if, God forbid, there was a low-yield [nuclear weapon] use in Europe tomorrow?&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Andrew J. Gebara, deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration, said at the Air & Space Forces Association conference outside Washington, D.C. 'Or what if there was a demonstration of nuclear use, or a nuclear test? What if we had to adapt the INDOPACOM regional fight because a nuclear power had a red line [that meant] we couldn't fly in certain areas? 'These are the kind of things that our warfighters need to understand from the beginning. It doesn't need to be just at the presidential level with no other discussion,&rdquo; Gebara said. That represents a big change in the way the military has historically talked about the possibility of nuclear war. It used to be that intelligence or analysis about the effects of such weapons on a given conflict was held at the highest possible, 'strategic&rdquo; level. That was a reflection of the times, when two great powers were engaged in a largely conventional arms race with knowable 'rules&rdquo; or at least principles of play. That doesn't represent the modern role of nuclear weapons in conflict, which may include far more players and means of delivery of nuclear effects. 'When I was younger, at the end of the Cold War, the biggest threat we had was no-notice-1,000 ICBMs just coming over the North Pole, and how would you handle that?&rdquo; Gebara said. 'That's horrific to even think about. But it's actually a pretty simple tactical problem. There's only a couple things you can do with something that bad.&rdquo; Today, ICBMs look quaint compared to new types of missiles and weapons that can deliver nuclear effects, including some that don't even appear to be weapons at first.

Gerbera said weapons instructors at Nevada's Nellis Air Force Base are already teaching these kinds of lessons to more pilots. 'So what does it mean if you're flying through this area and there's a radiological threat? What's it mean for the airplane?&rdquo; he said. Now, Gebara said, he's working to broaden training for such scenarios across the Air Force.

Air Force braces for new nuclear-war scenarios	The Air Force is planning a tabletop exercise to gauge U.S. readiness to react to a wide spectrum of nuclear-related scenarios, part of a larger effort to prepare for them, a service leader said on Wednesday.. 'What if, God forbid, there was a low-yield [nuclear weapon] use in Europe tomorrow?&rdquo; Lt. Gen. Andrew J. Gebara, deputy chief of staff for strategic deterrence and nuclear integration, said at the Air & Space Forces Association conference outside Washington, D.C. 'Or what if there was a demonstration of nuclear use, or a nuclear test? What if we had to adapt the INDOPACOM regional fight because a nuclear power had a red line [that meant] we couldn't fly in certain areas? 'These are the kind of things that our warfighters need to understand from the beginning. It doesn't need to be just at the presidential level with no other discussion,&rdquo; Gebara said. That represents a big change in the way the military has historically talked about the possibility of nuclear war. It used to be that intelligence or analysis about the effects of such weapons on a given conflict was held at the highest possible, 'strategic&rdquo; level. That was a reflection of the times, when two great powers were engaged in a largely conventional arms race with knowable 'rules&rdquo; or at least principles of play. That doesn't represent the modern role of nuclear weapons in conflict, which may include far more players and means of delivery of nuclear effects. 'When I was younger, at the end of the Cold War, the biggest threat we had was no-notice-1,000 ICBMs just coming over the North Pole, and how would you handle that?&rdquo; Gebara said. 'That's horrific to even think about. But it's actually a pretty simple tactical problem.

Army embraces Ukraine-style warfare with new all-drone unit	FORT JOHNSON, Louisiana&mdash;Staff Sgt. David Meyer peered intently into the screen of his hand-held drone controller, sweat slowly beading through his face paint in the 100-degree heat. Somewhere below his quadcopter, an allied unit was under attack by Geronimo, the highly skilled force that plays the enemy in weeks-long wargames at the U.S. Army's Joint Readiness Training Center here. Meyer suspected the Geronimo troops of trying to trick his side into burning through its ammo. Then they'd melt back into the forest to strike again elsewhere. It's the sort of game that comes naturally to Geronimo, whose home-team status gives them an unmatched knowledge of the training area's 250,000 acres of pine forest. This time, they may have underestimated their opponent. Meyer was part of the new Lethal Unmanned Systems platoon, one of the Army's first formations dedicated entirely to operating short-range reconnaissance drones. If Meyer's drones could find Geronimo, they could bring the fire of an attached platoon of 81mm mortars and turn Geronimo's raid into a disaster. All Meyer had to do was find them. The LUS platoon In mid-August, Defense One spent an afternoon with LUS soldiers as they fought Geronimo. Soldiers explained how the unit is structured, what was working&mdash;and what could be improved. The soldiers are members of the 101st Airborne's second brigade, which had traveled to JRTC to test the Army's 'transforming-in-contact&rdquo; initiative. Under the effort, the Army is fielding new equipment to the 101st Airborne's second brigade, the 10th Mountain Division's third brigade, and the 25th Infantry Division's second Brigade. Soldiers are responsible for giving feedback and working out on new doctrine in conditions as close as possible to actual war. The LUS platoon sits within the Multi-Purpose Company, or MPC, itself a new formation launched this April. The MPC's four platoons&mdash;scout, mortar, anti-tank, and LUS&mdash;replace the old heavy weapons companies, which were downgraded to platoons in February. Nine of the LUS platoon's 21 soldiers fly drones, including Meyer and platoon leader 1st. Lt. Jahmir King. The rest are air defenders who use a mix of anti-aircraft weapons like Stinger missiles and counter-drone weapons, including the Bal Chatri drone detector, Dronebuster jamming rifle, and Modi electronic warfare system. Just as in Ukraine, their drones are meant primarily to help spot enemy forces, and, if possible, coordinate indirect fire. But unlike the Ukrainians, the LUS drone operators cannot directly stream their video to other soldiers. Instead, they must rely on an attached fire control officer to radio to the mortar section where they are seeing the rounds land. Similarly, LUS soldiers must upload data to battle-management systems to share it with commanders, in contrast to the banks of live drone video feeds that Ukrainian commanders use to survey the battlefield. But the operators do have some ability to strike enemies themselves. Some of the drones can be rigged to drop munitions, and soldiers are trained to fly Switchblade loitering munitions systems. The unit was not practicing with the Switchblades at JRTC. The unit can also use their drones for route reconnaissance, said MPC commander Captain Phil Tateyama. If the unit wants to quickly clear an area, a drone operator will fly a drone just ahead of the moving vehicle. The platoon also carries a drone-borne electronic detection unit built on an ultracheap Raspberry Pi computer that can sniff for WiFi connections. To operate it, they'd temporarily brought along an Army cyber soldier. The counter-drone unit, meanwhile, serves as a mobile defense force that can be split out as needed, with some members defending the command post and others assigned to the mortars, according to Tateyama and King. Drones, lots of drones The unit's seven drone operators carry about five extra drones, but King said many more might be required in an actual war. In realistic training operations, such as the one they were on, he expected to have at least one drone down due to mechanical or other failures every other day. Combat operations would likely increase that rate, he said. 'We're going to start losing them, and then we're out of a job,&rdquo; said King. The unit operates Parrot, Skydio, and Vesper drones, all small short-range systems with a flight time of under an hour. King said such systems could fly only one to three kilometers out before losing signal in the dense vegetation of Fort Johnson. That meant the team had to be relatively close to the front line, placing them in easy range of Geronimo's artillery and even their infantry. Eventually, King and Tateyama said, they hope to equip the unit with medium-range drones like the C100. Smaller drones would then be assigned to the reconnaissance unit. Tateyama said those drones should most likely be operated by an experienced LUS member detailed to the recon unit. King said they could move up to operating first-person-view drones &mdash; hobbyist racing drones that Ukraine uses for pinpoint strikes&mdash;although he added that the weeks of training necessary made it harder to employ such drones. King said Skydio and Parrot drones performed well, with soldiers favoring the latter for its ability to identify the specific map coordinates of whatever object it looked at, which was useful for artillery coordination. A mechanical problem, however, meant that soldiers had not brought along the Parrot. Drone soldiers In contrast to previous Army drone operations, all of the LUS soldiers are infantrymen, rather than specialist operators. 'If you can drive semi-decent in [Grand Theft Auto],&rdquo; then you can fly, said one soldier. To hone their skills, the unit practices drone operations on a special course back at Fort Campbell, their home base. Soldiers also receive some training to recognize enemy vehicles, said King. Some features on the drone also help, such the Parrot's ability to pinpoint the hottest parts of whatever it's looking at. Using this feature, soldiers can easily identify exhaust pipes, thereby discovering vehicles. Besides flying and processing drone footage, soldiers are also expected to keep the drones charged. Battery management in particular is a major concern in planning, said King. 'That's what it's about: how long can we stay on the objective.&rdquo; One soldier said he kept extra batteries in the pouch typically used for dumping spent rifle magazines. On top of all that, soldiers must also pull security. Ideally, King said he'd like to see three to four soldiers assigned to flying, data management, and security, for a maximum of 12 soldiers versus the seven they have now. Hunting Geronimo Back at the screen, Mayer soon ran into difficulty. In the sweltering heat of the Lousianna pine forest, the drone's already limited batteries were eking out just 20 minutes of flight time&mdash;including only a few minutes over the objective. To maximize coverage, the unit kept a fresh drone ready to go when one returned. But flight-safety rules forbid operating two drones at once. As drone after drone buzzed into the sky, hope started to fade. For a brief moment, Meyer's screen showed a Geronimo truck driving along the road&mdash;but then lost it. Somewhere out there, Geronimo was still lurking, hidden beneath trees or simply beyond the range of the LUS platoon's drone. They'd gotten away, if only for the moment.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/army-embraces-ukraine-style-warfare-new-all-drone-unit/399679/	2024-09-19T12:55:29-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/19/Staff_Sgt._David_Mey_2500/large.jpg
The D Brief: More device detonations; House rejects CR plan; Firs...	Walkie-talkies exploded across Lebanon Wednesday, killing another 25 people and wounding at least 600 others just one day after pagers exploded across the region, killing a dozen and wounding more than 2,000 people, the Associated Press reports. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah spoke publicly Thursday for the first time since the attacks were launched, telling supporters and Israeli officials listening, 'This is sheer terrorism. We'll call them Tuesday's massacre and Wednesday's massacre. These are war crimes or at least declaration of war,&rdquo; said the leader of the U.S.-designated terrorist group. About the Tuesday attack, Nasrallah claimed Thursday, 'A number of pagers were out of service or switched off. Some were not allocated and still in storage.&rdquo; Update: 37 of Hezbollah's fighters have been killed in the past 48 hours, including three from Israeli airstrikes, Charles Lister of the Middle East Institute reports. IDF reax: 'For decades, Hezbollah has weaponized civilian homes, dug tunnels beneath them, and used civilians as human shields &mdash; having turned southern Lebanon into a war zone,&rdquo; the Israeli military said in a statement Thursday. ICYMI: 'I believe that we are at the onset of a new phase in this war, and we need to adapt,&rdquo; Israeli military chief Yoav Gallant said in a statement Wednesday. By the way: Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin spoke with Gallant Wednesday to 'review regional security developments,&rdquo; to 'reiterate unwavering U.S. support for Israel,&rdquo; and to reaffirm 'the priority of achieving a Gaza ceasefire deal&rdquo; and an 'enduring diplomatic resolution to the conflict on the Israel-Lebanon border,&rdquo; according to a Pentagon readout. Expert reax: The exploding device operations are 'likely to damage Hezbollah's morale, and many fighters and collaborators will have been put out of action for some time due to their injuries,&rdquo; said Luca Trenta, associate professor in International Relations at Swansea University in Wales, writing Wednesday for the Royal United Services Institute. 'Israel has increasingly shown a tendency to escalate the fighting, bringing the region to the precipice of a wider war,&rdquo; he added. Former NSA Director Nakasone: The pager and walkie-talkie attack perpetrators 'had incredible ability to do targeting intelligence and to be able to actually know the numbers, know who's got them, know the periodicity upon which they're using them,&rdquo; said Paul Nakasone, former director of the National Security Agency and commander of U.S. Cyber Command, said Wednesday at a news conference in Nashville.

Making moves: Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper has joined the team of consultants at Squire Patton Boggs international law firm. He'll serve as a senior advisor with a portfolio spanning national security, domestic and foreign policy issues, the firm announced Thursday. Rewind: Esper was former President Trump's longest-serving Pentagon chief at 16 months on the job until he was fired in November 2020&mdash;five months after U.S. marshals and prison security forces were sent to Washington in a heavy-handed response to peaceful protests related to the police killing of George Floyd. In early June, Esper was filmed walking with Trump and then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Army Gen. Mark Milley across Washington's Lafayette Square for a photo op after authorities used tear gas and rubber bullets to remove peaceful protesters. Two days later, Esper publicly broke with Trump and told reporters the Insurrection Act did not need to be invoked yet and active duty troops should not be used to suppress protests, as Trump had suggested. Esper's reaction rattled Trump, but the president waited until the week after Election Day 2020 to fire Esper&mdash;during a period in which Trump had begun isolating among his most loyal followers after it became clear had lost the election to Joe Biden. Esper had also served as Trump's Army secretary beginning November 2017 and running through his appointment as SecDef nearly 18 months later. Prior to that, Esper was employed as an executive at Raytheon, capping 21 years in the Army as an active duty officer, as well as more than a decade as a member of the National Guard and Reserve. 'We are living through an era of great change that has stoked national security ramifications that are rippling through board rooms around the world,&rdquo; Esper said in a statement, according to his new employer. 'Squire Patton Boggs has a clear vision to lead in this space and I am excited to add to the unique offering that the firm is building,&rdquo; he added. Read more, here. And former Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy just joined the Florida-based private equity firm AE Industrial where he'll serve as an operating partner, the company announced Tuesday. McCarthy took over for Esper when Trump nominated the latter to lead the Pentagon in 2019. He stayed on in that role until the Biden administration took over in January 2021. Before that, he'd served for more than two years as Army undersecretary after hopping over from a role at Lockheed Martin. Like Esper, he, too, was an Army veteran, with five years of service on active duty ending 2002. But unlike Esper, McCarthy was an Army Ranger with the 75th Regiment's 3rd Battalion. 'Global events continue to illustrate that there is sustained need for innovative technologies to combat complex and evolving threats,&rdquo; McCarthy said in a statement, according to his new employer. 'I look forward to partnering with AEI's portfolio companies operating within the national security space to capitalize on new opportunities and create value,&rdquo; he said. And lastly today: The manhunt is reportedly over in Kentucky following an apparently random highway shooting less than two weeks ago that injured at least five people who were driving along I-75. Authorities said they located a body 'in the deep brush&rdquo; near the scene of the shootings Wednesday afternoon. 'The people of Laurel County can rest easy &mdash; much easier &mdash; knowing that this manhunt has now come to a conclusion,&rdquo; Kentucky State Police commissioner, Phillip Burnett Jr., said in a news conference later that evening. One tip off: 'vultures in the air,&rdquo; according to the police. Upon further investigation, they 'detected a heavy odor consistent with a decomposing body.&rdquo; What's more, 'Personal artifacts and a weapon found with the body are consistent with the suspect,&rdquo; police said.

Device detonations reveal ‘incredible’ intelligence abilities: ex...	NASHVILLE, Tennessee&mdash;The detonation of several thousand Hezbollah devices displayed a stunning capability for intelligence-gathering, likely Israel's &mdash; and underscored potential vulnerabilities in global supply chains, a former NSA chief said Wednesday. The perpetrators 'had incredible ability to do targeting intelligence and to be able to actually know the numbers, know who's got them, [and] know the periodicity upon which they're using them,&rdquo; said Paul Nakasone, the former director of the National Security Agency and four-star commander of U.S. Cyber Command. Thousands of pagers remotely detonated in Lebanon at 3:30 p.m. local time on Tuesday, killing at least 12 people, including two children, and injuring roughly 2,800 others. On Wednesday, a second wave of explosions&mdash;this time, of walkie-talkies&mdash;killed at least 20 people and injured some 450. The covert attack on the Iran-backed militant group demonstrated a thorough understanding of their operatives, and that the targets were known 'pretty intimately,&rdquo; said Nakasone, who added that he had no advance knowledge of the operation. In recent months, Hezbollah has adopted a more basic tech strategy to try to evade Israeli intelligence, which has infiltrated the group's landlines and mobile phones. But the move seemingly backfired after someone&mdash;widely believed to be Israeli intelligence operatives&mdash;appeared to have orchestrated a series of covert supply-chain compromises that turned the devices into deadly weapons. A major concern now is how those types of hijacks could end up inside U.S. consumer products or devices, Nakasone said. 'One is, if this was a supply-chain [attack], I think about our own supply chains and what we need to be able to do to ensure their integrity,&rdquo; he said. 'The second piece is, if it wasn't a supply-chain attack, how was this conducted?&rdquo; In recent weeks, and following Israeli airstrikes against his commanders, Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has advised his militant operatives to take a low-tech approach while fighting Israel. In February, he ordered a cellphone blackout in an effort to thwart Israel's intelligence gathering. Israel has a long history of rigging and exploding communications devices on their targets. In 1996, Israel's Shin Bet tricked notorious Hamas bombmaker Yahya Ayyash into using a cell phone rigged with explosives, killing him instantly. Nakasone, who retired from his post in February, was speaking to reporters at a news conference leading up to the launch of Vanderbilt University's National Security Institute, where he is slated to head the program meant to steer younger talent into national security roles.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/device-detonations-reveal-incredible-intelligence-abilities-ex-nsa-chief/399660/	2024-09-19T05:56:32-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/19/091924_getty_ng_nakasone-1/large.jpg
AFSOC still wants 75 light attack aircraft despite Congress’ doub...	The Air Force's special operators trimmed the number of light attack planes they're asking for after Congress looked askance. But they still need them, the commander of Air Force Special Operations Command said Wednesday. 'Our requirement still remains 75&rdquo; OA-1K aircraft to fight extremist groups or other low-tech adversaries, AFSOC commander Lt. Gen. Michael E. Conley told reporters at the AIr-Space-Cyber conference outside Washington. 'It is possible that we don't buy those 75 in the same timeframe that we wanted to, but that's still our requirement.&rdquo; In 2020, AFSOC launched its quest for a small propeller-driven attack plane for close air support and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions. Dubbed Armed Overwatch, the program aimed to buy 75 planes by 2029 for just $2 billion (a ceiling of $3 billion,) a fraction of the cost of larger aircraft. AFSOC eventually chose the OA-1K, a crop-duster made by Air Tractor and given sensors and a gun by L3Harris. But the program has since drawn fire from lawmakers who wonder about the planes' utility. 'Congress has expressed concerns about the Armed Overwatch program. It has delayed the reprogramming of funds for the aircraft and required the Department of Defense to provide information about its plans,&rdquo; GAO said in a report this month. In March, AFSOC cut the number it was acquiring from 75 to 62. But AFSOC still hasn't justified why it needs 75 light attack aircraft, planes that would be relatively useless in a fight with an adversary like China, with advanced air defenses and fighter jets. Said GAO: 'We found that SOCOM was limited in its ability to justify the acquisition of the Armed Overwatch aircraft for three reasons. First, because SOCOM decided on the size of the fleet before conducting required analyses. Second, SOCOM did not assess how changes in the aircraft's capabilities could affect the number needed for operations. And third, that SOCOM has not reevaluated its needs despite changes to operational missions.&rdquo; On Wednesday, Conley said, 'I think from when OA-1k was conceptualized and decided on until now, the world's changed a little bit&hellip;I think it still provides a cost effective close air support platform, which is one of the missions that it was designed for.&rdquo; AFSOC is still digesting the GAO report but 'Our requirement still remains 75,&rdquo; based on a Capability Development Document AFSOC has created, he said. Conley said that while the Defense Department remains highly focused on buying weapons to deter China, the world is more chaotic today than many experts thought it would be a few years ago. He said continued turmoil and ongoing operations in the Middle East show that low-tech extremist groups continue to be a threat, despite the Pentagon's hopes of moving focus to the Pacific. 'I tell my team every day, the Pacific is incredibly important to us for all the reasons&hellip;China, China, China. We get it. But we've also got the rest of the world,&rdquo; he said. 'I don't think we're done in CENTCOM. As a nation, I don't think we're done in CENTCOM.&rdquo;. Conley cautioned against drawing conclusions about the utility of low-tech attack aircraft based on present-day capabilities. Such assumptions overlook the sort of rapid adaptation that might make such aircraft more useful against a wider variety of missions. 'You know, we're a command that took an AC-130 or a C-47 and put guns on the side, or the command that put jets on a C-130 to try to get it out of the stadium in Iran. That's our DNA. And I think once we get the aircraft and we start flying our crew members and our maintainers will figure out novel ways that will be relevant in the future fight as well as the current one.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/technology/2024/09/afsoc-still-wants-75-light-attack-aircraft-despite-congress-doubts/399650/	2024-09-18T17:47:21-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_8.38.48PM/large.png
Army wants to buy as many drones as it does munitions	The Army wants to buy drones in the 'kind of quantities&rdquo; it buys munitions, Army acquisition chief Doug Bush said Wednesday during an webcast with Defense News. 'We need them potentially at very large scale and very quickly,&rdquo; said Bush. 'They're somewhere between a munition and the way we think about a large platform,&rdquo; he added. The Army has plans to eventually field drones of different types at the platoon, company, and brigade levels. So far, the Army has only fielded drones at the platoon level under the Short Range Reconnaissance program. Fielding of the drone, currently the Skydio RQ-28A, is still in its early stages. The Army requested 207 of these drones in 2023, and 459 in 2024, according to budget documents. In September, the Army selected Anduril and Performance Drone Works to provide drones to company-level units. These drones are larger than the RQ-28A and have a longer loitering time, among other features. Starting in fiscal year 2026, The Army will evaluate prototype drones for the brigade level program. [[Related Posts]] The Army may also field first-person-view drones, typically used as a loitering munition, and tethered drones. Bush did not specify what types of munitions he was referring to. Excluding rounds for small arms, the Army buys munitions like missiles and artillery shells in the range of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Army leaders have put drones at the center of a new fielding effort dubbed 'transforming in contact,&rdquo; and have asked for more money for them in this year's unfunded priorities lists. Multiple units across the Army are also experimenting with drone uses and training. However, an Defense One analysis indicates that U.S. industry is not ready to produce the hundreds of thousands of drones that may be needed in a major war, 'Until the U.S. military mainstreams operational concepts that demand large numbers of drones, production will remain at a relatively low level,&rdquo; Hudson Institute senior fellow Bryan Clark previously told Defense One. Smaller drones like those the Army gives platoons and companies, are relatively simple to manufacture, Bush said. 'A lot of it is people hand-building things.&rdquo; Bush also highlighted the Army's focus on software-based updates and modular open-system architecture&mdash;the ability to easily add and subtract components like a new radar or sensor. 'Those are the two major pushes from both large platforms like [Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft] and XM-30 [Infantry Combat Vehicle] all the way down to small [drones],&rdquo; Bush said. Both approaches allow the Army to upgrade equipment quickly, helping the service to field improved systems 'at the speed needed in combat,&rdquo; he said. Bush also said artificial intelligence is decreasing the load on the Army's contracting force. There are AI pilot programs that assist contracting personnel in 'everything from our research to writing initial [request for proposals] to doing draft contracts to doing evaluations of contracts,&rdquo; Bush said. 'I'm assuming we're probably not going to get a lot more [contracting professionals].&rdquo; he said. 'We've got to use technology to help them do their jobs.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/business/2024/09/army-wants-buy-many-drones-it-does-munitions/399646/	2024-09-18T14:18:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_11.17.25AM/large.png
Budget drama could snag Pentagon’s satellite launch award	The Pentagon's new satellite launch competition between SpaceX, United Launch Alliance, and Blue Origin could be delayed if Congress passes a long continuing resolution instead of a full budget for 2025, a space acquisitions official said Wednesday. Congress is scrambling to avert a government shutdown by Sept. 30 as House Republicans are poised to reject a proposed six-month continuing resolution funding bill for fiscal year 2025. Continuing resolutions, or CRs, are stopgap funding solutions that fund the government and programs at the same level as the previous year, to keep money flowing in the absence of full-year appropriations. Source selection for 'Lane 2&rdquo; of the National Security Space Launch Phase 3 program is continuing despite budget concerns, with the intent to award later this year. But work may be delayed if there's no permanent funding for 2025. 'The source selection is still underway. It's been underway for a while, it's a big important contract so we're definitely going to do a lot of due diligence on that. Anticipate the source selection being complete, being ready to award towards the end of this calendar year. But we need a budget,&rdquo; said Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, commander of Space Launch Delta 45 and program executive officer for Space Systems Command's assured access to space office. 'I can't do the mission assignments and actually put the specific launch on contract if I don't have that money. So while I would like to be able to do that at the beginning of the year, have a full budget, do it at the beginning of the fiscal year, give the companies the maximum amount of time to make sure integration and everything is ready to go, I have to wait until I have the funding to actually be able to put specific missions on contract,&rdquo; she told reporters Wednesday at the annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. [[Related Posts]] A continuing resolution could mean a monthslong waiting period and then 'sprinting to try to get everything done, which is not the most efficient cadence that we could be operating at,&rdquo; said Panzenhagen, who later added the command hasn't determined how it will handle award announcements if Congress agrees to a long CR. The Space Force has already signaled it wants to do more launches this year. Space Systems Command buys launches about two years in advance to give companies time to work on satellite integration. For 'Lane 2,&rdquo; there will be one large contract award for the annual mission assignments. Up to three companies can be awarded, with the third best provider getting seven missions and the top two splitting the rest 60-40, Panzenhagen said, without specifying how many total missions there would be. Companies must go through a certification process before they're eligible to bid on the contract. Some rocket providers are still going through that process, which has several components, including different reference orbits and launch bases. But the bottom line is: 'We also need an FY25 budget to award that contract,&rdquo; Panzenhagen said.	https://www.defenseone.com/defense-systems/2024/09/budget-drama-could-snag-pentagons-satellite-launch-award/399645/	2024-09-18T14:09:49-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_11.08.06AM/large.png
Test B-21 flying up to twice a week, Northrop reports	Flight testing of the Air Force's B-21 Raider stealth bomber is moving along swimmingly, officials report, giving a rare, and small, update on the highly classified program. 'We're really starting to strike up quite a cadence. We're actually able to generate two test flights, sometimes, within a week, which, if you think about how far ahead we are, that's great,&rdquo; said Tom Jones, president of Northrop's Aeronautics Systems. 'I think we're well on the way to delivering a kind of asset that can be that daily flyer for U.S. warfighters out there.&rdquo; The company has three aircraft 'in various configurations&rdquo; in flight test right now, Jones said Wednesday at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Two of them are being used for ground testing and one for flight testing. 'I don't want to jinx myself, but we've had more issues with test fixtures and training of our test personnel than we actually have with the test article, which, again, is a pretty good place to be at this point,&rdquo; Jones said. The program also completed a static test on a ground-based test article used to prove out the structure of the aircraft, according to William Bailey, director of the Air Force's Rapid Capabilities Office. Meanwhile, Northrop has already started building production aircraft. The company received the greenlight for low-rate initial production after the B-21 took its first flight in November. The Air Force plans to buy at least 100 B-21s to replace its B-1 and B-2 bombers. Once the Raider enters service, it will first go to Ellsworth Air Force Base. The service recently announced the second and third operating bases for B-21s: Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri and Dyess Air Force Base in Texas. Demand for the service's bomber task forces is only going to increase as B-21 comes online in the years ahead, Air Force Global Strike Commander Gen. Thomas Bussiere said Wednesday. 'As we transition from the B-1 and the B-2 to the B-21, and we transition from the B-52H to the B-52J model, there's a realization that we're probably not going to see a decreased demand signal from our regional combatant commands on bomber task forces,&rdquo; Bussiere said. 'As we transition from the legacy to new, the B-21 will provide great comfort to our allies and should provide great pause for a potential adversary.&rdquo; The service released a new image and video of the B-21 flying and landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/test-b-21s-flying-twice-week-northrop-reports/399641/	2024-09-18T13:37:53-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/8648580/large.jpg
Air Force’s Ospreys will return to forward-deployment within 'wee...	The Air Force is weeks away from sending its V-22 Ospreys back to combatant commands after the Pentagon lifted a months-long grounding on the tiltrotor fleet earlier this year. 'We will deploy out here in the coming weeks, back to support other geographic combatant commanders. We'll go back to the missions that only the CV-22 can do, or what the combatant commanders need us to do,&rdquo; Air Force Special Operations Command head Lt. Gen. Michael Conley told reporters Wednesday at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber conference. Conley didn't specify where they would send the V-22s, but said it will be to 'support the wars we're engaged in,&rdquo; and noted it won't be INDOPACOM or EUCOM, since those commands already have V-22 wings assigned there. The Pentagon grounded its entire fleet of Ospreys in late 2023 after a deadly crash off the coast of Japan killed eight airmen in November. The aircraft were cleared to fly again in March with some limitations: flights and missions have to stay within 30 minutes of a 'suitable divert airfield.&rdquo; [[Related Posts]] But Conley said the divert rule is just a 'planning factor,&rdquo; and won't affect AFSOC's ability to complete its mission for combatant commands. 'I won't even call it a limitation,&rdquo; Conley said. As of today, 60 percent of the fleet is fully operational, and by late 2024 or early next year, all 51 of the service's CV-22s will be ready for duty, Conley said. Last month, the Air Force released its investigation into the November crash, and found it was caused by the 'catastrophic failure&rdquo; of a prop-rotor gearbox and the pilot's decision to keep flying despite warnings. The service still doesn't know exactly why the part failed, but Conley maintained it was a 'rare&rdquo; occurrence. Conley doesn't believe the failure was caused by poor material from Bell Textron and Boeing, who build the Pentagon's V-22s. The companies have been 'good partners&rdquo; throughout the investigation, he added. But the families of Marines killed in a 2022 Osprey crash disagree, and are suing the companies, alleging they knew the aircraft was unsafe and failed to disclose that to the Pentagon. Aviation Week reported last week that the Air Force is considering overhauling the V-22's airworthiness certification. Asked about the possibility of the service rescinding airworthiness, Conley said: 'I don't think we're there. I think discussions may continue, but I don't think anyone's close to a decision on whether we need to break from the current construct.&rdquo;	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/air-forces-ospreys-will-be-forward-deployed-within-weeks/399638/	2024-09-18T13:14:08-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/Screenshot_2024_09_18_at_10.10.03AM/large.png
The D Brief: Why pagers explode; Russian ammo dump blows up; CNO ...	Israeli intelligence operatives appear to have pulled off a legendary and deadly supply chain hack, installing tiny quantities of explosives into at least 3,000 pagers specially ordered by Iran-backed Hezbollah militants across Lebanon and Syria, U.S. officials told Reuters, the New York Times, and the Associated Press over the past 24 hours. What happened: Thousands of the AR-924 pagers exploded remotely Tuesday around 3:30 p.m. local, killing at least a dozen people, including two children, and wounding around 2,800 others, Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said Wednesday. 'Explosive material, as little as one to two ounces, was implanted next to the battery in each pager,&rdquo; and 'A switch was also embedded that could be triggered remotely to detonate the explosives,&rdquo; the Times reported Tuesday. The pagers were initially traced to a company in Taiwan, but officials there point to Hungary, where the devices were made under license by a separate company based in Budapest, AP reported Wednesday. That Hungarian firm, known as BAC Consulting KFT, 'appeared to be a shell company,&rdquo; according to AP. Expert reax: 'There are many failure points in supply chains,&rdquo; noted Decker Eveleth of Virginia-based CNA. 'I don't think we should jump to the conclusion that [BAC was] directly involved or simply a front&rdquo; for Israeli intelligence, he warned. 'This would easily be the biggest counterintelligence failure that Hezbollah has had in decades,&rdquo; one former U.S. official told Reuters. Dmitri Alperovitch of the Silverado Policy Accelerator think tank in Washington described it as 'Perhaps one of the most extensive physical supply chain attacks in history.&rdquo; Among those hurt: Iran's ambassador to Lebanon, who 'lost one eye and his other eye is severely injured,&rdquo; according to the Times. Q. Is such an attack a violation of international humanitarian law? Apparently, says Shashank Joshi of the Economist&mdash;but possibly not, according to the Brits' interpretation of the laws of armed conflict, he noted on social media with the assistance of others.

And if you're not already subscribed, you can do that here. On this day in 2014, President Barack Obama offered military gear but denied weapons to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who had come to Washington seeking help against what the world believed at the time to be Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine, though Vladimir Putin later admitted they were in fact Russian military forces without any insignia. A large Russian ammunition depot erupted in a remarkable series of explosions early Wednesday around 3:30 in the morning. Regional earthquake monitors even picked up the blast, which registered as a 'light magnitude&rdquo; 2.8 quake. Location: The Toropets Northeast Ammunition Depot, in the Tver region of Russia, which is about 300 miles from the frontlines of Russia's Ukraine invasion. Six Ukrainian kamikaze drones were allegedly used in the attack, which appears to have caused several intense burn zones that NASA sensors picked up in the agency's Fire Information for Resource Management System. In video: Here is some footage taken moments after impact showing the initial blast wave followed by a smaller series of secondary explosions and their waves rolling across the illuminated horizon. 'We're likely looking at the loss of thousands of tons of explosive materials, shells, and rockets,&rdquo; one former Ukrainian officer said, noting, 'In events of this magnitude, replacement can't be quick.&rdquo; Developing: Norwegian sensors have reportedly detected cesium near the border with Russia, which would seem to suggest Moscow just tested its new nuclear-powered, nuclear-armed cruise missile known as the 9M730 Burevestnik, aka 'SSC-X-9 Skyfall&rdquo; according to NATO. 'The levels are clearly higher than normal, but pose no risk to humans or the environment,&rdquo; a Norwegian official told the Barents Observer on Tuesday, which noted, 'Cesium-137 is formed as a fission product by operating a nuclear reactor.&rdquo; It's 'Likely Russia conducted their 13th test of the system,&rdquo; because that location 'correspond[s] to the activity we see in satellite imagery at the Burevestnik missile test site at Pankovo,&rdquo; said Decker Eveleth. Get up to speed: Reuters has much more on the particular test site, reporting with satellite imagery in early September, here. The Barents Observers also runs down a few alternate possibilities near the end of their report, here. CNO releases new Navigation Plan. Announcing her first addition to the long-running series of guidance papers by the Navy's top officers, Adm. Lisa Franchetti says her top priorities are 'readiness for conflict with the PRC by 2027 and enhancing long-term advantage.&rdquo; She aims to achieve these ends 'through two central ways: implementing seven 'Project 33&rdquo; targets and expanding the Navy's contribution to the Joint warfighting ecosystem.&rdquo; Project 33&mdash;apparently a nod to her status as the 33rd CNO&mdash;includes these bullet points: Ready the force by eliminating ship, submarine, and aircraft maintenance delays Scale robotic and autonomous systems to integrate more platforms at speed Create the command centers our fleets need to win on a distributed battlefield Recruit and retain the force we need to get more players on the field Deliver a quality of service commensurate with the sacrifices of our Sailors Train for combat as we plan to fight, in the real world and virtually Restore the critical infrastructure that sustains and projects the fight from shore. You can read the 27-page document here (free trial required). Reax: The new NAVPLAN drew kudos from Cmdr. Salamander, the venerable and oft-cranky navy blogger. He praises especially her focus on 'near-term readiness&rdquo; and a reduction in references to diversity compared to the 2022 version. Read that, here. Joint Chiefs Chairman Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., met with four NATO counterparts over the past few days. That included Czech Lt. Gen. Karel Řehka and Turkish Gen. Metin G&uuml;rak Saturday in Prague during the alliance's annual Military Committee Conference. Two days later, Brown spoke with Belgian Gen. Frederik Vansina and Danish Gen. Michael Wiggers Hyldgaard Monday in Copenhagen. CQ's CR warning to HASC's Rogers: Brown warned the top House Armed Services Republican against advancing another temporary funding bill known as a continuing resolution in a letter dated Friday. 'In the race against time, each CR is the equivalent of taking a knee on advancing our defense capabilities as security challenges increase their momentum to challenge our credible combat power,&rdquo; Brown wrote in his letter. CRs 'slow progress and damage our relationships with the defense industrial base, eroding trust driving up costs, and increasing delivery times, as industry hedges against funding inconsistencies,&rdquo; Brown said. 'Should Congress move forward with a six-month CR, we anticipate detrimental impacts to readiness and modernization across the Joint Force,&rdquo; the general warned. 'Pay and entitlements, nuclear enterprise modernization, shipbuilding and maintenance, aircraft procurement, weapons system sustainment. munitions production, and multiple new starts are just a few examples that will feel the brunt of the lost time and lost buying power caused by a CR.&rdquo; 'We are living in a consequential time. There is no time to waste,&rdquo; said Brown. And lastly: North Korea launched a series of short-range ballistic missiles into the sea off its east coast just before 7 a.m. local time Wednesday, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reports. The missiles flew for about 250 miles before splashing down into the water, Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff said afterward. Indo-PACOM: 'The United States condemns these actions and calls on the DPRK to refrain from further unlawful and destabilizing acts,&rdquo; U.S. military officials said in a statement. 'While we have assessed that this event does not pose an immediate threat to U.S. personnel, or territory, or to our allies, we continue to monitor the situation,&rdquo; they added. ICYMI: 'The North fired several short-range ballistic missiles last Thursday, the first such launch in more than two months, which it later described as a test of a new 600-mm multiple launch rocket system,&rdquo; Reuters reports. And the launches come just a few 'days after North Korea offered a rare view into a secretive facility built to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs as leader Kim Jong Un called for a rapid expansion of his nuclear weapons program,&rdquo; AP reports. By the way: 'North Korea's rapid advancement of its nuclear and missile capabilities, combined with its stated ambition to exponentially expand its nuclear arsenal, is the single greatest challenge&rdquo; facing U.S. and allied forces in the region, said Army Lt. Gen. Xavier Brunson, the nominee to lead U.S. Forces Korea, told lawmakers Tuesday on Capitol Hill. Yonhap has more from that extended exchange, here.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/the-d-brief-september-18-2024/399621/	2024-09-18T08:28:46-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/18/DB_lander/large.png
NATO considering Arctic combined air operations center to deal wi...	The recent addition of Sweden and Finland to the NATO alliance is opening up new opportunities for members to better work together in the Arctic, where Russian activity has been increasing. That could mean a new combined air operations center, or CAOC 'fairly shortly,&rdquo; U.S. Air Forces Europe and NATO Allied Air Command Gen. James Hecker said Tuesday at the Air & Space Forces Association's Air Space & Cyber conference. Hecker said he has U.S. European Command head Gen. Chris Cavoli's approval to further explore the idea. 'We've thrown out the idea. Gen. Cavoli in principle agrees with it. That doesn't mean it's a done deal,&rdquo; he told Defense One, noting that the proposal still has to make it through NATO leadership. The location of the potential CAOC is yet to be determined, he said. During a panel discussion with representatives from the Swedish and Norwegian air forces, Hecker told them: 'We're going to exploit that close relationship between the Arctic nations and the knowledge that you bring to make that happen. So we're going to use that, and we're going to exploit it, and I think we'll probably get a third CAOC up there fairly shortly.&rdquo; Russian incursions into NATO airspace happen frequently in the Arctic, said Maj. Gen. &Oslash;ivind Gunnerud, the chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force. 'On average, per year, we intercept Russians once or twice per week [and] their ships all the time.&rdquo; Additionally, he said, there is more to consider for air operations there than at lower latitudes. 'You will experience icing. Now, inland, dry, cold climate, it has its challenges. But what we see in Norway, we have a lot of the coastal climate, above and below the freezing level all the time. So you have slippery runways. And, of course, it's night [operation] during the winter time. So you better add your night flying skills up there, that's for sure.&rdquo; Said Hecker, the U.S. Air Force has been experimenting with MQ-9 Reaper and Global Hawk drones in the Arctic Circle to increase situational awareness, 'which we haven't done in the past,&rdquo; as well as high-altitude balloons and other drones. But, he noted, Arctic conditions offer special challenges to unmanned systems as well, as many are powered via solar panels on the wings. 'That will work out in the summer, probably not so great in the winter,&rdquo; he said. If the proposal becomes a reality, the Arctic CAOC would be NATO's third, joining one in Germany and another in Spain.	https://www.defenseone.com/threats/2024/09/nato-considering-arctic-combined-air-operations-center-deal-russian-threats/399614/	2024-09-17T18:31:37-07:00	https://cdn.defenseone.com/media/img/cd/2024/09/17/GettyImages_1132893105/large.jpg
