Without Lebanon ceasefire, war could expand further into Syria and Iraq	A ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the strongest of Iran's armed proxies, is expected to significantly calm regional tensions that have led to fears of war between Israel and Iran directly.

One diplomat said there are fears that if no ceasefire is reached, the war will expand further into Syria and Iraq as Israel attempts to cut off the supply of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. Israel has carried out regular airstrikes on Iran-linked groups in Syria and has threatened to strike in Iraq, where Iran-backed militias have periodically launched drone attacks on Israel.	https://naharnet.com/stories/en/309392-without-lebanon-ceasefire-war-could-expand-further-into-syria-and-iraq	2024-11-25T03:27:34-08:00
