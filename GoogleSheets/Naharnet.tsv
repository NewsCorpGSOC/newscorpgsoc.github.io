Sinwar's killing opens up opportunity and much uncertainty for the war in Gaza	Israel's killing of Yahya Sinwar, Hamas' top leader and the mastermind of the group's Oct. 7 attack, is a dramatic turning point in the brutal yearlong war that it touched off. Sinwar's killing on Thursday decapitates the Palestinian militant group that has already been reeling from months of assassinations up and down its ranks. And it is a potent symbolic achievement for Israel in its battle to destroy Hamas.	https://naharnet.com/stories/en/308712-sinwar-s-killing-opens-up-opportunity-and-much-uncertainty-for-the-war-in-gaza	2024-10-18T00:20:00-07:00	
Iran's UN mission commemorates Sinwar	Iran’s Mission to the United Nations has issued a statement honoring Yahya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas, after Israel said Thursday he had been killed in fighting: 'When U.S. forces dragged a disheveled Saddam Hussein out of an underground hole, he begged them not to kill him despite being armed. Those who regarded Saddam as their model of resistance eventually collapsed. However when Muslims look up to martyr Sinwar standing on the battlefield — in combat attire and out in the open, not in a hideout, facing the enemy — the spirit of resistance will be strengthened. He will become a model for the youth and children who will carry forth his path for the liberation of Palestine. As long as occupation and aggression exist, resistance will endure, for the martyr remains alive and a source of inspiration.'	https://naharnet.com/stories/en/308711-iran-s-un-mission-commemorates-sinwar	2024-10-18T00:14:30-07:00
