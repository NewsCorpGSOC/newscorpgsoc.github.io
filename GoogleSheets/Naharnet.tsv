Syria's de facto leader says it could take up to 4 years to hold elections	Syria's de facto leader said it could take up to four years to hold elections in Syria, and that he plans to dissolve his Islamist group that led the country's insurgency at an anticipated national dialogue summit for the country. Ahmad al-Sharaa, who leads Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the group leading the new authority in Syria, made the remarks in an interview with Saudi television network Al-Arabiya. It comes almost a month after a lightning insurgency led by HTS overthrew President Bashar Assad's decades-long rule, ending the country's uprising-turned civil war that started back in 2011.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/310074-syria-s-de-facto-leader-says-it-could-take-up-to-4-years-to-hold-elections	2024-12-30T00:58:03-08:00	
Israeli hospital says Netanyahu has undergone successful prostate surgery	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent successful surgery Sunday to have his prostate removed, hospital officials said, a procedure that came as he manages multiple crises including the war in Gaza and his trial for alleged corruption.

During his trial this month, he boasted about working 18-hour days, accompanied by a cigar. But as Israel's longest-serving leader, such a grueling workload over a total of 17 years in power could take a toll on his well-being.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/310073-israeli-hospital-says-netanyahu-has-undergone-successful-prostate-surgery	2024-12-30T00:55:15-08:00
