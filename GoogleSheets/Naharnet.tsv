A long road ahead to decide Syria's future after Assad's fall	For the first time in 50 years, the question of how Syria will be governed is wide open. The end of the Assad family's rule is for many Syrians a moment of mixed joy and fear, of the total unknown. The insurgency that swept President Bashar Assad out of power is rooted in Islamist jihadi fighters. Its leader says he has renounced past ties to al-Qaida, and he has gone out of his way to assert a vision of creating a pluralistic Syria governed by civil institutions — not dictators and not ideology.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/309702-a-long-road-ahead-to-decide-syria-s-future-after-assad-s-fall	2024-12-10T02:42:33-08:00

Here's how the US is countering the Islamic State group during Syria's upheaval	Massive U.S. airstrikes on Islamic State militants in Syria were meant in part as a message to the group and a move to ensure that it doesn't try to take advantage of the chaos following the overthrow of President Bashar Assad's government.
