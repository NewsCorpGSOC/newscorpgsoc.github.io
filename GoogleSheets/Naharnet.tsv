While Syrian refugees don't want to return, officials in Lebanon and Syria see exodus as opportunity	Hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees have returned to their country since Israel launched a massive aerial bombardment on wide swathes of Lebanon in September. Many who fled to Lebanon after the war in Syria started in 2011 did not want to go back. But for officials in Lebanon, the influx of returnees comes as a silver lining to the war between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 3,000 people and displaced some 1.2 million in Lebanon. Some in Syria hope the returning refugees could lead to more international assistance and relief from western sanctions.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/309152-while-syrian-refugees-don-t-want-to-return-officials-in-lebanon-and-syria-see-exodus-as-opportunity	2024-11-09T23:40:42-08:00
