Gaza has long been a powder keg: Here's a look at its history	Gaza has long been a powder keg, and it exploded after Hamas fighters stormed southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing and abducting people, which sparked a crushing Israeli military operation that's only recently stopped under a tenuous ceasefire. U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion Tuesday that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the war-torn territory and the U.S. take 'ownership' of the land is triggering new tensions over the future of the enclave.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/310873-gaza-has-long-been-a-powder-keg-here-s-a-look-at-its-history	2025-02-06T02:13:03-08:00	
Israeli defense minister tells army to set plans for Palestinians to leave Gaza	Israel said on Thursday it has begun preparations for the departure of large numbers of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip in line with President Donald Trump's plan for the territory.

The Palestinians and much of the international community have rejected Trump's proposal, fearing Israel will never allow the refugees to return and that it would destabilize the region. Egypt has warned that such a plan could undermine its peace treaty with Israel, a cornerstone of stability and American influence in the Middle East for decades.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/310869-israeli-defense-minister-tells-army-to-set-plans-for-palestinians-to-leave-gaza	2025-02-06T01:56:22-08:00	
Arab American community offers muted response to Trump's Gaza takeover plan	Residents of the largest Arab American community in the U.S. had plenty to say during the 2024 presidential campaign about the roiling politics in the Middle East. But after President Donald Trump's stunning announcement on Tuesday that he wanted to remove Palestinians from Gaza and impose a U.S. takeover in the region, some leaders in Dearborn, Michigan, were treading far more cautiously. 'People are taking a deep breath. It's too early to render a judgment.
