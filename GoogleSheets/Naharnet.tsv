Israel has carried out regular airstrikes on Iran-linked groups in Syria and has threatened to strike in Iraq, where Iran-backed militias have periodically launched drone attacks on Israel.	https://naharnet.com/stories/en/309392-without-lebanon-ceasefire-war-could-expand-further-into-syria-and-iraq	2024-11-25T03:27:34-08:00
