International Criminal Court issues arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant and Hamas officials	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants on Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas officials, accusing them of war crimes and crimes against humanity over the war in Gaza and the October 2023 attacks that triggered Israel's offensive in the Palestinian territory.

But its practical implications could be limited since Israel and its major ally, the United States, are not members of the court and several of the Hamas officials have been subsequently killed in the conflict.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/309346-international-criminal-court-issues-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-gallant-and-hamas-officials	2024-11-21T04:05:39-08:00
