Thousands of Jews leave Israel, say they don't feel safe anymore	Leaving Israel is easier, Shira Z. Carmel thinks, by saying it's just for now. But she knows better. For the Israeli-born singer and an increasing number of relatively well-off Israelis, the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack shattered any sense of safety and along with it, Israel's founding promise: to be the world's safe haven for Jews. That day, thousands of Hamas militants blew past the country's border defenses, reportedly killed 1,200 people and dragged 250 more into Gaza in a siege that caught the Israeli army by surprise and stunned a nation that prides itself on military prowess. This time, during what became known as Israel's 9/11, the army didn't come for hours.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/309947-thousands-of-jews-leave-israel-say-they-don-t-feel-safe-anymore	2024-12-20T02:23:02-08:00
