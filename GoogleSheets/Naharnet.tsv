Arab American community offers muted response to Trump's Gaza takeover plan	Residents of the largest Arab American community in the U.S. had plenty to say during the 2024 presidential campaign about the roiling politics in the Middle East. But after President Donald Trump's stunning announcement on Tuesday that he wanted to remove Palestinians from Gaza and impose a U.S. takeover in the region, some leaders in Dearborn, Michigan, were treading far more cautiously. 'People are taking a deep breath. It's too early to render a judgment.

I won't leave. Put that in your brain.' Palestinians reject Trump's Gaza plan	Saeed Abu Elaish's wife, two of his daughters and two dozen others from his extended family were killed by Israeli airstrikes over the past 15 months.

Rights groups said his comments were tantamount to a call for 'ethnic cleansing' and forcible expulsion.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/310867-i-won-t-leave-put-that-in-your-brain-palestinians-reject-trump-s-gaza-plan	2025-02-06T01:42:06-08:00
