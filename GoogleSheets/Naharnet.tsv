Knesset to vote on bills that would severely restrict UN aid distribution in Gaza	Israel’s parliament is scheduled to vote Monday on a pair of bills that would effectively sever ties with the U.N. agency responsible for distributing aid in Gaza, strip it of legal immunities and restrict its ability to support Palestinians in east Jerusalem and the West Bank. Israel accuses the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, or UNRWA, of turning a blind eye to Hamas militants it says have infiltrated its staff, including a small number of its 13,000 employees in Gaza who participated in the Oct. 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel. The agency denies it knowingly aids armed groups and says it acts quickly to purge any suspected militants from its ranks.	https://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/308917-knesset-to-vote-on-bills-that-would-severely-restrict-un-aid-distribution-in-gaza	2024-10-28T08:56:21-07:00
