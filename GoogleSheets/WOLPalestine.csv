WOLPalestine,In response to the ongoing massacres in Palestine and the outrageous murder of Sonya Massey in her own home on July 6th in Illinois, we are calling on New York City to flood Brooklyn for Black &amp; Palestinian liberation and resistance by any means necessary. This also coincides with Black August, established to honor the life and legacy of George Jackson, who was assassinated inside San Quentin prison August 21st 1971, and his brother Jonathan, who also died at the hands of the state while attempting to liberate the Soledad Brothers. In solidarity with the Black freedom struggle, the ongoing fight to free all of our political prisoners from the U.S. to Palestine, and in recognition of the interconnectedness of our liberation, we take to the streets on August 3rd. Join us.(2/2),Sun Jul 28 2024 10:25:42 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),https://t.me/wolpalestine/502
WOLPalestine,? Flood Brooklyn For Black &amp; Palestinian Liberation! Justice For Sonya Massey!?? Saturday August 3rd ?? International Day of Solidarity With Gaza &amp; Palestinian Prisoners?? 5:00 pm? Barclays Center (Brooklyn, NY)? Twitter/X @wolpalestine? Telegram t.me/wolprotestU.S. imperialism is slaughtering and oppressing our people all over the world from Haiti, to Puerto Rico, to Palestine and beyond. In Gaza over 186,000 Palestinians have been martyred during the ongoing U.S.-israeli genocide over the past 10 months. And as the U.S. funds and facilitates genocide abroad, the state continues to commit genocide here at home against Black people, with local police murdering hundreds of Black people across the U.S. in cold blood year every year.(1/2),Sun Jul 28 2024 10:25:30 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),https://t.me/wolpalestine/501

WOLPalestine,With all its militant struggle, the Yemeni resistance aims to do whatever it takes to stop the aggression against Gaza. Recently, the southern port of Eilat in occupied Palestine declared bankruptcy, made possible by Yemen's continued efforts to turn another ship around.Their commitment to Palestinian liberation has been unceasing, despite the zionist entity's bombing of Hodeidah with US-manufactured F-35 warplanes. Responding to this attack that killed six and injured several more, Yemenis emerged with massive demonstrations and proclaimed, "No matter how much strike us... no matter what, we will not back down."Yemen is proving to the world that they will never abandon Gaza. From Gaza to Yemen to Lebanon to Iraq, our enemies are the same: the zionist entity and the US empire! ?????,Tue Jul 23 2024 17:05:29 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),https://t.me/wolpalestine/497

WOLPalestine,?Make no mistake, no matter who runs in the election, the Democratic Party and Biden will always have blood on their hands. He will go down in history as the President who killed more Palestinians than anyone else. And whoever they replace him with, enabled that same violence.? @ NerdeenKiswani (X),Sun Jul 21 2024 11:33:35 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),https://t.me/wolpalestine/493
WOLPalestine,Just two weeks ago, The Lancet revealed the shocking estimate that 186,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza by direct fire, enforced starvation, and rampant spread of diseases.In the face of the accelerating atrocities in Gaza, and rising fascist repression across Turtle Island, we must continue to organize and mobilize for an end to the genocide and for a free Palestine, from the river to the sea.?

WOLPalestine,?Flood CUNY for Gaza!??? FBI: Most Wanted, a CBS show, is filming a fake encampment at Queens College to demonize the student intifada and manufacture consent for the genocide of Palestine.?? MONDAY July 22nd?? 5:30pm? CUNY Graduate CenterTwitter/X: @wolpalestineTelegram: t.me/wolprotestCUNY4Palestine, Within Our Lifetime, and National Students for Justice in Palestine call for a Week of Rage to protest the filming of an FBI: Most Wanted episode at CUNY Queens College featuring a fictionalized Gaza Solidarity Encampment scene, complete with tents, a "chase and arrest" scene, and a mock-explosion.This is a clear attempt to simultaneously demonize and profit from the Student Movement against the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza. This episode obfuscates the concrete demands of the Student Intifada: our universities must divest from settler colonialism and genocide and cut all ties with Israeli academic institutions.(1/2),Sat Jul 20 2024 18:05:07 GMT-0700 (Pacific Daylight Time),https://t.me/wolpalestine/488
