FEATURE: Kinugawa Onsen reversing 'haikyo' image amid foreign vis...	On the banks of Kinugawa River, a row of abandoned, crumbling hotels stands like a relic of a forgotten past. A destination that once thrived as a hot spring resort during Japan's bubble economy era of the 1980s, many parts of Kinugawa Onsen have now fallen silent. But a revival is underway, driven partly by efforts to draw more foreign visitors. Not far away, a monorail takes guests through a quiet forested landscape into the tranquil environment of Hoshino Resorts KAI Kinugawa. The Japanese luxury hotel operator, which opened the high-end 'ryokan' inn in 2015, said foreign visitors now make up 10 to 15 percent of guests year-round, with a marked uptick in Western guests.
