He has long blamed factors such as globalization and unauthorized immigration for various economic and social problems, especially those affecting working-class white people.

Japan high court rules same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional	A Japanese high court ruled Wednesday that the country's lack of legal recognition for same-sex marriage violates the right to equality under the Constitution, saying the ban leads to discriminatory treatment of people based on sexual orientation.

It became the second high court to rule that the ban is unconstitutional.

Toyota Motor Corp. said Wednesday its global production fell 7.0 percent from a year earlier in the April-September period, marking the first drop in four years, as a quality scandal and weaker sales in China dented both domestic and overseas output.

Japan has lodged a protest with a U.N. human rights watchdog that called for reviewing a domestic law that limits imperial succession to male heirs on the emperor's father side, the top government spokesman said Wednesday. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said the imperial succession system is linked to the foundations of Japan as a country, and that the government had told the U.N. panel, which aims at eliminating discrimination against women, before the release of the review that it would be 'inappropriate' for it to take up the issue.

Japan PM seeks partners after ruling bloc loses lower house major...	Japan's ruling camp lost its majority in the House of Representatives in Sunday's election, dealing a heavy blow to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba who must now look for additional support outside the coalition to run a stable government.

FOCUS: Ishiba's high-stakes election backfires, worsens LDP scars	Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba had hoped calling an election would allow him to gain a firmer grip on power. Instead, his political capital has waned, leaving his premiership hanging by a thread only a month after taking office.
