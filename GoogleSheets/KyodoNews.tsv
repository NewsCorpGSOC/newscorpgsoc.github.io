Japan's nuclear watchdog formally decided Wednesday that a reactor in central Japan has failed to pass a safety review needed for its restart, in the first such case since the regulatory body's founding after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear crisis.

The NRA had also solicited public comments.

Donald Trump's return to the White House is likely to make Japan reluctant to raise potentially controversial proposals affecting the decades-old bilateral alliance -- including Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's desire to seek a first-ever revision of a pact governing the U.S. military presence. Ishiba says he wants to beef up the alliance by changing the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement. But experts warn that attempts to amend the pact could backfire with the Republican president-elect critical of allies he says are not paying enough for U.S. security support.

But inflation-adjusted wages at workplaces with five or more employees decreased at a slower rate, easing from a 0.8 percent drop in August, as the resumption of government subsidies for utility bills helped lower core consumer prices, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said.

Survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan on Wednesday expressed concerns that former President Donald Trump, who has won the U.S. presidential election, would be passive about global nuclear abolition and called for the incoming leader to embrace a nuclear-free world.

'It's difficult to predict in which direction the United States will move, but as hibakusha, we just want him to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.'

Trump, born in New York to a real estate tycoon, has built his political identity on a view of the United States as a once-great country in severe decline. He has long blamed factors such as globalization and unauthorized immigration for various economic and social problems, especially those affecting working-class white people.
