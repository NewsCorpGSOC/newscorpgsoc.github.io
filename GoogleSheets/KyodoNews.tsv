Japan PM admits giving gift vouchers to rookie ruling party lawma...	Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Thursday that his office handed out gift vouchers to rookie Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers but maintained that the practice does not pose legal problems, dealing a fresh blow to the ruling party still reeling from a slush fund scandal. Ishiba said the gifts, delivered to the first-term lawmakers before they met for dinner at the prime minister's official residence on March 3, were intended to reward their hard work and paid out of his own pocket. A voucher gift was worth 100,000 yen ($676) per person, according to participants of the meeting.

Japanese conveyor-belt sushi chain Sushiro has been building a strong following in China despite Beijing's total ban on Japanese seafood imports, with its affordable prices appealing to belt-tightening consumers amid an economic slump and some queuing for hours to enter an outlet. When its first store in Beijing opened last August, some customers waited for more than 10 hours to eat sushi items priced at a minimum 10 yuan ($1.4) per dish. On recent weekends, people still had to wait for as long as eight hours, according to the chain operator.
