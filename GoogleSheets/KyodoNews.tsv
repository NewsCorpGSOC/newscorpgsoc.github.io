Dog lovers gather at canine-friendly shrine event in Kagawa	Dog lovers and their furry friends gathered from across Japan to pay homage at Kotohiragu shrine in Kotohira, Kagawa Prefecture, during an event earlier this year that also included a stamp rally, pet goods market and photo spots in the shrine's vicinity.
