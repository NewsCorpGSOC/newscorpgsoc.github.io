Flight voice recordings from a Japan Coast Guard plane involved in a fatal collision were released Wednesday, reinforcing the view that its crew likely erroneously believed the aircraft was allowed to enter the runway when it was hit by a Japan Airlines jetliner at Tokyo's Haneda airport in January.

But subsequent exchanges among the crew suggest they believed they had been given permission to enter, according to a Japan Transport Safety Board report.
