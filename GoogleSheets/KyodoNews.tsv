China stresses need to keep monitoring water near Fukushima plant	China said Thursday no abnormalities were found in seawater samples it independently collected near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, reportedly carried out last October, but stressed the need to continue such monitoring before it can lift a total ban on Japanese seafood imports.

She said having China conduct its own independent monitoring was 'only one of the steps' for Japan to fulfill its commitments.

When Chiaki Kasai set out to make a documentary about Iwao Hakamata, a Japanese man who was acquitted in a retrial of a 1966 quadruple murder case after spending more than four decades on death row, she hoped to tell the story of his life as a promising young boxer before his life was upended by tragedy.

Japan's trade deficit shrinks 44% in 2024 on record exports	Japan's trade deficit in 2024 shrank 44 percent from a year earlier to 5.33 trillion yen ($34 billion), as exports hit a record high due to robust vehicle and semiconductor-related demand, government data showed Thursday.

Appealing to Donald Trump's penchant for business dealmaking could provide a lifeline for Nippon Steel Corp.'s seemingly doomed $14.1 billion buyout of United States Steel Corp., some Japanese economists believe, giving some hope that the recently inaugurated president may overturn his predecessor's ban on the deal.

OPINION: AI is assistive intelligence, leads to better democracy	There are serious global concerns about the misuse of synthetic content, ranging from psychological to financial and political harm.
