OPINION: AI is assistive intelligence, leads to better democracy	There are serious global concerns about the misuse of synthetic content, ranging from psychological to financial and political harm. Artificial intelligence can amplify the misuse of such content and create doubt about the authenticity of what we see and hear. Creative AI can also be directed toward authoritarian use.

The impact is social-technical, and the remedies must be the remedies. While the manipulation of information undermines trust, top-down responses such as government censorship also weaken the foundations of governance.
