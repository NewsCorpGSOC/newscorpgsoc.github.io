Donald Trump's return to the White House is likely to make Japan reluctant to raise potentially controversial proposals affecting the decades-old bilateral alliance -- including Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's desire to seek a first-ever revision of a pact governing the U.S. military presence. Ishiba says he wants to beef up the alliance by changing the Japan-U.S. Status of Forces Agreement. But experts warn that attempts to amend the pact could backfire with the Republican president-elect critical of allies he says are not paying enough for U.S. security support.

But inflation-adjusted wages at workplaces with five or more employees decreased at a slower rate, easing from a 0.8 percent drop in August, as the resumption of government subsidies for utility bills helped lower core consumer prices, the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare said.

Survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan on Wednesday expressed concerns that former President Donald Trump, who has won the U.S. presidential election, would be passive about global nuclear abolition and called for the incoming leader to embrace a nuclear-free world.

'It's difficult to predict in which direction the United States will move, but as hibakusha, we just want him to aim for a world without nuclear weapons.'

Trump, born in New York to a real estate tycoon, has built his political identity on a view of the United States as a once-great country in severe decline. He has long blamed factors such as globalization and unauthorized immigration for various economic and social problems, especially those affecting working-class white people.

Japan high court rules same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional	A Japanese high court ruled Wednesday that the country's lack of legal recognition for same-sex marriage violates the right to equality under the Constitution, saying the ban leads to discriminatory treatment of people based on sexual orientation.

It became the second high court to rule that the ban is unconstitutional.
