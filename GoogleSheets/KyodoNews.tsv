Japan Tourism Topics by JNTO - December [PR]	[News!]1. Japan's Breweries and Distilleries Celebrate UNESCO Heritage Listing Japanese sake, one of the most well-known elements of Japanese cuisine, has a history that stretches back centuries, with regional varieties made all across the country. This fermented alcoholic beverage is made with rice, 'koji' mold, and water. While seemingly simple, the techniques and conditions required to make Japanese sake are unique, leading to the Japanese government proposing 'Traditional knowledge and skills of sake-making with koji mold in Japan' to be registered as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, which was approved on December 4 (December 5 JST). This includes not only Japanese sake, but also 'shochu' and 'awamori,' and 'mirin' cooking wine. Traditional knowledge and skills of sake-making with koji mold in Japan came to be thanks to the experienced, dedicated 'toji' (chief sake maker) and 'kurabito' (sake brewery worker) who use koji mold, adjust their brewing processes to work with different climates across Japan, and have passed down their techniques and skills over generations. The sake produced through these traditional methods has deep roots in Japanese society, playing a significant role in Japanese religious rituals, ceremonies such as weddings, and other parts of Japanese culture. The ingredient koji is also used to make miso, vinegar, and soy sauce, making it a crucial element of Japanese food culture and demonstrating the strong ties between sake making and traditional Japanese cuisine. It is expected that the new designation will make the rich history and culture of sake-making more well-known and appreciated worldwide. The deep history and masterful techniques and skills used to make Japanese sake make it a significant symbol of Japanese culture.
