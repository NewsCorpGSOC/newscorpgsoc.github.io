Japan's births likely to fall under 700,000 for 1st time in 2024	The number of births in Japan in 2024 is likely to fall under 700,000 for the first time after government data showed Tuesday that the figure in the first half fell 6.3 percent from a year earlier to 329,998.

Japan's parliament will convene a special session from next Monday following the general election, the top government spokesman said, with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba looking set to be reelected the same day.

The conventional wisdom has been that he is unpredictable, but his stated priorities remain rather consistent as he aims to complete unfinished work by retaking the White House. Trump, born in New York to a real estate tycoon, has built his political identity on a view of the United States as a once-great country in severe decline. He has long blamed factors such as globalization and unauthorized immigration for various economic and social problems, especially those affecting working-class white people.
