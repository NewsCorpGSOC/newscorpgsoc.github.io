Chilled noodles shimmer in Shikoku winter sun as production peaks	Traditionally made, chilled 'kan-somen' noodles shimmered in the winter cold in mid-January as their annual production peaked on Shodo Island in western Japan's Seto Inland Sea. The island's noodles made from October to the end of March are popular for their firm texture thanks to exposure to the cool air and their pronounced white color. Lower amounts of salt are also a benefit of the method.

China stresses need to keep monitoring water near Fukushima plant	China said Thursday no abnormalities were found in seawater samples it independently collected near the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, reportedly carried out last October, but stressed the need to continue such monitoring before it can lift a total ban on Japanese seafood imports.

Japan's trade deficit shrinks 44% in 2024 on record exports	Japan's trade deficit in 2024 shrank 44 percent from a year earlier to 5.33 trillion yen ($34 billion), as exports hit a record high due to robust vehicle and semiconductor-related demand, government data showed Thursday.

Appealing to Donald Trump's penchant for business dealmaking could provide a lifeline for Nippon Steel Corp.'s seemingly doomed $14.1 billion buyout of United States Steel Corp., some Japanese economists believe, giving some hope that the recently inaugurated president may overturn his predecessor's ban on the deal. While Trump publicly opposed the proposal in the lead-up to his return to the White House, he may change his mind if he comes to see the potential economic benefits the deal, which would create the world's third-largest steelmaker by volume, can provide for the United States, Hiroshi Watanabe, a senior economist at Sony Financial Holdings Inc., said.
