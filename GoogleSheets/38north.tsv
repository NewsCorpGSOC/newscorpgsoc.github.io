Why and How Estimates of North Korean GDP by the Bank of Korea Are Deceptive	The most commonly used indicator to gauge a country’s economic capacity and well-being is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is defined as -the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.- It measures the flow of money based on transactions in a market economy, where income and expenditure should be equal. In the case of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea), the Bank of Korea’s (BOK) estimates are the most widely cited metrics by international organizations and policy actors when assessing the DPRK’s economic situation. However, these numbers can be deceptive as the BOK uses the production approach to estimate North Korea’s GDP, which does not reflect its actual economic situation. Even though the BOK’s use of the production approach has flaws when measuring the DPRK’s GDP, other approaches are also insufficient. The biggest deficiency in current estimative approaches is the inability to properly account for the state procuring goods and services without payment or at a fraction of the cost, undermining the market principle that income should equal expenditure—a common trait among communist states. Because the North Korean regime does not disclose reliable information on its economy and resorts to widespread extraction of labor, conventional economic thinking cannot be applied to assess its economic reality. At the same time, the country’s dependence on an extractive system is increasingly risky, as most other instances of this approach have led to a state’s demise. How Bank of Korea Estimates Mislead According to the BOK, the real GDP of the DPRK declined by 8.4 percent from 2017 to 2022. Many have disputed these estimates: Korea Economic Institute of America Senior Advisor William Brown has suggested retiring the BOK’s report because of these inaccuracies. In addition, Seoul National University’s Professor Byung-Yeon Kim has argued that household income in North Korea actually fell by half between 2017 and 2022, according to testimonies from defectors, resulting in GDP decreasing by 25 percent. Despite acknowledging the BOK’s flaws, no one has fully captured why and how the BOK’s GDP figures are so misleading. A closer look into the different approaches to estimating a nation’s GDP coupled with an analysis of the impact of labor extraction in North Korea is essential to grasp the discrepancies. In general, there are three ways economists measure GDP: the production approach, the income approach, and the expenditure approach. In market economies, when using any approach, the GDP calculated in principle would be the same. The BOK implements the production approach when assessing North Korea’s economic performance by -using the basic data on production quantities supplied by relevant institutions…with the use of South Korea’s prices and value-added ratios.- However, this approach does not account for labor extraction, where, either voluntarily or through coercion, workers contribute labor to produce goods and services in North Korea for free or at a highly discounted rate. This should be interpreted as a -hidden tax- on labor where the worker’s time is redirected by the state, thereby causing the worker to lose earning potential while the state collects returns on the worker’s outputs. The BOK’s estimation assumes no extraction of labor and thus shows an artificial increase in the value added to the economy, skewing estimates of its economic activity. The Difficulties of Measuring North Korea’s GDP Of the three major approaches to measuring GDP, each presents distinct flaws when applied to North Korea. The Production Approach The BOK uses South Korean prices in its estimates, which distorts changes in North Korean prices. Since the 2017 sanctions, North Korea has experienced a sustained trade deficit due to decreased exports, causing a drop in government revenue and the rise of the foreign exchange rate, resulting in inflation—a phenomenon that is overlooked when using South Korean prices. This can be illustrated by the 2019 data, which shows a trade deficit of $2.69 billion, or 9.5 percent of North Korea’s nominal GDP, as estimated by the BOK. Yet that same year, the BOK stated that GDP grew by 0.4 percent. In reality, the real income of North Koreans has sharply declined due to inflation and a sharply declining won-dollar exchange rate. All in all, North Korean GDP is overstated by the BOK. The Income Approach The income approach aggregates income from household wages, dividends, rent from private properties, and interest. In North Korea, the state owns the means of production; there is no stock market, property rights, or banking system. Therefore, national income can only amount to aggregate household income, composed of economic activity in the shadow economy and government-paid wages, representing a fraction of the market wage because of labor extraction. For example, Ri Il Gyu, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and recent defector, claimed to earn only the equivalent of $500 monthly while working in Cuba and $0.30 monthly in North Korea. Consequently, he was compelled to engage in the shadow economy via smuggling to make up for his low income and support his family. Not accounting for labor extraction in the income approach will result in a much lower GDP figure than the production approach. This is confirmed by empirical research, including testimonies I gathered in July 2024 from North Korean defectors who arrived in South Korea in October 2023, verifying the intensification of labor extraction and the precipitated decline in state-provided wages during the COVID period. Professor Kim had similar findings and concluded that the GDP decreased by 25 percent between 2017 and 2022. The BOK’s approach clearly overstates real income in the DPRK, thereby exaggerating GDP. The Expenditure Approach The expenditure approach estimates GDP by summing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The BOK’s approach overstates North Korean GDP compared to the expenditure approach in several key ways. First, output produced without due compensation via extraction would logically result in both decreased government expenditure, as the government does not pay for labor, and household income, as individuals are not paid for their labor. Decreased household income results in lower household consumption, which, therefore, impacts the population’s economic well-being. Such a phenomenon is not effectively captured in the BOK’s estimation, which inflates the GDP. Second, the expenditure approach is the only open model incorporating foreign trade, the bulk of which is with China, providing a lifeline to the regime and ensuring its survival. Exports are the largest source of North Korea’s government revenue, so its sustained trade deficit causes government revenue to decrease and impacts the types of output North Korea can produce. The sustained trade deficit causes the foreign exchange rate to increase and prices to rise. Yet, the BOK’s approach does not account for this as it uses South Korean prices and does not consider net exports. Accounting for Extraction The DPRK uses the extraction of labor on a large scale. As an example, news reports in May 2024 showed students, from those in elementary school to those in university, being forced to transplant rice seedlings for no pay as part of the state-mandated farm assistance period. By forcing people to work for no income, much of the DPRK’s economic activity is not captured in traditional GDP data. As the foreign exchange rate rises and the budget deficit deepens, the DPRK must compensate for this by printing money, eventually leading to inflation. However, instead of resorting to printing money, the regime has relied more and more on labor extraction, which is not accounted for in the BOK’s estimation. Finally, in the DPRK, investment can only come from the government as the inability of individuals to save precludes private investment. Revenue must exceed expenditure to ensure net investment from the government into the economy—without sustained investment, the country’s economic capacity will contract, and depreciation will occur, resulting in eroding infrastructure, the contraction of productive capacity, and pervasive adverse effects on the economy in the long run. The DPRK resolves this through extraction, both when paying workers a fraction of the market wage or when procuring goods and services below the market value. By not taking into account all these factors and using the production approach, the BOK’s estimate overstates North Korea’s GDP. Conclusion Each approach to estimating a state’s GDP has its own blind spots, and all of them fail to illustrate North Korea’s dire economic situation. Its accumulated trade deficit after the increased sanctions in 2017 and self-imposed COVID-19 isolation in 2020 forced Kim Jong Un to deplete the foreign exchange reserves and rely on hacking, smuggling, and other illegal activities to replenish its diminishing coffers. The future of the DPRK is bleak, and the regime has no other choice but to rely on labor extraction and harsh repression of its people. Pyongyang’s increased belligerence internationally is merely a sign of the regime’s desperation to enhance its economic plight and ensure the survival of its extractive system. Recent Nobel Prize laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson explained in their book Why Nations Fail that extractive systems, like the one in North Korea, impede economic development because the economy’s benefits accrue to only a few chosen members of the ruling class and are not shared among people. Therefore, it should be noted that the economic failure of extractive systems is not an indictment of the people in that country but a system that, throughout history, has consistently failed. North Korea must replace its extractive system with an inclusive one if it is to achieve real economic development and avoid collapse.

Quick Take: North Korea’s Coverage of Russian War Against Ukraine	In a speech at a Korean People’s Army conference on November 15, Kim Jong Un said the United States was -sustaining their [its] military assistance to Ukraine- and claimed -the United States and other Western countries are using Ukraine as a shock force in the war against Russia.- This speech was carried for both domestic and external audiences. Kim’s unusual, but not unprecedented, direct reference to the Russia-Ukraine war offers a good opportunity to review how North Korean propaganda outlets have handled this topic since the war began. North Korea has taken two widely different approaches to the coverage of the war, depending on the audience.[1] Outlets targeting external audiences were quick and decisive in reporting on the war and siding with Russia. By contrast, domestically oriented media were first observed to mention the Ukraine situation in March 2023, more than a year after the war began.[2] North Korea became more forward-leaning in its domestic coverage of the war as its relationship with Russia continued to deepen. North Korea’s cautious and more calibrated approach to the war in Ukraine vis-à-vis the domestic public indicates sensitivities surrounding the topic. In that vein, it should be no surprise the country’s domestic media, unlike its external websites, remain silent on the extent of North Korea’s role in the war. External Versus Domestic Coverage External outlets reacted within days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Two days after the invasion, the Foreign Ministry website carried a bylined article blaming the United States and supporting Russia’s position on Ukraine. An official Foreign Ministry statement reiterated this same line two days later. North Korean external platforms, led by the Foreign Ministry website, have since carried articles and statements consistent with Russia’s position on Ukraine, including North Korean Foreign Ministry officials’ press statements directly voicing support for Russia. Pyongyang’s quick and decisive support for Russia’s war against Ukraine is in line with one of the earliest signs of its foreign policy reorientation in August 2021, when the Foreign Ministry website started to regularly carry reports and articles introducing or supporting Russian positions on international and foreign policy issues. Domestic media’s first observed reference to the war in Ukraine was in a party daily article on March 30, 2023 citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s claim that the United States was encouraging the -Ukrainian crisis- for economic benefits. Domestic media have since published news reports, articles, and commentaries that aligned with Russia’s position on Ukraine and were critical of the United States and the West. Domestic media coverage of the war in Ukraine has increased since March 2024, shortly after the Foreign Ministry indicated, based on the foreign minister’s trip to Russia in January 2024, that Putin would be visiting Pyongyang and a new treaty would be signed. It was also after this announcement that domestic media started to provide more details about the war and carry Foreign Ministry statements on the war in Ukraine, which had hitherto been reserved for external websites. Choe Son Hui’s Russia visit in January 2024 seems to have given North Korea greater confidence in its relationship with Moscow, prompting it to give clearer signals domestically on its position on the war. That notwithstanding, domestic media refrained from directly voicing support for the war. In two instances, they indirectly acknowledged North Korea’s support for Russia’s -special military operation- by citing Putin (July 2023) or Russia (January 2024). Putin’s visit to Pyongyang in June 2024, however, was a turning point. In a departure from past practice, a party daily editorial explicitly voiced -full support and encouragement for the special military operation against Ukraine- on the day of Putin’s scheduled arrival in Pyongyang. In his talks with the visiting Russian vice defense minister the following month, Kim Jong Un himself expressed -strong support for and firm solidarity with- Russia on -the special military operations in Ukraine,- echoing the same promise he made during the summit with Putin.

Quick Take: Video Shows More of Suspected Airborne Early Warning Aircraft	A video shot by a tourist in North Korea has provided a close-up view of an Air Koryo Ilyushin IL-76 that could be the country’s first Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft. The IL-76 was captured in footage taken aboard an Air Koryo flight departing from Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport in October. The aircraft, which had been part of Air Koryo’s cargo fleet, has been in a maintenance facility at the airport for a little over a year. Commercial satellite imagery since October 2023 has revealed work on top of the fuselage that is consistent with a radar pedestal. The new video shows the aircraft from the side, with the structure visible on top of the fuselage. It was shot from approximately 0.5 kilometers away, meaning fine details of the structure are difficult to make out. However, the structure on the plane does appear similar to a radar pedestal. A fence is also visible around the aircraft, which serves to both keep personnel from the plane and hide materials from view. Since the video was taken, commercial satellite imagery indicates the aircraft has been moved from its position adjacent to the maintenance hangar. Unfortunately, available imagery is not sufficiently detailed to determine if the radome has been added and the conversion is complete.

Munchon Naval Complex Construction Progresses	Two months after Kim Jong Un visited Tapchon Port on North Korea’s east coast and announced plans to build a large naval base, commercial satellite imagery shows no signs of construction advancing at the site. Tapchon is part of a larger complex of naval facilities in the Munchon area, previously the home of the KPA East Fleet Headquarters. However, across the bay, there is significant work to expand the existing October 3 Dockyard and Korean People’s Army (KPA) Navy Unit 155 Base. Together with Tapchon Port, these facilities are all part of the Munchon Naval Complex. Kim visited the future site of the Tapchon naval base in early September and said its construction would be a -pressing task- if the country’s navy were able to moor -large surface warships and submarines which cannot be anchored at the existing facilities.- Long piers and several buildings were constructed at the port between 2015 and 2022, but none appear to have been put into regular use. Some still remain incomplete on imagery from November 6. While perhaps a less-than-auspicious start for the naval base project, Kim’s emphasis on the importance of this new base to the navy’s future suggests work should pick up in the near future. A slow start following Kim’s visit is not uncommon—for example, at Sohae Satellite Launching Station, modernization and expansion efforts did not begin in earnest immediately following Kim’s mandate. Tapchon Port There have been no discernable changes at the Tapchon port area since Kim’s visit in September, despite Kim calling the site’s expansion a pressing task. Fishing boats are still using some of the piers, numerous buildings remain half-finished, and no new land clearance has begun. Around the site, large concrete blocks remain scattered where they have sat for years. Similar blocks are usually used throughout the country to build up sea walls, although the walls around Tapchon Port appear to be well-fortified. October 3 Dockyard At the nearby October 3 Dockyard, home to KPA Navy Unit 597, many of the vessels on the repair way do not appear to have moved in the last two months. The dockyard was almost completely rebuilt in 2015 after Kim visited and called for its modernization. The latest image reveals work on a new building near the entrance of the site has been completed, and a second adjacent building appears to be under construction. KPA Navy Unit 155 Base Just south, construction progress has occurred at the KPA Navy Unit 155 site. The entire facility is being redeveloped with several new buildings. Satellite imagery from November 6 reveals roofs have been added to some buildings, and second floors are being added to others. Two new round buildings are under construction. The internal partitioning and unique design suggest they are likely to be headquarters or administrative buildings. Additionally, the sea wall has been extended and appears set to snake around the edge of the bay. It may be that the stepped-up efforts at KPA Navy Unit 155 are a prelude to the final phase of construction at Tapchon.
