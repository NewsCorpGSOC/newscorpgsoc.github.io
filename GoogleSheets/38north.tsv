North Korea’s Importance for Putin’s -Turn to the East-	While attention rightly centers on China’s vital role in Vladimir Putin’s -Turn to the East,- now in its 12th year, little notice has been taken of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK or North Korea) importance for the -Turn.- After China, North Korea is one of two states—along with India—of greatest significance for Putin’s initiative for no less than four reasons. They reflect the security and identity aims of the -Turn.- They also are testimony to the complexity of Sino-Russian relations—close but often distrustful.[1] First, the -Turn- revives the -Grand Strategic Triangle- of the Cold War era, demonstrating to the United States and China that Russia is a powerful force with which they must reckon. It is steeped in the logic of Soviet foreign policy, for which North Korea was a vital element. Second, after initial wavering in Stage One of the -Turn to the East- from 2012 to early 2014, it increasingly targeted the US alliances with South Korea and Japan, treated reminiscent of the Cold War, as is North Korea. If some initially pointed to economics as the priority, rightly recognizing a focus on exports of energy, investments and modernization of the Russian Far East were secondary aims. Third, no state is more welcoming to the Russian agenda than North Korea and more eager to covet its assets: arms technology, energy, and foodstuffs. Further, Pyongyang wholeheartedly endorses Putin’s aggressive behavior. Finally, the national identity component of the -Turn- necessitates a partner other than China to vindicate such claims as Eurasianism, multipolarity, equality of great powers, and unique civilization. Too much one-sided dependence on China strips Russia of the identity justifications it keeps making, vital to claims Putin insists are key. To understand the evolution of the -Turn to the East,- we need look no further than articles by Russians over the past twelve years.[2] Cozying up to North Korea in 2023-2024 is a continuation of the fourth stage. Below, I outline the stages with new focus on North Korea’s role and the four reasons for pursuing the North.[3] Embracing North Korea fits into a broader Russian strategy than simply gaining support for the Ukraine war. Along with forging a close but at times contentious relationship with China, it harks back to aspirations of the 1950s and targets a world where US might and alliances are put under siege. In the absence of a regional security framework aimed at undermining these alliances and giving Russia veto power, the desired outcome is a polarized Northeast Asia in which Moscow and Beijing each cultivate ties with Pyongyang without succumbing to a Sinocentric agenda. Fearful of security threats, Seoul and Tokyo find themselves obliged to accommodate Russia’s interests to a substantial degree. The closer Moscow’s ties to Pyongyang, the more leverage it expects over US allies as well as China. North Korea and the Four Stages of the -Turn to the East- We need to look back to the Six Party Talks for early signs of Russian thinking about North Korea’s significance. Russians saw an opportunity to be -very helpful- to the North in adjusting to -new economic, political, and social realities- in a -long, slow period of mutual accommodation of North and South.-[4] Russia would modernize factories built by the Soviets, absorb the North’s workforce, provide its energy, upgrade its armed forces, and be the ideal partner in its complex dealings with China and Japan (as well as the United States).[5] -At stake…is not only the security of Russia’s eastern flank but also its prospects…in the geopolitical and economic upsurge of the world’s most dynamic region.-[6] Anticipating a new structure in which Moscow had a critical voice—reinforced by organizing the Six Party Talks fifth working group on peace and security in Northeast Asia—Russians saw its reemergence as a major player in regional affairs, -holding the forces of globalization at a distance.-[7] Failure of the talks necessitated a new agenda in Asia. Stage One of Putin’s -Turn to the East- in 2012-2014 focused less on North Korea but recognized the fact that Abe Shinzo in wooing Putin, and Park Geun-hye in advancing her -Eurasian Initiative,- saw Russia as a partner in managing North Korea as well as in limiting China’s ambitions.[8] Its emphasis on both multipolarity, including US allies, and modernization of the Russian Far East, attracting investments from diverse sources, held promise for Russian-DPRK ties, even if diplomacy was stalled in the transition to Kim Jong Un. Seeking a place for Russia in a booming region, Putin aimed less to transform than to adjust regional dynamics, centering first on China. After annexing Crimea and advancing in eastern Ukraine, Putin, in Stage Two, 2014-2017, chose a more aggressive approach to Northeast Asia, seeking to reshape it through -docking- with China in infrastructure and bonding with North Korea. Troubled Sino-DPRK ties left an opening, pursued along with lingering diplomacy with Japan and South Korea, despite lower expectations. Frustration was mounting, however, as Beijing outmaneuvered Moscow in joint plans and Kim Jong Un, as he built up his nuclear and missile capabilities, saw little benefit in prioritizing a breakthrough with Putin. The -turn to North Korea- seemed to be at an impasse after Putin acquiesced to Xi Jinping’s decision in late 2017 to toughen up UN sanctions on it. Stage Three, 2018-2021, started slowly for Russia as it was marginalized in the diplomacy between Kim Jong Un and both Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in. Putin pressed China to agree to his plan for a -Greater Eurasian Partnership,- but Xi did not coordinate on India and ASEAN, his Central Asia moves were suspect, and claims of coordination over North Korea were of uncertain value. As Xi regained his footing through repeated summits with Kim Jong Un, Putin was finally able to host Kim. -Delighted- with the failure of the Hanoi summit and with signs Sino-US relations were in a new Cold War, Putin, however, found there was no room left to play the -North Korea- card when North Korea in early 2020 shut its borders to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak. While diplomacy with Pyongyang drew little outside attention, the urgency of a breakthrough was growing. Putin was set on stirring up Cold War divisions; he was intent on demonstrating he had options other than China and was determined to put security at the forefront. With further deterioration in Sino-US relations in the pandemic year 2020 and with the start of the Biden administration’s pushback against China, US minilateralism at last promised to give Putin the opening he sought. Camp David trilateralism defied China, Russia, and North Korea demands. The language in Russian publications in 2019-2021 both appealed to China to join in a new Cold War and searched for a way to affirm Russia’s standing in a world not exclusively dominated by two great powers.[9] Although the Russian ambassador remained in Pyongyang during the period it closed its borders, there was scant diplomacy to vindicate high hopes. Yet commentaries on what went wrong at the Hanoi summit and on North Korea’s case for security made sympathies clear. With no renewed US diplomacy toward the North and China keeping up pressure despite relaxing some enforcement of sanctions, Russia would have to take matters into its own hands. Stage Four from 2022 saw Putin unleash full-scale war in Ukraine as he revved up the -Turn to the East- through China with the intent to add North Korea to the mix. His war of attrition made the case for tightening ties to North Korea stronger. Aggression in the West did not come at the expense of ambitions in the East; it complemented them. Four reasons justified a breakthrough with the North: reviving the Grand Strategic Triangle, targeting US alliances in East Asia, welcoming North Korea’s agenda as in Russia’s interest, and reconceptualizing national identity. Reviving the Grand Strategic Triangle After 45 years of grandiose claims of being one of two superpowers, Moscow acclimated to the post-Cold War. It rejected any junior status to the United States and, encouraged by Beijing, from the mid-1990s, grasped for a strategic triangle with the two. A sharp break with the West was required, given Russia’s diminished standing. In the East, the challenge was to draw close to China, proving Russia’s value against the United States, while seeking some balance elsewhere in Asia. Japan and South Korea failed the test, being too close to Washington and opposed by China. India looked promising, but the Indian backlash against China after their 2020 skirmish and growing security ties to the United States reduced its value. North Korea fit the bill well, given its ambivalent but essential ties to China and its security obsession, raising the variable most critical for strategic triangle maneuvering. Putin recognized its value in his surprise visit to Pyongyang in 2000; his attempted diplomatic intervention in January 2003, when he sent a deputy foreign minister to Pyongyang in an attempt to put Russia at the center of resolving the nuclear crisis; his hopes in the Six Party Talks for the fifth working group chaired by Moscow; his response in 2010 to the Cheonan sinking; and his overtures to Kim Jong Un in 2014 to 2017 (e.g., showcasing him at the 70th anniversary victory day parade on May 9, 2015, before Kim changed his mind about attending, and blaming Seoul, not Pyongyang, when plans for large-scale coal trade from Khasan through Rajin collapsed). Failure of the 2019 Hanoi summit renewed hope. Instead of a blitzkrieg success in Ukraine affirming the revival of the Grand Strategic Triangle to be taken seriously by Washington and Beijing, a war of attrition left Russia as a wobbly leg of the triangle in an even more asymmetrical relationship with China.[10] Isolated in Europe, it needed autonomous standing in Asia. North Korea boosted the Grand Strategic Triangle image: 1) raising the salience of nuclear weapons; 2) adding an arms trade partner affecting the war balance; and 3) making Beijing and Washington take its impact on regional security seriously. The legacy of communist thinking, i.e., the Soviet worldview, endures in grandiose claims to be on the top step of the global ladder.[11] Apart from Belarus, there is no country more welcoming to the reassertion of this old identity than North Korea. The more Moscow defines itself as a peer to Washington and Beijing, the more room for maneuvering Pyongyang expects to enjoy. Targeting US Alliances in East Asia Too little attention has been paid to the increasingly negative thinking in Moscow from 2014 toward both Japan and South Korea, whose leaders were too bent on wooing Putin to register the degree of disdain manifest on the other side. It was not until 2022 when both US allies were designated -non-friendly countries,- that waning hopes faded.[12] Commentaries on the end of World War II and the Korean War had long since hardened.[13] Russians may have dangled hope before Park Geun-hye, Moon Jae-in, and Abe Shinzo, but narratives pointed to an unbridgeable gap. History had become an obsession for Putin, was repeatedly cited by Foreign Minister Lavrov, and became intertwined in assessments of bilateral relations. Recognizing the justice of the seizure of four islands never before under Russian control suddenly became a prerequisite for reaching a peace agreement with Japan, complicating talks beyond rigidity on the territorial issue in Moscow. By not accepting that it was a defeated state, restricted in its security agenda, Japan was deemed a revisionist, militarist country trying to disrupt the regional order.[14] Unsaid was that part of that order was a divided Korea, brought about by the same Red Army that had -defeated- Japan. Japan’s aspirations for influence on the Korean Peninsula or reunification at odds with the wishes of the North Korean regime likewise did not jibe with its required status. No less unacceptable were South Korean challenges to the -natural order- left from the Soviet Union’s glorious victories, in cahoots with US ambitions to arouse a -color revolution- in North Korea. As the cult of victory in World War II became Putin’s fixation, the Korean War narrative of helping North Korea fend off US imperialism emerged as a useful addendum. The internal workings of North Korea, including human rights, faded from view in the narrative about a regional order established through blood and sacrifice and serving national interests. In the background loomed the ally of South Korea, moving it as a pawn as it also did with another country supposedly lacking full sovereignty, Japan. Removal of US bases came to be seen as the starting point for an independent foreign policy, which would open the door to problem-solving. Welcoming North Korea’s Agenda as in Russia’s Interest Moscow needed a partner hostile to the status quo, wary of China but unwilling to antagonize its neighbor, and helpful in meeting arms or perhaps labor needs. It did not need to replace the many benefits its quasi-alliance with China provides. China long seemed too dependent on ties to the West to join Russia openly or fully in challenging the existing order. It also had aspirations of drawing Russia into excessive dependency through the Belt and Road Initiative and turning Central Asia from Russia’s sphere of influence inimical to Putin’s ambitions. A troika with India would have been ideal, but India grew too wary of China and too intent on boosting ties with the United States, Japan, and other targets of Russian hostility. North Korea served different goals. In 2024, the economic dimension of cooperation with North Korea has changed, if not as much as the security dimension. Interest in navigation on the Tumen River has reemerged, something China covets but requires North Korean buy-in. The Northern Sea Route, passing along North Korea en route to the Arctic Ocean, is moving ahead. Vladivostok, near the border with North Korea, is opening to transit trade from China. Russians are talking earnestly about bringing large numbers of North Korean workers into their country after complying with sanctions by returning some workers. Much depends on China, now applying pressure on the North to clarify its path. Reconceptualizing Russian National Identity North Korea symbolizes the extension of Moscow’s power into East Asia. In the 1960s-1980s, it was the lone outpost of what Soviets considered their sphere of influence in the neighboring states of Northeast Asia. Complete loss of clout in the 1990s, as diplomacy around the North unfolded, became the foremost sign of regional irrelevance. No wonder, in 2000, Putin stopped in Pyongyang on the way to a G8 summit in Japan as his first demonstration that Russia was making a comeback. The collapse of communism and the Soviet Union left a void in Russian national identity, which Putin is filling with Eurasianism at the forefront. Much as the Sino-Soviet split was treated as a secondary identity theme to the clash with the West and leadership in the communist bloc, the notion of Eurasianism does not rest primarily on Sino-Russian camaraderie. It is an assertion of Russian power and civilization in an Asian context. Ignoring the reality of North Korea, a vision has emerged of it as a valued partner, which reinforces Russia’s identity as an Asian power. Conclusion It is difficult to predict the timing and degree of Putin’s overtures to Kim Jong Un had Putin not launched his full-scale war in Ukraine. Without an urgent need for arms imports, Putin would presumably have taken smaller steps. Yet the logic of pursuing a breakthrough with Kim would have remained. Putin needed to move to a more assertive -Turn to the East- by 2022, given the reasons cited above. In Stage One, he tried a multi-pronged approach that proved contradictory and inadequate to reach his goals. In Stage Two, his outreach to Kim Jong Un fell short, and he had become so reliant on Xi Jinping that he saw no alternative to alienating Kim by agreeing to tough United Nations Security Council sanctions. Marginalized in the diplomacy of 2018, Putin prepared for a new stage in his -Turn to the East- together with a newly aggressive Xi Jinping but seeking more. Attacking Ukraine poked the West in the eye; allying with North Korea delivered a new punch. It also served as a reminder to China that asymmetric dependency is not a license to act at will.

North Korea’s Post-Parliament Tension Signaling	Predicting North Korea’s next moves can be risky, even for the most seasoned and careful experts who base their analysis on a robust baseline of relevant data. Cases in point are the latest Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) session held on October 7 and 8, and the steps North Korea has since taken. The general assessment was that Pyongyang would remove unification-related language and define North Korea’s territory in a constitutional revision at the SPA session—probably with Kim giving a policy speech, as he has done at all fall SPA sessions since 2021.[1] Many North Korea watchers, including myself, had also predicted that inter-Korean tensions would inevitably increase as a result of North Korea’s announcement—and probably enforcement—of its new borders. Contrary to these widespread expectations, North Korean media’s readout of the latest SPA meeting did not mention any of these topics, focusing instead on economic issues. And in lieu of addressing the SPA, Kim made a rare visit to the University of National Defense, where he gave a speech with a heavy nuclear focus. As a result, speculation abounded in the days that followed about whether North Korea revised the constitution related to unification and North Korean territory. Even more surprising and significant than the outcome of the SPA session itself is what followed. North Korea demolished sections of the inter-Korean roads and railways and issued a flurry of angry statements on alleged South Korean drone incursions into Pyongyang airspace, escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In the first week after the SPA session, it appeared that North Korea was not ready for a major confrontation with Seoul. However, its demolition of the inter-Korean roads and railways and belated implication of a constitutional revision defining -the ROK as a hostile state- may signal a turn of events.[2] In that vein, Kim Jong Un’s nuclear rhetoric in recent days, reinforced by his sister Kim Yo Jong’s statement, may be cause for concern. Upping the Ante Prior to its announcement of the road and railway demolition, Pyongyang’s handling of the border question suggested it was not ready to confront South Korea over the definition of its border or address it with its own people. This included the fact that no details were provided about the constitutional revisions passed at the October SPA session (other than the revisions adjusting people’s working and voting ages), and that North Korea’s announcement of its plan to sever all inter-Korean roads and railways was disseminated to external audiences only. By contrast, North Korea was much more vocal about the alleged South Korean drone incursions, even sharing relevant statements with the domestic populace despite the apparent sensitivities surrounding the military’s failure to protect the Pyongyang airspace. Yet, similar to the North’s treatment of the border issue, the initial set of statements suggested the country did not wish to escalate tensions with Seoul beyond what was necessary. The warnings were all conditional and left room for de-escalation. Placing eight artillery brigades on -standby to open fire- in case of recurrence paled compared to the -wartime state- of frontline units in August 2015. Even North Korean media’s coverage of the people’s reaction for the first two days was underwhelming in volume and tone when compared to the intensive anti-South Korea campaign in June 2020. However, an unusual meeting of top defense and security officials convened by Kim Jong Un on October 14 marked a turning point. North Korea destroyed sections of the inter-Korean roads and railways the day after the meeting, presumably in response to Kim’s instructions on -immediate military activities.-[3] It was after this meeting that North Korea announced the demolition of the railways and roads to its own people as well as to external audiences. It was also after this meeting that Pyongyang implied the constitution had been revised to redefine South Korea, in line with Kim’s new two Koreas policy.[4] These were both notable shifts from North Korea’s previous positions. Although state media readout of the October 14 meeting did not provide much detail, there were certain references, such as Kim giving tasks on the -operation of the war deterrent and the exercise of the right to self-defense,- that raise concern about the potential for further escalation of tensions. In fact, since Kim’s meeting was reported, North Korean media coverage of the drones has taken on a militant tone, with state media reporting that 1.4 million people have volunteered to join the Korean People’s Army (KPA). Additionally, since the publication of the demolition report, there has been an uptick in media coverage of the people’s reactions to the drones, some even slipping in criticism of the United States. This behavior is normal during inter-Korean tensions—for example, state media as recently as March 2023 carried similar reports on joining the army—but it is worth watching how North Korea covers public sentiment in the coming days. Furthermore, during a visit to the frontline Second Corps on October 17, Kim reviewed their -military action plans- that apparently included Seoul. He described South Korea as -a foreign country and an apparent hostile country- and reiterated his conditional warning of attack against the South, reinforcing his two Koreas policy.[5] These actions and comments by themselves may not be new or remarkable, but they become significant when viewed in tandem with the ongoing tensions. Kim’s Nuclear Rhetoric In one of her statements on the drones, Kim Yo Jong referred to North Korea as -a nuclear weapons state- and claimed the United States should be held accountable for the alleged South Korean drone incursions. Under normal circumstances, this uncharacteristically short statement may have been written off as simply odd, but it echoes Kim Jong Un’s nuclear rhetoric in recent days. This, coupled with the summoning of the United States in the North’s propaganda on the drone incursions, merits a closer review of Kim’s nuclear rhetoric. Pyongyang carried out a carefully choreographed campaign between early August and mid-September to underscore the country’s nuclear capabilities and justify the importance of prioritizing defense development over the civilian economy despite difficult circumstances and limited resources. Notably, Kim delivered an unusual National Day speech, which focused heavily on continued expansion of the country’s nuclear capabilities. The speech was quickly followed by his first publicized visit to a uranium enrichment facility. Kim picked up on the nuclear theme again in the days running up to, and on the first day of, the latest SPA session. However, his nuclear rhetoric took a tougher turn. Speaking to special operations units—his second visit to a special operations forces training facility in three weeks—Kim Jong Un made personal attacks on the South Korean president for showing off -their military muscle at the doorstep of a state possessing nuclear weapons- during the previous day’s military parade. He then warned that -the DPRK will use without hesitation all the striking forces in its possession, including nuclear weapons,- against South Korea if it uses military force to violate North Korea’s sovereignty. This was an unusually direct threat of nuclear use, despite Kim’s emphasis on the word -if,- its weight redoubled due to the attribution to Kim himself. North Korea typically uses a more indirect formulation, -the second mission- of nuclear weapons, to indicate preemptive nuclear use. For example, Kim, in a speech at an SPA session in January, said, -the second mission of our nuclear force.- Kim issued virtually the same conditional warning about nuclear use in his speech at the University of National Defense on October 7—presumably after he had been briefed on the first drone incursion on October 3. Notably, Kim repeated a theme he has stressed since early August—that North Korea faces serious security challenges because -the ROK-U.S. military alliance has completely changed into a nuclear alliance.- This, when viewed in conjunction with Kim’s pledge in the same speech that North Korea would -never tolerate the balance of strength being disturbed on the Korean peninsula,- seems to imply the North may act decisively if it judges that the -balance- is about to be or has been disrupted. North Korea’s official statements and commentaries since mid-August have linked US security arrangements with its allies and partners to the disruption of the balance of power in the region. During his October 17 visit to the Second Corps, Kim Jong Un reiterated the possibility of retaliation against South Korea if its sovereignty is violated (but omitting the use of -nuclear weapons-) and again stressed the implications of the US-South Korea alliance’s -changed nature- for North Korea’s security. Conclusion The ongoing situation makes the North’s motives and next possible moves particularly challenging to assess because of its highly unusual circumstances: violation of the capital’s airspace and North Korea’s disclosure of it. This places not only North Korea watchers but also North Korea itself in unchartered territory. Another potential twist in this story is Russia’s unequivocal support for Pyongyang amid rising tensions. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused South Korea of a -reckless and provocative campaign- and echoed Pyongyang’s line that the alleged South Korean drone incursions were a violation of North Korea’s sovereignty. The Russian deputy foreign minister went further and said Russia will provide military assistance to North Korea if it comes under attack as per the new North Korea-Russia treaty. This deepening policy coordination between the two countries could affect Kim’s calculus as he thinks about his next steps. Kim proclaimed to his own people in January 2024 that -if the ROK violates even 0.001 mm of our territorial land, air and waters, it will be considered a war provocation.- This likely has not been forgotten by the North Korean army or the people, and Kim will need to handle the situation in a way that does not make him look weak. We should also recall that two border issues have come up thus far: land (the road and railway demolition and continued work to -fortify- the border areas) and air (drone incursions). It may only be a matter of time before tensions over the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean maritime boundary line that Kim has called -illegal,- rear their head again.

US Policy Toward the Indo-Pacific through 2030: Continuity, Consequences, and Change	Whether 2025 marks the beginning of a first Harris administration or a second term for former President Trump, it is almost assured that the United States (US) government will pursue geopolitical competition with China through an -Indo-Pacific Strategy.- Although the tone has varied across the last three US administrations, a shared underlying characterization of interests and associated principles have driven a significant degree of continuity in American foreign policy toward the Indo-Pacific. Behind this continuity, there is a mainstream assumption that sustaining these policies—whether they are fully implemented or not—preserves the status quo in the region, despite the significant geopolitical and geoeconomic changes underway. The logic driving the Indo-Pacific focus is understandable given the mounting threats in the region. And busy government officials can be forgiven for leaning on policies and programs that are well-established and seemingly uncontroversial, versus asking politically difficult (and perhaps career-risking) questions about the wisdom of sustaining the default approach. Nevertheless, an US Indo-Pacific strategy on autopilot seems increasingly blind to the consequences of continuity, namely the ways in which it is exacerbating dangers of crisis or conflict. The next US administration likely will feel constrained in its choices, but it should carefully assess the efficacy of the existing approach and the challenges to its implementation and consider more seriously policy alternatives that could arrest the slide toward insecurity in the region. Continuities As viewed from Washington, the Indo-Pacific problem is mainly driven by Sino-American competition. The Trump and Biden administrations both described the China challenge in similar terms and amplified policies aimed at strengthening the US hand in that competition. The Trump administration’s -Free and Open- Indo-Pacific framework and the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy speak of China as the principal destabilizing agent whose perceived revisionist aims threaten US interests in the region. Influenced by what they assess as the return of great power competition, both administrations’ National Security Strategy (NSS) documents elaborated on the need to contain China and build a -balance of influence- favorable to the United States. Importantly, four areas of continuity can be observed across the two administrations’ strategies toward the region—trends that seem likely to sustain in a second Trump or Harris administration. The first policy continuity is countering the perceived regional military threat from China, especially toward Taiwan. When he took office in 2017, Donald Trump vowed to preserve US military superiority in Asia. His National Security Strategy (NSS) argued that American -advantages are shrinking as rival states modernize and augment their nuclear and conventional forces,- and—believing that military superiority is predicated on the ability to prevail in areas where the US is weakest relative to its adversary—placed a premium on denying Chinese military superiority around Taiwan. One presidential administration later, Joe Biden’s NSS strikes a similar tone, reaffirming the US would maintain its -capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion against Taiwan,- and adds in his National Defense Strategy (NDS) that the Defense Department’s first priority would be to develop anti-access/area-denial-insensitive strike capabilities. While traveling to Japan in 2022 to meet with Japanese, South Korean, and Australian leaders, Vice President Harris similarly noted that -peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is an essential feature of a free and open Indo-Pacific- and that the US -will continue to deepen our unofficial ties- with Taipei and -will continue to support Taiwan’s self-defense, consistent with our longstanding policy.- Both the Trump and Biden administrations emphasized the need to strengthen deterrence against China and North Korea by conducting military deployments, nuclear-capable bomber overflights, and joint exercises with allies. A second area of continuity has been the further strengthening of alliances. Sustaining a reliable alliance system has been a cornerstone of the US approach to the region for over seventy years. In their strategy documents, both the Trump and Biden administrations emphasized the importance of existing security alliances and expanded partnerships via the Quad and related frameworks. Admittedly, during his presidency, Trump was rhetorically more hostile toward the alliances with Japan and South Korea in particular, yet, like his successor, he underwrote actions to sustain those alliances and forge new regional partnerships in the face of mounting Chinese and North Korean pressures. The Biden Administration adopted and drove the Indo-Pacific Strategy further, complemented by strategic asset rotations to the Korean Peninsula and closer trilateral defense and deterrence cooperation with Japan and South Korea. A third area of continuity, underscored by similar language in both administrations’ national security documents, has been the commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Every president since Bill Clinton has, with varying degrees of effort, sought to negotiate constraints on North Korea’s nuclear activities, all under the rubric of denuclearization. The promise of inducements resulting from negotiations has been backed by -maximum pressure- campaigns to convince North Korean leaders to abandon their nuclear ambitions, a policy that continues under Biden and seems likely also to be a feature of a putative Harris administration’s future policy toward the Korean Peninsula. Trump departed from this strategy in form by holding summits and exchanging letters with Kim Jong Un, but not in substance. Finally, one additional area of continuity between Trump and Biden that does not have the same lineage yet is an increasingly prominent element of US strategy toward the region, is a sharp shift away from Sino-American economic interdependence. The turn toward economic protectionism predated Trump, but he accelerated it by implementing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were rapidly followed by additional tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports. The ensuing trade war set-off a process of partial economic de-coupling – or -de-risking- as the Biden administration has termed it. China-US trade fell by 14.5% between 2022 and the first half of 2023. Like Trump, Biden’s strategy documents all point to Chinese economic coercion and weaponization of interconnectivity as reasons for the US to strengthen its economic competitiveness and impose costs via tariffs, sanctions, and export controls. Harris has few antecedents on trade policy, but in her presidential debate with Trump in September 2024, she charged that Trump -sold us out on China- by -selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military,- and advocated for targeted restrictions, particularly on AI and quantum computing, coordinated with US allies. Consequences of Continuity For American foreign policy practitioners, these policies may seem like an anchor of stability in a turbulent geopolitical sea. However, policy continuity risks ignoring the ways in which the region itself is changing. It is important, therefore, to consider the negative externalities these policies help generate, which contribute to growing instability and escalation risks over the long run. If ignored, these accumulating risks could lead to catastrophic deterrence failures. First, defining Taiwan as the worst-case-stress test for US military planning has over time increased arms racing pressures and exacerbated crisis instability. Since China cannot match the US -ship for ship, tank for tank,- Beijing focuses on investing in capabilities that target US weaknesses, predominantly in anti-access/area denial (A2AD). To maintain deterrence based on military superiority feeds a perception in Washington that it must continually increase arms production to overcome the growth in Chinese capabilities. At the same time, the centrality of the Taiwan scenario to US military planning—coupled with arms sales to Taipei and rhetorical support perceived by Beijing as advancing Taiwanese independence—drives more bellicose and aggressive Chinese behavior. This further reinforces US perceptions that deterrence is failing and needs to be re-established via augmented forces and greater support for Taiwan. This vicious cycle is already highly escalatory on its own, but attempting to deny China area superiority around Taiwan also requires US military planners to target multiple locations in the Chinese mainland, where most of Beijing’s anti-access/area denial capabilities are based. Even if the US would not strike these capabilities directly to avoid escalation in a conflict, military planners might nevertheless be prompted to target Chinese dual-use command, control, communication, and intelligence assets as a way to blunt China’s A2AD. Given the probable entanglement of these systems with China’s nuclear arsenal, this strategy carries substantial risks of inadvertent nuclear escalation, over and above the costs of arms racing. Second, worst-case planning by both Washington and Beijing is part of another spiral driving increased prominence of nuclear deterrence in the region. China is currently engaged in a substantial build-up of its nuclear arsenal, seemingly motivated by concerns about the survivability of its nuclear second-strike capability against the combination of US missile defenses and precision conventional strike arms. China’s fears are exacerbated by Washington’s reluctance to acknowledge mutual nuclear vulnerability—a strategic reassurance that the US does not seek to undermine China’s nuclear deterrent. This is another feature of US policy continuity, partly due to domestic politics (not wanting to be branded as -weak- on China), and partly due to allies’ concerns that acknowledging mutual vulnerability could attenuate US extended deterrence. The combination of growing nuclear threats from China (and North Korea) compounds the stress on US extended deterrence commitments, driving South Korea and Japan to seek more and more visible US nuclear capability in the region. In turn, efforts by the United States and its allies to continually -strengthen- deterrence drive arms race perceptions in Beijing and Pyongyang. Meanwhile, the sustained commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as a policy objective and the coercive posturing to achieve it have, over time, driven North Korea to accelerate its nuclear and missiles programs and posture its nuclear weapons in more aggressive ways. Continuing to condition negotiations with North Korea on Pyongyang’s willingness to commit to the ultimate objective of denuclearization—as opposed to focusing instead on shorter-term risk reduction options—is therefore inadvertently increasing conflict escalation risks on the Korean Peninsula. In this sense, continuity in US policy toward North Korea is part of yet another perilous action-reaction cycle, in which North Korea’s growing nuclear arsenal and its ability to threaten the US homeland incentivizes American deterrence investments, especially in national and regional missile defense capabilities. North Korea and China—which also perceives US and allied missile defense as a threat—respond with further increases and improvements in capabilities to defeat US missile defenses, thus fueling arms racing in the region. Finally, the continuation of efforts to -de-risk- US-China trade could unintentionally become a conflict driver. For instance, US policies to prevent the export of computer chips to China necessary for artificial intelligence may provide the US with advantages in AI-enabled military capabilities for the foreseeable future. Before that advantage becomes highly significant, however, some analysts worry that China might decide to risk a military conflict before its relative power declines further. More broadly, this raises a question about whether economic decoupling increases or decreases the prospect of war. Many leaders in Asia have long believed that economic interdependence is a key to stability, even as that interdependence could be weaponized to damage their economies and is thought by some scholars to have enabled structural violence and corruption. Change The most significant and widely discussed potential source of disruption to US policy continuity—and the one of greatest concern to US allies—is the uncertainty and chaos that could result from a second Trump presidency. Indeed, the policy continuity during his first term described above probably held despite Trump, reflecting the efforts of his advisors and the national security bureaucracy to stymie major departures from established policies. By all accounts, Trump intends to overcome these obstacles in a second term, not least by forcing the departure of large numbers of government civil servants, including those whose jobs are to implement policy toward Asia. In this regard, change in a second Trump administration is likely to be driven less by national security principle, more by ego and personal instincts, while continuity could apply to issues that don’t come on his radar. This degree of uncertainty means that any current policy could be up for change, with wide ranging implications for the region. For example, Trump seems likely to sustain or even deepen a trade war with China—he has recently proposed a 60 percent tariff on goods from China—unless he believed that a modus vivendi with Xi Jinping would elevate him as a statesman or further enrich his family enterprises. Some of these changes could increase the chances of blundering into conflict, while others might actually mitigate risks; the point is the lack of certainty in contrast with the relative continuity of the past. Of all the potential changes to alliances under Trump, the most consequential would be a decision to withdraw from the region or any one allied country in particular, given the latent isolationist and protectionist tendencies he represents, as well as Trump’s record of capricious behavior. Some political commentators believe that in a second term Trump would be less restrained by -moderate- advisors and could more easily overcome bureaucratic resistance to such a major departure from US security practice. Trump’s views of alliances as protection rackets are relatively well understood. He argued in the past that the presence of US forces in the Korean Peninsula was -no guarantee we’ll have peace- and he asked what the US was -getting out- of stationing troops, aircraft, ships and bases in Japan. There is little evidence to indicate whether or not in a second term Trump would go so far as to actually disband the US alliance system in Asia, an act that would be in serious tension with the Indo-Pacific policies he pursued from 2017-2021. Perhaps a less extreme course might be a switch to an offshore balancing strategy, in which the US would refrain from deploying large forces abroad and instead encourage other countries to take the lead in checking a rising China. This strategy could provoke nuclear proliferation by Japan and/or South Korea, which Trump himself stated was only a question of time. Another plausible change in a second Trump administration—one with a bit more evidence behind it, fake news or otherwise—is a shift in US policy toward North Korea. Clearly, Trump has a fascination with Kim Jong Un and may well regret that he did not seal a nuclear deal at their Hanoi summit in 2019. Thus, it is imaginable that Trump could attempt to resurrect a deal: to accept the existence of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and to -buy down- the threat, with Pyongyang ceasing missile testing in return for sanctions relief or other aid. This approach could effectively end denuclearization policy as it has existed for the last three decades. It might have some salutary short-term effects in reducing the potential for conflict around the Korean Peninsula, but could also exacerbate long-term risks, especially regarding South Korea’s potential nuclearization. Finally, although US extended nuclear deterrence also aims to disincentivize Japan and South Korea from developing their own nuclear arsenals, the increasing prominence of nuclear weapons in the region is inadvertently creating constituencies for independent nuclear capabilities among US allies. Even if the next US administration sustains an alliance-centric policy, it is plausible that an ally might choose to pursue nuclear weapons. South Korea appears to be the most likely case. There, domestic politics and public opinion favorable to nuclear weapons, concern about North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilities, and fear of abandonment by the US create fertile ground for a proliferation decision. This trend exists even apart from the prospect of a second Trump administration, which some in South Korea would welcome in the belief that Trump would be more likely to tolerate proliferation by Seoul. For Washington, South Korean nuclearization would pose a sharp tension between its long-standing support for nonproliferation and its desire to sustain alliances. Risks of nuclear conflict on the Korean Peninsula would increase, especially during the early buildout of an ROK arsenal, when it would be at greatest risk to North Korean and/or Chinese pre-emption. There also could be effects well beyond the region if leaders in other states decided that they should follow the ROK example and seek nuclear weapons. Conclusion As the next administration takes office in January 2025, it will inherit policies toward the Indo-Pacific that have long tails. There are good reasons these policies have remained in place. There are also good reasons to re-assess the wisdom of sustaining them given the changes under way in the region. The next administration is not locked into an inevitable course. There are alternative choices it could explore to mitigate dangers exacerbated by continuity. Perpetuating a policy of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is one such choice. Arms competition with China is another. Instead, the next administration could pursue comprehensive risk reduction strategies toward both Beijing and Pyongyang. Though it would be costly (politically, diplomatically, and perhaps economically) to back away from continuity, the risks of not doing so in some instances may be greater. At the same time, radical change—an overt US shift to offshore balancing for instance—could result in a region at far greater risk of military conflict, even nuclear war.

Uiju Military Airfield Welcomes Back Bombers	North Korea’s Uiju Airfield is back in business. Commercial satellite imagery shows the return of 31 Ilyushin IL-28 medium-range bombers to the base, ending a three-and-a-half-year absence while the airfield served as a quarantine center for incoming goods from China. Their return rebalances North Korea’s bomber aircraft between bases on the east and west coasts after having them all based on the east coast during Uiju Airfield’s closure. It also represents another step in North Korea’s move back to pre-pandemic conditions. Quarantine Center Conversion of the airfield into a quarantine center began in March 2021, approximately a year after North Korea closed its borders to all travelers and most cargo. The quarantine center began operating in December 2021, when trains began to arrive, and containers began to populate the main runway. That continued into early 2024, but by April, the number of containers had decreased significantly. By August, all had been removed, and the restoration of the airfield had begun. Also in early 2024, quarantine warehouses were periodically dismantled. On September 22, the paint marking began on the runway while work to restore other areas of the airfield continued in anticipation of the regiment’s return. In order support the temporary quarantine mission of the airfield, in the first half of 2021, the IL-28 regiment deployed to airbases on the country’s east coast—Changjin, home to another squadron of IL-28, and Sondok, a transport aircraft facility home to Antonov AN-2s. Return of the Bombers On imagery from October 4, five of the aircraft were observed on the southeast alert apron, 16 were on the northeast apron, and nine were located at the far eastern apron queued in front of one of two aircraft storage tunnels at the base. The last of the IL-28s never departed the airfield, likely because it was not flight worthy. It has been parked in one of a series of revetments along a service road south of the aircraft tunnels. Two of the other revetments along the road hold 12 and eight MIG-21 aircraft, respectively, all of which had been stored in the revetments throughout the conversion period. The bombers, which are also referred to as Harbin B-5, belong to the nation’s 24th Bomber Regiment.

What’s Up with North Korea’s Skyrocketing Exchange Rates?	In recent months, foreign exchange rates in North Korea have surged in ways that intuitively make little sense. The Korean People’s won (KPW), the country’s domestic currency, now trades at 16,100 to the dollar in Pyongyang—the highest recorded rate since Daily NK began tracking it in 2009. This marks a 92 percent increase over the past year, and a nearly 90 percent increase in just six months. The Chinese renminbi (RMB) rate has also increased, but less sharply, by 35 percent in the past six months. How can we explain this seemingly strange puzzle? Several factors appear to be at play. One is the reopening of trade after the pandemic, although current trade levels do not fully account for the sharp rise in exchange rates. North Korea’s trade with China, its largest trading partner by far, has only recently begun to recover, reaching 82 percent of pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Another factor may be Kim Jong Un’s -20&#215;10 Policy,- which aims to build modern factories in 20 rural cities and counties each year for the next ten years, requiring substantial imports of industrial goods. Increased trade with Russia could also be contributing, although it is unclear how much of North Korea’s arms exports are paid in cash versus in-kind with other goods. Even when combined, these factors do not fully explain the scale of the exchange rate rise. The most significant factors seem to be human psychology and market expectations. Expectations play a crucial role in setting exchange rates: if people anticipate the domestic currency will lose value, they tend to shift their holdings to foreign currency, and vice versa. In this case, expectations of a broader reopening of trade have likely fueled much of the KPW’s depreciation. When the market anticipates increased trade, more foreign currency is needed to pay for imports, causing the KPW to lose value. Ironically, government policies aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate closer to the official level seem to be having the opposite effect. Authorities recently issued a sternly-worded directive instructing everyone to work to stabilize exchange rates. The document blames -unfounded rumors- and unrealistic expectations for driving up rates and calls for the -eradication- of foreign currency hoarding. Predictably, it also mandates that all individuals and workplaces adhere strictly to the official exchange rate, while blaming black market currency traders operating outside state control. The problem for the government is that its official exchange rate of 8,900 KPW to the dollar is wildly unrealistic, set at about 50 percent of the -real- black market rate of 16,100 KPW . This discrepancy inevitably encourages continued trading at the much higher black market rate, given the opportunities for arbitrage. In response, the state has ramped up its crackdown on illegal money changers, ordering the confiscation of goods and cash from anyone caught trading foreign currency at rates above the official level. These measures only heighten market anxiety, prompting more people to hoard foreign currency, which in turn pushes the rate higher as expectations grow that the crackdown will make dollars even more scarce. The recent history of exchange rate fluctuations also suggests that the state’s repressive measures might be adding fuel to the fire. Exchange rates dropped sharply during COVID-19 border closures, and the North Korean won against both the dollar and renminbi as trade with China picked up in early 2023. Political signals at the time also hinted that trade with Russia could increase. Much of the stability then was likely due to state-driven monetary policy, with the government possibly limiting the supply of KPW to keep rates stable. An influx of foreign currency from increased trade may have also played a role. However, the state’s ability to control monetary policy is limited. Its reserves of foreign currency are small and tightly controlled, and a strict monetary policy could lead to reduced consumer spending and even deflation. Over time, exchange rates are likely to stabilize. As the market’s expectations of sharply increased trade fail to materialize, demand for foreign currency among firms and individuals will likely decrease. However, if the state’s aggressive crackdown on illegal currency exchange continues, hoarding could persist regardless of actual economic conditions. Only time will tell, but it is clear that the state has relatively few realistic tools at its disposal.

Sohae Satellite Launching Station: Modernization Efforts Continue Apace	Commercial satellite imagery reveals modernization efforts at North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station have steadily progressed since the failed launch of a Malligyong-1-1 reconnaissance satellite in May 2024. As part of Kim Jong Un’s instructions to expand and modernize the facility, several construction projects—such as a new horizontal assembly building and rail spur connecting the site’s entrance to the coastal roadway—continue to progress. While the site appears to remain ready for future tests, no signs point to an imminent launch. New Assembly Building The new probable assembly building appears ready for the installation of roof trusses. A crane with extendable arm is visible inside of the structure on imagery from September 23. Additionally, three trusses are visible on the ground alongside the building. Around the outside of the building, large, concrete slabs are being laid and the new road, extended from the east end of the building connecting to the west tunnel entrance, now meets the wider road. Towards the entrance of the site, just north of the rail transfer station, work on a new rail spur is progressing and dirt is being deposited in what will become the bed of the new tracks. The preparation work indicates the new spur will run from a point north of the transfer building, likely bypassing the new assembly building and heading towards the tunnel. This could explain the widening work taking place on the road between the new assembly building and the west tunnel entrance. Six empty ore cars, having deposited their loads, are located where the work to build up the railroad base is ongoing. Another six ore cars with a locomotive, and full of aggregate, are queued 1.2 kilometers northeast of the complex, waiting their turn to deposit their content. Tunnel Area West Tunnel Area At the west tunnel, an unidentified object—possibly related to construction— is observed inside the tunnel on imagery from September 23. Several arch trusses are seen in the nearby area, indicating that this new rectangular opening will likely be covered with a roof. However, the nearby roof trusses are too short to span the existing opening. It is possible each truss is half of a piece that will be connected by a ridge beam in the center. East Tunnel Area Construction has slowed at the east tunnel entrance. Some digging activity near the entrance was observed on imagery from September 2024. Major work at this entrance may be complete, save for finishing cosmetic touches. Coastal Launch Pad No observable activity has occurred at the coastal launch pad. Ahead of the May 27 satellite launch attempt, two roadside revetments were constructed at the entrance to the coastal launch pad and covered in camouflage netting. The netting—initially used to conceal support vehicles parked in the area—was removed between July 19 and August 8. Two trucks are present at the revetments on imagery from September 23, possibly related to road work in the area. Just south of the costal launch pad is an area containing support buildings constructed in the spring of 2023. At this location, in support of the last launch, a structure was erected to cover the presence of launch support vans with camouflage. Imagery from September 23 reveals no vehicles or vans to be present, but the netting remains in place. Main Launch Pad The main launch pad remains quiet. Work appears to have resumed on one of the nearby fuel/oxidizer bunkers. However, no significant progress has been made and vegetation has grown within one of the building’s footprints. Engine Test Stand Area At the Vertical Engine Test Stand (VETS), the guides in place for moving the retractable shelter appear to have been replaced. On imagery from late June, bulk construction material and a truck were present on the ramp to the VETS. By July 19, the guides had been replaced. No other major activity has been observed over monsoon season at the engine test stand area. Tracking Station Imagery from September 23 shows the mountaintop launch tracking station, located just west of the engine test stand area, has been augmented with a new structure on its roof. The structure appeared in early July. It is likely this structure will house tracking-related equipment. One vehicle is present, possibly a passenger van often observed at the site. Seaport Activity continues at the seaport. The new coastal road is now being extended through the small village to the port area. Dump trucks continue to deposit dirt and move concrete blocks in efforts to extend the jetty out into the sea. Given the large tides in the area, this work suggests the jetty could become a long, wide pier into deeper water, where cargo can be more easily unloaded regardless of the tidal pattern. At the sea’s edge, large concrete blocks continue to be placed at what will likely be the main quay area of the port.

Prospects for Health Cooperation: Changing Health Priorities for the Democratic People’s Republic of...	Four years after the World Health Organization (WHO) officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic, humanitarian engagement in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) has yet to fully return to pre-pandemic normalcy. Offers of aid from China, Russia and South Korea following the most recent devastating floods in the northwestern part of the country, and subsequent rejections from the DPRK, highlight the ongoing challenges North Korea faces in balancing its autonomy with the need for external assistance. Although there have been significant steps toward reopening its borders in the last month, such as allowing tourists from Russia and inviting Swedish diplomats back to the country’s embassy, progress in resuming humanitarian work by international nonprofits has remained slow and fragmented. Given this context, a thorough, up-to-date understanding of what health issues the DPRK considers to be the domains of highest priority is crucial. Based on our review of its previous medium-term strategic plans and the evolving trends in the country’s national health priorities, this analysis outlines the most critical areas in health likely to be emphasized in the forthcoming edition of the WHO and DPRK’s Country Cooperation Strategy (CCS). North Korea’s health system strengthening strategy is expected to focus on several key areas, including communicable disease control, technological advancements and modernization, maternal and child health, the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, and ecological health impacts. Bolstering these efforts will be vital for improving the country’s health outcomes and resilience. Renewed Emphasis of Communicable Diseases Control The health needs of the North Korean people have undergone significant changes over the years, driven by various internal and external factors. Although the DPRK has historically prioritized preventive measures to safeguard public health, the pandemic has highlighted limitations in its infrastructure. While North Korea had a seemingly successful response to COVID-19, the next pandemic could arise with a higher transmission rate, increased resistance to treatments, or any other unpredicted challenges. At a time when the WHO has just declared that the upsurge of mpox constitutes a public health emergency of international concern, it is imperative that North Korea glean lessons from the pandemic to reinforce its healthcare systems. To address the vulnerabilities exposed by COVID-19, the DPRK is expected to focus on several areas to enhance its health system concerning communicable disease control. According to the -DPRK’s Voluntary National Review on the Implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,- published in 2021, one of North Korea’s standing strategic priorities is to reinforce its hygiene and anti-epidemic sectors. The limitations in diagnostic capacity were demonstrated by North Korea’s practice of using fever cases as proxy indicators for outbreaks due to its lack of PCR testing capabilities. Through a sanctions exemption granted to the WHO until August 2025, North Korea is projected to expand its essential laboratory capacity with additional equipment supplies. A health system’s efficacy is judged not just by its ability to detect diseases, but also to treat them promptly. This involves the availability of PPEs like masks as well as oxygen supply, antibiotics and other essential medical supplies. According to Chinese customs data, North Korea purchased approximately $45 million in pharmaceuticals alone in 2022 with no signs of slowing down. It has been estimated that at least 150 invasive ventilators were imported that same year, which far exceeds the number needed just in Pyongyang. This suggests that the DPRK is keen to equip not just the capital, but also all of its provincial hospitals with the capability to respond in the case of a serious disease outbreak. North Korea’s latest vaccination campaign, launched following UNICEF’s delivery of over 4 million vaccine doses earlier this year, marks a substantial effort by its government to address the significant gaps in immunization rates, which fell from 96 percent to below 42 percent during the pandemic. Low immunization coverage not only makes the North Korean population vulnerable to vaccine-preventable diseases, but also carries serious implications for global health security. The United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), Gavi and the WHO should ensure that vaccine supplies are accompanied by essential field assistance for effective deployment, a capability historically demonstrated by North Korea through the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH. Sustained efforts should also go toward combating other diseases of high burden, such as tuberculosis (TB) and hepatitis. However, previously established programs, including those run by the Eugene Bell Foundation and Christian Friends of Korea (CFK), are presently on hold due to geopolitics—US-based NGOs are not being invited back into the country at this moment. Furthermore, the DPRK should not neglect the elimination of malaria and maintain its said HIV-free status. Integrating Technological Advancements for Strengthening Robust Health Systems As the DPRK seeks to modernize its healthcare system, it must continue to build its capabilities in epidemiological research, especially given the limited number of domestic programs and peer-reviewed journals that currently exist in the country. Strengthening the control of communicable diseases in North Korea should be carried out in tandem with the building of epidemiological capacity that balances both investigative and emergency response efforts. While North Korea officially has a universal health coverage policy, the ground reality suggests that the quality of access to treatments and health facilities varies considerably. Integrating the latest technological advancements across all channels of a health system can help overcome this limitation. Telemedicine provides an excellent avenue for extending healthcare services to remote areas. It also allows for virtual training with international experts, offering an alternative to external aid and fostering -self-reliance,- an important theme for the North Korean leadership. Technological improvements extend to enhancing the quality of more specialized medical care, including surgical procedures, which can greatly benefit from the import of advanced imaging. Concurrently, North Korea must improve the health literacy of its general population. Citizens should not only be aware of the availability of services, but also how to access and utilize these services effectively. North Korea’s existing section doctor system, where physicians are assigned to specific geographic regions or communities, provides a robust framework for healthcare delivery that could integrate digital record-keeping and systematic knowledge dissemination. Strengthening leadership, management, and human resource capacities are additional steps toward making the healthcare system more robust and self-sustaining. Moreover, the DPRK has a rich history of Koryo traditional medicine, which could be integrated more seamlessly into the modern healthcare system. This would require research documentation as well as the implementation of standard treatment protocols. Continued Prioritization of Maternal, Newborn and Child Health North Korea has made notable strides in reducing both maternal and infant mortality rates in recent years. The South Korea-funded maternal and child health project, led in collaboration with the WHO and UNICEF from 2006 to 2015, carried a budget of $65 million. This remains the largest international health cooperation project implemented in North Korea. While the achievements from those years of targeted interventions can be seen as successful, the goal to continue improving other indicators, such as the prevalence of wasting in children under five years of age, should not be neglected. Chronic malnutrition has long-term impacts on a child’s cognitive and physical development and remains a key metric in evaluating the success of child healthcare programs. Comprehensively addressing reproductive health and nutrition is vital for the well-being of mothers and children. There is a continued need for more extensive services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, and nutritional guidance for pregnant and lactating mothers. Such services would be of interest to North Korea now more than ever, whose leader expressed concern about its population decline last year. With the DPRK joining the Executive Board of the WHO in 2023, we would likely see the DPRK pay more attention to the implementation of the World Health Assembly (WHA). Leaders are expected to set a good example. Specifically, with international partners and funding, the DPRK may choose to implement the recommendations to fortify with micronutrients like folic acid to prevent neural tube defects, as recommended by WHA resolution 76.19. Focused Measures Toward Addressing Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) As North Korea takes significant steps toward improving its overall healthcare, the epidemiological landscape has also naturally shifted toward non-communicable diseases (NCDs). According to the WHO’s NCD 2018 Country Profiles, NCDs account for 84 percent of deaths in North Korea. Effective management of NCDs requires a population-level approach that extends beyond merely treating individuals who are already affected. Preventive measures, including innovative lifestyle modification campaigns and early screening programs, need to be implemented. To strengthen chronic disease management in the long term, North Korea can benefit from adopting and tailoring global strategies that incorporate diverse perspectives on complex health issues, such as the WHO’s Intersectoral Global Action Plan on Epilepsy and Other Neurological Conditions. Early efforts to identify unmet surgical needs in North Korea to minimize disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) will significantly improve future health outcomes at the population level. Lastly, cancers are a significant subset of NCDs that require complex policy interventions, whether it be the incidence of lung cancer associated with smoking or hematological malignancies with a more genetic basis to its cause. The DPRK is already a signatory of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. In addition to strengthening diagnosis and treatment options, it is equally important to build capacity for palliative care. Public awareness campaigns about the risk factors and palliative support associated with cancers can contribute to early diagnosis and improved quality of life outcomes. Climate Resilience and Environmental Determinants of Health The DPRK has shown a commitment to tackling climate change, evidenced by its membership in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and active diplomatic participation in international forums, including the 28th Conference of the Parties (COP28) in 2023. North Korean State media often highlights environmental concerns such as deforestation and natural disasters affecting crop production, in addition to spotlighting global issues. Their official communication on the 2016 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) makes it clear that North Korea recognizes the cross-cutting importance of climate resilience, which, in turn, also affects the country’s public health landscape. A 2022 UN report stated that undernourishment among North Korea’s population of 25 million reached 41.6 percent from 2019 to 2021 compared to 33.8 percent from 2004 to 2006. Its frequent exposure to typhoons, flooding, and droughts compounds existing vulnerabilities in its healthcare system. For instance, in 2020 alone, the country experienced five major typhoons within a span of a few weeks, causing widespread damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, roads, and water systems, and displacing thousands of citizens. These events pose an imminent threat beyond just access to clean water and food security by increasing the risk of waterborne diseases, injuries, and long-term mental health burdens. North Korea needs to integrate these environmental factors into its broader healthcare strategy, implementing resilience measures through improved water irrigation systems, sustainable agriculture, and food distribution networks that can withstand the volatility of a changing climate. Existing protocols for implementing the One Health approach, incorporating veterinary considerations, can guide the reduction of disease spillover risks from animals to humans. Building Trust Through Health Cooperation Given North Korea’s current position of refusing external aid, health cooperation based on fundamental humanitarian principles can serve as a non-contentious entry point for broader engagement with the DPRK. However, this should occur within a framework that ensures multi-year programming is protected from disruptions by political motivations. A comprehensive health system strengthening approach that includes workforce training, infrastructure improvement, and technology transfer for vaccine development facilitated through neutral entities, such as the WHO vaccine hub, if taken in an enduring manner, could help build trust between North Korea and the international community while improving the lives of ordinary North Koreans. Conclusion With the COVID-19 pandemic now seemingly long behind us, North Korea stands at a critical juncture for making decisions on how it will allocate resources toward advancing its health system. Given the interconnected nature of global health, it is imperative for the international community to build cooperative measures, not only in areas of mutual interest, including disease control and climate resilience, but also for improving fundamental indicators of quality of life, such as maternal and child health. The Country Cooperation Strategy (CCS), together with the WHO, should provide a clear sense of direction to encourage sustainable long-term efforts in the years to come.

Pyongyang’s New Frame	Pyongyang continues to alter how it frames the international security landscape, increasingly portraying itself as part of a larger collection of countries standing against the United States (US). Rather than suggest it is facing the US alone, it is painting itself as part of a group of -independent sovereign states- being threatened. Recently it has refined that image further, and suggested the next step will be formation of a -just strategic axis- to redress what it calls an -imbalance- of forces on the Peninsula and in the region created by new US-led defense alignments in the Indo-Pacific. This framing has policy implications on several levels. Internally, it may be meant to reassure the domestic audience that the North will not be alone in the event of a confrontation with the US. Externally, Pyongyang may anticipate that grouping itself with -independent sovereign states- will be useful in providing cover—however thin—for any action it takes, blunting US efforts to gather a broad anti-DPRK coalition in event of a crisis. While the new term -just strategic axis- may be largely propaganda-speak, the concept of a broader, more concrete security alignment may be the next step in Pyongyang’s more aggressive stance on the Peninsula. The term first appeared in a press statement issued by the Foreign Ministry’s Institute for Disarmament and Peace on September 13, the same day Sergei Shoigu, Secretary of the Russian Security Council, arrived in Pyongyang. That raises the possibility that enhanced DPRK-Russia military cooperation may have been a topic during the visit. The term appeared again in a long article on September 14 (the day Shoigu departed), by one of the North’s -international analysts- criticizing AUKUS and warning of other moves by the US to fashion a new security architecture in the Indo-Pacific. Shoigu, who flew directly from St. Petersburg, where Russian President Putin had just warned of a tough response if the US and NATO approved Ukrainian use of their weapons for deep strikes into Russia, could have been prepared to discuss with Kim what Putin meant and how the North fit in. On the ground in Pyongyang for only 13 hours, Shoigu had two meetings with Kim Jong Un. To demonstrate how well the meetings went and the strength of Pyongyang’s ties with Moscow, Kim broke with protocol and personally saw Shoigu off at the airport. Less than a week after Shoigu’s visit, there was an odd ballet of official Russian aircraft flying between Khabarovsk (Kh), Vladivostok (Vv), and North Korea.1 On September 19, a Special Flight Squadron (SFS) plane and a Russian Air Force IL 62 landed in Vladivostok within minutes of each other. Later the same day, the SFS plane flew to somewhere on the North’s east coast, returned to Vv a few hours later, then left for Novosibirsk. Within a short time the Air Force plane took off for Pyongyang, stayed on the ground only about an hour before flying directly to Kh; the following day (September 21) the Air Force plane flew back to Vv, remained there until 22 September, returned briefly to Kh, then flew directly to Pyongyang where it was on the ground for about two hours before returning to Vv for a brief stop before taking off near dawn on 23 September for an airport outside of Moscow. (AF IL 62 itinerary 19-23 September): Moscow-Vv-Py-Kh-Vv-Kh-Py-Vv-Moscow Precisely what those flights were supporting or delivering is unknown, but their unusual itineraries, their proximity to the Shoigu visit, and the appearance of the new North Korean language on a -just strategic axis- suggest that they were connected in whole or in part with developments in Russian-DPRK military ties. All along, in addition to stronger diplomatic backing, Kim has undoubtedly been expecting Russian support in terms of military technology and hardware. With the possibility of another round of escalation in the Ukraine war, Kim may have decided the time is ripe to push Putin to see that it is in Russia’s interest for North Korean action that will distract the US and interfere with ROK supplies of armaments that find their way to support for Ukraine Pyongyang may hope to see a -strategic axis- that includes both Russia and China one day, however that isn’t the case right now.
