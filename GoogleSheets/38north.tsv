Quick Take: Pyongyang’s Subdued Coverage of South Korea’s Post-Martial Law Situation	How does North Korea feel about South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s enactment of martial law and the fallout, including the National Assembly’s vote to impeach Yoon? The North’s reaction to the ongoing South Korean political turmoil has been subdued. Notably, it remains silent on reports that the former South Korean defense minister sent drones into Pyongyang in October in an attempt to start a limited conflict with North Korea and lay the groundwork for martial law enactment. North Korea seems to be in an escalation prevention mode for now, probably because of its focus on maximizing economic production by the end of the year, and its continued supply of military resources to Russia. The party plenary meeting at the end of this month and the next Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) session, slated for late January, may lend more insight into Kim Jong Un’s next steps on foreign policy and policy toward Seoul. Subdued Media Coverage Pyongyang’s initial reaction to Yoon’s declaration of martial law eight days after the fact was slower than one would have expected. North Korean media, since May 2023, have regularly reported on anti-Yoon protests in South Korea—even after Kim Jong Un in late 2023 and early 2024 renounced a decades-old policy of peaceful unification and defined South Korea as a -foreign country.-[2] The two-day lag between the National Assembly’s passage of the impeachment bill and North Korea’s reaction also was slightly longer than the one-day interval in December 2016, when the National Assembly voted to impeach then-President Park Geun-hye. As of December 18, North Korea has carried only three news reports—low in the hierarchy of North Korean propaganda vehicles—since its initial reaction to Yoon’s martial law enactment. Such sparse coverage also is inconsistent with North Korean media’s regular reporting since May 2023 on anti-Yoon protests in the South.[3] Worth noting is that North Korea has not reacted to the former South Korean defense minister’s reported attempt to draw North Korea into a limited conflict by sending drones into Pyongyang and justify martial law.[4] The North’s silence on this issue is uncharacteristic. It tends to issue official statements or media commentaries on South Korea over issues that concern North Korea. It was in this vein that it issued a flurry of official statements in October alleging South Korean drones had violated Pyongyang airspace. Preventing Escalation The reasons for North Korea’s low-key handling of the political situation in South Korea are unclear. It may be waiting to see how events unfold, is undecided on what to say, or looking for the right moment to release a stronger response. The definition of South Korea as a separate country under Kim’s new two Koreas policy could be a factor. Yet, it would not fully explain this behavior, as North Korea has diligently reported on Yoon’s political challenges up until his martial law enactment. Keying in on its silence on South Korean media reports about the drone incursions, it appears that North Korea wants to prevent escalation. It has been supplying weapons and troops to Russia. Moreover, the overriding theme in North Korean propaganda these days is the economy. The country needs to maximize economic output before Kim reviews the year’s achievements in his report to the annual year-end party plenary meeting later this month. All in all, North Korea is seeking stability at the moment. Escalation prevention would be consistent with North Korea’s measured response to the drones’ violation of Pyongyang airspace in October. It issued some official statements, Kim convened a meeting of top defense and security officials, and there were some angry reactions from the public. North Korea, however, quickly shifted its focus to the economy instead of escalating tensions, which it easily could have justified. This occurred around the time North Korea reportedly dispatched troops to Russia, which probably explains its restraint. Although North Korea seems uninterested in escalating tensions for now—and during Park’s impeachment between December 2016 and March 2017, it did not engage in any notable military activities that heightened tensions—its calculus could change if the political turmoil in South Korea becomes protracted. Unlike in 2016, North Korea has no desire to improve relations with the United States at the expense of its nuclear programs; it has defined South Korea as a -hostile state- separate from North Korea, and it has a new treaty with Russia. The upcoming party plenary meeting and the SPA session in late January may provide more clues about Kim’s next moves. North Korea announced that it will revise -some provisions- of the constitution at the next SPA session. It made amendments to this legal document in October, but details remain largely unknown. It is possible that the upcoming SPA session may make constitutional revisions with implications for inter-Korean relations.

Yoon’s Political Implosion: Making Pyongyang’s Day	The pantomime that has been South Korean politics for the past fortnight has brought swift smiles to the lips of both Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin. For Kim, in particular, this is the perfect gift and validates the strategic choices made in his last New Year’s Address. The South may outgun the North by a factor of ten and more, but the fiasco that was an on-off martial law declaration merely made public that the South’s military leadership is ill-disciplined, insubordinate and confused, and the dithering of Seoul’s governing party was worse. What’s not to like in Pyongyang? The North’s much lauded secret weapon, ‘single minded unity,’ has never looked more powerful in the face of Seoul’s indecision and incompetence. This did not just happen overnight. Recent reports reveal early stages of this plan have been in play for several months as Yoon tried to hide his domestic woes by raising tensions on the Peninsula. This includes the provocative use of the South’s drones to spread propaganda leaflets in Kim Il Sung Square. When that did not elicit a military response, Yoon ordered the South’s military to fire on the sites of the North’s ‘trash’ balloons launches, directions that were apparently refused. The term ‘leaderless resistance’ is normally applied to the tactics of terrorist groups fearful of infiltration by the state. In Seoul, the term is stood on its head with a state structure inchoate and incompetent. Now with the National Assembly, at the second time of asking, voting for impeachment, the South’s decision making goes into limbo for up to 180 days as the Constitutional Court ponders the legitimacy of the vote. All this makes Kim’s day as it confirms his strategic pivot while comprehensively sidelining Seoul in any future talks with Trump. The Backstory After the car-crash in Hanoi in 2019, Kim Jong Un abandoned the family’s forty-year-long venture to normalize relations with Washington. Across four decades—after the fall of the Soviet Union—American presidents proved immune to any deal, but in 2017, Trump seemed different. Gently coaxed by Pyongyang’s foreign affairs establishment, Ri Su Yong in the International Department of the Party and Ri Yong Ho in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kim was convinced a deal was possible that would see cross-recognition under the protective covering of punctuated progress over a decade and more of slow step-by-step initial freezing and incremental backtracking of the North’s nuclear program. But 2017 turned out to be a false dawn. Kim viewed the failure of the 2019 Hanoi Summit as the Republican establishment encircling Trump sabotaging the process and preventing the conclusion of any deal. Concluding Washington’s willing were unable to make meaningful changes, Kim purged the doves within his regime in favor of hawks and began to change the course of the country’s external affairs. Subsequent global events reinforced Kim’s view of the world and shifting power dynamics. The chaotic US retreat from Afghanistan demonstrated the vulnerability of American military might to the wrong warfare, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed spineless decision makers among Ukraine’s partners, and Israel’s devastation of Gaza proved that Washington’s allies could now slip the leash. Mixed Messages for Kim No longer the only game in town, Kim saw Washington’s loss of control and reaction to China’s challenge as the opening encounters in a second Cold War—a lens through which Kim Jong Un now views the world. The crass and chaotic failed coup d’état by President Yoon in Seoul confirms his analysis and strengthens his hand. Yet there are spots on the sun. First, Kim needs to massage and spin the events in Seoul for the readers of Rodong Sinmun. Pyongyang has never been enthusiastic over advertising the world’s color revolutions; wary the North’s own citizens might be infected with similar gaudy ideas. Here and now it is possibly worse. Kim started the year designating the South as the -most hostile state-. It replaced the previous portrayal of the South Korean citizenry as misguided and misled, intimidated under the thrall of Washington and its domestic dupes with a picture of monochrome malevolence. But the fierce resistance to martial law and overwhelming outcry for impeachment over the last two weeks is clearly at odds with Kim’s propaganda created to help sell why unification should be abandoned. As second challenge is the ouster of Assad from Syria. The Assad regime had been a Russian proxy propped up by Moscow and Tehran. Its house of cards collapse suggests a fragility to that support and an inability and/or unwillingness for Moscow to fight a two-front war, even in the long shadow of a threatened Trump-inspired ceasefire in Ukraine. It must strike Kim that were the Peninsula’s mutual provocations to turn to skirmishes and threaten escalation to war, like in 1950, Russian engagement could turn out to be coaching from the sidelines with the heavy lifting of mutual assistance sub-contracted to Beijing, which is likely to limit help to the minimum for survival, far short of the resources for victory. Conclusion Despite domestic disturbances, semi-insurrections and coups in South Korea, North Korea has never seized these opportunities to renew civil war. Nevertheless, Yoon’s failed attempt to consolidate power will give Kim confidence to continue on his chosen path of joining what decades ago Jimmy Carter’s National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski called the nightmare coalition for the US of China, Russia and Iran. The North’s chilly relations with Beijing are likely to become more tepid, while Pyongyang, Moscow and Beijing will all welcome and be grateful for the postponement and cancellations in Seoul’s further integration into NATO, the Quad+ or any kind of East Asian Security framework, and the early prospects of a progressive presidency in the South.

Sinpho South Shipyard: The Sinpo-C SSB Repositioned in Drydock During Extended Stay	Recent commercial satellite imagery of North Korea’s Sinpho South Shipyard reveals that the newest ballistic missile class submarine (SSB), the Sinpo-C (also called the Hero Kim Kun Ok), has been repositioned to the front of the drydock—immediately adjacent to the inflow gate—and covered by a protective structure. While the exact reason for this movement is unclear, the activity suggests the vessel will continue to remain in the drydock for an extended fitting-out period. The Drydock The Sinpo-C class SSB—unveiled in early September 2023—was immediately moved into the shipyard’s secure boat basin after its launch, sharing the basin with North Korea’s first SSB, the experimental Sinpo-B, Gorae. It remained under the protective awning in the basin, away from view. The Sinpo-C was moved into the drydock in mid-May 2024, positioned at the dock’s north end. From May 18 through July 8, a portal jib was seen actively working over the submarine. However, by July 19, the vessel had been shielded from view by a protective covering, either to obscure view of the ongoing work or to protect workers from the elements. On imagery from December 1, the Sinpo-C and its protective covering had moved to the south end of the drydock, close to the inflow gate. It is unclear when exactly this movement took place between November 12 and December 1. Other activity around the drydock includes the refurbishment of the inflow gate control building—which has been ongoing since late October 2024—and the installation of 30 posts along the west wall of the drydock, whose purpose may be used for the installation of a covering across the entire width of the drydock. It remains to be seen how long the Sinpo-C remains berthed at the south end of the drydock. It is possible the movement is temporary, allowing for the construction of a more secure base structure towards the back of the drydock. Regardless of the purpose, the submarine’s movement within the drydock—and not its removal—suggests that the vessel will remain in the drydock in the near term. On imagery from December 6—again on December 12—the drydock was partially filled with water, covering portions of the concealment apparatus. It is unclear whether this was intentional flooding of the dock or a mechanical issue with the gate. Construction Hall Materials Staging Area Imagery from December 6 also reveals new submarine hull components in the materials staging area, each measuring eight meters in diameter. Components such as these were also reported on imagery from April 27, 2024, indicating ongoing construction of a new submarine in the same class as the Hero Kim Kun Ok SSB. L-Shaped Pier Imagery from early December also indicates construction work continues to extend the L-shaped pier located at the western end of the shipyard.

Using Forecasting Methodologies to Look to the Future of the North Korean Nuclear Program	How can we improve our understanding of the future of the North Korean nuclear program? By using a methodology known as forecasting, we may be able to identify the most likely trajectories that nuclear programs may follow. Forecasting is an analytical skill that can be learned and improved upon; it requires forecasters to provide precise statistical boundaries on the chance of clearly defined future events.[1] As a predictive technique, forecasting has been embraced by sectors ranging from financial institutions to the US intelligence community, and it may be a useful addition to the analytical toolbox of North Korea watchers. It can help to address uncertainties regarding future developments by breaking them apart and interrogating underlying assumptions. In fact, this methodology has already been applied to better understand the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK or North Korea) nuclear program, a particularly difficult challenge for conventional analysis due to the opacity of information. In February 2024, the Open Nuclear Network (ONN), the Verification Research, Training and Information Centre (VERTIC), and the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS) held a workshop to forecast North Korean nuclear futures with the help of the Swift Centre, a team of forecasting facilitators founded by a former director at the Good Judgement Project. VERTIC Researcher Hailey Wingo interviewed the organizers, Dr. Grant Christopher (Co-Director of the Verification and Monitoring Program, VERTIC), and Sarah Laderman (Senior Analyst, ONN) to extract their insights from running this workshop on whether forecasting is a useful tool for the North Korea watcher community. Hailey Wingo (HW): What is forecasting, and how could it be relevant for the DPRK watcher community? Grant Christopher (GC): Forecasting is usually explained as the -wisdom of the crowd-: how an analytical and open-minded group can outperform subject-matter experts when predicting things. A classic example of the wisdom of crowds is the fairground game guessing the number of jellybeans in a jar, where averaging over the guesses of many participants can get close to the real answer (with potentially a complete absence of volumetric experts). For forecasting complex political and technical questions, forecasters, and in particular a well-structured forecasting team, can be shown to outperform subject-matter experts on predictions for complex questions. We should be skeptical that forecasting can improve on expert analysis in every instance. On the other hand, we should understand why and under which circumstances it could add value. Experts have a more detailed understanding of the dynamics, history and underlying factors of a subject than forecasters, and expert analyses can be crucial inputs for successful forecasting. However, experts may also have a predetermined belief, based on their expertise and a theoretical structure, on how the future will unfold and even a thesis they wish to defend against alternatives. Successful forecasters should not be wedded to a school of thought and should be prepared to update their forecasts when new data is available. In addition, a team of forecasters can improve over that of an individual by interrogating the underlying reasoning. Accurate forecasting requires good data produced by expert analysis, and it is not entirely auditable—forecasters can provide explanations and reasoning, but wisdom of the crowd-type predictions do not allow averaging of reasoning. Sarah Laderman (SL): Forecasting, when combined with other analytical methods, is a powerful tool that can be used to think about a number of challenging issue areas. As there is comparatively little reliable information in open sources about how North Korea structures its nuclear program, it is especially useful in order to generate new, insightful analysis and approach the dearth of information from a new viewpoint. By thinking about problems from different angles and questioning assumptions and baseline knowledge, we can better understand different potential futures and their consequences. While forecasting is not a methodological panacea, it is an extremely effective tool to force some of these discussions that experts do not typically have regarding the assumptions and logic behind their analyses. Further, it can provide a new way of looking at the same data. This field suffers from a lack of new information, so analysts need to be creative in their thinking in order to not fall into bias traps. GC: Forecasting is not a silver bullet for predicting how the situation on the Korean Peninsula will unfold in the next few decades or the role of the nuclear program. However, it is a helpful tool when participants have a clear sense of both the purpose of forecasting and its limitations and can provide valuable insights. Forecasting must be structured using answerable questions related to a fixed date; it is good for questions like -Will North Korea conduct another nuclear test before March 2025?- but cannot directly address questions such as -What will be the role of the WMD nuclear program in 2035?- In the latter case, forecasting could develop scenarios to understand the context for decisions about the nuclear program. HW: What does pursuing a forecasting process look like, and what are possible starting points for analysis? GC: As we said, forecasting cannot directly address complex questions, such as how the North Korean nuclear program will evolve. A forecasting question must have a date at which the question is answered and constructed so that it can be objectively checked, as well as framing questions with concrete, measurable answers. For example, one could approach this by asking -How many nuclear weapons will North Korea have by February 2029?-[2] Others who explore the use of forecasting methodologies may wish to consider other core questions, which have a quantitative or binary answer but are good indicators of broader changes. Responses to an initial question are used for calibration, and then forecasters are asked about how their answers would change if certain factors changed. These factors may include particular events: internal and external factors related to the nuclear program, political leadership, broader political dynamics and -acts of God- such as pandemics, nuclear accidents, and succession crises from unexpected changes in leadership. They may also include the emergence of new information from defector accounts, declassification of intelligence reports, advances in open-source technology, or disclosures from the North Korean regime or its allies. A workshop is a tried-and-tested format when you want subject matter experts to interact with each other directly in developing and evaluating these factors. Forecasting adds an additional layer. With the use of a voting system, including displaying real-time results, it leverages the expertise of everybody in the room, not just whoever has the floor. On any particular question, it facilitates interaction between experts on diverse subject matters and generalists. Without forecasting, experts could brainstorm factors, and then discuss which should be considered most important to the trajectory of North Korea’s nuclear program. But I have no doubt that asking participants to forecast how a factor would actually impact the baseline and then discussing and revising results in a more rigorous outcome than a traditional roundtable format. It is not necessary to recruit a team of -superforecasters-; you can use a more typical workshop audience, composed of both generalists and North Korean-focused technical and political experts with diverse genders, ages and backgrounds. However, it is essential to prime such a group with training before the forecasting sessions.[3] HW: We ran a workshop in February 2024 using the forecasting methodology. How was it used to drive the workshop? SL: When structuring the workshop, we really wanted a free-flowing discussion on day one with more than just presentations from organizers to attendees. We put together a group of participants with vastly different areas of expertise (technical vs. political, generalists vs. North Korea experts) and varied genders, ages and backgrounds. In the spirit of discussion and collaboration, we asked each participant to prepare remarks related to their areas of expertise, which kicked off more in-depth project presentations and subsequent sharing of ideas. From these general conversations, we undertook some brainstorming exercises that funneled down into more specific areas—multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) capabilities, gas boosting, and experimental light-water reactor (ELWR) operation—that were ripe for exploration during the forecasting work on the second day. We were able to get a lot of good discussion out of day one simply because we asked people to get out of their seats, put away their laptops, physically write on paper, and present their own ideas, all of which rarely happens at workshops. While ONN and the project consortium could have made some educated assumptions about what might happen in the future based on our own expertise, we wanted to have insight into how a broader set of experts viewed the future of the program. This was the ideal opportunity to introduce forecasting to those who might be unfamiliar with the method and utilize its framework to gain actionable insight into an uncertain issue. GC: On the first day, we discussed the forces driving North Korea’s nuclear program, and brainstormed factors that could make a significant impact on its trajectory. During the second day, we used these factors to forecast the impact of selected events on North Korea’s nuclear program. Our aim was not to use forecasting to quantify the future size of the North Korean nuclear program but to apply the group’s judgment in identifying key factors that would impact the trajectory of the nuclear program in the medium term. These results could then be used to inform our fuel cycle simulation for the next decade. As a proxy for the North Korean nuclear program, we estimated the number of warheads it will have in its arsenal by February 2029 (five years after the workshop). We are not sharing this number because the goal was not to use the wisdom of the crowd to provide this. We took this number as a baseline and were interested in how any particular factor would change this. Participants had to quantify each factor’s likelihood (percent chance of occurring), impact (what would be the revised number of warheads, above or below the baseline), and also a confidence level, effectively providing a probability distribution function. This occurred through a voting system that displayed live results, showing the sum of all inputs from participants. After a first round of voting, participants, particularly those on the extremes of predictions, would explain their choices to the workshop adapting a Delphi methodology, allowing them to revise their choices after group discussion.[4] Asking people to discuss their answers and vote again introduces a risk of conformity bias. To mitigate this, our discussion included both a roundtable and an anonymous chat function that were both used by the facilitator. An alternative would be to have only a single round of voting that is not influenced by discussion and does not draw out the knowledge of assembled experts, which would provide poorer results. Without discussion, there is also the risk of retaining systematic biases (i.e., an incorrect or unsupportable assumption) that could be dispelled or countered by knowledgeable input. HW: What were some of the challenges in forecasting and interpreting results during the workshop? GC: One of the issues we encountered was a healthy debate at the beginning of the second day about how to define the overarching question: How do you encapsulate the trajectory of the North Korean nuclear program in a single question? It will, of course, require a simplification, but in the end, we settled upon the number of warheads in the arsenal as a general indicator of the program’s trajectory. Ideally, we could also repeat this workshop with another group of experts and see if or how the results differ. At 18 participants, the group in this workshop was the perfect size for the facilitators—any bigger, and we would have had to divide into smaller groups—but it did mean that there was often only one person per area of expertise. With a bigger group or repeated trials, subject matter experts may be able to delve even deeper into debates during the rounds of discussion while refining predictions. Another issue was ensuring buy-in on forecasting. We informed participants far ahead of time what the aims and structure of the workshop would be and provided preparatory material. We had thought carefully about inviting participants that we thought would engage with the format, but I think most had some uncertainty about it until we were in the room. Using the wisdom of crowds, where you cannot average reasoning for a complex technical, political problem, also unnerved some participants. However, there was a great deal of reassurance when it was clear that forecasting was a tool to obtain key drivers that would impact the nuclear program. SL: In addition to those issues, one of the largest challenges was simply time. Covering the entirety of North Korea’s nuclear fuel cycle and weapons program in just two days was ambitious, so we were only able to cover a select number of topics. In the future, I would love to see a series of workshops on specific issue areas related to the program, with each area getting its own two days of discussion and forecasting. HW: How was forecasting able to provide you with insight on the direction of the North Korean nuclear program? GC: At the point when we began developing this workshop, VERTIC had already modeled North Korea’s nuclear fuel cycle from 1986 until 2023, and had produced estimates of its plutonium and highly enriched uranium stockpiles (HEU) as part of a project with CNS and the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), funded by Global Affairs Canada. To model the North Korean program, we used open sources, including satellite imagery, International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reports, US Government assessments and other nongovernmental analyses to estimate the size of their program. Although we can learn a great deal from those sources, we cannot completely constrain what North Korea is doing, particularly for HEU production. SL: To complement VERTIC’s work in forecasting North Korea’s fuel cycle, ONN sought to continue its nuclear arsenal modeling out for the next decade; however, this was also stymied by the lack of open-source information relevant for future projections. I believe that by incorporating forecasting work into what could have been a more conventional workshop, the participants and organizers were forced to lay out their assumptions and innate biases. The examination of our forecasts allowed for spirited debate about how everyone arrived at their predictions. I was pleasantly surprised to find not only my ideas reshaping, but also other experts walking away with newly shifted perspectives, especially on some poorly understood technical nuances that affect political analyses and vice versa. A public version of the workshop report will soon be available on ONN’s website. The workshop outcomes are also included in other ONN and VERTIC analyses.

Quick Take: The South and Syria	North Korean state media has yet to issue any response to South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s December 3 declaration of martial law in the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea). The declaration was short-lived and immediately triggered an ongoing political leadership crisis in Seoul. Combined with the sudden collapse of the Assad regime in Syria—one of the North’s closest allies—these developments present the country with dual geopolitical challenges that may compel Kim Jong Un to recalibrate his regime’s messaging and prioritize defense cooperation with Russia. The only substantive foreign policy activity from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) was a December 4 finalization of the country’s comprehensive treaty with Russia, which took place in Moscow, a December 5 Foreign Ministry spokesman’s statement decrying a power challenge to the Assad regime in Syria, and a December 7 statement from the National Aerospace Technology Administration (NATA) opposing US Space Forces deployment to Japan. The treaty signing and NATA statement constitute old business for the DPRK—the treaty was a fait accompli, and the US Space Force deployment was announced in 2022. Of course, -the reckless military moves of [the] terrorists- in Syria decried by the Foreign Ministry proved successful on December 8. The Assad regime, a favorite partner of North Korea with whom Kim Jong Un has routinely exchanged messages, folded. Its leader, Bashar al-Assad, was given asylum in Russia. The December 3 martial law declaration in the South and the collapse of the Syrian regime after 11 days of fighting (amid a 13-year civil war) found Kim and top DPRK policymakers contending with two strategic shocks. With a modest personnel footprint in Syria, North Korean contingency planning may have envisioned and planned for the collapse of the Assad regime but probably failed to foresee how quickly the regime crumbled. Yoon’s martial law declaration was entirely unanticipated. President Yoon cited -anti-state- and -North Korean communist forces- within his domestic political opposition in his declaration, which included mobilizing military forces in and around Seoul. With that initial declaration, it is highly probable that Pyongyang went into an unpublicized crisis posture out of caution. While the US retains operation control (OPCON) over military forces in South Korea, the martial law declaration raised the possibility, from the Pyongyang perspective, of South Korea launching clandestine attacks against the North or limited military engagement near the Northern Limit Line (NLL). Pyongyang probably surveyed the ROK’s domestic political landscape in the days after the declaration. Because senior ROK government officials from President Yoon’s own political party were caught almost completely unaware, the DPRK’s Seoul watchers found a high degree of uncertainty and instability. Kim could have authorized military activity or weapons testing to aggravate the overall situation in the region or ordered communique or media activity—like the publishing of Rodong Sinmun essays or editorials—to express satisfaction at Yoon’s predicament, but Pyongyang has exercised restraint. Perhaps at the point when Pyongyang was prepared to formulate some type of response to events in Seoul, Hayat Tahir al-Sham (HTS) and its satellite forces moved into Damascus, Assad’s last stronghold in Syria. With the collapse of a close DPRK ally and one of the last family-based authoritarian regimes, along with a budding political transition in South Korea, Kim Jong Un and his advisers find themselves in an extraordinary decision-making environment, at the very least in terms of strategic communication and what ideas and perspectives Pyongyang intends to convey. North Korea might use the Assad regime collapse and leadership uncertainty in South Korea to persuade Russia to expedite any potential technology exchanges or defense industry cooperation that might aid in innovating or expanding the DPRK’s weapons systems, including ballistic missiles. Finally, cadres planning for the year-end Central Committee plenum might have to adjust the plenum’s agenda to include more rhetoric and policy initiatives focused on national security.

Why and How Estimates of North Korean GDP by the Bank of Korea Are Deceptive	The most commonly used indicator to gauge a country’s economic capacity and well-being is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is defined as -the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.- It measures the flow of money based on transactions in a market economy, where income and expenditure should be equal. In the case of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea), the Bank of Korea’s (BOK) estimates are the most widely cited metrics by international organizations and policy actors when assessing the DPRK’s economic situation. However, these numbers can be deceptive as the BOK uses the production approach to estimate North Korea’s GDP, which does not reflect its actual economic situation. Even though the BOK’s use of the production approach has flaws when measuring the DPRK’s GDP, other approaches are also insufficient. The biggest deficiency in current estimative approaches is the inability to properly account for the state procuring goods and services without payment or at a fraction of the cost, undermining the market principle that income should equal expenditure—a common trait among communist states. Because the North Korean regime does not disclose reliable information on its economy and resorts to widespread extraction of labor, conventional economic thinking cannot be applied to assess its economic reality. At the same time, the country’s dependence on an extractive system is increasingly risky, as most other instances of this approach have led to a state’s demise. How Bank of Korea Estimates Mislead According to the BOK, the real GDP of the DPRK declined by 8.4 percent from 2017 to 2022. Many have disputed these estimates: Korea Economic Institute of America Senior Advisor William Brown has suggested retiring the BOK’s report because of these inaccuracies. In addition, Seoul National University’s Professor Byung-Yeon Kim has argued that household income in North Korea actually fell by half between 2017 and 2022, according to testimonies from defectors, resulting in GDP decreasing by 25 percent. Despite acknowledging the BOK’s flaws, no one has fully captured why and how the BOK’s GDP figures are so misleading. A closer look into the different approaches to estimating a nation’s GDP coupled with an analysis of the impact of labor extraction in North Korea is essential to grasp the discrepancies. In general, there are three ways economists measure GDP: the production approach, the income approach, and the expenditure approach. In market economies, when using any approach, the GDP calculated in principle would be the same. The BOK implements the production approach when assessing North Korea’s economic performance by -using the basic data on production quantities supplied by relevant institutions…with the use of South Korea’s prices and value-added ratios.- However, this approach does not account for labor extraction, where, either voluntarily or through coercion, workers contribute labor to produce goods and services in North Korea for free or at a highly discounted rate. This should be interpreted as a -hidden tax- on labor where the worker’s time is redirected by the state, thereby causing the worker to lose earning potential while the state collects returns on the worker’s outputs. The BOK’s estimation assumes no extraction of labor and thus shows an artificial increase in the value added to the economy, skewing estimates of its economic activity. The Difficulties of Measuring North Korea’s GDP Of the three major approaches to measuring GDP, each presents distinct flaws when applied to North Korea. The Production Approach The BOK uses South Korean prices in its estimates, which distorts changes in North Korean prices. Since the 2017 sanctions, North Korea has experienced a sustained trade deficit due to decreased exports, causing a drop in government revenue and the rise of the foreign exchange rate, resulting in inflation—a phenomenon that is overlooked when using South Korean prices. This can be illustrated by the 2019 data, which shows a trade deficit of $2.69 billion, or 9.5 percent of North Korea’s nominal GDP, as estimated by the BOK. Yet that same year, the BOK stated that GDP grew by 0.4 percent. In reality, the real income of North Koreans has sharply declined due to inflation and a sharply declining won-dollar exchange rate. All in all, North Korean GDP is overstated by the BOK. The Income Approach The income approach aggregates income from household wages, dividends, rent from private properties, and interest. In North Korea, the state owns the means of production; there is no stock market, property rights, or banking system. Therefore, national income can only amount to aggregate household income, composed of economic activity in the shadow economy and government-paid wages, representing a fraction of the market wage because of labor extraction. For example, Ri Il Gyu, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and recent defector, claimed to earn only the equivalent of $500 monthly while working in Cuba and $0.30 monthly in North Korea. Consequently, he was compelled to engage in the shadow economy via smuggling to make up for his low income and support his family. Not accounting for labor extraction in the income approach will result in a much lower GDP figure than the production approach. This is confirmed by empirical research, including testimonies I gathered in July 2024 from North Korean defectors who arrived in South Korea in October 2023, verifying the intensification of labor extraction and the precipitated decline in state-provided wages during the COVID period. Professor Kim had similar findings and concluded that the GDP decreased by 25 percent between 2017 and 2022. The BOK’s approach clearly overstates real income in the DPRK, thereby exaggerating GDP. The Expenditure Approach The expenditure approach estimates GDP by summing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The BOK’s approach overstates North Korean GDP compared to the expenditure approach in several key ways. First, output produced without due compensation via extraction would logically result in both decreased government expenditure, as the government does not pay for labor, and household income, as individuals are not paid for their labor. Decreased household income results in lower household consumption, which, therefore, impacts the population’s economic well-being. Such a phenomenon is not effectively captured in the BOK’s estimation, which inflates the GDP. Second, the expenditure approach is the only open model incorporating foreign trade, the bulk of which is with China, providing a lifeline to the regime and ensuring its survival. Exports are the largest source of North Korea’s government revenue, so its sustained trade deficit causes government revenue to decrease and impacts the types of output North Korea can produce. The sustained trade deficit causes the foreign exchange rate to increase and prices to rise. Yet, the BOK’s approach does not account for this as it uses South Korean prices and does not consider net exports. Accounting for Extraction The DPRK uses the extraction of labor on a large scale. As an example, news reports in May 2024 showed students, from those in elementary school to those in university, being forced to transplant rice seedlings for no pay as part of the state-mandated farm assistance period. By forcing people to work for no income, much of the DPRK’s economic activity is not captured in traditional GDP data. As the foreign exchange rate rises and the budget deficit deepens, the DPRK must compensate for this by printing money, eventually leading to inflation. However, instead of resorting to printing money, the regime has relied more and more on labor extraction, which is not accounted for in the BOK’s estimation. Finally, in the DPRK, investment can only come from the government as the inability of individuals to save precludes private investment. Revenue must exceed expenditure to ensure net investment from the government into the economy—without sustained investment, the country’s economic capacity will contract, and depreciation will occur, resulting in eroding infrastructure, the contraction of productive capacity, and pervasive adverse effects on the economy in the long run. The DPRK resolves this through extraction, both when paying workers a fraction of the market wage or when procuring goods and services below the market value. By not taking into account all these factors and using the production approach, the BOK’s estimate overstates North Korea’s GDP. Conclusion Each approach to estimating a state’s GDP has its own blind spots, and all of them fail to illustrate North Korea’s dire economic situation. Its accumulated trade deficit after the increased sanctions in 2017 and self-imposed COVID-19 isolation in 2020 forced Kim Jong Un to deplete the foreign exchange reserves and rely on hacking, smuggling, and other illegal activities to replenish its diminishing coffers. The future of the DPRK is bleak, and the regime has no other choice but to rely on labor extraction and harsh repression of its people. Pyongyang’s increased belligerence internationally is merely a sign of the regime’s desperation to enhance its economic plight and ensure the survival of its extractive system. Recent Nobel Prize laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson explained in their book Why Nations Fail that extractive systems, like the one in North Korea, impede economic development because the economy’s benefits accrue to only a few chosen members of the ruling class and are not shared among people. Therefore, it should be noted that the economic failure of extractive systems is not an indictment of the people in that country but a system that, throughout history, has consistently failed. North Korea must replace its extractive system with an inclusive one if it is to achieve real economic development and avoid collapse.

Quick Take: North Korea’s Coverage of Russian War Against Ukraine	In a speech at a Korean People’s Army conference on November 15, Kim Jong Un said the United States was -sustaining their [its] military assistance to Ukraine- and claimed -the United States and other Western countries are using Ukraine as a shock force in the war against Russia.- This speech was carried for both domestic and external audiences. Kim’s unusual, but not unprecedented, direct reference to the Russia-Ukraine war offers a good opportunity to review how North Korean propaganda outlets have handled this topic since the war began. North Korea has taken two widely different approaches to the coverage of the war, depending on the audience.[1] Outlets targeting external audiences were quick and decisive in reporting on the war and siding with Russia. By contrast, domestically oriented media were first observed to mention the Ukraine situation in March 2023, more than a year after the war began.[2] North Korea became more forward-leaning in its domestic coverage of the war as its relationship with Russia continued to deepen. North Korea’s cautious and more calibrated approach to the war in Ukraine vis-à-vis the domestic public indicates sensitivities surrounding the topic. In that vein, it should be no surprise the country’s domestic media, unlike its external websites, remain silent on the extent of North Korea’s role in the war. External Versus Domestic Coverage External outlets reacted within days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Two days after the invasion, the Foreign Ministry website carried a bylined article blaming the United States and supporting Russia’s position on Ukraine. An official Foreign Ministry statement reiterated this same line two days later. North Korean external platforms, led by the Foreign Ministry website, have since carried articles and statements consistent with Russia’s position on Ukraine, including North Korean Foreign Ministry officials’ press statements directly voicing support for Russia. Pyongyang’s quick and decisive support for Russia’s war against Ukraine is in line with one of the earliest signs of its foreign policy reorientation in August 2021, when the Foreign Ministry website started to regularly carry reports and articles introducing or supporting Russian positions on international and foreign policy issues. Domestic media’s first observed reference to the war in Ukraine was in a party daily article on March 30, 2023 citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s claim that the United States was encouraging the -Ukrainian crisis- for economic benefits. Domestic media have since published news reports, articles, and commentaries that aligned with Russia’s position on Ukraine and were critical of the United States and the West. Domestic media coverage of the war in Ukraine has increased since March 2024, shortly after the Foreign Ministry indicated, based on the foreign minister’s trip to Russia in January 2024, that Putin would be visiting Pyongyang and a new treaty would be signed. It was also after this announcement that domestic media started to provide more details about the war and carry Foreign Ministry statements on the war in Ukraine, which had hitherto been reserved for external websites. Choe Son Hui’s Russia visit in January 2024 seems to have given North Korea greater confidence in its relationship with Moscow, prompting it to give clearer signals domestically on its position on the war. That notwithstanding, domestic media refrained from directly voicing support for the war. In two instances, they indirectly acknowledged North Korea’s support for Russia’s -special military operation- by citing Putin (July 2023) or Russia (January 2024). Putin’s visit to Pyongyang in June 2024, however, was a turning point. In a departure from past practice, a party daily editorial explicitly voiced -full support and encouragement for the special military operation against Ukraine- on the day of Putin’s scheduled arrival in Pyongyang. In his talks with the visiting Russian vice defense minister the following month, Kim Jong Un himself expressed -strong support for and firm solidarity with- Russia on -the special military operations in Ukraine,- echoing the same promise he made during the summit with Putin.
