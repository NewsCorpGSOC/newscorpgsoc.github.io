Munchon Naval Complex Construction Progresses	Two months after Kim Jong Un visited Tapchon Port on North Korea’s east coast and announced plans to build a large naval base, commercial satellite imagery shows no signs of construction advancing at the site. Tapchon is part of a larger complex of naval facilities in the Munchon area, previously the home of the KPA East Fleet Headquarters. However, across the bay, there is significant work to expand the existing October 3 Dockyard and Korean People’s Army (KPA) Navy Unit 155 Base. Together with Tapchon Port, these facilities are all part of the Munchon Naval Complex. Kim visited the future site of the Tapchon naval base in early September and said its construction would be a -pressing task- if the country’s navy were able to moor -large surface warships and submarines which cannot be anchored at the existing facilities.- Long piers and several buildings were constructed at the port between 2015 and 2022, but none appear to have been put into regular use. Some still remain incomplete on imagery from November 6. While perhaps a less-than-auspicious start for the naval base project, Kim’s emphasis on the importance of this new base to the navy’s future suggests work should pick up in the near future. A slow start following Kim’s visit is not uncommon—for example, at Sohae Satellite Launching Station, modernization and expansion efforts did not begin in earnest immediately following Kim’s mandate. Tapchon Port There have been no discernable changes at the Tapchon port area since Kim’s visit in September, despite Kim calling the site’s expansion a pressing task. Fishing boats are still using some of the piers, numerous buildings remain half-finished, and no new land clearance has begun. Around the site, large concrete blocks remain scattered where they have sat for years. Similar blocks are usually used throughout the country to build up sea walls, although the walls around Tapchon Port appear to be well-fortified. October 3 Dockyard At the nearby October 3 Dockyard, home to KPA Navy Unit 597, many of the vessels on the repair way do not appear to have moved in the last two months. The dockyard was almost completely rebuilt in 2015 after Kim visited and called for its modernization. The latest image reveals work on a new building near the entrance of the site has been completed, and a second adjacent building appears to be under construction. KPA Navy Unit 155 Base Just south, construction progress has occurred at the KPA Navy Unit 155 site. The entire facility is being redeveloped with several new buildings. Satellite imagery from November 6 reveals roofs have been added to some buildings, and second floors are being added to others. Two new round buildings are under construction. The internal partitioning and unique design suggest they are likely to be headquarters or administrative buildings. Additionally, the sea wall has been extended and appears set to snake around the edge of the bay. It may be that the stepped-up efforts at KPA Navy Unit 155 are a prelude to the final phase of construction at Tapchon.

Sohae Satellite Launching Station: No Observable Indications of Launch Preparations	Commercial satellite imagery shows that work at North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station is progressing. South Korean intelligence reported on October 29 that North Korea appears to be ready to conduct another satellite launch attempt—with the acquisition of parts and technological cooperation with Russia—in what would be its first attempt since the failed launch of the Malligyong-1-1 reconnaissance satellite in May 2024. While modernization efforts progress throughout the site, no typical indicators of an imminent launch have been observed in recent weeks. In addition, North Korea has not made any imminent launch notifications to relevant authorities, a practice they have complied with in the last several satellite launches. Coastal Launch Pad The coastal launch pad has been used for the past three launch attempts. Imagery from throughout October 2024 and, most recently, November 6 shows no observable activities on the pad itself. Around the failed satellite launch in May 2024, support vehicles were observed parked underneath a structure covered in camouflage. Vehicles have not been parked under the same camouflage since late June. On imagery from November 6, the camouflage appears to have been removed from the framing. Roadside revetments near the entry to the launch pad also remain empty. To the south of the launch pad, support buildings were constructed in the spring of 2023. At one of the southwest support buildings, paving of the surrounding area has progressed since August 2024, and as recently as November 6, materials remain in the lot. Tunnel Area Between the east tunnel entrance and the VIP observation area, a section was cleared—resembling a larger revetment—prior to the last satellite launch. In May, equipment was observed underneath camouflage in this area before the last launch. Imagery throughout September and October shows objects in the same area, the nature of which is unclear. The east tunnel entrance remains quiet, with few observable changes. At the west tunnel entrance, work continues. The rectangular opening on top of the tunnel entrance is still visible on imagery from November 6, and roof trusses remain in the surrounding areas. Engine Test Stand Area On imagery from November 6, a blue van and smaller vehicles are observed on the road connecting the engine test stands, moving away from the Horizontal Engine Test Stand. While the purpose of this vehicle movement cannot be determined, the vehicles may have been purposed for test monitoring or could have been carrying test-related equipment for installation or a small upper stage for testing. Other Vehicle Activity On November 6, buses were observed at the mountaintop tracking station and the administration and security check-in building located at the entrance to the site. Their presence may indicate a VIP visit to the facility. On that same date, several white packages or stacks of material were observed in front of the same administration and security check-in building. Their purpose is unclear. A vehicle was also observed at the old Horizontal Assembly Building. New Assembly Building Notably, roof trusses began to be installed between October 8 and October 20. Previous reports observed trusses in the area surrounding the building. By October 31, more than half of the frames have been installed over the top of the building. As of November 6, all but one section of roof trusses has been put in place. Paving around the perimeter of the new assembly building that began in early September 2024 progresses. Imagery from late October shows the paving blocks begin to connect to the main site road. Seaport Activity progresses to extend the jetty at the southern seaport. Between September 23 and September 28, blocks began to be placed on the west and south sides of the end of the jetty. In early October, blocks were placed along the east side as well. Work continues through the end of October. This activity is likely to define a dock or quay at the end of the jetty that allows for the unloading of deeper draft vessels. Work also progresses on the coastal highway, connecting the jetty to the rest of the site.

Construction Expands at Nampho Port	Commercial satellite imagery of Nampho Port indicates previously identified work on a ship repair way is part of a much larger project that will significantly upgrade the facility. Nampho, located on the west coast of North Korea, is both the country’s primary ship construction and repair facility and its largest commercial port, known for its coal, petroleum, oil and commercial goods imports and exports. This work on Nampho’s shipbuilding facilities, together with the recent reveal of a new naval base being built on the east coast, appear to be part of larger efforts to upgrade the Korean People’s Navy. Marine Repair Way Construction At the center of the port, construction of a large structure on one of the two marine repair ways has been progressing since September 2023. As of late September 2024, the structure was walled off on four sides, likely to effectively shield construction of shipbuilding work on the repair way from overhead surveillance. On imagery from November 2, a roof or covering is being installed over the top of the structure. The green covering is semi-transparent and possibly a tarp or netting material. As it does not appear sturdy enough to support the weight of a snowfall as winter nears, it is likely just a temporary measure to conceal activity taking place. The structure could possibly become a shipbuilding hall, but the framing and covering differ from other construction halls throughout the country. Measuring 30 meters by 170 meters, the hall would be among the largest in North Korea. White blocks or slabs appear to lay on the lattice gridwork. The blocks are likely being offloaded by a nearby crane barge, lifting the blocks onto the gridwork from the hold of the utility cargo ship next to the crane barge. On the adjacent repair way, a similar grid lattice is also visible. These gridworks may support the staging of component parts for ships under construction. This work appears to be part of efforts to build up the repair ways and could possibly mirror the work being done on its neighbor. Secure Boat Basin In imagery from September 2024, work had begun to fill in the secure boat basin. By November 2, multiple piles had been driven into the riverbed in the basin area and around the end of the other repair way with grid lattice. It appears the entirety of the basin will eventually be filled. East Repair Ways On the east side of the ship repair area, the two ship repair ways are also abuzz with activity. One has a similar grid lattice to that seen on the west side of the site. A white building was constructed between the lattice work and the water in October and November of 2023. While the purpose of the building is unclear, it blocks the path between the repair way and the water. Building Construction A number of new buildings are also being erected near the west repair ways, where land was cleared earlier this year. Their purpose is yet unclear.

North Korean Non-kinetic Attacks: A Problem for Incheon Airport	North Korea has recently engaged in -non-kinetic- forms of provocations against South Korea. These operations include waste-laden balloons, GPS spoofing, electronic jamming and cyberattacks. It has sometimes been difficult for South Korea to identify appropriate countermeasures for these non-kinetic provocations because the Rules of Engagement—set by the United Nations Command, which has monitored and managed crises between the two Koreas since the Armistice Agreement of 1953—have not kept pace with these evolving threats. Recently, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) destroyed the northern sections of the unused road and rail routes linking it with South Korea, seen as a symbolic protest of the hardline policies of the Republic of Korea’s (ROK or South Korea) President Yoon Suk Yeol. On October 31, North Korea launched a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, dubbed Hwasong-19, from a new 24-wheel mobile launcher. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared it was in reaction to the 56th US-ROK Security Consultative Meeting, held in Washington the day before. The ROK intelligence agency said that North Korea may have obtained some critical technical assistance from Russia as a quid pro quo for North Korean involvement in the Ukraine War. These actions have symbolic and political implications both for the ROK and the US, with North Korea aiming to demonstrate that it still poses an intractable threat to the ROK. In recent years, larger physical (kinetic) conflicts have become rare, the most recent being the Yeonpyeong Island naval skirmishes of 1999 and 2002, which also included a North Korean artillery bombardment of the island and then the sinking of ROK Navy (ROKN) corvette, the Cheonan, in 2010. North Korea’s continued psychological warfare, however, increases tensions and is probably a tactic of -escalate to de-escalate- to acquire leverage for later negotiations with South Korea. The situation is also exacerbating South Korean political polarization over North Korea policy, which the regime of Kim Jong Un presumably sees as a win. While some sectors of South Korea’s defense infrastructure are prepared to respond to non-kinetic threats, Incheon Airport—a vital hub for the ROK’s economy and international connectivity—is especially vulnerable. North Korea’s shift toward non-kinetic provocations underscores the need for modernizing security systems and coordination efforts at critical sites such as Incheon Airport. Recent Non-kinetic Attacks Since May 2024, North Korea has been sending hundreds of waste-laden balloons, typically containing plastic bottles and paper, across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In response, since July 21, the ROK Armed Forces have reinstated an operation in which fixed speakers regularly broadcast messages across the DMZ. Waste balloons have been released at least 20 times and have been found in more than 5,500 locations nationwide. One balloon caught fire after bursting on the rooftop of a residential building in Gyeonggi Province, where Incheon International Airport, South Korea’s main aerial gateway, is located. Just in this province, waste balloons have been discovered in more than 2,000 locations in recent days. The airport has been directly affected by North Korean waste balloons: runway operations have been halted 12 times for a total of 265 minutes. Besides the balloons, North Korea has also increasingly been jamming civil aircraft using Incheon Airport. Broadcasting of false signals, deliberately intended to confuse GPS systems, has been reported 578 times between January and August this year, compared to 39 last year and only 26 in the three years before that. Most of these cases have been traced back to North Korea. Such cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and are potentially effective against unmanned aerial vehicles operated by US Forces Korea stationed in the South. No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety. Most of the jamming occurred between May 29 and June 2, when hundreds of civilian aircraft and ships reported suspected GPS jamming near the de facto inter-Korean sea border in the West Sea, the Northern Limit Line. The GPS interference sometimes lasted a few minutes and sometimes several hours. The Vulnerability of Incheon Airport Every year, Incheon Airport carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo, but it is less than 100 kilometers from North Korea and, therefore, very vulnerable to trash balloons, electronic jamming, and other cyberattacks on flight control systems. Besides electronic jamming of aircraft navigation systems, other forms of cyberattacks are suspected: during the last decade, Incheon Airport has experienced several technical problems that have affected aircraft navigation and air traffic control. Incheon Airport is an important hub connecting East Asia with North America, so many parties could conceivably be responsible, but it is difficult to see how any of them have an interest in disrupting regular flight schedules, except for North Korea. The ROK’s intelligence community has verified that North Korea has conducted frequent cyberattacks and electronic jamming directed against Incheon Airport, and they are seriously concerned about the potential impact on domestic and international aircraft. The unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) on March 8, 2014 offers a grim warning of what could happen: the cause remains mysterious, but a cyberattack has not been excluded. Certainly, if a similar unexplained disappearance should occur with an Incheon flight, then a North Korean cyberattack would top the list of possible causes to be investigated. The environment of Incheon Airport is also unusually challenging for search and rescue (SAR) operations, being situated on a muddy island, Yeongjong-do, with a tidal range exceeding 10 meters. This makes it difficult for traditional surface vessels to operate, so the ROK Coast Guard (KCG) and the ROKN have deployed specialized platforms and other equipment. KCG has a number of hovercraft capable of amphibious operations, which can provide an immediate response to any emergency in the vicinity.[1] ROKN also possesses some hydrofoils, which are deployed to Incheon Defense Command, based in Incheon.[2] These are available to support SAR operations in coastal areas near Incheon International Airport, and some joint SAR exercises have been conducted with KCG to build operational experience. Policy Recommendations Such SAR cooperation is essential for an effective response to an aircraft accident near Incheon International Airport, especially now that the recent escalation in North Korean non-kinetic attacks threatens the safety and security of South Korean airspace. KCG is well prepared, but ROKN could improve its monitoring, for example with unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vessels. It is also essential to coordinate systems and technology between the ROK’s SAR center, the KCG, the ROKN, and various other authorities, including local governments. Given the complexity of this situation, it is recommended that a procedural manual should be created for joint SAR operations near Incheon Airport. A standard operational manual between ROKN and KCG should be established first, which can then be expanded to become the Chungmu emergency plan, encompassing other government and civic organizations. The recent escalation in North Korean electromagnetic jamming and cyberattacks needs to be countered more effectively. The ROK is bidding to host an international cybersecurity conference with representatives from the militaries of 24 countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and collaborative cybersecurity exercises would also be useful. Following the announcement of the ROK’s cybersecurity strategy in February, the ROK National Security Council has drawn up the National Cybersecurity Basic Plan after consulting with 14 government agencies. This plan seeks to secure the ROK’s industrial infrastructure and other facilities against cyber threats, using both defensive and offensive measures. The ROK Ministry of National Defense is working together with various countries to coordinate cybersecurity responses and has joined international partnerships such as Cyber Alliance and Cyber Flag drill. Conclusion North Korean balloons, GPS spoofing, and other non-kinetic attacks have the potential to seriously compromise the safety of Incheon Airport. The worst-case scenario is an airliner crashing in muddy littoral areas where timely SAR operations and cybersecurity would be very challenging. The complexity of the threat from North Korean non-kinetic operations requires whole-of-government measures. Besides South Korean military and security organizations, civil organizations are also working to deal with these challenges, notably the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization. Existing SAR capabilities are not adequate to protect Incheon International Airport from North Korean non-kinetic operations. Multilateral cybersecurity protocols are needed, and the ROK is well-placed to take the lead in developing them.

North Korea Tests New Solid ICBM Probably Intended for MIRVs	On October 31, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) conducted the initial flight test of the new Hwasong-19 (HS-19) solid-propellant intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Photos show the missile is longer than the North’s first solid ICBM, the Hwasong-18 (HS-18). This explains the increased boost capability shown in the missile’s longer flight time and higher maximum altitude, and thus is not an indication of technological assistance from Russia, as some analysts have speculated. Because the HS-18 can already reach targets throughout the US, the HS-19’s additional boost capability will probably be used to loft heavier payloads. A multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV)-associated probable post-boost vehicle (PBV) was shown in stage-separation photos from the launch released by Pyongyang. One or two more successful flight tests will likely be needed before considering the HS-19 booster ready for deployment, but a MIRV payload would require at least several successful tests over at least a few years to be ready. The most likely reason for developing another solid ICBM with more boost capability than the existing HS-18 is to loft a heavier MIRV payload to a similar range. Deployment of MIRVs on the HS-19 (and probably the larger, liquid-propellant HS-17), in combination with single-RV versions and the HS-18 force, will significantly boost the number of deployed North Korean warheads for a given number of missiles and launchers, increase the number of targets that a surviving missile force can retaliate against after absorbing a first strike, and further complicate the task of allied missile defenses by forcing them to cope with more relatively small objects in the same timeframe. But this potential depends on how the North chooses to allocate its relatively limited nuclear warhead production among many different weapons systems. Information to Date On October 30, it was reported that South Korean military intelligence had detected signs North Korea would soon launch an ICBM, including the placement of a missile and its mobile launcher. The Japanese Ministry of Defense reported the launch of an ICBM-class missile on October 31 from the suburbs of Pyongyang to the northeast, landing in the sea after a flight of about 86 minutes covering some 1,000 kilometers (km) at a maximum altitude of over 7,000 km. South Korea’s military confirmed the launch and impact areas, as well as a highly lofted trajectory. Images in the Japanese media of apparent reentering objects suggested the flight was successful. That same day, the North Korean press announced -an ICBM test-fire,- but provided no further technical information. North Korean media provided further information on November 1, reporting the ICBM was -the latest-type ICBM Hwasongpho-19- (aka Hwasong-19 or HS-19), which flew for 85.93 minutes to a maximum altitude of 7,687.5 km and a distance of 1,001.2 km. Accompanying photos depicted the launch of a three-stage, solid-propellant missile from a canister mounted on an 11-axle road mobile launcher (TEL, or transporter-erector-launcher), and also depicted missile staging, including a photo captioned -third stage separation- of two rocket nozzles remaining on the bottom of the missile’s payload section as the expended third stage falls away. North Korean TV video shows the missile being -cold launched- from its canister on an 11-axle TEL. Analysis The missile. The HS-19’s use of an 11-axle TEL indicates that the new missile is longer than North Korea’s first solid-propellant ICBM, the HS-18, which uses a nine-axle TEL. Initial analyses differ on whether the HS-19 is larger in diameter, as well. Either way, the size increase provides for additional solid propellant to increase the HS-19’s total boost capability—which is consistent with the new missile’s increased flight time (about 13 minutes) and altitude (some 1,100 km altitude) compared to the most recent HS-18 launch on December 18, 2023. Although the increased boost capability could be used to extend the HS-19’s range, the HS-18 can already cover anywhere in the United States from anywhere in North Korea. It is much more likely that the new missile’s increased capability will be used to boost a heavier payload. The payload. In the North Korean photos, the nozzles protruding from the bottom of the payload section, which remained in place after third-stage separation, are consistent with the presence of a PBV, a rocket-powered platform used to maneuver between drop-off locations for MIRVs. The PBV dispenses each reentry vehicle (RV) onto its own discrete trajectory toward a separate target. The payload of a MIRVed missile has to include the weight of the PBV and its propellant, not just that of the multiple RVs, and so a MIRV payload would be a good use for the increased boost capability of the HS-19. We do not know if the apparent PBV in the HS-19 test was operational or a dummy, if it carried actual RVs or payload simulators, if it maneuvered or was used for range extension, or if it released any RVs—although there is no reporting of unusual reentry objects. Although North Korea first mentioned interest in multiple warheads in January 2021 and conducted what it claimed was a MIRV test in June 2024 (that probably failed before RV release), it has yet to successfully demonstrate MIRV capability. The June test used a booster based on the first stage of the HS-16 solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which is probably based on the first stage of the HS-18 and, according to North Korea, was intended to release three RVs and a decoy. This may be reflective of the payload intended for the HS-19. The weight of the payloads flown on the HS-18 and HS-19 is unknown. The increased payload capability of the HS-19 would more easily accommodate the 1960s-style heavier, blunter RVs that North Korea probably deploys on its ICBMs to have sufficient confidence they will survive reentry at operational ranges despite the lack of flight testing to such ranges. (All of the North’s ICBM tests to date have been highly lofted, with much shorter ranges than targets in the US.) If the HS-19 is larger in diameter than the HS-18, it would also better accommodate multiple such RVs. Implications No sign of recent Russian assistance. Although some instant commentary attributed the greater performance of the October 31 launch over previous HS-18 launches to the recent receipt of technical assistance from Russia—even to the provision of -a key propellant component that can boost a missile’s engine thrust-—there is no open-source evidence of this occurring. Moreover, the increased performance of the new missile is fully explainable by the increased size of the HS-19, which is itself fully obtainable from the HS-18 technology base that was probably catalyzed some 7-10 years ago. That said, any assistance North Korea has or will obtain from Russia for its ICBM program is a continuing wildcard that could increase the capability, reliability, and/or timeliness of strategic missile developments. More tests to come. The apparent success of the first HS-19 test continues the impressive reliability demonstrated by North Korean solid-propellant ballistic missiles, even as such missiles have gotten larger in diameter and thus more challenging to produce with good quality control. One or two more successful flight tests would probably be sufficient in the eyes of the North Koreans to qualify the HS-19 booster for deployment. However, if the missile has a MIRV payload, this is a demanding technology, and at least several successful payload tests on the HS-19 over at least a few years are likely before North Korea operationally deploys MIRVs. Assistance from Russia could somewhat accelerate the timeline but would not obviate the likely need for at least a few successful MIRV flight tests. Likely to augment rather than replace. According to North Korean media, the HS-19 is intended to be used -along with Hwasongpho-18…as the primary core means in defending the DPRK.- It remains to be seen whether HS-19s carry MIRVs and HS-18s carry single RVs, but except perhaps for the deployment of extremely large, high-yield warheads, the HS-18 has enough range/payload capability to deliver single RVs to any place North Korea might reasonably want to target. North Korea is likely to deploy a mix of MIRV and single RV payloads to cover different missions and use scenarios, to hedge against the potential loss of multiple RVs on a single booster to reliability problems or enemy action, and to help manage the challenges of allocating a relatively limited number of nuclear weapons across a large number and variety of potential delivery systems. Moreover, the HS-19 is likely to share MIRV duty with the large, liquid-propellant HS-17 ICBM. The probable greater payload capability and larger diameter of the latter make it extremely well suited to carry MIRVs—and potentially more RVs and/or decoys per missile than the HS-19. Construction over the past year at North Korea’s key liquid-propellant strategic rocket engine production facility, the Thaesong Machine Factory, is consistent with a continuing role for liquid ICBMs. It will be survivable. Some have contended that the larger size of the HS-19 renders it too visible and too hard to move, imperiling its survivability. Although the length and weight of the HS-19 and its TEL will keep it from using some roads and off-road areas available to smaller North Korean mobile ICBMs, it will still be able to move out of garrison to remote locations and be camouflaged during a pre-war crisis period or in the run-up to any DPRK-initiated crisis or conflict. Once dispersed over hundreds of square miles of wooded terrain, the increased size of the HS-19 would not appreciably increase its detectability. If caught in garrison, even smaller mobile ICBMs would be highly vulnerable; the larger HS-19 is unlikely to be much worse off. As with the probably heavier (when fueled) HS-17, North Korea also has the option of putting the HS-19 on a rail-mobile launcher if it sees the need. What about the 12-axle TEL? Immediately after the October 31 launch, it was speculated that the new missile might have been launched from the new 12-axle TEL revealed in North Korean photos released in September 2024 in conjunction with factory visits by Kim Jong Un. Now that it is clear the HS-19 was launched from an 11-axle TEL (albeit one resembling the 12-axle vehicle rather than the type of 11-axle TEL used with the HS-17), the question remains of what system(s) the 12-axle TEL supports. As noted previously in 38 North, the new TEL could be used with a longer variant of the HS-17 or HS-18 (or now the HS-19), a space-launch vehicle, a space-launch version of an existing ICBM (which would have a longer payload section), or to improve the mobility of the existing HS-17. The Bottom Line The revelation of an apparent PBV on North Korean photos from the HS-19 test is consistent with the use of a MIRV payload. In a few years, with or without additional Russian help, North Korea is likely to complete MIRV development via the requisite flight testing, resulting in an ICBM force with more flexibility, able to cover more targets, and possessing a more robust second-strike capability.

Quick Take: China Marks Up New Customs Area	Commercial satellite imagery indicates China continues to take steps towards completion of a new, modern customs post on its border with North Korea across the New Yalu River Bridge. Work at the facility near Dandong has been ongoing despite no observable preparation on the North Korean side that might signal an imminent opening of the new border crossing. Background The New Yalu River Bridge, a large cable-stayed bridge, was completed ten years ago and has never been used. Work on the Chinese customs area stalled soon after the bridge was completed but resumed in 2022. Since then, new border and customs control points have been constructed and paved, and work continues. Recent Activity Currently, road patterns around the facility are being rerouted, the latest appearing by early October. The first new traffic patterns were painted between early May and mid-June 2024 and repainted in early October as well. Until recently, the road off the bridge bypassed the customs facility and connected directly to the Chinese road network, but now new gates block off direct access and lane markings indicate vehicles will be funneled through checkpoints. While the latest work is another sign that the facility is moving closer to opening, there remains no indication of preparations on the North Korean side. The bridge was not connected to the North Korean road network until 2020, when the highway was completed. At that time, a large area of land adjacent to the road and near the bridge landing was cleared. Although this appeared to be creating space for a new North Korean customs facility, no further progress has been observed.

Quick Take: Large Trenches Across Former Border Links	Commercial satellite imagery shows that two large, well-defined trenches now slice through the land that once carried roads and railways that linked North and South Korea. The work began almost immediately after North Korean troops demolished the border links on October 15. As of October 30, construction continues. West Coast Route (Asian Highway-1) At the west coast crossing, which connected South Korea to the Kaesong Industrial Zone (also written as Kaesong Industrial Complex), a 125-meter-long trench has been dug perpendicular to the road, a few meters past the military demarcation line (MDL) that divides the two countries. The trench measures approximately seven meters wide, and large piles of dirt sit on either side of it. The purpose of the trench and dirt is unclear beyond it being some type of blockade that is intended to sever the transportation links. The mound could be part of the barrier, or it could be a temporary product of the construction work. East Coast Route (Asian Highway-6) The east coast crossing—previously connecting South Korea and the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone—has similarly been bisected by a large trench. Medium-resolution satellite imagery does not reveal the same level of detail as imagery of the AH-1 crossing, but the trench is clear. It is slightly longer at 150 meters and differs from the trench at the west coast crossing in that dirt and land clearance are only observed on one side of the trench. Continued Work Several trucks are still visible at the west coast, indicating that work is not yet complete. As construction efforts continue, we may gain more understanding about the reason for the trench and how North Korea intends to seal these two border crossings.

Quick Take: -The Old SOF Shoe-	Citing an anonymous source, Kyodo News reported that North Korea’s special operations forces (SOF) commander, three-star Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, arrived in Russia on October 24 to assume -command- of Korean People’s Army (KPA) SOF personnel deployed to Russia. His presence in Russia was corroborated and publicized by a Republic of Korea (ROK) delegation briefing NATO officials in Brussels on October 28, in which he was identified as -commander-in-chief&#8221; of KPA forces in Russia. Estimates on the KPA presence in Ukraine have been contradictory, ranging from approximately 3,500 to 10,000, which is one to two KPA SOF brigades. Neither the Russian nor the North Korean government has denied North Korea’s deployment. Prior to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s tacit admission of the KPA deployment, Pyongyang (and Ukraine) watchers were relying on a combination of official sanctioned releases and anonymous media leaks. There was incomplete provenance of sources or placement of caveats on the information, such as DPRK personnel finding their way into eavesdropped conversations. There were no analytical hedges, such as positing alternative scenarios like the KPA SOF serving as rear area guards. This creates an effect in which kernels of accurate information, such as North Korea’s largest troop deployment outside the Korean Peninsula since the Vietnam War, are overshadowed by speculation. This brings us to Colonel General Kim Yong Bok’s purported in-country presence in Russia. In March of this year, he was identified as Vice Chief of the KPA General Staff, placing him in the KPA’s high command. By dint of this position, he is Kim Jong Un’s top advisor on light infantry and the SOF. He attended seven of Kim’s public engagements and inspections in 2024, three of which involved SOF exercises, one a live fire artillery drill and two flood reconstruction efforts in North Pyongan Province. The number of disclosed SOF exercises was probably a tell-tale sign that North Korea would deploy some personnel to Russia. One can write off his presence at the artillery drill in the context of his high military command position. However, by publicizing his presence at flood reconstruction work, to which he has no seeming connection (with the hedge that the KPA SOF has construction units which could contribute to such work), Pyongyang was telecasting that their SOF commander has direct, unfettered access to Kim. Characterizing Colonel General Kim Yong Bok as -commander- of KPA forces in Russia is deliberately ambiguous. It would lead many observers to assume that he will take up a field command role. From this perspective, Kim Jong Un is sending one of his best people to personally oversee the deployment. On the other hand, why would Kim subject a reliable, close aide with whom he presumably shares a good rapport into the line of fire? Moreover, three-star colonel generals do not command brigade-sized units. If Colonel General Kim has traveled to Russia, a more sensible interpretation would be that he is supervising the KPA SOF’s transition into the Ukraine theater and consolidating command and control over all KPA assets, including munitions technicians, in the Ukraine theater. He is also probably coordinating with Russian counterparts and creating a reporting framework between deployed personnel and Pyongyang.

North Korea Construction at the East and West Border Crossings	Just over a week since North Korea demolished the two main road and rail links connecting it to South Korea, commercial satellite imagery indicates work has begun on a new border fortification or obstacle where the road and railways once sat. On both the east and west sides of the Korean Peninsula, North Korean soldiers are clearing land and digging wide trenches with what appear to be concrete sides. The nature of the construction is uncertain, but the structures appear similar on each road. Together, they add a level of permanence to the severed cross-border infrastructure. West Coast Crossing The west coast crossing connected South Korea’s Dorasan border station with a North Korean road that led into the Kaesong Industrial Zone (also written as Kaesong Industrial Complex). The crossing is part of the Asian Highway 1 (AH-1), a United Nations-backed highway scheme that connects Tokyo in the east to Turkey in the west. While both South Korea and North Korea are signatories to the Asian Highway plan, driving through North Korea has only ever been theoretically possible. The section inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is approximately 4.7 kilometers (km) long and is fenced-in at either end. The South Korean border post is located immediately south of the gate, but the North Korean checkpoint is located one kilometer up the road, just before the Kaesong Industrial Zone. The military demarcation line (MDL) runs through the DMZ approximately 600 meters from the North Korean gate. It is marked by a slight change in the road surface and signs on each side of the line. The South Korean sign declared the beginning of Kaesong City and strikingly included the words -Good bye- in English. A few meters north, just over the MDL, a North Korean site informed the distance to Kaesong City was five km. The road has not regularly been used since the complex was shuttered in February 2016. Fences on either side have meant that, like much of the DMZ, the area rarely receives visitors. Around early December 2023, a series of trenches were dug across the road just north of the South Korean gate. Imagery from February 2024 shows the trenches measuring approximately 180 meters long, running between wooded areas on either side of the road. Their purpose is unclear, although they could be designed to stop traffic from traversing the road. Notably, the trenches appeared weeks before Kim Jong Un delivered his January 2024 speech, deeming South Korea an -enemy state.- However, it is not possible to determine if these two actions are linked. In mid-2024, the trenches appeared to have been filled in with dirt or other aggregate. On October 15, explosives ripped up the inter-Korean road and railway just a few meters north of the MDL. Footage released by the South Korean government shows North Korean workers clearing away the roadway debris using backhoes. The North Korean road sign declaring the distance to Kaesong City was also knocked down. Electrical power lines parallel the road, connecting the North to the South, although they have not transmitted electricity since 2018. It remains to be seen if they will stay in place or also be destroyed. Since the detonation, the excavation work has expanded. Imagery from October 17 shows a 50-meter portion of the roadway has been ripped up, and a trench is being dug across the area where the road and railway used to run. As of October 19, the trench was approximately 4 meters wide by 130 meters long. East Coast Crossing The east coast crossing was used to shuttle visitors from South Korea to the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone until tours ended in 2008. Like the west coast route, it has not seen any regular traffic in many years. Notionally, it makes up part of the AH-6 route that is meant to run from Busan, South Korea, to Russia’s border with Belarus. North and South Korea have gates on either side of this section of the DMZ as well, which measures approximately 1.3 kilometers. The MDL lies roughly 300 meters south of the North Korean gate. A single-track railway line runs along the west side of the road. Work also began here in December 2023 when a rectangular, dark brown area appeared on the road on the North Korean side of the MDL. There is no imagery record of what occurred just prior to this December activity, so it cannot be determined whether trenches similar to those on AH-1 had been dug to disrupt this stretch of the road surface. Regardless, the nature of this darkened stretch of road is unclear. The detonation occurred just over the MDL on the North Korean side, as it did on the west coast road. Imagery from October 23 shows similar work is taking place, with road clearance and a 140-meter-long trench dug across the road and railway line. The trench is approximately 5 meters wide. Other Roads There appear to be no recent changes to the roadways at Panmunjom and Arrowhead Hill. The former is required for North Korean vehicles to reach the Joint Security Area, while the latter was reconstructed in 2018 to aid an operation looking for remains of war. Earlier this year, the South Korean government said it had detected North Korean soldiers laying landmines along a portion of the road.

Russia-DPRK Relations: Strategic Partnership or Opportunistic Alliance?	Europe’s deadliest armed conflict in nearly 80 years has put Russia-DPRK relations into overdrive, with Russia’s need for outside assistance fueling the development of deep military cooperation. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) leader Kim Jong Un have established a personal rapport with each other, one driven in large measure by a shared animosity of US foreign policy and what both perceive—rightly or wrongly—to be an overbearing United States desperately seeking to maintain hegemony in Europe and East Asia. Two questions naturally arise. First, how deep does the Russia-DPRK relationship go? And second, can it now be categorized as an alliance in the same vein as what the United States shares with South Korea and Japan? The answers are not mutually exclusive; just because Moscow and Pyongyang are collaborating more seamlessly than they have in the past does not necessarily mean either one expects a full-scale alliance to be established as a result or that they are even interested in such an arrangement. What the two countries boast at the present moment is, if anything, a marriage of convenience fueled by self-interest, a desire to counter Washington’s strengthening of its own alliance system, and a firmly-held belief in Moscow and Pyongyang that the United States is trying to link the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe with its bilateral alliances in East Asia. The war in Ukraine, where Japan—which signed a 10-year security agreement with Kyiv in June with an accompanying $4.5 billion in non-military aid—and South Korea (to a more limited extent) are members of the US-organized sanctions regime against Russia, only reaffirms this belief in the minds of Russian and North Korean officials. North Korean Troops on Their Way to Ukraine US experts increasingly describe the Russia-DPRK relationship as a key node in a broader axis of authoritarians aiming to upend the so-called rules-based international order. News of North Korean troop deployments to Russia has reinforced the discourse. On October 17, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alleged that roughly 10,000 North Korean troops were being mobilized to join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, assessed that North Korean personnel would be ready to enter the fight by November 1. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service went a step further in its own assessment, claiming that 3,000 North Korean troops are already training inside Russia for combat operations. How those troops will be used is still a mystery. As Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin suggested, it is possible Putin could deploy the North Koreans as shock troops on the frontline, particularly in Donetsk, where ongoing Russian offensives near the Ukrainian towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokvrosk have caused extensive casualties on the Russian side. Others speculate that North Korean units might be stationed in Russia’s Kursk province, a portion of which the Ukrainian army continues to hold ground after a surprise August offensive, in order to free up Russian personnel for duties at the front. Yet for Washington and Seoul, how Russia chooses to deploy North Korean reinforcements is less important than the fact that Moscow and Pyongyang are now gearing up to fight on the same side. Even before news of the North Korean troop movements emerged, US Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell stressed that the Kim regime’s material support to the Russians was -creating further instability in Europe.- The Biden administration has spent well over a year arguing that the nexus between these two authoritarian powers is a danger not only to European stability but to the stability of East Asia as well. This is consistent with the emerging conventional theme percolating in Washington, Berlin, and Tokyo that security in Europe and Asia is inextricably linked. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration is even more emphatic about the risks of Russia-DPRK military ties, calling it both unacceptable and illegal given the multiple United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions prohibiting such activity, regardless of the treaty the two countries signed in June. On October 21, the South Korean Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul and demanded an immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops; a day later, the Yoon administration threatened to provide Ukraine with direct military assistance if military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang continued, a countermeasure Yoon reiterated personally this week. Such a course of action, however, is easier said than done for South Korea, which is barred by law from exporting lethal weapons to a country at war. Russia-DPRK Relations Rise to New Heights North Korean troops fighting in Ukraine would be an unprecedented situation. While Pyongyang has been involved in third-party conflicts in the past—North Korean pilots aided North Vietnam during the 1960s, for instance—never before has the Kim regime ordered so many North Korean ground personnel into a war that, objectively speaking, is of tertiary importance to North Korea’s own security. Whether or not Russia proves victorious in Ukraine is immaterial to the Kim regime’s longevity or Kim Jong Un’s own rule. The question, therefore, must be asked: knowing this, why would Pyongyang inject itself into a war of attrition over 4,200 miles away? The most straightforward explanation is that Kim is fully invested in bolstering his strategic relationship with Putin’s Russia and believes the cost of North Korean casualties—an inevitable result if the troops are sent to Donetsk—is worth the benefits of keeping Moscow close to Pyongyang. Although some will brand this as overly simplistic, there is some merit to the argument. North Korea, after all, has already been involved in Ukraine, albeit in an indirect capacity, since at least September 2022, when the first reports of North Korean munitions shipments to the Russian army surfaced publicly. According to C4ADS, a global security nonprofit, more than 74,000 metric tons of North Korean munitions were shipped to Russian ports in the Far East between August 2023 and January 2024. In August, South Korean military officials estimated that Pyongyang delivered 13,000 containers to Russia through the port in Rason, a significant uptick from the previous estimate of 7,000 containers in March. North Korean munitions factories are reportedly working around the clock to produce the basic munitions and artillery shells the Russian army needs to maintain its offensive in the face of formidable Ukrainian resistance. Moscow has also occasionally employed North Korean short-range ballistic missiles against Ukrainian targets, although their effectiveness is suspect. Outside of Ukraine, North Korea and Russia have elevated their bilateral relationship. Senior Russian and North Korean officials now meet on a fairly regular basis. In July 2023, a Russian military delegation led by then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu flew to the North Korean capital; two months later, Kim Jong Un made the trip to Russia’s far east, his first foreign visit in more than four years, where he toured the Vostochny Cosmodrome with Putin as well as an aircraft plant in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Putin’s June 2024 trip to North Korea was even more substantive in terms of deliverables, culminating in the signing of the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement that commits both sides to deeper collaboration in the military domain and mutual security assistance if either was attacked by a foreign power. The Kim regime, of course, is not doing any of this for free. Like any leader who makes an arrangement with another country, Kim is expecting the agreement to bring about benefits to his regime—in other words, Russia needs to compensate Pyongyang if it wants to maintain the present state of the relationship or improve it to new heights. Fortunately for the North Koreans, the Russian government is following through. On the political front, Russia’s obligations to North Korea are most prominently displayed at the UN Security Council, where Pyongyang is used to being ostracized by the great powers over any number of sins, from the development of its nuclear and missile programs to its ongoing human rights abuses. Due in large measure to Russia’s diplomatic support, the UNSC has become paralyzed on North Korea, with sessions on Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program having long descended into unproductive finger-pointing. The Russians (with backing from China) have repeatedly blocked the passage of new sanctions on North Korea at the Security Council and continue to call for an easing of sanctions for humanitarian purposes. This March, Moscow used its veto power to kill the UN Panel of Experts monitoring the implementation (and evasion) of sanctions against North Korea, an action that was also self-serving given Russia’s own sanctions violations, including the importation of North Korean arms and the export of refined petroleum above Security Council-mandated levels. With the Panel in tatters, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been forced to construct an alternative multilateral monitoring mechanism outside the UN system, adding to the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing the sanctions. A Hostile Alliance in the Making? Considering the state of the Russia-DPRK relationship today, prominent US foreign policy experts are increasingly employing the word -alliance- to categorize it. Still, others have boldly labeled the arrangement a -full-fledged military alliance circa [the] Cold War,- claiming the obligations embedded in the comprehensive strategic partnership accord will be durable over the long term. The pending deployment of thousands of North Korean foot soldiers to Russia will only amplify these arguments in the days and weeks to come. Yet -alliance- is a loaded term. It suggests, for instance, that Russia and North Korea have identical—or at least similar—values and interests, are obligated to fight for one another during a security crisis and at the very least will sustain current ties decades into the future. In reality, the strategic partnership is built on a weaker foundation than is presently assumed, motivated by a common adversary in the United States and fueled by a combination of desperation, convenience and a lack of other alternatives. Russia and North Korea are strengthening their bonds not out of a shared affinity for each other but rather because both sides view the relationship as in their respective self-interests. The unique geopolitical circumstances of the day help as well. Putin views Kim as useful for the moment, while Kim likely views Putin as a big chip to be played in his dance with Washington, Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing. North Korea’s direct participation in Ukraine is no exception to the rule. Russia’s foreign policy machinery and its defense-industrial base are now, seemingly, in complete service to the war in Ukraine. Every other Russian foreign and defense policy priority is subservient to the objective of winning the war or at least ending it on terms Moscow finds acceptable. Russia’s willingness to sustain such punishment for the sake of victory demonstrates just how vital the war is to the Russian political elite. The costs have been significant. Economically and politically, the war has burned Russia’s bridges to the West, which up until 2022 was Russia’s biggest buyer of crude oil, for the foreseeable future. Geopolitically, Moscow is more reliant on China than ever—and despite Chinese President Xi Jinping’s proclamations of a Russia-China partnership without limits, Beijing is seeking to exploit its superior position vis-à-vis Moscow to finalize bilateral projects—like the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline—on the cheap. Notwithstanding the recent territorial advances in Donetsk, Russia’s military losses are astronomical. While the accuracy of war-time projections should always be challenged, US officials gave a provisional tally of more than 600,000 Russian dead and wounded since the conflict began. September was reportedly the bloodiest month of the war for the Russians, with Moscow losing about 1,200 personnel a day. These casualties are coming at a time when Putin, wary of provoking unrest in places like Moscow and St. Petersburg, is doing everything short of a full-scale national mobilization to re-pad the Russian army’s ranks. While 12,000 North Korean soldiers will not do much to alleviate Russia’s workforce issues, their deployment would nevertheless give the Kremlin some additional time to reassess its options. Putin needs as many bodies as he can get, no matter where they come from or even how effective they may be on the battlefield. On the surface, Pyongyang looks like it gets the short end of the stick. North Korea, after all, is making most of the sacrifices. If reports are correct, the Kim regime is making a deliberate decision to potentially sacrifice thousands of its own citizens in a war whose outcome will not impact North Korea’s security situation. Yet it is not a total loss for the Kim regime either; indeed, if it were, Kim would not consider a deployment, let alone authorize it. First, any North Korean troops sent to fight in Ukraine will acquire the kind of battlefield experience that the Korean People’s Army (KPA) currently lacks. This should not be understated; the last time the KPA fought a large-scale conventional conflict was the 1950-1953 Korean War. The Kim regime has devoted a significant portion of its annual gross domestic product to its military and weapons of mass destruction programs in the seven decades since but remains grossly under-funded and under-equipped on the key defense platforms—fighter and bomber aircraft, air defense systems and logistics infrastructure to name a few—required to wage a successful military campaign. Indeed, one of the primary reasons why the Kim regime spends so lavishly on its nuclear and missile programs is because the KPA’s conventional capability is qualitatively inferior to its adversaries. Assisting the Russians in Ukraine can provide the KPA with the institutional knowledge of what systems, tactics and procedures are needed for modern-day warfare. Second and just as importantly, the Kim regime wants Russia in its corner. Moscow’s support is a geopolitical coup for Pyongyang, granting North Korea more flexibility and freedom of maneuver in relation to its dealings with the United States and China alike. Comfortable that it can rely on Moscow’s support, North Korea is even less worried about additional economic sanctions today than it normally is. More specifically, Pyongyang is likely receiving technology it has long coveted to develop its military satellite program, a core component of Kim’s defense modernization plans. And as relations with Russia strengthen, Kim reduces the vulnerability that comes with dependence on China, a country whose own relationship with North Korea goes through periods of romance and frostiness. Conclusion There is no doubt Russia-DPRK relations are at their most elevated in years, if not decades. North Korean troop deployments to Russia, North Korean arms shipments to the Russian army, Moscow’s support of Pyongyang’s position in international forums and the regular meetings between Russian and North Korean officials are a testament to this state of affairs. However, international relations is a fickle beast, and history has proven that countries aligned today may find themselves unaligned tomorrow. As long as the war in Ukraine persists, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are unlikely to have that problem. But when the war does end—and it will eventually end—the commonalities now binding Moscow and Pyongyang could give way to divergences.

North Korean Troops in Russia: What Are They Doing There?	On October 17, South Korean intelligence disclosed that several thousand North Korean troops had apparently begun training in Russia, presumably for deployment to Ukraine. This was later confirmed by other reporting, including the US Department of Defense. There are several reasons why such an arrangement might be considered beneficial by both countries—and concerning to the rest of the world. After the two governments signed a mutual defense treaty in June 2024, this news highlights the cooperation but raises questions about why the world’s third-largest army, which outnumbers its adversary considerably and has been promoting a narrative that it is winning, needs help at this time. The appearance of North Korean forces in Russia points to both a deepening of security cooperation between dictatorships and increasing desperation on the Russian side. What Is in It for Russia Obviously, part of the answer is that Russia is not winning, at least not to the degree that Vladimir Putin would have the world believe, but it should also be increasingly clear that Moscow really needs help. Generally, there are three ways in which the North Korean deployment can help Russia. The most mundane way is labor. Despite the North Korean troops involved being labeled -special forces,- they are less experienced in battle and generally trained on older equipment than the Russian and Ukrainian forces that have been fighting for over two years. The North Koreans might be seen as more suited to low-skilled labor than combat roles. Employing North Koreans for manual labor could free up Russians for military duties and help keep defense industry production. Russia is already experiencing labor shortages and has tried to recruit workers from South Asian countries to fill vacant jobs. Russia also can make a strong case for employing North Koreans in combat roles. An expert on the Soviet military once described the Russian way of war as -playing chess with two sets of pawns,- meaning always having a larger number of expendable troops than an adversary.[1] For centuries, Russian tactics have been based, in part, on being able to absorb more casualties than any opponent. Reports from the front in Ukraine would seem to bear this out, with evidence that conscripts are taking casualties at much higher rates than -contract- soldiers. It could be that with casualty rates high from recent offensive operations, the Russian leadership would prefer to have someone else in the line of fire. In a war of attrition, the deciding factor will not be who controls various villages, but which side can tolerate the toll of deaths and wounds the longest. Russian generals know their history and are aware that in 1917, the Russian army, despite numerical superiority, grew tired of wasting lives and essentially stopped fighting. By having North Koreans do some dying in place of Russians, the Kremlin may hope to delay a similar collapse. What’s more, the employment of foreign forces, whether in combat or combat support, points to a level of desperation in Moscow. Having failed to unseat the Ukrainian government in 2022, Russia turned to a strategy of attrition aimed at portraying the war as unwinnable for Ukraine to try to persuade governments supporting Kyiv that they were wasting resources. All the while, Russia has made regular use of nuclear threats to raise the perceived risk of helping Ukraine and encouraged the idea that Ukraine should be forced to swallow a -land for peace- arrangement. While nuclear threats have led Western governments to place limits on assistance to Ukraine, Moscow’s strategy has not had much success. Since late 2023, Russian forces have generally taken the offensive, making minor territorial gains at a heavy cost. By mid-2024, the Russian army was advertising higher bonuses for enlistment, indicating that recruiting could be growing more difficult. All these developments could indicate that the Kremlin is feeling pressure to end the war in the coming months before it runs short on troops and materiel to maintain its offensive. Adding contingents from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) could provide more time for the strategy to work and for Ukraine’s supporters to abandon Kyiv. Western opponents of aid to Ukraine will point to the presence of DPRK forces as further evidence that the war is going badly, and Russian aggression should be considered a fait accompli and renew calls for a ceasefire on Russian terms. What Is in It for North Korea It is also important to consider what North Korea could gain from sending its soldiers to die in Ukraine. Apart from any sort of monetary payment, deployment to Russia would allow DPRK troops to train with and perhaps use in combat, more modern equipment. Any such benefit may be limited by the way Russian commanders would expect to use troops perceived as expendable but could remain an incentive to Pyongyang. Benefits from training and combat experience, however, would only be useful for those troops that make it home, and, given the Russian army’s lackluster battlefield performance, would be unlikely to change the military balance in Korea. Sources from the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea) have reported that Russia has found the DPRK soldiers to be lacking an understanding of modern warfare. Facing a pronounced qualitative disadvantage relative to the ROK, the North is likely receiving more advanced military technology from Russia as payment for North Korean lives. With an uneven record in tests over the last two years, ballistic missile technology may be high on Kim Jong Un’s wish list. Such missiles have relatively little conventional military value but, as delivery systems, are key components of North Korea’s nuclear option. Conclusion Improvement to both North Korea’s conventional and nuclear forces should be of serious concern for stability on the Korean Peninsula. An alteration of the military balance could lead to more aggressive adventurism from Kim Jung Un. Although importing North Korean forces to fight in Ukraine seems a fairly desperate measure, it has important longer-term implications in Korea and beyond. Russia is fighting a war of aggression in which it routinely uses nuclear threats to achieve its aims. Should it succeed with assistance from nuclear-armed North Korea, it will set a disturbing precedent for nuclear-aided aggression that could be repeated in Northeast Asia.

North Korea’s Importance for Putin’s -Turn to the East-	While attention rightly centers on China’s vital role in Vladimir Putin’s -Turn to the East,- now in its 12th year, little notice has been taken of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK or North Korea) importance for the -Turn.- After China, North Korea is one of two states—along with India—of greatest significance for Putin’s initiative for no less than four reasons. They reflect the security and identity aims of the -Turn.- They also are testimony to the complexity of Sino-Russian relations—close but often distrustful.[1] First, the -Turn- revives the -Grand Strategic Triangle- of the Cold War era, demonstrating to the United States and China that Russia is a powerful force with which they must reckon. It is steeped in the logic of Soviet foreign policy, for which North Korea was a vital element. Second, after initial wavering in Stage One of the -Turn to the East- from 2012 to early 2014, it increasingly targeted the US alliances with South Korea and Japan, treated reminiscent of the Cold War, as is North Korea. If some initially pointed to economics as the priority, rightly recognizing a focus on exports of energy, investments and modernization of the Russian Far East were secondary aims. Third, no state is more welcoming to the Russian agenda than North Korea and more eager to covet its assets: arms technology, energy, and foodstuffs. Further, Pyongyang wholeheartedly endorses Putin’s aggressive behavior. Finally, the national identity component of the -Turn- necessitates a partner other than China to vindicate such claims as Eurasianism, multipolarity, equality of great powers, and unique civilization. Too much one-sided dependence on China strips Russia of the identity justifications it keeps making, vital to claims Putin insists are key. To understand the evolution of the -Turn to the East,- we need look no further than articles by Russians over the past twelve years.[2] Cozying up to North Korea in 2023-2024 is a continuation of the fourth stage. Below, I outline the stages with new focus on North Korea’s role and the four reasons for pursuing the North.[3] Embracing North Korea fits into a broader Russian strategy than simply gaining support for the Ukraine war. Along with forging a close but at times contentious relationship with China, it harks back to aspirations of the 1950s and targets a world where US might and alliances are put under siege. In the absence of a regional security framework aimed at undermining these alliances and giving Russia veto power, the desired outcome is a polarized Northeast Asia in which Moscow and Beijing each cultivate ties with Pyongyang without succumbing to a Sinocentric agenda. Fearful of security threats, Seoul and Tokyo find themselves obliged to accommodate Russia’s interests to a substantial degree. The closer Moscow’s ties to Pyongyang, the more leverage it expects over US allies as well as China. North Korea and the Four Stages of the -Turn to the East- We need to look back to the Six Party Talks for early signs of Russian thinking about North Korea’s significance. Russians saw an opportunity to be -very helpful- to the North in adjusting to -new economic, political, and social realities- in a -long, slow period of mutual accommodation of North and South.-[4] Russia would modernize factories built by the Soviets, absorb the North’s workforce, provide its energy, upgrade its armed forces, and be the ideal partner in its complex dealings with China and Japan (as well as the United States).[5] -At stake…is not only the security of Russia’s eastern flank but also its prospects…in the geopolitical and economic upsurge of the world’s most dynamic region.-[6] Anticipating a new structure in which Moscow had a critical voice—reinforced by organizing the Six Party Talks fifth working group on peace and security in Northeast Asia—Russians saw its reemergence as a major player in regional affairs, -holding the forces of globalization at a distance.-[7] Failure of the talks necessitated a new agenda in Asia. Stage One of Putin’s -Turn to the East- in 2012-2014 focused less on North Korea but recognized the fact that Abe Shinzo in wooing Putin, and Park Geun-hye in advancing her -Eurasian Initiative,- saw Russia as a partner in managing North Korea as well as in limiting China’s ambitions.[8] Its emphasis on both multipolarity, including US allies, and modernization of the Russian Far East, attracting investments from diverse sources, held promise for Russian-DPRK ties, even if diplomacy was stalled in the transition to Kim Jong Un. Seeking a place for Russia in a booming region, Putin aimed less to transform than to adjust regional dynamics, centering first on China. After annexing Crimea and advancing in eastern Ukraine, Putin, in Stage Two, 2014-2017, chose a more aggressive approach to Northeast Asia, seeking to reshape it through -docking- with China in infrastructure and bonding with North Korea. Troubled Sino-DPRK ties left an opening, pursued along with lingering diplomacy with Japan and South Korea, despite lower expectations. Frustration was mounting, however, as Beijing outmaneuvered Moscow in joint plans and Kim Jong Un, as he built up his nuclear and missile capabilities, saw little benefit in prioritizing a breakthrough with Putin. The -turn to North Korea- seemed to be at an impasse after Putin acquiesced to Xi Jinping’s decision in late 2017 to toughen up UN sanctions on it. Stage Three, 2018-2021, started slowly for Russia as it was marginalized in the diplomacy between Kim Jong Un and both Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in. Putin pressed China to agree to his plan for a -Greater Eurasian Partnership,- but Xi did not coordinate on India and ASEAN, his Central Asia moves were suspect, and claims of coordination over North Korea were of uncertain value. As Xi regained his footing through repeated summits with Kim Jong Un, Putin was finally able to host Kim. -Delighted- with the failure of the Hanoi summit and with signs Sino-US relations were in a new Cold War, Putin, however, found there was no room left to play the -North Korea- card when North Korea in early 2020 shut its borders to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak. While diplomacy with Pyongyang drew little outside attention, the urgency of a breakthrough was growing. Putin was set on stirring up Cold War divisions; he was intent on demonstrating he had options other than China and was determined to put security at the forefront. With further deterioration in Sino-US relations in the pandemic year 2020 and with the start of the Biden administration’s pushback against China, US minilateralism at last promised to give Putin the opening he sought. Camp David trilateralism defied China, Russia, and North Korea demands. The language in Russian publications in 2019-2021 both appealed to China to join in a new Cold War and searched for a way to affirm Russia’s standing in a world not exclusively dominated by two great powers.[9] Although the Russian ambassador remained in Pyongyang during the period it closed its borders, there was scant diplomacy to vindicate high hopes. Yet commentaries on what went wrong at the Hanoi summit and on North Korea’s case for security made sympathies clear. With no renewed US diplomacy toward the North and China keeping up pressure despite relaxing some enforcement of sanctions, Russia would have to take matters into its own hands. Stage Four from 2022 saw Putin unleash full-scale war in Ukraine as he revved up the -Turn to the East- through China with the intent to add North Korea to the mix. His war of attrition made the case for tightening ties to North Korea stronger. Aggression in the West did not come at the expense of ambitions in the East; it complemented them. Four reasons justified a breakthrough with the North: reviving the Grand Strategic Triangle, targeting US alliances in East Asia, welcoming North Korea’s agenda as in Russia’s interest, and reconceptualizing national identity. Reviving the Grand Strategic Triangle After 45 years of grandiose claims of being one of two superpowers, Moscow acclimated to the post-Cold War. It rejected any junior status to the United States and, encouraged by Beijing, from the mid-1990s, grasped for a strategic triangle with the two. A sharp break with the West was required, given Russia’s diminished standing. In the East, the challenge was to draw close to China, proving Russia’s value against the United States, while seeking some balance elsewhere in Asia. Japan and South Korea failed the test, being too close to Washington and opposed by China. India looked promising, but the Indian backlash against China after their 2020 skirmish and growing security ties to the United States reduced its value. North Korea fit the bill well, given its ambivalent but essential ties to China and its security obsession, raising the variable most critical for strategic triangle maneuvering. Putin recognized its value in his surprise visit to Pyongyang in 2000; his attempted diplomatic intervention in January 2003, when he sent a deputy foreign minister to Pyongyang in an attempt to put Russia at the center of resolving the nuclear crisis; his hopes in the Six Party Talks for the fifth working group chaired by Moscow; his response in 2010 to the Cheonan sinking; and his overtures to Kim Jong Un in 2014 to 2017 (e.g., showcasing him at the 70th anniversary victory day parade on May 9, 2015, before Kim changed his mind about attending, and blaming Seoul, not Pyongyang, when plans for large-scale coal trade from Khasan through Rajin collapsed). Failure of the 2019 Hanoi summit renewed hope. Instead of a blitzkrieg success in Ukraine affirming the revival of the Grand Strategic Triangle to be taken seriously by Washington and Beijing, a war of attrition left Russia as a wobbly leg of the triangle in an even more asymmetrical relationship with China.[10] Isolated in Europe, it needed autonomous standing in Asia. North Korea boosted the Grand Strategic Triangle image: 1) raising the salience of nuclear weapons; 2) adding an arms trade partner affecting the war balance; and 3) making Beijing and Washington take its impact on regional security seriously. The legacy of communist thinking, i.e., the Soviet worldview, endures in grandiose claims to be on the top step of the global ladder.[11] Apart from Belarus, there is no country more welcoming to the reassertion of this old identity than North Korea. The more Moscow defines itself as a peer to Washington and Beijing, the more room for maneuvering Pyongyang expects to enjoy. Targeting US Alliances in East Asia Too little attention has been paid to the increasingly negative thinking in Moscow from 2014 toward both Japan and South Korea, whose leaders were too bent on wooing Putin to register the degree of disdain manifest on the other side. It was not until 2022 when both US allies were designated -non-friendly countries,- that waning hopes faded.[12] Commentaries on the end of World War II and the Korean War had long since hardened.[13] Russians may have dangled hope before Park Geun-hye, Moon Jae-in, and Abe Shinzo, but narratives pointed to an unbridgeable gap. History had become an obsession for Putin, was repeatedly cited by Foreign Minister Lavrov, and became intertwined in assessments of bilateral relations. Recognizing the justice of the seizure of four islands never before under Russian control suddenly became a prerequisite for reaching a peace agreement with Japan, complicating talks beyond rigidity on the territorial issue in Moscow. By not accepting that it was a defeated state, restricted in its security agenda, Japan was deemed a revisionist, militarist country trying to disrupt the regional order.[14] Unsaid was that part of that order was a divided Korea, brought about by the same Red Army that had -defeated- Japan. Japan’s aspirations for influence on the Korean Peninsula or reunification at odds with the wishes of the North Korean regime likewise did not jibe with its required status. No less unacceptable were South Korean challenges to the -natural order- left from the Soviet Union’s glorious victories, in cahoots with US ambitions to arouse a -color revolution- in North Korea. As the cult of victory in World War II became Putin’s fixation, the Korean War narrative of helping North Korea fend off US imperialism emerged as a useful addendum. The internal workings of North Korea, including human rights, faded from view in the narrative about a regional order established through blood and sacrifice and serving national interests. In the background loomed the ally of South Korea, moving it as a pawn as it also did with another country supposedly lacking full sovereignty, Japan. Removal of US bases came to be seen as the starting point for an independent foreign policy, which would open the door to problem-solving. Welcoming North Korea’s Agenda as in Russia’s Interest Moscow needed a partner hostile to the status quo, wary of China but unwilling to antagonize its neighbor, and helpful in meeting arms or perhaps labor needs. It did not need to replace the many benefits its quasi-alliance with China provides. China long seemed too dependent on ties to the West to join Russia openly or fully in challenging the existing order. It also had aspirations of drawing Russia into excessive dependency through the Belt and Road Initiative and turning Central Asia from Russia’s sphere of influence inimical to Putin’s ambitions. A troika with India would have been ideal, but India grew too wary of China and too intent on boosting ties with the United States, Japan, and other targets of Russian hostility. North Korea served different goals. In 2024, the economic dimension of cooperation with North Korea has changed, if not as much as the security dimension. Interest in navigation on the Tumen River has reemerged, something China covets but requires North Korean buy-in. The Northern Sea Route, passing along North Korea en route to the Arctic Ocean, is moving ahead. Vladivostok, near the border with North Korea, is opening to transit trade from China. Russians are talking earnestly about bringing large numbers of North Korean workers into their country after complying with sanctions by returning some workers. Much depends on China, now applying pressure on the North to clarify its path. Reconceptualizing Russian National Identity North Korea symbolizes the extension of Moscow’s power into East Asia. In the 1960s-1980s, it was the lone outpost of what Soviets considered their sphere of influence in the neighboring states of Northeast Asia. Complete loss of clout in the 1990s, as diplomacy around the North unfolded, became the foremost sign of regional irrelevance. No wonder, in 2000, Putin stopped in Pyongyang on the way to a G8 summit in Japan as his first demonstration that Russia was making a comeback. The collapse of communism and the Soviet Union left a void in Russian national identity, which Putin is filling with Eurasianism at the forefront. Much as the Sino-Soviet split was treated as a secondary identity theme to the clash with the West and leadership in the communist bloc, the notion of Eurasianism does not rest primarily on Sino-Russian camaraderie. It is an assertion of Russian power and civilization in an Asian context. Ignoring the reality of North Korea, a vision has emerged of it as a valued partner, which reinforces Russia’s identity as an Asian power. Conclusion It is difficult to predict the timing and degree of Putin’s overtures to Kim Jong Un had Putin not launched his full-scale war in Ukraine. Without an urgent need for arms imports, Putin would presumably have taken smaller steps. Yet the logic of pursuing a breakthrough with Kim would have remained. Putin needed to move to a more assertive -Turn to the East- by 2022, given the reasons cited above. In Stage One, he tried a multi-pronged approach that proved contradictory and inadequate to reach his goals. In Stage Two, his outreach to Kim Jong Un fell short, and he had become so reliant on Xi Jinping that he saw no alternative to alienating Kim by agreeing to tough United Nations Security Council sanctions. Marginalized in the diplomacy of 2018, Putin prepared for a new stage in his -Turn to the East- together with a newly aggressive Xi Jinping but seeking more. Attacking Ukraine poked the West in the eye; allying with North Korea delivered a new punch. It also served as a reminder to China that asymmetric dependency is not a license to act at will.

North Korea’s Post-Parliament Tension Signaling	Predicting North Korea’s next moves can be risky, even for the most seasoned and careful experts who base their analysis on a robust baseline of relevant data. Cases in point are the latest Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) session held on October 7 and 8, and the steps North Korea has since taken. The general assessment was that Pyongyang would remove unification-related language and define North Korea’s territory in a constitutional revision at the SPA session—probably with Kim giving a policy speech, as he has done at all fall SPA sessions since 2021.[1] Many North Korea watchers, including myself, had also predicted that inter-Korean tensions would inevitably increase as a result of North Korea’s announcement—and probably enforcement—of its new borders. Contrary to these widespread expectations, North Korean media’s readout of the latest SPA meeting did not mention any of these topics, focusing instead on economic issues. And in lieu of addressing the SPA, Kim made a rare visit to the University of National Defense, where he gave a speech with a heavy nuclear focus. As a result, speculation abounded in the days that followed about whether North Korea revised the constitution related to unification and North Korean territory. Even more surprising and significant than the outcome of the SPA session itself is what followed. North Korea demolished sections of the inter-Korean roads and railways and issued a flurry of angry statements on alleged South Korean drone incursions into Pyongyang airspace, escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In the first week after the SPA session, it appeared that North Korea was not ready for a major confrontation with Seoul. However, its demolition of the inter-Korean roads and railways and belated implication of a constitutional revision defining -the ROK as a hostile state- may signal a turn of events.[2] In that vein, Kim Jong Un’s nuclear rhetoric in recent days, reinforced by his sister Kim Yo Jong’s statement, may be cause for concern. Upping the Ante Prior to its announcement of the road and railway demolition, Pyongyang’s handling of the border question suggested it was not ready to confront South Korea over the definition of its border or address it with its own people. This included the fact that no details were provided about the constitutional revisions passed at the October SPA session (other than the revisions adjusting people’s working and voting ages), and that North Korea’s announcement of its plan to sever all inter-Korean roads and railways was disseminated to external audiences only. By contrast, North Korea was much more vocal about the alleged South Korean drone incursions, even sharing relevant statements with the domestic populace despite the apparent sensitivities surrounding the military’s failure to protect the Pyongyang airspace. Yet, similar to the North’s treatment of the border issue, the initial set of statements suggested the country did not wish to escalate tensions with Seoul beyond what was necessary. The warnings were all conditional and left room for de-escalation. Placing eight artillery brigades on -standby to open fire- in case of recurrence paled compared to the -wartime state- of frontline units in August 2015. Even North Korean media’s coverage of the people’s reaction for the first two days was underwhelming in volume and tone when compared to the intensive anti-South Korea campaign in June 2020. However, an unusual meeting of top defense and security officials convened by Kim Jong Un on October 14 marked a turning point. North Korea destroyed sections of the inter-Korean roads and railways the day after the meeting, presumably in response to Kim’s instructions on -immediate military activities.-[3] It was after this meeting that North Korea announced the demolition of the railways and roads to its own people as well as to external audiences. It was also after this meeting that Pyongyang implied the constitution had been revised to redefine South Korea, in line with Kim’s new two Koreas policy.[4] These were both notable shifts from North Korea’s previous positions. Although state media readout of the October 14 meeting did not provide much detail, there were certain references, such as Kim giving tasks on the -operation of the war deterrent and the exercise of the right to self-defense,- that raise concern about the potential for further escalation of tensions. In fact, since Kim’s meeting was reported, North Korean media coverage of the drones has taken on a militant tone, with state media reporting that 1.4 million people have volunteered to join the Korean People’s Army (KPA). Additionally, since the publication of the demolition report, there has been an uptick in media coverage of the people’s reactions to the drones, some even slipping in criticism of the United States. This behavior is normal during inter-Korean tensions—for example, state media as recently as March 2023 carried similar reports on joining the army—but it is worth watching how North Korea covers public sentiment in the coming days. Furthermore, during a visit to the frontline Second Corps on October 17, Kim reviewed their -military action plans- that apparently included Seoul. He described South Korea as -a foreign country and an apparent hostile country- and reiterated his conditional warning of attack against the South, reinforcing his two Koreas policy.[5] These actions and comments by themselves may not be new or remarkable, but they become significant when viewed in tandem with the ongoing tensions. Kim’s Nuclear Rhetoric In one of her statements on the drones, Kim Yo Jong referred to North Korea as -a nuclear weapons state- and claimed the United States should be held accountable for the alleged South Korean drone incursions. Under normal circumstances, this uncharacteristically short statement may have been written off as simply odd, but it echoes Kim Jong Un’s nuclear rhetoric in recent days. This, coupled with the summoning of the United States in the North’s propaganda on the drone incursions, merits a closer review of Kim’s nuclear rhetoric. Pyongyang carried out a carefully choreographed campaign between early August and mid-September to underscore the country’s nuclear capabilities and justify the importance of prioritizing defense development over the civilian economy despite difficult circumstances and limited resources. Notably, Kim delivered an unusual National Day speech, which focused heavily on continued expansion of the country’s nuclear capabilities. The speech was quickly followed by his first publicized visit to a uranium enrichment facility. Kim picked up on the nuclear theme again in the days running up to, and on the first day of, the latest SPA session. However, his nuclear rhetoric took a tougher turn. Speaking to special operations units—his second visit to a special operations forces training facility in three weeks—Kim Jong Un made personal attacks on the South Korean president for showing off -their military muscle at the doorstep of a state possessing nuclear weapons- during the previous day’s military parade. He then warned that -the DPRK will use without hesitation all the striking forces in its possession, including nuclear weapons,- against South Korea if it uses military force to violate North Korea’s sovereignty. This was an unusually direct threat of nuclear use, despite Kim’s emphasis on the word -if,- its weight redoubled due to the attribution to Kim himself. North Korea typically uses a more indirect formulation, -the second mission- of nuclear weapons, to indicate preemptive nuclear use. For example, Kim, in a speech at an SPA session in January, said, -the second mission of our nuclear force.- Kim issued virtually the same conditional warning about nuclear use in his speech at the University of National Defense on October 7—presumably after he had been briefed on the first drone incursion on October 3. Notably, Kim repeated a theme he has stressed since early August—that North Korea faces serious security challenges because -the ROK-U.S. military alliance has completely changed into a nuclear alliance.- This, when viewed in conjunction with Kim’s pledge in the same speech that North Korea would -never tolerate the balance of strength being disturbed on the Korean peninsula,- seems to imply the North may act decisively if it judges that the -balance- is about to be or has been disrupted. North Korea’s official statements and commentaries since mid-August have linked US security arrangements with its allies and partners to the disruption of the balance of power in the region. During his October 17 visit to the Second Corps, Kim Jong Un reiterated the possibility of retaliation against South Korea if its sovereignty is violated (but omitting the use of -nuclear weapons-) and again stressed the implications of the US-South Korea alliance’s -changed nature- for North Korea’s security. Conclusion The ongoing situation makes the North’s motives and next possible moves particularly challenging to assess because of its highly unusual circumstances: violation of the capital’s airspace and North Korea’s disclosure of it. This places not only North Korea watchers but also North Korea itself in unchartered territory. Another potential twist in this story is Russia’s unequivocal support for Pyongyang amid rising tensions. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused South Korea of a -reckless and provocative campaign- and echoed Pyongyang’s line that the alleged South Korean drone incursions were a violation of North Korea’s sovereignty. The Russian deputy foreign minister went further and said Russia will provide military assistance to North Korea if it comes under attack as per the new North Korea-Russia treaty. This deepening policy coordination between the two countries could affect Kim’s calculus as he thinks about his next steps. Kim proclaimed to his own people in January 2024 that -if the ROK violates even 0.001 mm of our territorial land, air and waters, it will be considered a war provocation.- This likely has not been forgotten by the North Korean army or the people, and Kim will need to handle the situation in a way that does not make him look weak. We should also recall that two border issues have come up thus far: land (the road and railway demolition and continued work to -fortify- the border areas) and air (drone incursions). It may only be a matter of time before tensions over the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean maritime boundary line that Kim has called -illegal,- rear their head again.
