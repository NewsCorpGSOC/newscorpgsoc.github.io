Why and How Estimates of North Korean GDP by the Bank of Korea Are Deceptive	The most commonly used indicator to gauge a country’s economic capacity and well-being is Gross Domestic Product (GDP). GDP is defined as -the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.- It measures the flow of money based on transactions in a market economy, where income and expenditure should be equal. In the case of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea), the Bank of Korea’s (BOK) estimates are the most widely cited metrics by international organizations and policy actors when assessing the DPRK’s economic situation. However, these numbers can be deceptive as the BOK uses the production approach to estimate North Korea’s GDP, which does not reflect its actual economic situation. Even though the BOK’s use of the production approach has flaws when measuring the DPRK’s GDP, other approaches are also insufficient. The biggest deficiency in current estimative approaches is the inability to properly account for the state procuring goods and services without payment or at a fraction of the cost, undermining the market principle that income should equal expenditure—a common trait among communist states. Because the North Korean regime does not disclose reliable information on its economy and resorts to widespread extraction of labor, conventional economic thinking cannot be applied to assess its economic reality. At the same time, the country’s dependence on an extractive system is increasingly risky, as most other instances of this approach have led to a state’s demise. How Bank of Korea Estimates Mislead According to the BOK, the real GDP of the DPRK declined by 8.4 percent from 2017 to 2022. Many have disputed these estimates: Korea Economic Institute of America Senior Advisor William Brown has suggested retiring the BOK’s report because of these inaccuracies. In addition, Seoul National University’s Professor Byung-Yeon Kim has argued that household income in North Korea actually fell by half between 2017 and 2022, according to testimonies from defectors, resulting in GDP decreasing by 25 percent. Despite acknowledging the BOK’s flaws, no one has fully captured why and how the BOK’s GDP figures are so misleading. A closer look into the different approaches to estimating a nation’s GDP coupled with an analysis of the impact of labor extraction in North Korea is essential to grasp the discrepancies. In general, there are three ways economists measure GDP: the production approach, the income approach, and the expenditure approach. In market economies, when using any approach, the GDP calculated in principle would be the same. The BOK implements the production approach when assessing North Korea’s economic performance by -using the basic data on production quantities supplied by relevant institutions…with the use of South Korea’s prices and value-added ratios.- However, this approach does not account for labor extraction, where, either voluntarily or through coercion, workers contribute labor to produce goods and services in North Korea for free or at a highly discounted rate. This should be interpreted as a -hidden tax- on labor where the worker’s time is redirected by the state, thereby causing the worker to lose earning potential while the state collects returns on the worker’s outputs. The BOK’s estimation assumes no extraction of labor and thus shows an artificial increase in the value added to the economy, skewing estimates of its economic activity. The Difficulties of Measuring North Korea’s GDP Of the three major approaches to measuring GDP, each presents distinct flaws when applied to North Korea. The Production Approach The BOK uses South Korean prices in its estimates, which distorts changes in North Korean prices. Since the 2017 sanctions, North Korea has experienced a sustained trade deficit due to decreased exports, causing a drop in government revenue and the rise of the foreign exchange rate, resulting in inflation—a phenomenon that is overlooked when using South Korean prices. This can be illustrated by the 2019 data, which shows a trade deficit of $2.69 billion, or 9.5 percent of North Korea’s nominal GDP, as estimated by the BOK. Yet that same year, the BOK stated that GDP grew by 0.4 percent. In reality, the real income of North Koreans has sharply declined due to inflation and a sharply declining won-dollar exchange rate. All in all, North Korean GDP is overstated by the BOK. The Income Approach The income approach aggregates income from household wages, dividends, rent from private properties, and interest. In North Korea, the state owns the means of production; there is no stock market, property rights, or banking system. Therefore, national income can only amount to aggregate household income, composed of economic activity in the shadow economy and government-paid wages, representing a fraction of the market wage because of labor extraction. For example, Ri Il Gyu, a former high-ranking North Korean diplomat and recent defector, claimed to earn only the equivalent of $500 monthly while working in Cuba and $0.30 monthly in North Korea. Consequently, he was compelled to engage in the shadow economy via smuggling to make up for his low income and support his family. Not accounting for labor extraction in the income approach will result in a much lower GDP figure than the production approach. This is confirmed by empirical research, including testimonies I gathered in July 2024 from North Korean defectors who arrived in South Korea in October 2023, verifying the intensification of labor extraction and the precipitated decline in state-provided wages during the COVID period. Professor Kim had similar findings and concluded that the GDP decreased by 25 percent between 2017 and 2022. The BOK’s approach clearly overstates real income in the DPRK, thereby exaggerating GDP. The Expenditure Approach The expenditure approach estimates GDP by summing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. The BOK’s approach overstates North Korean GDP compared to the expenditure approach in several key ways. First, output produced without due compensation via extraction would logically result in both decreased government expenditure, as the government does not pay for labor, and household income, as individuals are not paid for their labor. Decreased household income results in lower household consumption, which, therefore, impacts the population’s economic well-being. Such a phenomenon is not effectively captured in the BOK’s estimation, which inflates the GDP. Second, the expenditure approach is the only open model incorporating foreign trade, the bulk of which is with China, providing a lifeline to the regime and ensuring its survival. Exports are the largest source of North Korea’s government revenue, so its sustained trade deficit causes government revenue to decrease and impacts the types of output North Korea can produce. The sustained trade deficit causes the foreign exchange rate to increase and prices to rise. Yet, the BOK’s approach does not account for this as it uses South Korean prices and does not consider net exports. Accounting for Extraction The DPRK uses the extraction of labor on a large scale. As an example, news reports in May 2024 showed students, from those in elementary school to those in university, being forced to transplant rice seedlings for no pay as part of the state-mandated farm assistance period. By forcing people to work for no income, much of the DPRK’s economic activity is not captured in traditional GDP data. As the foreign exchange rate rises and the budget deficit deepens, the DPRK must compensate for this by printing money, eventually leading to inflation. However, instead of resorting to printing money, the regime has relied more and more on labor extraction, which is not accounted for in the BOK’s estimation. Finally, in the DPRK, investment can only come from the government as the inability of individuals to save precludes private investment. Revenue must exceed expenditure to ensure net investment from the government into the economy—without sustained investment, the country’s economic capacity will contract, and depreciation will occur, resulting in eroding infrastructure, the contraction of productive capacity, and pervasive adverse effects on the economy in the long run. The DPRK resolves this through extraction, both when paying workers a fraction of the market wage or when procuring goods and services below the market value. By not taking into account all these factors and using the production approach, the BOK’s estimate overstates North Korea’s GDP. Conclusion Each approach to estimating a state’s GDP has its own blind spots, and all of them fail to illustrate North Korea’s dire economic situation. Its accumulated trade deficit after the increased sanctions in 2017 and self-imposed COVID-19 isolation in 2020 forced Kim Jong Un to deplete the foreign exchange reserves and rely on hacking, smuggling, and other illegal activities to replenish its diminishing coffers. The future of the DPRK is bleak, and the regime has no other choice but to rely on labor extraction and harsh repression of its people. Pyongyang’s increased belligerence internationally is merely a sign of the regime’s desperation to enhance its economic plight and ensure the survival of its extractive system. Recent Nobel Prize laureates Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson explained in their book Why Nations Fail that extractive systems, like the one in North Korea, impede economic development because the economy’s benefits accrue to only a few chosen members of the ruling class and are not shared among people. Therefore, it should be noted that the economic failure of extractive systems is not an indictment of the people in that country but a system that, throughout history, has consistently failed. North Korea must replace its extractive system with an inclusive one if it is to achieve real economic development and avoid collapse.

Quick Take: North Korea’s Coverage of Russian War Against Ukraine	In a speech at a Korean People’s Army conference on November 15, Kim Jong Un said the United States was -sustaining their [its] military assistance to Ukraine- and claimed -the United States and other Western countries are using Ukraine as a shock force in the war against Russia.- This speech was carried for both domestic and external audiences. Kim’s unusual, but not unprecedented, direct reference to the Russia-Ukraine war offers a good opportunity to review how North Korean propaganda outlets have handled this topic since the war began. North Korea has taken two widely different approaches to the coverage of the war, depending on the audience.[1] Outlets targeting external audiences were quick and decisive in reporting on the war and siding with Russia. By contrast, domestically oriented media were first observed to mention the Ukraine situation in March 2023, more than a year after the war began.[2] North Korea became more forward-leaning in its domestic coverage of the war as its relationship with Russia continued to deepen. North Korea’s cautious and more calibrated approach to the war in Ukraine vis-à-vis the domestic public indicates sensitivities surrounding the topic. In that vein, it should be no surprise the country’s domestic media, unlike its external websites, remain silent on the extent of North Korea’s role in the war. External Versus Domestic Coverage External outlets reacted within days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Two days after the invasion, the Foreign Ministry website carried a bylined article blaming the United States and supporting Russia’s position on Ukraine. An official Foreign Ministry statement reiterated this same line two days later. North Korean external platforms, led by the Foreign Ministry website, have since carried articles and statements consistent with Russia’s position on Ukraine, including North Korean Foreign Ministry officials’ press statements directly voicing support for Russia. Pyongyang’s quick and decisive support for Russia’s war against Ukraine is in line with one of the earliest signs of its foreign policy reorientation in August 2021, when the Foreign Ministry website started to regularly carry reports and articles introducing or supporting Russian positions on international and foreign policy issues. Domestic media’s first observed reference to the war in Ukraine was in a party daily article on March 30, 2023 citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s claim that the United States was encouraging the -Ukrainian crisis- for economic benefits. Domestic media have since published news reports, articles, and commentaries that aligned with Russia’s position on Ukraine and were critical of the United States and the West. Domestic media coverage of the war in Ukraine has increased since March 2024, shortly after the Foreign Ministry indicated, based on the foreign minister’s trip to Russia in January 2024, that Putin would be visiting Pyongyang and a new treaty would be signed. It was also after this announcement that domestic media started to provide more details about the war and carry Foreign Ministry statements on the war in Ukraine, which had hitherto been reserved for external websites. Choe Son Hui’s Russia visit in January 2024 seems to have given North Korea greater confidence in its relationship with Moscow, prompting it to give clearer signals domestically on its position on the war. That notwithstanding, domestic media refrained from directly voicing support for the war. In two instances, they indirectly acknowledged North Korea’s support for Russia’s -special military operation- by citing Putin (July 2023) or Russia (January 2024). Putin’s visit to Pyongyang in June 2024, however, was a turning point. In a departure from past practice, a party daily editorial explicitly voiced -full support and encouragement for the special military operation against Ukraine- on the day of Putin’s scheduled arrival in Pyongyang. In his talks with the visiting Russian vice defense minister the following month, Kim Jong Un himself expressed -strong support for and firm solidarity with- Russia on -the special military operations in Ukraine,- echoing the same promise he made during the summit with Putin.

Quick Take: Video Shows More of Suspected Airborne Early Warning Aircraft	A video shot by a tourist in North Korea has provided a close-up view of an Air Koryo Ilyushin IL-76 that could be the country’s first Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft. The IL-76 was captured in footage taken aboard an Air Koryo flight departing from Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport in October. The aircraft, which had been part of Air Koryo’s cargo fleet, has been in a maintenance facility at the airport for a little over a year. Commercial satellite imagery since October 2023 has revealed work on top of the fuselage that is consistent with a radar pedestal. The new video shows the aircraft from the side, with the structure visible on top of the fuselage. It was shot from approximately 0.5 kilometers away, meaning fine details of the structure are difficult to make out. However, the structure on the plane does appear similar to a radar pedestal. A fence is also visible around the aircraft, which serves to both keep personnel from the plane and hide materials from view. Since the video was taken, commercial satellite imagery indicates the aircraft has been moved from its position adjacent to the maintenance hangar. Unfortunately, available imagery is not sufficiently detailed to determine if the radome has been added and the conversion is complete.

Munchon Naval Complex Construction Progresses	Two months after Kim Jong Un visited Tapchon Port on North Korea’s east coast and announced plans to build a large naval base, commercial satellite imagery shows no signs of construction advancing at the site. Tapchon is part of a larger complex of naval facilities in the Munchon area, previously the home of the KPA East Fleet Headquarters. However, across the bay, there is significant work to expand the existing October 3 Dockyard and Korean People’s Army (KPA) Navy Unit 155 Base. Together with Tapchon Port, these facilities are all part of the Munchon Naval Complex. Kim visited the future site of the Tapchon naval base in early September and said its construction would be a -pressing task- if the country’s navy were able to moor -large surface warships and submarines which cannot be anchored at the existing facilities.- Long piers and several buildings were constructed at the port between 2015 and 2022, but none appear to have been put into regular use. Some still remain incomplete on imagery from November 6. While perhaps a less-than-auspicious start for the naval base project, Kim’s emphasis on the importance of this new base to the navy’s future suggests work should pick up in the near future. A slow start following Kim’s visit is not uncommon—for example, at Sohae Satellite Launching Station, modernization and expansion efforts did not begin in earnest immediately following Kim’s mandate. Tapchon Port There have been no discernable changes at the Tapchon port area since Kim’s visit in September, despite Kim calling the site’s expansion a pressing task. Fishing boats are still using some of the piers, numerous buildings remain half-finished, and no new land clearance has begun. Around the site, large concrete blocks remain scattered where they have sat for years. Similar blocks are usually used throughout the country to build up sea walls, although the walls around Tapchon Port appear to be well-fortified. October 3 Dockyard At the nearby October 3 Dockyard, home to KPA Navy Unit 597, many of the vessels on the repair way do not appear to have moved in the last two months. The dockyard was almost completely rebuilt in 2015 after Kim visited and called for its modernization. The latest image reveals work on a new building near the entrance of the site has been completed, and a second adjacent building appears to be under construction. KPA Navy Unit 155 Base Just south, construction progress has occurred at the KPA Navy Unit 155 site. The entire facility is being redeveloped with several new buildings. Satellite imagery from November 6 reveals roofs have been added to some buildings, and second floors are being added to others. Two new round buildings are under construction. The internal partitioning and unique design suggest they are likely to be headquarters or administrative buildings. Additionally, the sea wall has been extended and appears set to snake around the edge of the bay. It may be that the stepped-up efforts at KPA Navy Unit 155 are a prelude to the final phase of construction at Tapchon.

Sohae Satellite Launching Station: No Observable Indications of Launch Preparations	Commercial satellite imagery shows that work at North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station is progressing. South Korean intelligence reported on October 29 that North Korea appears to be ready to conduct another satellite launch attempt—with the acquisition of parts and technological cooperation with Russia—in what would be its first attempt since the failed launch of the Malligyong-1-1 reconnaissance satellite in May 2024. While modernization efforts progress throughout the site, no typical indicators of an imminent launch have been observed in recent weeks. In addition, North Korea has not made any imminent launch notifications to relevant authorities, a practice they have complied with in the last several satellite launches. Coastal Launch Pad The coastal launch pad has been used for the past three launch attempts. Imagery from throughout October 2024 and, most recently, November 6 shows no observable activities on the pad itself. Around the failed satellite launch in May 2024, support vehicles were observed parked underneath a structure covered in camouflage. Vehicles have not been parked under the same camouflage since late June. On imagery from November 6, the camouflage appears to have been removed from the framing. Roadside revetments near the entry to the launch pad also remain empty. To the south of the launch pad, support buildings were constructed in the spring of 2023. At one of the southwest support buildings, paving of the surrounding area has progressed since August 2024, and as recently as November 6, materials remain in the lot. Tunnel Area Between the east tunnel entrance and the VIP observation area, a section was cleared—resembling a larger revetment—prior to the last satellite launch. In May, equipment was observed underneath camouflage in this area before the last launch. Imagery throughout September and October shows objects in the same area, the nature of which is unclear. The east tunnel entrance remains quiet, with few observable changes. At the west tunnel entrance, work continues. The rectangular opening on top of the tunnel entrance is still visible on imagery from November 6, and roof trusses remain in the surrounding areas. Engine Test Stand Area On imagery from November 6, a blue van and smaller vehicles are observed on the road connecting the engine test stands, moving away from the Horizontal Engine Test Stand. While the purpose of this vehicle movement cannot be determined, the vehicles may have been purposed for test monitoring or could have been carrying test-related equipment for installation or a small upper stage for testing. Other Vehicle Activity On November 6, buses were observed at the mountaintop tracking station and the administration and security check-in building located at the entrance to the site. Their presence may indicate a VIP visit to the facility. On that same date, several white packages or stacks of material were observed in front of the same administration and security check-in building. Their purpose is unclear. A vehicle was also observed at the old Horizontal Assembly Building. New Assembly Building Notably, roof trusses began to be installed between October 8 and October 20. Previous reports observed trusses in the area surrounding the building. By October 31, more than half of the frames have been installed over the top of the building. As of November 6, all but one section of roof trusses has been put in place. Paving around the perimeter of the new assembly building that began in early September 2024 progresses. Imagery from late October shows the paving blocks begin to connect to the main site road. Seaport Activity progresses to extend the jetty at the southern seaport. Between September 23 and September 28, blocks began to be placed on the west and south sides of the end of the jetty. In early October, blocks were placed along the east side as well. Work continues through the end of October. This activity is likely to define a dock or quay at the end of the jetty that allows for the unloading of deeper draft vessels. Work also progresses on the coastal highway, connecting the jetty to the rest of the site.

Construction Expands at Nampho Port	Commercial satellite imagery of Nampho Port indicates previously identified work on a ship repair way is part of a much larger project that will significantly upgrade the facility. Nampho, located on the west coast of North Korea, is both the country’s primary ship construction and repair facility and its largest commercial port, known for its coal, petroleum, oil and commercial goods imports and exports. This work on Nampho’s shipbuilding facilities, together with the recent reveal of a new naval base being built on the east coast, appear to be part of larger efforts to upgrade the Korean People’s Navy. Marine Repair Way Construction At the center of the port, construction of a large structure on one of the two marine repair ways has been progressing since September 2023. As of late September 2024, the structure was walled off on four sides, likely to effectively shield construction of shipbuilding work on the repair way from overhead surveillance. On imagery from November 2, a roof or covering is being installed over the top of the structure. The green covering is semi-transparent and possibly a tarp or netting material. As it does not appear sturdy enough to support the weight of a snowfall as winter nears, it is likely just a temporary measure to conceal activity taking place. The structure could possibly become a shipbuilding hall, but the framing and covering differ from other construction halls throughout the country. Measuring 30 meters by 170 meters, the hall would be among the largest in North Korea. White blocks or slabs appear to lay on the lattice gridwork. The blocks are likely being offloaded by a nearby crane barge, lifting the blocks onto the gridwork from the hold of the utility cargo ship next to the crane barge. On the adjacent repair way, a similar grid lattice is also visible. These gridworks may support the staging of component parts for ships under construction. This work appears to be part of efforts to build up the repair ways and could possibly mirror the work being done on its neighbor. Secure Boat Basin In imagery from September 2024, work had begun to fill in the secure boat basin. By November 2, multiple piles had been driven into the riverbed in the basin area and around the end of the other repair way with grid lattice. It appears the entirety of the basin will eventually be filled. East Repair Ways On the east side of the ship repair area, the two ship repair ways are also abuzz with activity. One has a similar grid lattice to that seen on the west side of the site. A white building was constructed between the lattice work and the water in October and November of 2023. While the purpose of the building is unclear, it blocks the path between the repair way and the water. Building Construction A number of new buildings are also being erected near the west repair ways, where land was cleared earlier this year. Their purpose is yet unclear.

North Korean Non-kinetic Attacks: A Problem for Incheon Airport	North Korea has recently engaged in -non-kinetic- forms of provocations against South Korea. These operations include waste-laden balloons, GPS spoofing, electronic jamming and cyberattacks. It has sometimes been difficult for South Korea to identify appropriate countermeasures for these non-kinetic provocations because the Rules of Engagement—set by the United Nations Command, which has monitored and managed crises between the two Koreas since the Armistice Agreement of 1953—have not kept pace with these evolving threats. Recently, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) destroyed the northern sections of the unused road and rail routes linking it with South Korea, seen as a symbolic protest of the hardline policies of the Republic of Korea’s (ROK or South Korea) President Yoon Suk Yeol. On October 31, North Korea launched a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, dubbed Hwasong-19, from a new 24-wheel mobile launcher. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared it was in reaction to the 56th US-ROK Security Consultative Meeting, held in Washington the day before. The ROK intelligence agency said that North Korea may have obtained some critical technical assistance from Russia as a quid pro quo for North Korean involvement in the Ukraine War. These actions have symbolic and political implications both for the ROK and the US, with North Korea aiming to demonstrate that it still poses an intractable threat to the ROK. In recent years, larger physical (kinetic) conflicts have become rare, the most recent being the Yeonpyeong Island naval skirmishes of 1999 and 2002, which also included a North Korean artillery bombardment of the island and then the sinking of ROK Navy (ROKN) corvette, the Cheonan, in 2010. North Korea’s continued psychological warfare, however, increases tensions and is probably a tactic of -escalate to de-escalate- to acquire leverage for later negotiations with South Korea. The situation is also exacerbating South Korean political polarization over North Korea policy, which the regime of Kim Jong Un presumably sees as a win. While some sectors of South Korea’s defense infrastructure are prepared to respond to non-kinetic threats, Incheon Airport—a vital hub for the ROK’s economy and international connectivity—is especially vulnerable. North Korea’s shift toward non-kinetic provocations underscores the need for modernizing security systems and coordination efforts at critical sites such as Incheon Airport. Recent Non-kinetic Attacks Since May 2024, North Korea has been sending hundreds of waste-laden balloons, typically containing plastic bottles and paper, across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In response, since July 21, the ROK Armed Forces have reinstated an operation in which fixed speakers regularly broadcast messages across the DMZ. Waste balloons have been released at least 20 times and have been found in more than 5,500 locations nationwide. One balloon caught fire after bursting on the rooftop of a residential building in Gyeonggi Province, where Incheon International Airport, South Korea’s main aerial gateway, is located. Just in this province, waste balloons have been discovered in more than 2,000 locations in recent days. The airport has been directly affected by North Korean waste balloons: runway operations have been halted 12 times for a total of 265 minutes. Besides the balloons, North Korea has also increasingly been jamming civil aircraft using Incheon Airport. Broadcasting of false signals, deliberately intended to confuse GPS systems, has been reported 578 times between January and August this year, compared to 39 last year and only 26 in the three years before that. Most of these cases have been traced back to North Korea. Such cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and are potentially effective against unmanned aerial vehicles operated by US Forces Korea stationed in the South. No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety. Most of the jamming occurred between May 29 and June 2, when hundreds of civilian aircraft and ships reported suspected GPS jamming near the de facto inter-Korean sea border in the West Sea, the Northern Limit Line. The GPS interference sometimes lasted a few minutes and sometimes several hours. The Vulnerability of Incheon Airport Every year, Incheon Airport carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo, but it is less than 100 kilometers from North Korea and, therefore, very vulnerable to trash balloons, electronic jamming, and other cyberattacks on flight control systems. Besides electronic jamming of aircraft navigation systems, other forms of cyberattacks are suspected: during the last decade, Incheon Airport has experienced several technical problems that have affected aircraft navigation and air traffic control. Incheon Airport is an important hub connecting East Asia with North America, so many parties could conceivably be responsible, but it is difficult to see how any of them have an interest in disrupting regular flight schedules, except for North Korea. The ROK’s intelligence community has verified that North Korea has conducted frequent cyberattacks and electronic jamming directed against Incheon Airport, and they are seriously concerned about the potential impact on domestic and international aircraft. The unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) on March 8, 2014 offers a grim warning of what could happen: the cause remains mysterious, but a cyberattack has not been excluded. Certainly, if a similar unexplained disappearance should occur with an Incheon flight, then a North Korean cyberattack would top the list of possible causes to be investigated. The environment of Incheon Airport is also unusually challenging for search and rescue (SAR) operations, being situated on a muddy island, Yeongjong-do, with a tidal range exceeding 10 meters. This makes it difficult for traditional surface vessels to operate, so the ROK Coast Guard (KCG) and the ROKN have deployed specialized platforms and other equipment. KCG has a number of hovercraft capable of amphibious operations, which can provide an immediate response to any emergency in the vicinity.[1] ROKN also possesses some hydrofoils, which are deployed to Incheon Defense Command, based in Incheon.[2] These are available to support SAR operations in coastal areas near Incheon International Airport, and some joint SAR exercises have been conducted with KCG to build operational experience. Policy Recommendations Such SAR cooperation is essential for an effective response to an aircraft accident near Incheon International Airport, especially now that the recent escalation in North Korean non-kinetic attacks threatens the safety and security of South Korean airspace. KCG is well prepared, but ROKN could improve its monitoring, for example with unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vessels. It is also essential to coordinate systems and technology between the ROK’s SAR center, the KCG, the ROKN, and various other authorities, including local governments. Given the complexity of this situation, it is recommended that a procedural manual should be created for joint SAR operations near Incheon Airport. A standard operational manual between ROKN and KCG should be established first, which can then be expanded to become the Chungmu emergency plan, encompassing other government and civic organizations. The recent escalation in North Korean electromagnetic jamming and cyberattacks needs to be countered more effectively. The ROK is bidding to host an international cybersecurity conference with representatives from the militaries of 24 countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and collaborative cybersecurity exercises would also be useful. Following the announcement of the ROK’s cybersecurity strategy in February, the ROK National Security Council has drawn up the National Cybersecurity Basic Plan after consulting with 14 government agencies. This plan seeks to secure the ROK’s industrial infrastructure and other facilities against cyber threats, using both defensive and offensive measures. The ROK Ministry of National Defense is working together with various countries to coordinate cybersecurity responses and has joined international partnerships such as Cyber Alliance and Cyber Flag drill. Conclusion North Korean balloons, GPS spoofing, and other non-kinetic attacks have the potential to seriously compromise the safety of Incheon Airport. The worst-case scenario is an airliner crashing in muddy littoral areas where timely SAR operations and cybersecurity would be very challenging. The complexity of the threat from North Korean non-kinetic operations requires whole-of-government measures. Besides South Korean military and security organizations, civil organizations are also working to deal with these challenges, notably the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization. Existing SAR capabilities are not adequate to protect Incheon International Airport from North Korean non-kinetic operations. Multilateral cybersecurity protocols are needed, and the ROK is well-placed to take the lead in developing them.

North Korea Tests New Solid ICBM Probably Intended for MIRVs	On October 31, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) conducted the initial flight test of the new Hwasong-19 (HS-19) solid-propellant intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Photos show the missile is longer than the North’s first solid ICBM, the Hwasong-18 (HS-18). This explains the increased boost capability shown in the missile’s longer flight time and higher maximum altitude, and thus is not an indication of technological assistance from Russia, as some analysts have speculated. Because the HS-18 can already reach targets throughout the US, the HS-19’s additional boost capability will probably be used to loft heavier payloads. A multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV)-associated probable post-boost vehicle (PBV) was shown in stage-separation photos from the launch released by Pyongyang. One or two more successful flight tests will likely be needed before considering the HS-19 booster ready for deployment, but a MIRV payload would require at least several successful tests over at least a few years to be ready. The most likely reason for developing another solid ICBM with more boost capability than the existing HS-18 is to loft a heavier MIRV payload to a similar range. Deployment of MIRVs on the HS-19 (and probably the larger, liquid-propellant HS-17), in combination with single-RV versions and the HS-18 force, will significantly boost the number of deployed North Korean warheads for a given number of missiles and launchers, increase the number of targets that a surviving missile force can retaliate against after absorbing a first strike, and further complicate the task of allied missile defenses by forcing them to cope with more relatively small objects in the same timeframe. But this potential depends on how the North chooses to allocate its relatively limited nuclear warhead production among many different weapons systems. Information to Date On October 30, it was reported that South Korean military intelligence had detected signs North Korea would soon launch an ICBM, including the placement of a missile and its mobile launcher. The Japanese Ministry of Defense reported the launch of an ICBM-class missile on October 31 from the suburbs of Pyongyang to the northeast, landing in the sea after a flight of about 86 minutes covering some 1,000 kilometers (km) at a maximum altitude of over 7,000 km. South Korea’s military confirmed the launch and impact areas, as well as a highly lofted trajectory. Images in the Japanese media of apparent reentering objects suggested the flight was successful. That same day, the North Korean press announced -an ICBM test-fire,- but provided no further technical information. North Korean media provided further information on November 1, reporting the ICBM was -the latest-type ICBM Hwasongpho-19- (aka Hwasong-19 or HS-19), which flew for 85.93 minutes to a maximum altitude of 7,687.5 km and a distance of 1,001.2 km. Accompanying photos depicted the launch of a three-stage, solid-propellant missile from a canister mounted on an 11-axle road mobile launcher (TEL, or transporter-erector-launcher), and also depicted missile staging, including a photo captioned -third stage separation- of two rocket nozzles remaining on the bottom of the missile’s payload section as the expended third stage falls away. North Korean TV video shows the missile being -cold launched- from its canister on an 11-axle TEL. Analysis The missile. The HS-19’s use of an 11-axle TEL indicates that the new missile is longer than North Korea’s first solid-propellant ICBM, the HS-18, which uses a nine-axle TEL. Initial analyses differ on whether the HS-19 is larger in diameter, as well. Either way, the size increase provides for additional solid propellant to increase the HS-19’s total boost capability—which is consistent with the new missile’s increased flight time (about 13 minutes) and altitude (some 1,100 km altitude) compared to the most recent HS-18 launch on December 18, 2023. Although the increased boost capability could be used to extend the HS-19’s range, the HS-18 can already cover anywhere in the United States from anywhere in North Korea. It is much more likely that the new missile’s increased capability will be used to boost a heavier payload. The payload. In the North Korean photos, the nozzles protruding from the bottom of the payload section, which remained in place after third-stage separation, are consistent with the presence of a PBV, a rocket-powered platform used to maneuver between drop-off locations for MIRVs. The PBV dispenses each reentry vehicle (RV) onto its own discrete trajectory toward a separate target. The payload of a MIRVed missile has to include the weight of the PBV and its propellant, not just that of the multiple RVs, and so a MIRV payload would be a good use for the increased boost capability of the HS-19. We do not know if the apparent PBV in the HS-19 test was operational or a dummy, if it carried actual RVs or payload simulators, if it maneuvered or was used for range extension, or if it released any RVs—although there is no reporting of unusual reentry objects. Although North Korea first mentioned interest in multiple warheads in January 2021 and conducted what it claimed was a MIRV test in June 2024 (that probably failed before RV release), it has yet to successfully demonstrate MIRV capability. The June test used a booster based on the first stage of the HS-16 solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which is probably based on the first stage of the HS-18 and, according to North Korea, was intended to release three RVs and a decoy. This may be reflective of the payload intended for the HS-19. The weight of the payloads flown on the HS-18 and HS-19 is unknown. The increased payload capability of the HS-19 would more easily accommodate the 1960s-style heavier, blunter RVs that North Korea probably deploys on its ICBMs to have sufficient confidence they will survive reentry at operational ranges despite the lack of flight testing to such ranges. (All of the North’s ICBM tests to date have been highly lofted, with much shorter ranges than targets in the US.) If the HS-19 is larger in diameter than the HS-18, it would also better accommodate multiple such RVs. Implications No sign of recent Russian assistance. Although some instant commentary attributed the greater performance of the October 31 launch over previous HS-18 launches to the recent receipt of technical assistance from Russia—even to the provision of -a key propellant component that can boost a missile’s engine thrust-—there is no open-source evidence of this occurring. Moreover, the increased performance of the new missile is fully explainable by the increased size of the HS-19, which is itself fully obtainable from the HS-18 technology base that was probably catalyzed some 7-10 years ago. That said, any assistance North Korea has or will obtain from Russia for its ICBM program is a continuing wildcard that could increase the capability, reliability, and/or timeliness of strategic missile developments. More tests to come. The apparent success of the first HS-19 test continues the impressive reliability demonstrated by North Korean solid-propellant ballistic missiles, even as such missiles have gotten larger in diameter and thus more challenging to produce with good quality control. One or two more successful flight tests would probably be sufficient in the eyes of the North Koreans to qualify the HS-19 booster for deployment. However, if the missile has a MIRV payload, this is a demanding technology, and at least several successful payload tests on the HS-19 over at least a few years are likely before North Korea operationally deploys MIRVs. Assistance from Russia could somewhat accelerate the timeline but would not obviate the likely need for at least a few successful MIRV flight tests. Likely to augment rather than replace. According to North Korean media, the HS-19 is intended to be used -along with Hwasongpho-18…as the primary core means in defending the DPRK.- It remains to be seen whether HS-19s carry MIRVs and HS-18s carry single RVs, but except perhaps for the deployment of extremely large, high-yield warheads, the HS-18 has enough range/payload capability to deliver single RVs to any place North Korea might reasonably want to target. North Korea is likely to deploy a mix of MIRV and single RV payloads to cover different missions and use scenarios, to hedge against the potential loss of multiple RVs on a single booster to reliability problems or enemy action, and to help manage the challenges of allocating a relatively limited number of nuclear weapons across a large number and variety of potential delivery systems. Moreover, the HS-19 is likely to share MIRV duty with the large, liquid-propellant HS-17 ICBM. The probable greater payload capability and larger diameter of the latter make it extremely well suited to carry MIRVs—and potentially more RVs and/or decoys per missile than the HS-19. Construction over the past year at North Korea’s key liquid-propellant strategic rocket engine production facility, the Thaesong Machine Factory, is consistent with a continuing role for liquid ICBMs. It will be survivable. Some have contended that the larger size of the HS-19 renders it too visible and too hard to move, imperiling its survivability. Although the length and weight of the HS-19 and its TEL will keep it from using some roads and off-road areas available to smaller North Korean mobile ICBMs, it will still be able to move out of garrison to remote locations and be camouflaged during a pre-war crisis period or in the run-up to any DPRK-initiated crisis or conflict. Once dispersed over hundreds of square miles of wooded terrain, the increased size of the HS-19 would not appreciably increase its detectability. If caught in garrison, even smaller mobile ICBMs would be highly vulnerable; the larger HS-19 is unlikely to be much worse off. As with the probably heavier (when fueled) HS-17, North Korea also has the option of putting the HS-19 on a rail-mobile launcher if it sees the need. What about the 12-axle TEL? Immediately after the October 31 launch, it was speculated that the new missile might have been launched from the new 12-axle TEL revealed in North Korean photos released in September 2024 in conjunction with factory visits by Kim Jong Un. Now that it is clear the HS-19 was launched from an 11-axle TEL (albeit one resembling the 12-axle vehicle rather than the type of 11-axle TEL used with the HS-17), the question remains of what system(s) the 12-axle TEL supports. As noted previously in 38 North, the new TEL could be used with a longer variant of the HS-17 or HS-18 (or now the HS-19), a space-launch vehicle, a space-launch version of an existing ICBM (which would have a longer payload section), or to improve the mobility of the existing HS-17. The Bottom Line The revelation of an apparent PBV on North Korean photos from the HS-19 test is consistent with the use of a MIRV payload. In a few years, with or without additional Russian help, North Korea is likely to complete MIRV development via the requisite flight testing, resulting in an ICBM force with more flexibility, able to cover more targets, and possessing a more robust second-strike capability.
