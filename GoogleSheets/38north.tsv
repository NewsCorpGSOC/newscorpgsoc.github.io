North Korea Construction at the East and West Border Crossings	Just over a week since North Korea demolished the two main road and rail links connecting it to South Korea, commercial satellite imagery indicates work has begun on a new border fortification or obstacle where the road and railways once sat. On both the east and west sides of the Korean Peninsula, North Korean soldiers are clearing land and digging wide trenches with what appear to be concrete sides. The nature of the construction is uncertain, but the structures appear similar on each road. Together, they add a level of permanence to the severed cross-border infrastructure. West Coast Crossing The west coast crossing connected South Korea’s Dorasan border station with a North Korean road that led into the Kaesong Industrial Zone (also written as Kaesong Industrial Complex). The crossing is part of the Asian Highway 1 (AH-1), a United Nations-backed highway scheme that connects Tokyo in the east to Turkey in the west. While both South Korea and North Korea are signatories to the Asian Highway plan, driving through North Korea has only ever been theoretically possible. The section inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is approximately 4.7 kilometers (km) long and is fenced-in at either end. The South Korean border post is located immediately south of the gate, but the North Korean checkpoint is located one kilometer up the road, just before the Kaesong Industrial Zone. The military demarcation line (MDL) runs through the DMZ approximately 600 meters from the North Korean gate. It is marked by a slight change in the road surface and signs on each side of the line. The South Korean sign declared the beginning of Kaesong City and strikingly included the words -Good bye- in English. A few meters north, just over the MDL, a North Korean site informed the distance to Kaesong City was five km. The road has not regularly been used since the complex was shuttered in February 2016. Fences on either side have meant that, like much of the DMZ, the area rarely receives visitors. Around early December 2023, a series of trenches were dug across the road just north of the South Korean gate. Imagery from February 2024 shows the trenches measuring approximately 180 meters long, running between wooded areas on either side of the road. Their purpose is unclear, although they could be designed to stop traffic from traversing the road. Notably, the trenches appeared weeks before Kim Jong Un delivered his January 2024 speech, deeming South Korea an -enemy state.- However, it is not possible to determine if these two actions are linked. In mid-2024, the trenches appeared to have been filled in with dirt or other aggregate. On October 15, explosives ripped up the inter-Korean road and railway just a few meters north of the MDL. Footage released by the South Korean government shows North Korean workers clearing away the roadway debris using backhoes. The North Korean road sign declaring the distance to Kaesong City was also knocked down. Electrical power lines parallel the road, connecting the North to the South, although they have not transmitted electricity since 2018. It remains to be seen if they will stay in place or also be destroyed. Since the detonation, the excavation work has expanded. Imagery from October 17 shows a 50-meter portion of the roadway has been ripped up, and a trench is being dug across the area where the road and railway used to run. As of October 19, the trench was approximately 4 meters wide by 130 meters long. East Coast Crossing The east coast crossing was used to shuttle visitors from South Korea to the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone until tours ended in 2008. Like the west coast route, it has not seen any regular traffic in many years. Notionally, it makes up part of the AH-6 route that is meant to run from Busan, South Korea, to Russia’s border with Belarus. North and South Korea have gates on either side of this section of the DMZ as well, which measures approximately 1.3 kilometers. The MDL lies roughly 300 meters south of the North Korean gate. A single-track railway line runs along the west side of the road. Work also began here in December 2023 when a rectangular, dark brown area appeared on the road on the North Korean side of the MDL. There is no imagery record of what occurred just prior to this December activity, so it cannot be determined whether trenches similar to those on AH-1 had been dug to disrupt this stretch of the road surface. Regardless, the nature of this darkened stretch of road is unclear. The detonation occurred just over the MDL on the North Korean side, as it did on the west coast road. Imagery from October 23 shows similar work is taking place, with road clearance and a 140-meter-long trench dug across the road and railway line. The trench is approximately 5 meters wide. Other Roads There appear to be no recent changes to the roadways at Panmunjom and Arrowhead Hill. The former is required for North Korean vehicles to reach the Joint Security Area, while the latter was reconstructed in 2018 to aid an operation looking for remains of war. Earlier this year, the South Korean government said it had detected North Korean soldiers laying landmines along a portion of the road.

Russia-DPRK Relations: Strategic Partnership or Opportunistic Alliance?	Europe’s deadliest armed conflict in nearly 80 years has put Russia-DPRK relations into overdrive, with Russia’s need for outside assistance fueling the development of deep military cooperation. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) leader Kim Jong Un have established a personal rapport with each other, one driven in large measure by a shared animosity of US foreign policy and what both perceive—rightly or wrongly—to be an overbearing United States desperately seeking to maintain hegemony in Europe and East Asia. Two questions naturally arise. First, how deep does the Russia-DPRK relationship go? And second, can it now be categorized as an alliance in the same vein as what the United States shares with South Korea and Japan? The answers are not mutually exclusive; just because Moscow and Pyongyang are collaborating more seamlessly than they have in the past does not necessarily mean either one expects a full-scale alliance to be established as a result or that they are even interested in such an arrangement. What the two countries boast at the present moment is, if anything, a marriage of convenience fueled by self-interest, a desire to counter Washington’s strengthening of its own alliance system, and a firmly-held belief in Moscow and Pyongyang that the United States is trying to link the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Europe with its bilateral alliances in East Asia. The war in Ukraine, where Japan—which signed a 10-year security agreement with Kyiv in June with an accompanying $4.5 billion in non-military aid—and South Korea (to a more limited extent) are members of the US-organized sanctions regime against Russia, only reaffirms this belief in the minds of Russian and North Korean officials. North Korean Troops on Their Way to Ukraine US experts increasingly describe the Russia-DPRK relationship as a key node in a broader axis of authoritarians aiming to upend the so-called rules-based international order. News of North Korean troop deployments to Russia has reinforced the discourse. On October 17, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alleged that roughly 10,000 North Korean troops were being mobilized to join the war in Ukraine on Russia’s behalf. Lieutenant General Kyrylo Budanov, the head of Ukraine’s military intelligence, assessed that North Korean personnel would be ready to enter the fight by November 1. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service went a step further in its own assessment, claiming that 3,000 North Korean troops are already training inside Russia for combat operations. How those troops will be used is still a mystery. As Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin suggested, it is possible Putin could deploy the North Koreans as shock troops on the frontline, particularly in Donetsk, where ongoing Russian offensives near the Ukrainian towns of Chasiv Yar and Pokvrosk have caused extensive casualties on the Russian side. Others speculate that North Korean units might be stationed in Russia’s Kursk province, a portion of which the Ukrainian army continues to hold ground after a surprise August offensive, in order to free up Russian personnel for duties at the front. Yet for Washington and Seoul, how Russia chooses to deploy North Korean reinforcements is less important than the fact that Moscow and Pyongyang are now gearing up to fight on the same side. Even before news of the North Korean troop movements emerged, US Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell stressed that the Kim regime’s material support to the Russians was -creating further instability in Europe.- The Biden administration has spent well over a year arguing that the nexus between these two authoritarian powers is a danger not only to European stability but to the stability of East Asia as well. This is consistent with the emerging conventional theme percolating in Washington, Berlin, and Tokyo that security in Europe and Asia is inextricably linked. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s administration is even more emphatic about the risks of Russia-DPRK military ties, calling it both unacceptable and illegal given the multiple United Nations (UN) Security Council Resolutions prohibiting such activity, regardless of the treaty the two countries signed in June. On October 21, the South Korean Foreign Ministry summoned the Russian ambassador in Seoul and demanded an immediate withdrawal of North Korean troops; a day later, the Yoon administration threatened to provide Ukraine with direct military assistance if military cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang continued, a countermeasure Yoon reiterated personally this week. Such a course of action, however, is easier said than done for South Korea, which is barred by law from exporting lethal weapons to a country at war. Russia-DPRK Relations Rise to New Heights North Korean troops fighting in Ukraine would be an unprecedented situation. While Pyongyang has been involved in third-party conflicts in the past—North Korean pilots aided North Vietnam during the 1960s, for instance—never before has the Kim regime ordered so many North Korean ground personnel into a war that, objectively speaking, is of tertiary importance to North Korea’s own security. Whether or not Russia proves victorious in Ukraine is immaterial to the Kim regime’s longevity or Kim Jong Un’s own rule. The question, therefore, must be asked: knowing this, why would Pyongyang inject itself into a war of attrition over 4,200 miles away? The most straightforward explanation is that Kim is fully invested in bolstering his strategic relationship with Putin’s Russia and believes the cost of North Korean casualties—an inevitable result if the troops are sent to Donetsk—is worth the benefits of keeping Moscow close to Pyongyang. Although some will brand this as overly simplistic, there is some merit to the argument. North Korea, after all, has already been involved in Ukraine, albeit in an indirect capacity, since at least September 2022, when the first reports of North Korean munitions shipments to the Russian army surfaced publicly. According to C4ADS, a global security nonprofit, more than 74,000 metric tons of North Korean munitions were shipped to Russian ports in the Far East between August 2023 and January 2024. In August, South Korean military officials estimated that Pyongyang delivered 13,000 containers to Russia through the port in Rason, a significant uptick from the previous estimate of 7,000 containers in March. North Korean munitions factories are reportedly working around the clock to produce the basic munitions and artillery shells the Russian army needs to maintain its offensive in the face of formidable Ukrainian resistance. Moscow has also occasionally employed North Korean short-range ballistic missiles against Ukrainian targets, although their effectiveness is suspect. Outside of Ukraine, North Korea and Russia have elevated their bilateral relationship. Senior Russian and North Korean officials now meet on a fairly regular basis. In July 2023, a Russian military delegation led by then-Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu flew to the North Korean capital; two months later, Kim Jong Un made the trip to Russia’s far east, his first foreign visit in more than four years, where he toured the Vostochny Cosmodrome with Putin as well as an aircraft plant in Komsomolsk-on-Amur. Putin’s June 2024 trip to North Korea was even more substantive in terms of deliverables, culminating in the signing of the comprehensive strategic partnership agreement that commits both sides to deeper collaboration in the military domain and mutual security assistance if either was attacked by a foreign power. The Kim regime, of course, is not doing any of this for free. Like any leader who makes an arrangement with another country, Kim is expecting the agreement to bring about benefits to his regime—in other words, Russia needs to compensate Pyongyang if it wants to maintain the present state of the relationship or improve it to new heights. Fortunately for the North Koreans, the Russian government is following through. On the political front, Russia’s obligations to North Korea are most prominently displayed at the UN Security Council, where Pyongyang is used to being ostracized by the great powers over any number of sins, from the development of its nuclear and missile programs to its ongoing human rights abuses. Due in large measure to Russia’s diplomatic support, the UNSC has become paralyzed on North Korea, with sessions on Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons program having long descended into unproductive finger-pointing. The Russians (with backing from China) have repeatedly blocked the passage of new sanctions on North Korea at the Security Council and continue to call for an easing of sanctions for humanitarian purposes. This March, Moscow used its veto power to kill the UN Panel of Experts monitoring the implementation (and evasion) of sanctions against North Korea, an action that was also self-serving given Russia’s own sanctions violations, including the importation of North Korean arms and the export of refined petroleum above Security Council-mandated levels. With the Panel in tatters, the United States, South Korea and Japan have been forced to construct an alternative multilateral monitoring mechanism outside the UN system, adding to the difficulty of monitoring and enforcing the sanctions. A Hostile Alliance in the Making? Considering the state of the Russia-DPRK relationship today, prominent US foreign policy experts are increasingly employing the word -alliance- to categorize it. Still, others have boldly labeled the arrangement a -full-fledged military alliance circa [the] Cold War,- claiming the obligations embedded in the comprehensive strategic partnership accord will be durable over the long term. The pending deployment of thousands of North Korean foot soldiers to Russia will only amplify these arguments in the days and weeks to come. Yet -alliance- is a loaded term. It suggests, for instance, that Russia and North Korea have identical—or at least similar—values and interests, are obligated to fight for one another during a security crisis and at the very least will sustain current ties decades into the future. In reality, the strategic partnership is built on a weaker foundation than is presently assumed, motivated by a common adversary in the United States and fueled by a combination of desperation, convenience and a lack of other alternatives. Russia and North Korea are strengthening their bonds not out of a shared affinity for each other but rather because both sides view the relationship as in their respective self-interests. The unique geopolitical circumstances of the day help as well. Putin views Kim as useful for the moment, while Kim likely views Putin as a big chip to be played in his dance with Washington, Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing. North Korea’s direct participation in Ukraine is no exception to the rule. Russia’s foreign policy machinery and its defense-industrial base are now, seemingly, in complete service to the war in Ukraine. Every other Russian foreign and defense policy priority is subservient to the objective of winning the war or at least ending it on terms Moscow finds acceptable. Russia’s willingness to sustain such punishment for the sake of victory demonstrates just how vital the war is to the Russian political elite. The costs have been significant. Economically and politically, the war has burned Russia’s bridges to the West, which up until 2022 was Russia’s biggest buyer of crude oil, for the foreseeable future. Geopolitically, Moscow is more reliant on China than ever—and despite Chinese President Xi Jinping’s proclamations of a Russia-China partnership without limits, Beijing is seeking to exploit its superior position vis-à-vis Moscow to finalize bilateral projects—like the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline—on the cheap. Notwithstanding the recent territorial advances in Donetsk, Russia’s military losses are astronomical. While the accuracy of war-time projections should always be challenged, US officials gave a provisional tally of more than 600,000 Russian dead and wounded since the conflict began. September was reportedly the bloodiest month of the war for the Russians, with Moscow losing about 1,200 personnel a day. These casualties are coming at a time when Putin, wary of provoking unrest in places like Moscow and St. Petersburg, is doing everything short of a full-scale national mobilization to re-pad the Russian army’s ranks. While 12,000 North Korean soldiers will not do much to alleviate Russia’s workforce issues, their deployment would nevertheless give the Kremlin some additional time to reassess its options. Putin needs as many bodies as he can get, no matter where they come from or even how effective they may be on the battlefield. On the surface, Pyongyang looks like it gets the short end of the stick. North Korea, after all, is making most of the sacrifices. If reports are correct, the Kim regime is making a deliberate decision to potentially sacrifice thousands of its own citizens in a war whose outcome will not impact North Korea’s security situation. Yet it is not a total loss for the Kim regime either; indeed, if it were, Kim would not consider a deployment, let alone authorize it. First, any North Korean troops sent to fight in Ukraine will acquire the kind of battlefield experience that the Korean People’s Army (KPA) currently lacks. This should not be understated; the last time the KPA fought a large-scale conventional conflict was the 1950-1953 Korean War. The Kim regime has devoted a significant portion of its annual gross domestic product to its military and weapons of mass destruction programs in the seven decades since but remains grossly under-funded and under-equipped on the key defense platforms—fighter and bomber aircraft, air defense systems and logistics infrastructure to name a few—required to wage a successful military campaign. Indeed, one of the primary reasons why the Kim regime spends so lavishly on its nuclear and missile programs is because the KPA’s conventional capability is qualitatively inferior to its adversaries. Assisting the Russians in Ukraine can provide the KPA with the institutional knowledge of what systems, tactics and procedures are needed for modern-day warfare. Second and just as importantly, the Kim regime wants Russia in its corner. Moscow’s support is a geopolitical coup for Pyongyang, granting North Korea more flexibility and freedom of maneuver in relation to its dealings with the United States and China alike. Comfortable that it can rely on Moscow’s support, North Korea is even less worried about additional economic sanctions today than it normally is. More specifically, Pyongyang is likely receiving technology it has long coveted to develop its military satellite program, a core component of Kim’s defense modernization plans. And as relations with Russia strengthen, Kim reduces the vulnerability that comes with dependence on China, a country whose own relationship with North Korea goes through periods of romance and frostiness. Conclusion There is no doubt Russia-DPRK relations are at their most elevated in years, if not decades. North Korean troop deployments to Russia, North Korean arms shipments to the Russian army, Moscow’s support of Pyongyang’s position in international forums and the regular meetings between Russian and North Korean officials are a testament to this state of affairs. However, international relations is a fickle beast, and history has proven that countries aligned today may find themselves unaligned tomorrow. As long as the war in Ukraine persists, Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un are unlikely to have that problem. But when the war does end—and it will eventually end—the commonalities now binding Moscow and Pyongyang could give way to divergences.

North Korean Troops in Russia: What Are They Doing There?	On October 17, South Korean intelligence disclosed that several thousand North Korean troops had apparently begun training in Russia, presumably for deployment to Ukraine. This was later confirmed by other reporting, including the US Department of Defense. There are several reasons why such an arrangement might be considered beneficial by both countries—and concerning to the rest of the world. After the two governments signed a mutual defense treaty in June 2024, this news highlights the cooperation but raises questions about why the world’s third-largest army, which outnumbers its adversary considerably and has been promoting a narrative that it is winning, needs help at this time. The appearance of North Korean forces in Russia points to both a deepening of security cooperation between dictatorships and increasing desperation on the Russian side. What Is in It for Russia Obviously, part of the answer is that Russia is not winning, at least not to the degree that Vladimir Putin would have the world believe, but it should also be increasingly clear that Moscow really needs help. Generally, there are three ways in which the North Korean deployment can help Russia. The most mundane way is labor. Despite the North Korean troops involved being labeled -special forces,- they are less experienced in battle and generally trained on older equipment than the Russian and Ukrainian forces that have been fighting for over two years. The North Koreans might be seen as more suited to low-skilled labor than combat roles. Employing North Koreans for manual labor could free up Russians for military duties and help keep defense industry production. Russia is already experiencing labor shortages and has tried to recruit workers from South Asian countries to fill vacant jobs. Russia also can make a strong case for employing North Koreans in combat roles. An expert on the Soviet military once described the Russian way of war as -playing chess with two sets of pawns,- meaning always having a larger number of expendable troops than an adversary.[1] For centuries, Russian tactics have been based, in part, on being able to absorb more casualties than any opponent. Reports from the front in Ukraine would seem to bear this out, with evidence that conscripts are taking casualties at much higher rates than -contract- soldiers. It could be that with casualty rates high from recent offensive operations, the Russian leadership would prefer to have someone else in the line of fire. In a war of attrition, the deciding factor will not be who controls various villages, but which side can tolerate the toll of deaths and wounds the longest. Russian generals know their history and are aware that in 1917, the Russian army, despite numerical superiority, grew tired of wasting lives and essentially stopped fighting. By having North Koreans do some dying in place of Russians, the Kremlin may hope to delay a similar collapse. What’s more, the employment of foreign forces, whether in combat or combat support, points to a level of desperation in Moscow. Having failed to unseat the Ukrainian government in 2022, Russia turned to a strategy of attrition aimed at portraying the war as unwinnable for Ukraine to try to persuade governments supporting Kyiv that they were wasting resources. All the while, Russia has made regular use of nuclear threats to raise the perceived risk of helping Ukraine and encouraged the idea that Ukraine should be forced to swallow a -land for peace- arrangement. While nuclear threats have led Western governments to place limits on assistance to Ukraine, Moscow’s strategy has not had much success. Since late 2023, Russian forces have generally taken the offensive, making minor territorial gains at a heavy cost. By mid-2024, the Russian army was advertising higher bonuses for enlistment, indicating that recruiting could be growing more difficult. All these developments could indicate that the Kremlin is feeling pressure to end the war in the coming months before it runs short on troops and materiel to maintain its offensive. Adding contingents from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) could provide more time for the strategy to work and for Ukraine’s supporters to abandon Kyiv. Western opponents of aid to Ukraine will point to the presence of DPRK forces as further evidence that the war is going badly, and Russian aggression should be considered a fait accompli and renew calls for a ceasefire on Russian terms. What Is in It for North Korea It is also important to consider what North Korea could gain from sending its soldiers to die in Ukraine. Apart from any sort of monetary payment, deployment to Russia would allow DPRK troops to train with and perhaps use in combat, more modern equipment. Any such benefit may be limited by the way Russian commanders would expect to use troops perceived as expendable but could remain an incentive to Pyongyang. Benefits from training and combat experience, however, would only be useful for those troops that make it home, and, given the Russian army’s lackluster battlefield performance, would be unlikely to change the military balance in Korea. Sources from the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea) have reported that Russia has found the DPRK soldiers to be lacking an understanding of modern warfare. Facing a pronounced qualitative disadvantage relative to the ROK, the North is likely receiving more advanced military technology from Russia as payment for North Korean lives. With an uneven record in tests over the last two years, ballistic missile technology may be high on Kim Jong Un’s wish list. Such missiles have relatively little conventional military value but, as delivery systems, are key components of North Korea’s nuclear option. Conclusion Improvement to both North Korea’s conventional and nuclear forces should be of serious concern for stability on the Korean Peninsula. An alteration of the military balance could lead to more aggressive adventurism from Kim Jung Un. Although importing North Korean forces to fight in Ukraine seems a fairly desperate measure, it has important longer-term implications in Korea and beyond. Russia is fighting a war of aggression in which it routinely uses nuclear threats to achieve its aims. Should it succeed with assistance from nuclear-armed North Korea, it will set a disturbing precedent for nuclear-aided aggression that could be repeated in Northeast Asia.

North Korea’s Importance for Putin’s -Turn to the East-	While attention rightly centers on China’s vital role in Vladimir Putin’s -Turn to the East,- now in its 12th year, little notice has been taken of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK or North Korea) importance for the -Turn.- After China, North Korea is one of two states—along with India—of greatest significance for Putin’s initiative for no less than four reasons. They reflect the security and identity aims of the -Turn.- They also are testimony to the complexity of Sino-Russian relations—close but often distrustful.[1] First, the -Turn- revives the -Grand Strategic Triangle- of the Cold War era, demonstrating to the United States and China that Russia is a powerful force with which they must reckon. It is steeped in the logic of Soviet foreign policy, for which North Korea was a vital element. Second, after initial wavering in Stage One of the -Turn to the East- from 2012 to early 2014, it increasingly targeted the US alliances with South Korea and Japan, treated reminiscent of the Cold War, as is North Korea. If some initially pointed to economics as the priority, rightly recognizing a focus on exports of energy, investments and modernization of the Russian Far East were secondary aims. Third, no state is more welcoming to the Russian agenda than North Korea and more eager to covet its assets: arms technology, energy, and foodstuffs. Further, Pyongyang wholeheartedly endorses Putin’s aggressive behavior. Finally, the national identity component of the -Turn- necessitates a partner other than China to vindicate such claims as Eurasianism, multipolarity, equality of great powers, and unique civilization. Too much one-sided dependence on China strips Russia of the identity justifications it keeps making, vital to claims Putin insists are key. To understand the evolution of the -Turn to the East,- we need look no further than articles by Russians over the past twelve years.[2] Cozying up to North Korea in 2023-2024 is a continuation of the fourth stage. Below, I outline the stages with new focus on North Korea’s role and the four reasons for pursuing the North.[3] Embracing North Korea fits into a broader Russian strategy than simply gaining support for the Ukraine war. Along with forging a close but at times contentious relationship with China, it harks back to aspirations of the 1950s and targets a world where US might and alliances are put under siege. In the absence of a regional security framework aimed at undermining these alliances and giving Russia veto power, the desired outcome is a polarized Northeast Asia in which Moscow and Beijing each cultivate ties with Pyongyang without succumbing to a Sinocentric agenda. Fearful of security threats, Seoul and Tokyo find themselves obliged to accommodate Russia’s interests to a substantial degree. The closer Moscow’s ties to Pyongyang, the more leverage it expects over US allies as well as China. North Korea and the Four Stages of the -Turn to the East- We need to look back to the Six Party Talks for early signs of Russian thinking about North Korea’s significance. Russians saw an opportunity to be -very helpful- to the North in adjusting to -new economic, political, and social realities- in a -long, slow period of mutual accommodation of North and South.-[4] Russia would modernize factories built by the Soviets, absorb the North’s workforce, provide its energy, upgrade its armed forces, and be the ideal partner in its complex dealings with China and Japan (as well as the United States).[5] -At stake…is not only the security of Russia’s eastern flank but also its prospects…in the geopolitical and economic upsurge of the world’s most dynamic region.-[6] Anticipating a new structure in which Moscow had a critical voice—reinforced by organizing the Six Party Talks fifth working group on peace and security in Northeast Asia—Russians saw its reemergence as a major player in regional affairs, -holding the forces of globalization at a distance.-[7] Failure of the talks necessitated a new agenda in Asia. Stage One of Putin’s -Turn to the East- in 2012-2014 focused less on North Korea but recognized the fact that Abe Shinzo in wooing Putin, and Park Geun-hye in advancing her -Eurasian Initiative,- saw Russia as a partner in managing North Korea as well as in limiting China’s ambitions.[8] Its emphasis on both multipolarity, including US allies, and modernization of the Russian Far East, attracting investments from diverse sources, held promise for Russian-DPRK ties, even if diplomacy was stalled in the transition to Kim Jong Un. Seeking a place for Russia in a booming region, Putin aimed less to transform than to adjust regional dynamics, centering first on China. After annexing Crimea and advancing in eastern Ukraine, Putin, in Stage Two, 2014-2017, chose a more aggressive approach to Northeast Asia, seeking to reshape it through -docking- with China in infrastructure and bonding with North Korea. Troubled Sino-DPRK ties left an opening, pursued along with lingering diplomacy with Japan and South Korea, despite lower expectations. Frustration was mounting, however, as Beijing outmaneuvered Moscow in joint plans and Kim Jong Un, as he built up his nuclear and missile capabilities, saw little benefit in prioritizing a breakthrough with Putin. The -turn to North Korea- seemed to be at an impasse after Putin acquiesced to Xi Jinping’s decision in late 2017 to toughen up UN sanctions on it. Stage Three, 2018-2021, started slowly for Russia as it was marginalized in the diplomacy between Kim Jong Un and both Donald Trump and Moon Jae-in. Putin pressed China to agree to his plan for a -Greater Eurasian Partnership,- but Xi did not coordinate on India and ASEAN, his Central Asia moves were suspect, and claims of coordination over North Korea were of uncertain value. As Xi regained his footing through repeated summits with Kim Jong Un, Putin was finally able to host Kim. -Delighted- with the failure of the Hanoi summit and with signs Sino-US relations were in a new Cold War, Putin, however, found there was no room left to play the -North Korea- card when North Korea in early 2020 shut its borders to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak. While diplomacy with Pyongyang drew little outside attention, the urgency of a breakthrough was growing. Putin was set on stirring up Cold War divisions; he was intent on demonstrating he had options other than China and was determined to put security at the forefront. With further deterioration in Sino-US relations in the pandemic year 2020 and with the start of the Biden administration’s pushback against China, US minilateralism at last promised to give Putin the opening he sought. Camp David trilateralism defied China, Russia, and North Korea demands. The language in Russian publications in 2019-2021 both appealed to China to join in a new Cold War and searched for a way to affirm Russia’s standing in a world not exclusively dominated by two great powers.[9] Although the Russian ambassador remained in Pyongyang during the period it closed its borders, there was scant diplomacy to vindicate high hopes. Yet commentaries on what went wrong at the Hanoi summit and on North Korea’s case for security made sympathies clear. With no renewed US diplomacy toward the North and China keeping up pressure despite relaxing some enforcement of sanctions, Russia would have to take matters into its own hands. Stage Four from 2022 saw Putin unleash full-scale war in Ukraine as he revved up the -Turn to the East- through China with the intent to add North Korea to the mix. His war of attrition made the case for tightening ties to North Korea stronger. Aggression in the West did not come at the expense of ambitions in the East; it complemented them. Four reasons justified a breakthrough with the North: reviving the Grand Strategic Triangle, targeting US alliances in East Asia, welcoming North Korea’s agenda as in Russia’s interest, and reconceptualizing national identity. Reviving the Grand Strategic Triangle After 45 years of grandiose claims of being one of two superpowers, Moscow acclimated to the post-Cold War. It rejected any junior status to the United States and, encouraged by Beijing, from the mid-1990s, grasped for a strategic triangle with the two. A sharp break with the West was required, given Russia’s diminished standing. In the East, the challenge was to draw close to China, proving Russia’s value against the United States, while seeking some balance elsewhere in Asia. Japan and South Korea failed the test, being too close to Washington and opposed by China. India looked promising, but the Indian backlash against China after their 2020 skirmish and growing security ties to the United States reduced its value. North Korea fit the bill well, given its ambivalent but essential ties to China and its security obsession, raising the variable most critical for strategic triangle maneuvering. Putin recognized its value in his surprise visit to Pyongyang in 2000; his attempted diplomatic intervention in January 2003, when he sent a deputy foreign minister to Pyongyang in an attempt to put Russia at the center of resolving the nuclear crisis; his hopes in the Six Party Talks for the fifth working group chaired by Moscow; his response in 2010 to the Cheonan sinking; and his overtures to Kim Jong Un in 2014 to 2017 (e.g., showcasing him at the 70th anniversary victory day parade on May 9, 2015, before Kim changed his mind about attending, and blaming Seoul, not Pyongyang, when plans for large-scale coal trade from Khasan through Rajin collapsed). Failure of the 2019 Hanoi summit renewed hope. Instead of a blitzkrieg success in Ukraine affirming the revival of the Grand Strategic Triangle to be taken seriously by Washington and Beijing, a war of attrition left Russia as a wobbly leg of the triangle in an even more asymmetrical relationship with China.[10] Isolated in Europe, it needed autonomous standing in Asia. North Korea boosted the Grand Strategic Triangle image: 1) raising the salience of nuclear weapons; 2) adding an arms trade partner affecting the war balance; and 3) making Beijing and Washington take its impact on regional security seriously. The legacy of communist thinking, i.e., the Soviet worldview, endures in grandiose claims to be on the top step of the global ladder.[11] Apart from Belarus, there is no country more welcoming to the reassertion of this old identity than North Korea. The more Moscow defines itself as a peer to Washington and Beijing, the more room for maneuvering Pyongyang expects to enjoy. Targeting US Alliances in East Asia Too little attention has been paid to the increasingly negative thinking in Moscow from 2014 toward both Japan and South Korea, whose leaders were too bent on wooing Putin to register the degree of disdain manifest on the other side. It was not until 2022 when both US allies were designated -non-friendly countries,- that waning hopes faded.[12] Commentaries on the end of World War II and the Korean War had long since hardened.[13] Russians may have dangled hope before Park Geun-hye, Moon Jae-in, and Abe Shinzo, but narratives pointed to an unbridgeable gap. History had become an obsession for Putin, was repeatedly cited by Foreign Minister Lavrov, and became intertwined in assessments of bilateral relations. Recognizing the justice of the seizure of four islands never before under Russian control suddenly became a prerequisite for reaching a peace agreement with Japan, complicating talks beyond rigidity on the territorial issue in Moscow. By not accepting that it was a defeated state, restricted in its security agenda, Japan was deemed a revisionist, militarist country trying to disrupt the regional order.[14] Unsaid was that part of that order was a divided Korea, brought about by the same Red Army that had -defeated- Japan. Japan’s aspirations for influence on the Korean Peninsula or reunification at odds with the wishes of the North Korean regime likewise did not jibe with its required status. No less unacceptable were South Korean challenges to the -natural order- left from the Soviet Union’s glorious victories, in cahoots with US ambitions to arouse a -color revolution- in North Korea. As the cult of victory in World War II became Putin’s fixation, the Korean War narrative of helping North Korea fend off US imperialism emerged as a useful addendum. The internal workings of North Korea, including human rights, faded from view in the narrative about a regional order established through blood and sacrifice and serving national interests. In the background loomed the ally of South Korea, moving it as a pawn as it also did with another country supposedly lacking full sovereignty, Japan. Removal of US bases came to be seen as the starting point for an independent foreign policy, which would open the door to problem-solving. Welcoming North Korea’s Agenda as in Russia’s Interest Moscow needed a partner hostile to the status quo, wary of China but unwilling to antagonize its neighbor, and helpful in meeting arms or perhaps labor needs. It did not need to replace the many benefits its quasi-alliance with China provides. China long seemed too dependent on ties to the West to join Russia openly or fully in challenging the existing order. It also had aspirations of drawing Russia into excessive dependency through the Belt and Road Initiative and turning Central Asia from Russia’s sphere of influence inimical to Putin’s ambitions. A troika with India would have been ideal, but India grew too wary of China and too intent on boosting ties with the United States, Japan, and other targets of Russian hostility. North Korea served different goals. In 2024, the economic dimension of cooperation with North Korea has changed, if not as much as the security dimension. Interest in navigation on the Tumen River has reemerged, something China covets but requires North Korean buy-in. The Northern Sea Route, passing along North Korea en route to the Arctic Ocean, is moving ahead. Vladivostok, near the border with North Korea, is opening to transit trade from China. Russians are talking earnestly about bringing large numbers of North Korean workers into their country after complying with sanctions by returning some workers. Much depends on China, now applying pressure on the North to clarify its path. Reconceptualizing Russian National Identity North Korea symbolizes the extension of Moscow’s power into East Asia. In the 1960s-1980s, it was the lone outpost of what Soviets considered their sphere of influence in the neighboring states of Northeast Asia. Complete loss of clout in the 1990s, as diplomacy around the North unfolded, became the foremost sign of regional irrelevance. No wonder, in 2000, Putin stopped in Pyongyang on the way to a G8 summit in Japan as his first demonstration that Russia was making a comeback. The collapse of communism and the Soviet Union left a void in Russian national identity, which Putin is filling with Eurasianism at the forefront. Much as the Sino-Soviet split was treated as a secondary identity theme to the clash with the West and leadership in the communist bloc, the notion of Eurasianism does not rest primarily on Sino-Russian camaraderie. It is an assertion of Russian power and civilization in an Asian context. Ignoring the reality of North Korea, a vision has emerged of it as a valued partner, which reinforces Russia’s identity as an Asian power. Conclusion It is difficult to predict the timing and degree of Putin’s overtures to Kim Jong Un had Putin not launched his full-scale war in Ukraine. Without an urgent need for arms imports, Putin would presumably have taken smaller steps. Yet the logic of pursuing a breakthrough with Kim would have remained. Putin needed to move to a more assertive -Turn to the East- by 2022, given the reasons cited above. In Stage One, he tried a multi-pronged approach that proved contradictory and inadequate to reach his goals. In Stage Two, his outreach to Kim Jong Un fell short, and he had become so reliant on Xi Jinping that he saw no alternative to alienating Kim by agreeing to tough United Nations Security Council sanctions. Marginalized in the diplomacy of 2018, Putin prepared for a new stage in his -Turn to the East- together with a newly aggressive Xi Jinping but seeking more. Attacking Ukraine poked the West in the eye; allying with North Korea delivered a new punch. It also served as a reminder to China that asymmetric dependency is not a license to act at will.

North Korea’s Post-Parliament Tension Signaling	Predicting North Korea’s next moves can be risky, even for the most seasoned and careful experts who base their analysis on a robust baseline of relevant data. Cases in point are the latest Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) session held on October 7 and 8, and the steps North Korea has since taken. The general assessment was that Pyongyang would remove unification-related language and define North Korea’s territory in a constitutional revision at the SPA session—probably with Kim giving a policy speech, as he has done at all fall SPA sessions since 2021.[1] Many North Korea watchers, including myself, had also predicted that inter-Korean tensions would inevitably increase as a result of North Korea’s announcement—and probably enforcement—of its new borders. Contrary to these widespread expectations, North Korean media’s readout of the latest SPA meeting did not mention any of these topics, focusing instead on economic issues. And in lieu of addressing the SPA, Kim made a rare visit to the University of National Defense, where he gave a speech with a heavy nuclear focus. As a result, speculation abounded in the days that followed about whether North Korea revised the constitution related to unification and North Korean territory. Even more surprising and significant than the outcome of the SPA session itself is what followed. North Korea demolished sections of the inter-Korean roads and railways and issued a flurry of angry statements on alleged South Korean drone incursions into Pyongyang airspace, escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula. In the first week after the SPA session, it appeared that North Korea was not ready for a major confrontation with Seoul. However, its demolition of the inter-Korean roads and railways and belated implication of a constitutional revision defining -the ROK as a hostile state- may signal a turn of events.[2] In that vein, Kim Jong Un’s nuclear rhetoric in recent days, reinforced by his sister Kim Yo Jong’s statement, may be cause for concern. Upping the Ante Prior to its announcement of the road and railway demolition, Pyongyang’s handling of the border question suggested it was not ready to confront South Korea over the definition of its border or address it with its own people. This included the fact that no details were provided about the constitutional revisions passed at the October SPA session (other than the revisions adjusting people’s working and voting ages), and that North Korea’s announcement of its plan to sever all inter-Korean roads and railways was disseminated to external audiences only. By contrast, North Korea was much more vocal about the alleged South Korean drone incursions, even sharing relevant statements with the domestic populace despite the apparent sensitivities surrounding the military’s failure to protect the Pyongyang airspace. Yet, similar to the North’s treatment of the border issue, the initial set of statements suggested the country did not wish to escalate tensions with Seoul beyond what was necessary. The warnings were all conditional and left room for de-escalation. Placing eight artillery brigades on -standby to open fire- in case of recurrence paled compared to the -wartime state- of frontline units in August 2015. Even North Korean media’s coverage of the people’s reaction for the first two days was underwhelming in volume and tone when compared to the intensive anti-South Korea campaign in June 2020. However, an unusual meeting of top defense and security officials convened by Kim Jong Un on October 14 marked a turning point. North Korea destroyed sections of the inter-Korean roads and railways the day after the meeting, presumably in response to Kim’s instructions on -immediate military activities.-[3] It was after this meeting that North Korea announced the demolition of the railways and roads to its own people as well as to external audiences. It was also after this meeting that Pyongyang implied the constitution had been revised to redefine South Korea, in line with Kim’s new two Koreas policy.[4] These were both notable shifts from North Korea’s previous positions. Although state media readout of the October 14 meeting did not provide much detail, there were certain references, such as Kim giving tasks on the -operation of the war deterrent and the exercise of the right to self-defense,- that raise concern about the potential for further escalation of tensions. In fact, since Kim’s meeting was reported, North Korean media coverage of the drones has taken on a militant tone, with state media reporting that 1.4 million people have volunteered to join the Korean People’s Army (KPA). Additionally, since the publication of the demolition report, there has been an uptick in media coverage of the people’s reactions to the drones, some even slipping in criticism of the United States. This behavior is normal during inter-Korean tensions—for example, state media as recently as March 2023 carried similar reports on joining the army—but it is worth watching how North Korea covers public sentiment in the coming days. Furthermore, during a visit to the frontline Second Corps on October 17, Kim reviewed their -military action plans- that apparently included Seoul. He described South Korea as -a foreign country and an apparent hostile country- and reiterated his conditional warning of attack against the South, reinforcing his two Koreas policy.[5] These actions and comments by themselves may not be new or remarkable, but they become significant when viewed in tandem with the ongoing tensions. Kim’s Nuclear Rhetoric In one of her statements on the drones, Kim Yo Jong referred to North Korea as -a nuclear weapons state- and claimed the United States should be held accountable for the alleged South Korean drone incursions. Under normal circumstances, this uncharacteristically short statement may have been written off as simply odd, but it echoes Kim Jong Un’s nuclear rhetoric in recent days. This, coupled with the summoning of the United States in the North’s propaganda on the drone incursions, merits a closer review of Kim’s nuclear rhetoric. Pyongyang carried out a carefully choreographed campaign between early August and mid-September to underscore the country’s nuclear capabilities and justify the importance of prioritizing defense development over the civilian economy despite difficult circumstances and limited resources. Notably, Kim delivered an unusual National Day speech, which focused heavily on continued expansion of the country’s nuclear capabilities. The speech was quickly followed by his first publicized visit to a uranium enrichment facility. Kim picked up on the nuclear theme again in the days running up to, and on the first day of, the latest SPA session. However, his nuclear rhetoric took a tougher turn. Speaking to special operations units—his second visit to a special operations forces training facility in three weeks—Kim Jong Un made personal attacks on the South Korean president for showing off -their military muscle at the doorstep of a state possessing nuclear weapons- during the previous day’s military parade. He then warned that -the DPRK will use without hesitation all the striking forces in its possession, including nuclear weapons,- against South Korea if it uses military force to violate North Korea’s sovereignty. This was an unusually direct threat of nuclear use, despite Kim’s emphasis on the word -if,- its weight redoubled due to the attribution to Kim himself. North Korea typically uses a more indirect formulation, -the second mission- of nuclear weapons, to indicate preemptive nuclear use. For example, Kim, in a speech at an SPA session in January, said, -the second mission of our nuclear force.- Kim issued virtually the same conditional warning about nuclear use in his speech at the University of National Defense on October 7—presumably after he had been briefed on the first drone incursion on October 3. Notably, Kim repeated a theme he has stressed since early August—that North Korea faces serious security challenges because -the ROK-U.S. military alliance has completely changed into a nuclear alliance.- This, when viewed in conjunction with Kim’s pledge in the same speech that North Korea would -never tolerate the balance of strength being disturbed on the Korean peninsula,- seems to imply the North may act decisively if it judges that the -balance- is about to be or has been disrupted. North Korea’s official statements and commentaries since mid-August have linked US security arrangements with its allies and partners to the disruption of the balance of power in the region. During his October 17 visit to the Second Corps, Kim Jong Un reiterated the possibility of retaliation against South Korea if its sovereignty is violated (but omitting the use of -nuclear weapons-) and again stressed the implications of the US-South Korea alliance’s -changed nature- for North Korea’s security. Conclusion The ongoing situation makes the North’s motives and next possible moves particularly challenging to assess because of its highly unusual circumstances: violation of the capital’s airspace and North Korea’s disclosure of it. This places not only North Korea watchers but also North Korea itself in unchartered territory. Another potential twist in this story is Russia’s unequivocal support for Pyongyang amid rising tensions. The Russian Foreign Ministry accused South Korea of a -reckless and provocative campaign- and echoed Pyongyang’s line that the alleged South Korean drone incursions were a violation of North Korea’s sovereignty. The Russian deputy foreign minister went further and said Russia will provide military assistance to North Korea if it comes under attack as per the new North Korea-Russia treaty. This deepening policy coordination between the two countries could affect Kim’s calculus as he thinks about his next steps. Kim proclaimed to his own people in January 2024 that -if the ROK violates even 0.001 mm of our territorial land, air and waters, it will be considered a war provocation.- This likely has not been forgotten by the North Korean army or the people, and Kim will need to handle the situation in a way that does not make him look weak. We should also recall that two border issues have come up thus far: land (the road and railway demolition and continued work to -fortify- the border areas) and air (drone incursions). It may only be a matter of time before tensions over the Northern Limit Line, the de facto inter-Korean maritime boundary line that Kim has called -illegal,- rear their head again.

US Policy Toward the Indo-Pacific through 2030: Continuity, Consequences, and Change	Whether 2025 marks the beginning of a first Harris administration or a second term for former President Trump, it is almost assured that the United States (US) government will pursue geopolitical competition with China through an -Indo-Pacific Strategy.- Although the tone has varied across the last three US administrations, a shared underlying characterization of interests and associated principles have driven a significant degree of continuity in American foreign policy toward the Indo-Pacific. Behind this continuity, there is a mainstream assumption that sustaining these policies—whether they are fully implemented or not—preserves the status quo in the region, despite the significant geopolitical and geoeconomic changes underway. The logic driving the Indo-Pacific focus is understandable given the mounting threats in the region. And busy government officials can be forgiven for leaning on policies and programs that are well-established and seemingly uncontroversial, versus asking politically difficult (and perhaps career-risking) questions about the wisdom of sustaining the default approach. Nevertheless, an US Indo-Pacific strategy on autopilot seems increasingly blind to the consequences of continuity, namely the ways in which it is exacerbating dangers of crisis or conflict. The next US administration likely will feel constrained in its choices, but it should carefully assess the efficacy of the existing approach and the challenges to its implementation and consider more seriously policy alternatives that could arrest the slide toward insecurity in the region. Continuities As viewed from Washington, the Indo-Pacific problem is mainly driven by Sino-American competition. The Trump and Biden administrations both described the China challenge in similar terms and amplified policies aimed at strengthening the US hand in that competition. The Trump administration’s -Free and Open- Indo-Pacific framework and the Biden administration’s Indo-Pacific Strategy speak of China as the principal destabilizing agent whose perceived revisionist aims threaten US interests in the region. Influenced by what they assess as the return of great power competition, both administrations’ National Security Strategy (NSS) documents elaborated on the need to contain China and build a -balance of influence- favorable to the United States. Importantly, four areas of continuity can be observed across the two administrations’ strategies toward the region—trends that seem likely to sustain in a second Trump or Harris administration. The first policy continuity is countering the perceived regional military threat from China, especially toward Taiwan. When he took office in 2017, Donald Trump vowed to preserve US military superiority in Asia. His National Security Strategy (NSS) argued that American -advantages are shrinking as rival states modernize and augment their nuclear and conventional forces,- and—believing that military superiority is predicated on the ability to prevail in areas where the US is weakest relative to its adversary—placed a premium on denying Chinese military superiority around Taiwan. One presidential administration later, Joe Biden’s NSS strikes a similar tone, reaffirming the US would maintain its -capacity to resist any resort to force or coercion against Taiwan,- and adds in his National Defense Strategy (NDS) that the Defense Department’s first priority would be to develop anti-access/area-denial-insensitive strike capabilities. While traveling to Japan in 2022 to meet with Japanese, South Korean, and Australian leaders, Vice President Harris similarly noted that -peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait is an essential feature of a free and open Indo-Pacific- and that the US -will continue to deepen our unofficial ties- with Taipei and -will continue to support Taiwan’s self-defense, consistent with our longstanding policy.- Both the Trump and Biden administrations emphasized the need to strengthen deterrence against China and North Korea by conducting military deployments, nuclear-capable bomber overflights, and joint exercises with allies. A second area of continuity has been the further strengthening of alliances. Sustaining a reliable alliance system has been a cornerstone of the US approach to the region for over seventy years. In their strategy documents, both the Trump and Biden administrations emphasized the importance of existing security alliances and expanded partnerships via the Quad and related frameworks. Admittedly, during his presidency, Trump was rhetorically more hostile toward the alliances with Japan and South Korea in particular, yet, like his successor, he underwrote actions to sustain those alliances and forge new regional partnerships in the face of mounting Chinese and North Korean pressures. The Biden Administration adopted and drove the Indo-Pacific Strategy further, complemented by strategic asset rotations to the Korean Peninsula and closer trilateral defense and deterrence cooperation with Japan and South Korea. A third area of continuity, underscored by similar language in both administrations’ national security documents, has been the commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. Every president since Bill Clinton has, with varying degrees of effort, sought to negotiate constraints on North Korea’s nuclear activities, all under the rubric of denuclearization. The promise of inducements resulting from negotiations has been backed by -maximum pressure- campaigns to convince North Korean leaders to abandon their nuclear ambitions, a policy that continues under Biden and seems likely also to be a feature of a putative Harris administration’s future policy toward the Korean Peninsula. Trump departed from this strategy in form by holding summits and exchanging letters with Kim Jong Un, but not in substance. Finally, one additional area of continuity between Trump and Biden that does not have the same lineage yet is an increasingly prominent element of US strategy toward the region, is a sharp shift away from Sino-American economic interdependence. The turn toward economic protectionism predated Trump, but he accelerated it by implementing steep tariffs on steel and aluminum, which were rapidly followed by additional tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese imports. The ensuing trade war set-off a process of partial economic de-coupling – or -de-risking- as the Biden administration has termed it. China-US trade fell by 14.5% between 2022 and the first half of 2023. Like Trump, Biden’s strategy documents all point to Chinese economic coercion and weaponization of interconnectivity as reasons for the US to strengthen its economic competitiveness and impose costs via tariffs, sanctions, and export controls. Harris has few antecedents on trade policy, but in her presidential debate with Trump in September 2024, she charged that Trump -sold us out on China- by -selling American chips to China to help them improve and modernize their military,- and advocated for targeted restrictions, particularly on AI and quantum computing, coordinated with US allies. Consequences of Continuity For American foreign policy practitioners, these policies may seem like an anchor of stability in a turbulent geopolitical sea. However, policy continuity risks ignoring the ways in which the region itself is changing. It is important, therefore, to consider the negative externalities these policies help generate, which contribute to growing instability and escalation risks over the long run. If ignored, these accumulating risks could lead to catastrophic deterrence failures. First, defining Taiwan as the worst-case-stress test for US military planning has over time increased arms racing pressures and exacerbated crisis instability. Since China cannot match the US -ship for ship, tank for tank,- Beijing focuses on investing in capabilities that target US weaknesses, predominantly in anti-access/area denial (A2AD). To maintain deterrence based on military superiority feeds a perception in Washington that it must continually increase arms production to overcome the growth in Chinese capabilities. At the same time, the centrality of the Taiwan scenario to US military planning—coupled with arms sales to Taipei and rhetorical support perceived by Beijing as advancing Taiwanese independence—drives more bellicose and aggressive Chinese behavior. This further reinforces US perceptions that deterrence is failing and needs to be re-established via augmented forces and greater support for Taiwan. This vicious cycle is already highly escalatory on its own, but attempting to deny China area superiority around Taiwan also requires US military planners to target multiple locations in the Chinese mainland, where most of Beijing’s anti-access/area denial capabilities are based. Even if the US would not strike these capabilities directly to avoid escalation in a conflict, military planners might nevertheless be prompted to target Chinese dual-use command, control, communication, and intelligence assets as a way to blunt China’s A2AD. Given the probable entanglement of these systems with China’s nuclear arsenal, this strategy carries substantial risks of inadvertent nuclear escalation, over and above the costs of arms racing. Second, worst-case planning by both Washington and Beijing is part of another spiral driving increased prominence of nuclear deterrence in the region. China is currently engaged in a substantial build-up of its nuclear arsenal, seemingly motivated by concerns about the survivability of its nuclear second-strike capability against the combination of US missile defenses and precision conventional strike arms. China’s fears are exacerbated by Washington’s reluctance to acknowledge mutual nuclear vulnerability—a strategic reassurance that the US does not seek to undermine China’s nuclear deterrent. This is another feature of US policy continuity, partly due to domestic politics (not wanting to be branded as -weak- on China), and partly due to allies’ concerns that acknowledging mutual vulnerability could attenuate US extended deterrence. The combination of growing nuclear threats from China (and North Korea) compounds the stress on US extended deterrence commitments, driving South Korea and Japan to seek more and more visible US nuclear capability in the region. In turn, efforts by the United States and its allies to continually -strengthen- deterrence drive arms race perceptions in Beijing and Pyongyang. Meanwhile, the sustained commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as a policy objective and the coercive posturing to achieve it have, over time, driven North Korea to accelerate its nuclear and missiles programs and posture its nuclear weapons in more aggressive ways. Continuing to condition negotiations with North Korea on Pyongyang’s willingness to commit to the ultimate objective of denuclearization—as opposed to focusing instead on shorter-term risk reduction options—is therefore inadvertently increasing conflict escalation risks on the Korean Peninsula. In this sense, continuity in US policy toward North Korea is part of yet another perilous action-reaction cycle, in which North Korea’s growing nuclear arsenal and its ability to threaten the US homeland incentivizes American deterrence investments, especially in national and regional missile defense capabilities. North Korea and China—which also perceives US and allied missile defense as a threat—respond with further increases and improvements in capabilities to defeat US missile defenses, thus fueling arms racing in the region. Finally, the continuation of efforts to -de-risk- US-China trade could unintentionally become a conflict driver. For instance, US policies to prevent the export of computer chips to China necessary for artificial intelligence may provide the US with advantages in AI-enabled military capabilities for the foreseeable future. Before that advantage becomes highly significant, however, some analysts worry that China might decide to risk a military conflict before its relative power declines further. More broadly, this raises a question about whether economic decoupling increases or decreases the prospect of war. Many leaders in Asia have long believed that economic interdependence is a key to stability, even as that interdependence could be weaponized to damage their economies and is thought by some scholars to have enabled structural violence and corruption. Change The most significant and widely discussed potential source of disruption to US policy continuity—and the one of greatest concern to US allies—is the uncertainty and chaos that could result from a second Trump presidency. Indeed, the policy continuity during his first term described above probably held despite Trump, reflecting the efforts of his advisors and the national security bureaucracy to stymie major departures from established policies. By all accounts, Trump intends to overcome these obstacles in a second term, not least by forcing the departure of large numbers of government civil servants, including those whose jobs are to implement policy toward Asia. In this regard, change in a second Trump administration is likely to be driven less by national security principle, more by ego and personal instincts, while continuity could apply to issues that don’t come on his radar. This degree of uncertainty means that any current policy could be up for change, with wide ranging implications for the region. For example, Trump seems likely to sustain or even deepen a trade war with China—he has recently proposed a 60 percent tariff on goods from China—unless he believed that a modus vivendi with Xi Jinping would elevate him as a statesman or further enrich his family enterprises. Some of these changes could increase the chances of blundering into conflict, while others might actually mitigate risks; the point is the lack of certainty in contrast with the relative continuity of the past. Of all the potential changes to alliances under Trump, the most consequential would be a decision to withdraw from the region or any one allied country in particular, given the latent isolationist and protectionist tendencies he represents, as well as Trump’s record of capricious behavior. Some political commentators believe that in a second term Trump would be less restrained by -moderate- advisors and could more easily overcome bureaucratic resistance to such a major departure from US security practice. Trump’s views of alliances as protection rackets are relatively well understood. He argued in the past that the presence of US forces in the Korean Peninsula was -no guarantee we’ll have peace- and he asked what the US was -getting out- of stationing troops, aircraft, ships and bases in Japan. There is little evidence to indicate whether or not in a second term Trump would go so far as to actually disband the US alliance system in Asia, an act that would be in serious tension with the Indo-Pacific policies he pursued from 2017-2021. Perhaps a less extreme course might be a switch to an offshore balancing strategy, in which the US would refrain from deploying large forces abroad and instead encourage other countries to take the lead in checking a rising China. This strategy could provoke nuclear proliferation by Japan and/or South Korea, which Trump himself stated was only a question of time. Another plausible change in a second Trump administration—one with a bit more evidence behind it, fake news or otherwise—is a shift in US policy toward North Korea. Clearly, Trump has a fascination with Kim Jong Un and may well regret that he did not seal a nuclear deal at their Hanoi summit in 2019. Thus, it is imaginable that Trump could attempt to resurrect a deal: to accept the existence of North Korea’s nuclear weapons and to -buy down- the threat, with Pyongyang ceasing missile testing in return for sanctions relief or other aid. This approach could effectively end denuclearization policy as it has existed for the last three decades. It might have some salutary short-term effects in reducing the potential for conflict around the Korean Peninsula, but could also exacerbate long-term risks, especially regarding South Korea’s potential nuclearization. Finally, although US extended nuclear deterrence also aims to disincentivize Japan and South Korea from developing their own nuclear arsenals, the increasing prominence of nuclear weapons in the region is inadvertently creating constituencies for independent nuclear capabilities among US allies. Even if the next US administration sustains an alliance-centric policy, it is plausible that an ally might choose to pursue nuclear weapons. South Korea appears to be the most likely case. There, domestic politics and public opinion favorable to nuclear weapons, concern about North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilities, and fear of abandonment by the US create fertile ground for a proliferation decision. This trend exists even apart from the prospect of a second Trump administration, which some in South Korea would welcome in the belief that Trump would be more likely to tolerate proliferation by Seoul. For Washington, South Korean nuclearization would pose a sharp tension between its long-standing support for nonproliferation and its desire to sustain alliances. Risks of nuclear conflict on the Korean Peninsula would increase, especially during the early buildout of an ROK arsenal, when it would be at greatest risk to North Korean and/or Chinese pre-emption. There also could be effects well beyond the region if leaders in other states decided that they should follow the ROK example and seek nuclear weapons. Conclusion As the next administration takes office in January 2025, it will inherit policies toward the Indo-Pacific that have long tails. There are good reasons these policies have remained in place. There are also good reasons to re-assess the wisdom of sustaining them given the changes under way in the region. The next administration is not locked into an inevitable course. There are alternative choices it could explore to mitigate dangers exacerbated by continuity. Perpetuating a policy of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is one such choice. Arms competition with China is another. Instead, the next administration could pursue comprehensive risk reduction strategies toward both Beijing and Pyongyang. Though it would be costly (politically, diplomatically, and perhaps economically) to back away from continuity, the risks of not doing so in some instances may be greater. At the same time, radical change—an overt US shift to offshore balancing for instance—could result in a region at far greater risk of military conflict, even nuclear war.

Uiju Military Airfield Welcomes Back Bombers	North Korea’s Uiju Airfield is back in business. Commercial satellite imagery shows the return of 31 Ilyushin IL-28 medium-range bombers to the base, ending a three-and-a-half-year absence while the airfield served as a quarantine center for incoming goods from China. Their return rebalances North Korea’s bomber aircraft between bases on the east and west coasts after having them all based on the east coast during Uiju Airfield’s closure. It also represents another step in North Korea’s move back to pre-pandemic conditions. Quarantine Center Conversion of the airfield into a quarantine center began in March 2021, approximately a year after North Korea closed its borders to all travelers and most cargo. The quarantine center began operating in December 2021, when trains began to arrive, and containers began to populate the main runway. That continued into early 2024, but by April, the number of containers had decreased significantly. By August, all had been removed, and the restoration of the airfield had begun. Also in early 2024, quarantine warehouses were periodically dismantled. On September 22, the paint marking began on the runway while work to restore other areas of the airfield continued in anticipation of the regiment’s return. In order support the temporary quarantine mission of the airfield, in the first half of 2021, the IL-28 regiment deployed to airbases on the country’s east coast—Changjin, home to another squadron of IL-28, and Sondok, a transport aircraft facility home to Antonov AN-2s. Return of the Bombers On imagery from October 4, five of the aircraft were observed on the southeast alert apron, 16 were on the northeast apron, and nine were located at the far eastern apron queued in front of one of two aircraft storage tunnels at the base. The last of the IL-28s never departed the airfield, likely because it was not flight worthy. It has been parked in one of a series of revetments along a service road south of the aircraft tunnels. Two of the other revetments along the road hold 12 and eight MIG-21 aircraft, respectively, all of which had been stored in the revetments throughout the conversion period. The bombers, which are also referred to as Harbin B-5, belong to the nation’s 24th Bomber Regiment.

What’s Up with North Korea’s Skyrocketing Exchange Rates?	In recent months, foreign exchange rates in North Korea have surged in ways that intuitively make little sense. The Korean People’s won (KPW), the country’s domestic currency, now trades at 16,100 to the dollar in Pyongyang—the highest recorded rate since Daily NK began tracking it in 2009. This marks a 92 percent increase over the past year, and a nearly 90 percent increase in just six months. The Chinese renminbi (RMB) rate has also increased, but less sharply, by 35 percent in the past six months. How can we explain this seemingly strange puzzle? Several factors appear to be at play. One is the reopening of trade after the pandemic, although current trade levels do not fully account for the sharp rise in exchange rates. North Korea’s trade with China, its largest trading partner by far, has only recently begun to recover, reaching 82 percent of pre-pandemic levels in 2023. Another factor may be Kim Jong Un’s -20&#215;10 Policy,- which aims to build modern factories in 20 rural cities and counties each year for the next ten years, requiring substantial imports of industrial goods. Increased trade with Russia could also be contributing, although it is unclear how much of North Korea’s arms exports are paid in cash versus in-kind with other goods. Even when combined, these factors do not fully explain the scale of the exchange rate rise. The most significant factors seem to be human psychology and market expectations. Expectations play a crucial role in setting exchange rates: if people anticipate the domestic currency will lose value, they tend to shift their holdings to foreign currency, and vice versa. In this case, expectations of a broader reopening of trade have likely fueled much of the KPW’s depreciation. When the market anticipates increased trade, more foreign currency is needed to pay for imports, causing the KPW to lose value. Ironically, government policies aimed at stabilizing the exchange rate closer to the official level seem to be having the opposite effect. Authorities recently issued a sternly-worded directive instructing everyone to work to stabilize exchange rates. The document blames -unfounded rumors- and unrealistic expectations for driving up rates and calls for the -eradication- of foreign currency hoarding. Predictably, it also mandates that all individuals and workplaces adhere strictly to the official exchange rate, while blaming black market currency traders operating outside state control. The problem for the government is that its official exchange rate of 8,900 KPW to the dollar is wildly unrealistic, set at about 50 percent of the -real- black market rate of 16,100 KPW . This discrepancy inevitably encourages continued trading at the much higher black market rate, given the opportunities for arbitrage. In response, the state has ramped up its crackdown on illegal money changers, ordering the confiscation of goods and cash from anyone caught trading foreign currency at rates above the official level. These measures only heighten market anxiety, prompting more people to hoard foreign currency, which in turn pushes the rate higher as expectations grow that the crackdown will make dollars even more scarce. The recent history of exchange rate fluctuations also suggests that the state’s repressive measures might be adding fuel to the fire. Exchange rates dropped sharply during COVID-19 border closures, and the North Korean won against both the dollar and renminbi as trade with China picked up in early 2023. Political signals at the time also hinted that trade with Russia could increase. Much of the stability then was likely due to state-driven monetary policy, with the government possibly limiting the supply of KPW to keep rates stable. An influx of foreign currency from increased trade may have also played a role. However, the state’s ability to control monetary policy is limited. Its reserves of foreign currency are small and tightly controlled, and a strict monetary policy could lead to reduced consumer spending and even deflation. Over time, exchange rates are likely to stabilize. As the market’s expectations of sharply increased trade fail to materialize, demand for foreign currency among firms and individuals will likely decrease. However, if the state’s aggressive crackdown on illegal currency exchange continues, hoarding could persist regardless of actual economic conditions. Only time will tell, but it is clear that the state has relatively few realistic tools at its disposal.
