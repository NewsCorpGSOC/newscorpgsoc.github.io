First Look at North Korea’s Uranium Enrichment Capabilities	On Friday, North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong Un visited uranium enrichment facilities to learn more about the country’s fissile material production process and . During the visit, Kim was accompanied by Hong Sung Mu, one of the country’s leading nuclear scientists, and the head of the country’s Nuclear Weapons Institute, whose name is unclear. The North Korean media coverage of this site visit is the first time images of the country’s centrifuge program have been shown. While only five photos were provided, it is clear that the uranium enrichment program has advanced significantly since it was first revealed. The centrifuges shown are not the P-2 equivalents observed by Dr. Siegfried Hecker during his delegation’s visit to the main Uranium Enrichment Plant (UEP) facility in Yongbyon in 2010, but a more advanced design. The size of the cascades and hall shown also signify substantial capacity, perhaps not to the level of -exponential growth- as Kim has mandated, but significant growth, nonetheless. And finally, it is probable that these centrifuges are North Korean designed and manufactured; however, they likely use at least some imported materials despite decades of increasingly harsh sanctions imposed to hinder the country’s nuclear development. These images send a strong message that the country has ample capacity and continued will to expand its nuclear program. The Centrifuges The centrifuges in the image are not the P-2 centrifuge equivalents seen in 2010 when Sig Hecker visited North Korea but appear to be a more advanced design. Based on the images, the cooling coils appear to be around the centrifuge motors inside a centrifuge housing. Centrifuges spin at incredibly high speeds and are subject to enormous stress that can lead to a mechanical failure. In such a case, the centrifuge housing serves as a barrier for blocking damage to nearby centrifuges caused by shrapnel. Another important protection measure is the fast-acting valves on the feed, product and tailpipes of each individual centrifuge, together with vibration sensors. The valves isolate the ailing centrifuge, blocking pressure impulses or dust that damages other centrifuges. Such valves are subject to export controls and are both hard to obtain and difficult to manufacture. The centrifuges are also secured by heavy footings to limit collateral damage in case of failures. The size of the cascade hall shows that North Korea’s enrichment program has taken substantial steps forward. What is shown in the images is probably of North Korean design, but likely required at least some imported materials to produce. Configuration In the first image, Kim Jong Un is seen standing alongside many centrifuges. There are approximately 70 visible in each row. There are two rows positioned close to each other and two more rows on the other side of the central piping. Added together, that makes approximately 280 centrifuges per section. The image appears to show three sections, and additional centrifuges are visible past some support columns. These seem to be the same columns in the second image, which is taken from the same platform but on the other side of the room. From this angle, we can see an additional three sections of centrifuges, so together, the hall could hold an estimated 1,680 centrifuges. A third image shows hundreds more centrifuges in a different room, which is determined from the different floor covering, lower ceiling and different walls. In this image, some of the centrifuges are not connected, providing visual proof of Kim’s intention to keep building up the country’s enrichment capability. Taken together, the two rooms likely account for over 2,000 centrifuges, although it should be noted that it is impossible to determine if they are all functioning. The Location This is one of the biggest questions and difficult to answer from the images alone, particularly because the visual clues available are few. What is clear is that at least two different rooms are depicted. The first appears to be at the UEP at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center. The two halls at the UEP measure approximately 120 meters by 15 meters each, but based on commercial satellite imagery, interior walls subdivide this space, so the actual length of the open floor space is approximately 93 meters. It is unclear where the second room is located. It is possible it is within the annex that was added in 2021 or 2022 to the centrifuge hall at Yongbyon, or it may be offsite at one of the suspected uranium enrichment facilities North Korea is yet to disclose.

The Next Big Thing? Possibilities for North Korea’s Longer Mobile Missile Launcher Chassis	On September 8, North Korea released an undated photo of Kim Jong Un standing next to an apparent road-mobile missile launcher (transporter-erector-launcher, or TEL) chassis that had at least 12 axles, compared to the previous 11-axle TEL of the large, liquid-propellant Hwasong-17 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Based on the additional axle(s), it is reasonable to assume the new TEL is longer than the Hwasong-17 TEL, and thus that the new chassis is associated with a longer new ICBM or a space-launch vehicle (SLV). However, the limited information to date does not allow confirmation that the vehicle in the photo is genuine, as opposed to an engineering or propaganda mock-up, and provides no solid basis to associate it with a specific type of ICBM or SLV. Assuming the new vehicle is associated with an ICBM or SLV, the main possibilities are: It remains to be seen whether the new vehicle makes it out of the factory and what ICBM or SLV system it may end up being associated with. At a minimum, the new chassis indicates North Korea’s continuing commitment to road-mobile missile deployment and further suggests Pyongyang is able to produce its own TELs. Information to Date On September 8, the North Korean press reported an undated visit by Kim Jong Un to a -defence industrial enterprise.- Analysis of the accompanying photographs indicates Kim visited the March 16 Factory in Phyongsong, North Korea’s main production facility for road-mobile missile launchers (TELs), which Kim previously visited in January and May of 2024. One of the photographs showed Kim standing next to an apparent TEL chassis with at least 12 axles. The overall length, width and number of axles could not be discerned, however. The top of the vehicle was not shown, no missile erector arms or other equipment were seen protruding above the vehicle’s side, and it was not carrying a missile, missile canister, or associated cradles. As noted elsewhere, an apparent lifting arm (presumably intended to help erect a missile) and other associated features were seen at the side rear of the vehicle that resemble those on the nine-axle TEL used for the Hwasong-18 solid-propellant ICBM. What Could It Be? The vehicle’s layout, green military paint job and presence at North Korea’s main TEL production facility all suggest the chassis is intended to be used as the basis of a new type of ballistic missile TEL. Based on the vehicle’s length as suggested by the number of axles, such a TEL would almost certainly be used with an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) or space-launch vehicle (SLV) system. (The Hwasong-18 and the liquid-propellant Hwasong-15 ICBM use nine-axle TELs; the liquid-propellant Hwasong-17, North Korea’s largest ICBM, uses an 11-axle TEL.) But the limited information to date does not allow confirmation that the vehicle in the photo is genuine, as opposed to an engineering or propaganda mock-up, and provides no solid basis to associate it with a specific type of ICBM or SLV. Assuming the vehicle is associated with an extant or developmental ICBM or SLV system, the four main possibilities are discussed below. 1) and 2) A Longer ICBM Although the vehicle’s overall length and even total number of axles is unknown, it is reasonable to assume the 12-plus-axle TEL is longer than the 11-axle Hwasong-11 TEL, and, thus that the new chassis would be associated with an ICBM system longer than the Hwasong-11. If such a system is under development, the photo released by the North Koreans is the first indication. Probably the two main contenders for a longer ICBM would be: A larger solid-propellant ICBM. The similarities between the rear of the new TEL and that of the Hwasong-18 may indicate there is a follow-on to that ICBM using longer booster stages. Longer stages of the current diameter could be used to provide more range, but the current missile has already demonstrated the capability to carry its flight tested payloads (weight unknown) to about 15,000 kilometers (km), easily enough to reach anywhere in the continental United States. Therefore, longer stages, with or without a diameter increase, would more likely be used to increase the amount of payload the missile could deliver to 15,000 km—a range flagged by Kim Jong Un in January 2021. Because the new vehicle’s width and overall length are unknown, there is no current basis to decide whether any new system uses larger-diameter booster stages; however, diameter increases would permit greater payload increases than length increases alone. Any increased payload would presumably be used to carry multiple warheads—if North Korea is confident that multiple reentry vehicles small enough in diameter to fit on the new solid missile’s final booster stage would survive reentry at operational ranges. More payload also could be used to carry decoys and other ballistic missile penetration aids. Pyongyang claimed to have conducted a flight on June 26 of a solid-propellant test booster releasing three reentry vehicles and a decoy, although the test apparently failed prior to actual payload release. A longer liquid-propellant ICBM. The similarities between the new TEL and the Hwasong-18 TEL do not rule out use with a longer follow-on to the Hwasong-17 liquid ICBM. Such a missile also presumably would use longer stages (with or without larger diameters) to achieve greater payload capability at current ranges, since the current Hwasong-17 also can reach targets anywhere in the US with its flight tested payloads. Because the current missile already has a very large payload capability due to its large size, the North would seem to have less of a need for a larger Hwasong-17 follow-on compared to a follow-on solid ICBM. But Pyongyang may have decided it needs an ICBM with even more payload capacity than the Hwasong-17 in order to carry multiple warheads large and heavy enough to confidently survive reentry at operational ranges without full-range flight testing—which the North has yet to perform and may wish to continue to avoid for political or other reasons. More payload weight also would permit more or larger decoys. 3) An SLV The use of the new chassis with an SLV cannot be ruled out. A mobile SLV launcher could be attractive to North Korea by allowing launches away from fixed facilities, thus varying launch and orbital locations, potentially increasing response time, and improving wartime survivability. The US and China, in particular, have been developing road-mobile SLV launchers for these reasons. North Korea’s latest SLV, the -Chollima-1,- uses a first stage based on the Hwasong-17 ICBM and is estimated to be about 29 meters long, three to four meters longer than the ICBM. That increased length might be compatible with the new, longer chassis. Although the green paint job of the new chassis would seem to suggest a military subordination, the North has thus far claimed the white-painted Chollima is under the civilian National Aerospace Technology Administration (NATA). It may become the case that some Chollimas will be controlled by the military for mobile launch, NATA may just use green TELs for its white missiles, or there may end up being both white/NATA and green/military mobile SLV launchers. Another possible SLV-related use of the new chassis would be as a stage transporter for the larger SLV North Korea is apparently developing, as suggested by activities at its Sohae Satellite Launching Ground since 2022. Depending on the size of the new SLV, the new chassis could be useful in moving its first stage, in particular, around and between production, final assembly and launch facilities. 4) A current ICBM Although a longer TEL intuitively suggests a longer missile, it is possible that the new TEL is associated with an existing ICBM system. If so, the best candidate would probably be the large Hwasong-17 liquid missile, where the addition of one or more axles would further distribute its 100,000-150,000 kg weight and reduce the ground pressure exerted when using its existing 11-axle TEL. Use of a longer TEL could thus open up more roadways and off-road locations to help better move and conceal field-deployed Hwasong-17 units, but would also limit the road curves that such a vehicle could traverse. Outlook It remains to be seen whether the new vehicle makes it out of the factory, and what ICBM or SLV system it may end up being associated with. But if it is a -new-type- system, there will be plenty of time to assess that system once it begins flight testing. At a minimum, the new chassis indicates North Korea’s continuing commitment to road-mobile missile deployment and further suggests Pyongyang is able to produce its own TELs.

Tapchon Naval Base: Planned Naval Base Makes the Most of Natural Defenses	Kim Jong Un’s visit to Tapchon—the future home to one of the country’s flagship naval bases—is expected to kick-start a significant construction project on North Korea’s east coast. The new base will sit on the site of a once-planned fishing port and will rely on natural defenses that could make it difficult for rival forces to penetrate. Depending on the ultimate size of the base, it could become one of the country’s most important military ports. The base construction comes as North Korea has been highlighting developments in naval technology, such as new warships and submarines, and amidst ongoing upgrades to some of the country’s military airfields. Background The work at Tapchon began ten years ago, but not with a naval base in mind. Kim Jong Un had given instructions for the construction of a large fishing port in the area, and it appears that the then-naval facility at Tapchon, which housed hovercraft for amphibious landings, was being sacrificed to make way for fishing boats. As detailed in our previous report, the hovercraft were moved out of the area just before work began in 2015 which included demolition of three of the four hovercraft sheds. Land reclamation and pier construction were already well underway in 2018 when a new rail connection was added. To extend the railway from Koam to Tapchon, engineers had to construct the country’s first maritime railway bridge—something for which they later received national awards. The bridge was completed in May 2018, and Kim Jong Un visited the site soon thereafter to inspect the project. In a report of the visit, North Korean state media said that Kim had -years ago- laid plans for -a large-scale fishing village zone in the areas of Koam, Tapchon and Chonapho.- According to the report, the new railway connection was built to speed up construction of the fishing village and transport fish once the project was opened. Construction at Tapchon was focused on a large fishing port until at least mid-2018. When construction shifted to building a naval base is unclear, as Tapchon has received scant mention in state media since 2018. The area’s only mentions have been in relation to stories reminiscing about Kim’s visit to inspect the bridge. Plans for a fishing village area were not repeated again. Even in the recent state media coverage of Kim’s recent visit, there was no mention of the fishing plans. While the area is in part used for fishing today, it is clear the original scale of the project was never realized. Bridge Changes One of the first major changes at the site happened only a year after the bridge was opened when it was converted to carry both rail and road traffic. Photos from Kim’s visit show the bridge carries a single-track railway, laid on a typical gravel bed, and two small paths on either side that would be suitable for foot or two-wheeled traffic. In 2019, roads were extended to both ends of the bridge. The gravel railbed was replaced with concrete, making it suitable for vehicles to cross in addition to trains. Location While Tapchon might have been originally noticed for its fishing grounds, its location at the top of Wonsan Bay makes it a strategic place for a naval base. The area is surrounded by mountains, islands and the Hodo Peninsula, which offer natural protection for the base, making it eminently defensible and allowing anti-air and missile defense installations to be emplaced on the peninsula and mainland. Underwater acoustic and magnetic sensor arrays can be installed to detect, identify, track, and destroy surface and subsurface threats with popup mines, torpedoes, and anti-ship missiles. Multiple layers of defense can be created, starting from the outer islands to the inner harbors. These features indicate that Tapchon could become one of the country’s largest naval bases. The hovercraft that were previously at Tapchon have been redeployed to several bases, including one on a peninsula approximately two kilometers south of the area. The peninsula also houses a base for Sohung-Class guided missile patrol boats and has a probable ZPU-4 anti-aircraft position atop the mountain with revetments and storage bunkers. The nearby Hodo Peninsula has been the site of numerous missile launch tests and about three kilometers east of Tapchon is the North Korean Navy’s October 3 Dockyards and Munchon Naval Base. Halfway down Wonsan Bay, just above the city of Wonsan, is a large palace where Kim Jong Un and family members spend much of their summer. Current Status Commercial satellite imagery from August 30 shows several fishing boats moored at a pier on the western side of the port, and fishing nets are visible drying on the dockside. Fishing nets are also visible in the bay approximately 500 meters offshore. However, little other infrastructure is present, indicating that whatever grand fishing plans did exist, they were never realized. There are 10 finger piers, three in the western zone and seven in the east. The piers on the west are each 100 meters long, and on the east, there are five piers that are 150 meters long, a 200-meter pier and a 300-meter pier. It is this latter pier that Kim Jong Un was photographed on. All of the piers are 10 meters wide. The five piers on the east side are evenly spaced every 75 meters, except for one gap of 160 meters. This is exactly enough room to construct an additional pier and maintain the 75-meter spacing. The piers all have a facility at the end, likely a utility closet for electricity or gasoline supply. There are also a number of marine railways used to take ships to and from the sea. Several have associated winch houses. Across the site there are numerous buildings under construction, although it is too early to determine their intended purpose. It is possible that some were associated with the fishing port plans and will serve no purpose in a future naval base. The railway station features a station north of the single track and a long 400-meter platform to the south. The track runs alongside approximately 250 meters of the platform. The modifications to the railway bridge carried out in 2019 mean the base is currently serviced by road and rail, albeit over a single-track bridge that carries both traffic. Looking Ahead With Kim Jong Un’s visit, the North Korean military will be expected to start turning his wishes into reality, and significant construction work at the site should begin. In addition to the construction of buildings, the road, rail and electric power infrastructure will require extensive expansion. Upgrades to air and maritime defenses are also likely.

North Korea’s Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site: Floodwaters Wash Out Bridges and Limit Access to the Tes...	Commercial satellite imagery indicates that the portal area of North Korea’s Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site incurred minor storm damage after the heavy summer rains, a pattern observed following the monsoon season year after year. Beyond flood-related activity, little else appears to have changed since our last update. Notably, no recent work has been detected either at Tunnel No. 3 (South Portal) or Tunnel No. 4 (West Portal). Flood-related Damage Year after year, monsoon season significantly affects North Korea, flooding various parts of the country and causing damage to homes, communities and farmlands. At Punggye-ri, in particular, heavy rainfall renders the site difficult to access, washing away vehicle bridges required to enter the site through mountainous terrain. This year was no exception. On imagery from September 3, at least seven bridges have been washed away from the portal area to the command and control facilities. Several footbridges have been installed across the creek bed in the interim. Once rainy weather conditions abate and access to the site is restored, it could take several weeks before vehicle bridges can be fully replaced. Tunnel No. 3 (South Portal) Since restoring access to Tunnel No. 3 and rebuilding the surrounding and main support areas in 2022, there has been constant speculation that North Korea would conduct a nuclear weapons test. However, while the entrance to the tunnels appeared to be complete by August of that year, no new test has yet been conducted to date. Personnel are occasionally observed around this tunnel, but little other activity appears to have taken place since 2022. Tunnel No. 4 (Former West Portal) Imagery from January 2023 showed efforts had begun to regain access to Tunnel No. 4, the entrance to which had been demolished in May 2018. The access road to the original tunnel entrance was graded, and the surrounding hillside stabilized, enabling vehicle activity. A wider area was cleared around the entrance near the creek bed, providing space for access to the tunnel network if and when needed. By April 24, 2023, a small shed was built in this area, potentially to protect the entrance of a future pilot tunnel to access the tunnel network. According to North Korean charts shown in 2018, only one test chamber was initially prepared for Tunnel No. 4 prior to demolishing the entrance, differing from the two test chambers available for Tunnel 3. Imagery from September 3, 2024 follows similar patterns to previous rainy seasons, where landslides have led to ground instability around the portal. In order to access Tunnel No. 4, headworks will be required to stabilize the surrounding hillside, as was in place for the original portal entrance. No further notable activity has been observed at the site. The reason for this extended hiatus in activity is unknown, though could be related to ground instability or a lack of need to reenter the tunnel, possibly due to no new developments to test.

North Korea’s New Naval Base: Tapchon	Commercial satellite imagery indicates the new naval base under construction, recently visited by Kim Jong Un, is a long-time naval hovercraft facility in Tapchon (located within Wonsan Bay). This site has been under on-and-off construction for the last decade. When complete, Kim expects the site to be one of the country’s flagship naval bases, meant to house the country’s latest warships and submarines that cannot be anchored at other bases. Large surface warships require deep water. However, North Korea’s west coast is shallow and not well suited for such vessels. This new east coast facility is well positioned, with access to the deep sea. It is also surrounded by high mountains to either side, perfect for the placement of artillery and missile stations that will provide protection for the base. Moreover, the piers at the Tapchon site are already long enough to accommodate a number of large warships. Work at the site began around 2015 but stalled for several years. Kim’s visit and instructions should lead to a significant expansion in construction activity to repurpose the site. This construction pattern is common after a visit by the leader, but especially so in this case, given Kim’s reported -need to make epochal progress- in -bolstering up the naval combat power- of the nation. Site History The site in Tapchon, in Kangwon’s Munchon county, has been a Korean People’s Navy hovercraft base since at least 2003. Images of the facility in 2013 show four large hovercraft sheds and numerous hovercraft observed along the coast. But the site started to change a year later. From mid-2014, hovercraft began to appear at nearby ports and beaches, apparently moved from Tapchon. Imagery shows that by November of that year, many of the houses at the base were being demolished. In 2015, land reclamation work was underway at the coast; in 2016, several of the piers that are now visible at the port were under construction. In 2017, a railway line was extended from the neighboring October 3 dockyard across a newly constructed bridge into Tapchon Port. At the end of that year, thousands of concrete blocks are visible, waiting to be used to build up the piers. Most of the piers that are visible today were completed by 2019, and in the preceding five years, a handful of buildings were constructed, including those visible behind Kim Jong Un in state media images. Progress at the site has been relatively slow, however, and certainly pales in comparison to the speed of other priority projects, such as the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, Wonsan Kalma tourist zone and Pyongyang housing projects. Given Kim’s instructions, a significant uptick in construction activity is expected in the near term to ready the site for the country’s naval expansion plans.

Sinpho South Shipyard: Construction and Modernization Efforts Continue	Recent commercial satellite imagery indicates that North Korea’s newest ballistic missile class submarine (SSB), the -Sinpo-C- class, is undergoing an extensive fitting-out period at the Sinpho South Shipyard. The submarine, also named the Hero Kim Kun Ok, was launched September 6, 2023, and was berthed in the secure boat basin under the protective awning, where it appears to have stayed until May 2024. At that time, it was moved to the drydock, likely to continue work on the lower half of the submarine. Probable submarine construction continues, demonstrated by the presence of hull sections in the materials staging area servicing the construction halls. Submarine components reappeared in April 2024, and new parts continue to be observed. Building repairs also appear to be taking place, as evidenced by the presence of probable refurbishment materials on adjacent quays. At the launch ceremony of the Hero Kim Kun Ok, Kim Jong Un announced plans to build additional SSBs and modernize existing vessels. It is probable that much of the activity observed throughout Sinpho South Shipyard is in support of this mandate. The Drydock Between May 8 and 18, the Sinpo-C SSB was moved from the basin to the drydock located at the northeast end of Sinpho. Imagery from August 19 shows it remains there. The move to the drydock indicates the fitting-out phase has moved to the lower components of the submarine. This may include its propulsion system, steering mechanisms or possibly its bow section, where the sonar and torpedo tubes are placed. Unlike the experimental SINPO-class (the 8.24 Yongung or GORAE/SINPO-class), which has served as a test platform, the Sinpo-C has 10 missile tubes that extend deep into the submarine hull, which require attention prior to the vessel beginning its initial sea trials. A protective canvas covering was erected over the entire length of the submarine between July 8 and 19. Due to monsoon season, it is likely the covering provides protection for the yard workers against the elements; however, concealment purposes cannot be ruled out. The Hero Kim Kun Ok varies significantly in design from the previous SINPO-Class SSB. It is likely that the submarine requires final adjustments or maintenance to prepare it for sea trials and eventual use. The Secure Boat Basin Since the movement of the Sinpo-C to the drydock in mid-May, the SINPO-class SSB was moved under the awning in the secure boat basin. The SINPO-class has only been visible protruding from under the awning twice, confirming its continued presence through May; however, due to the unique geometry required to see the vessel beneath the awning, its presence since then cannot be verified. On imagery from August 19, a small craft was observed on the quay at the north end of the awning. Although covered with a light-toned covering, a small, raised superstructure is observed at midship. While the nature of the craft cannot be determined, the basin has been the home to several experimental boats, from the GORAE to small possible pilotless (drone) submarines. However, small boats—other than a yard craft—have rarely been seen inside the secure boat basin, signifying the possible importance of this small, covered craft and warranting further monitoring of this craft. Construction Halls In May, submarine hull components were observed in the materials staging area located immediately south of the fabrication and construction halls. The arrival and continued movement of these components support Kim Jong Un’s instructions for additional SSB units to be built and deployed. Imagery from August 19 showed additional hull sections had been brought into the staging yard, likely supporting ongoing submarine construction. The south construction hall underwent a complete renovation in 2014 to accommodate modern submarine construction. On August 19, materials and small piles of aggregate were observed on the roll-out-to-launch quay. The nature of the work to be done is unknown, but it is possible the building requires additional refurbishment given the new types of vessels. Two floating cranes and the submersible pop-up barge were also berthed at the quay. The presence of the submersible test barge is unrelated to any refurbishment efforts, as it has been observed alternately between the quay and the secure basin for various periods of time. At the long pier to the south of the construction halls and basin, concrete blocks continue to be staged along the length of the pier. The intended use of these blocks is unknown. South Pier and Probable Submarine Storage Facility Imagery from August 19 indicates construction activity has picked up on the probable submarine storage and maintenance building, L-shaped pier, seawall and quay areas. Since April, a large number of concrete blocks have been positioned on the pier and at the quay in front of the new storage and maintenance hall. Work on a new sea wall also continues with the placement of additional concrete blocks along its length. However, the construction on the hall has not moved forward with much urgency. To complete the hall, dirt is needed to be backfilled along the north wall. It is possible that installation of roof trusses or moveable overhead cranes is also needed. Diving School While not directly related to activity at Sinpho South Shipyard, in an open area east of the dive school on the south shore of the peninsula, efforts to build a sea wall between two wharfs continue. In addition, since April, hundreds of concrete tetrapods have been neatly arranged. The tetrapods are concrete wave breakers commonly seen worldwide and used as breakwaters to preserve beach erosion in areas with rough waters. It is also possible that they could be used as obstacles to train amphibious assault teams. It is unclear whether the tetrapods have been cast at this location or brought in to be used to protect the nearby beaches and sea-facing quays.

A Challenging but Essential Task: Security Cooperation Between South Korea and Japan	Security cooperation between the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea) and Japan may appear to be a relatively recent development, but over the past 70 years—from the onset of the Korean War to the present day—Japan has contributed to South Korean security in various ways. Although the likelihood of Japan providing financial and technological assistance has significantly decreased, its capacity to offer logistical and operational assistance in a Korean contingency has notably increased in recent years. These findings are not solely based on my own observations; they are the culmination of interviews with over 60 security experts from the United States, Japan and South Korea. In this context, South Korea and Japan should establish a formal framework for discussing the scope of logistical and operational support Japan could provide in the event of a crisis on the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, the United States, South Korea and Japan should collaboratively formulate a strategy to manage a potential two-front war scenario, encompassing contingencies in both Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula. Addressing these issues should be a central aspect of South Korea-Japan security cooperation moving forward. How Far Could South Korea-Japan’s Security Cooperation Evolve? The Korean War of 1950 was initiated by North Korea, with backing from the Soviet Union and China. To prevent the further spread of communism in the region, the United States intervened militarily, primarily using Japan as a logistics base. This event underscored the importance of Japan’s role in a Korean contingency, leading to the establishment of the UN Command-Rear in Japan in 1957, solidifying its function as a logistical hub. Aware of this security link between South Korea and Japan, the leaders of both countries managed to preserve the existing security framework despite occasional negative public sentiments, often triggered by sensitive matters, such as textbook controversies, comfort women and the Yasukuni Shrine. North Korea’s expanding WMD capabilities, along with rising concerns about a potential Chinese military invasion of Taiwan in recent years, are heightening the importance of security cooperation between South Korea and Japan. While North Korea’s nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching Japan could potentially lead to a nuclear decoupling between the United States and Japan, South Korea’s role in a Taiwan contingency remains speculative. Regardless of the scenario, a closely aligned partnership between the United States, South Korea and Japan will be the crucial foundation for ensuring South Korea’s security. Given these conditions, robust security cooperation between South Korea and Japan, within the context of the US-ROK-Japan trilateral relations, is considered vital for South Korea’s national interests. Recent positive developments in trilateral security cooperation include the institutionalization of efforts through the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework (TSCF). While the specific details of the TSCF remain confidential, and it is uncertain whether it will evolve into something akin to an Asian version of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), it is evident that interoperability among the trilateral partners will be strengthened. This progress has paved the way for enhanced security cooperation between South Korea and Japan, including agreements such as the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreements. Despite these achievements, however, doubts remain among both Koreans and Japanese about whether the current bilateral security cooperation can be sustained over the long term. To better understand the nature of this challenge, it is crucial to examine the modern history (1950 to 2024) of security contributions Japan has made to South Korea to see how security and political triggers have transformed it over time. This retrospective analysis could provide insights for future bilateral security cooperation. The period under review could be segmented into five distinct phases, detailed below. Japan’s security contributions made during each of those phases can be categorized into three types: logistical support, operational support and financial and technological support. Such distinction in timing was established after consultations with over 20 Japanese security experts, including Akiyama Masahiro, a former Vice Defense Minister of Japan. In Phase I (1950-1953), Japan primarily focused on providing logistical support to South Korea.[1] This approach was influenced by the use of Japan as a strategic base and primary supply hub by the United Nations (UN) forces, primarily made up of US troops, during the Korean War. Financial and technological support from Japan was minimal, as the majority of such assistance came from the United States. The lack of diplomatic normalization between Japan and South Korea at that time also hindered significant financial and technological contributions from Japan. Although Japan did contribute operational support by deploying minesweepers in Korean waters, it did not send combat units to the Korean Peninsula due to both domestic and international constraints. Consequently, Japan’s operational support during this period was moderate. In Phase II (1954-1968), following the Korean Armistice Agreement in 1953, Japan’s operational support naturally waned.[2] Although diplomatic relations between South Korea and Japan normalized in 1965, US aid remained pivotal in addressing South Korea’s economic needs, reducing the demand for financial and technological support from Japan. While logistical support saw a reduction compared to Phase I, it still played a significant role among the three types of contributions throughout this period. Japan continued to be essential in supporting US bases in Japan in the event of a contingency on the Korean Peninsula, a role reinforced by the signing of a secret agreement between the United States and Japan in 1960. In Phase III (1969-1995), the levels of logistical and operational support from Japan stayed relatively consistent with those of Phase II, influenced by similar conditions.[3] During this period, South Korea actively pursued financial and technological assistance from Japan, particularly for constructing the Pohang steel mill in the late 1960s, as restrictions on US aid for heavy industries and a scarcity of international financing posed significant challenges. In the early 1980s, South Korea sought defense burden-sharing. However, due to domestic political constraints, Japan was unable to supply military hardware and instead provided a $4 billion loan. In Phase IV (1996-2014), Japan’s financial and technological support decreased as South Korea’s economic advancement rendered such assistance redundant.[4] Meanwhile, operational support escalated from minimal in Phase III to moderate in Phase IV, primarily due to the implementation of the 1997 Defense Guidelines and the 1999 Act on Measures to Ensure the Peace and Security of Japan in Perilous Situations in Areas Surrounding Japan (SIASJ Law). Logistic support experienced a significant rise, prompted by the launch of a North Korean ballistic missile over Japan in 1998, which led Japan to intensify its efforts in safeguarding US bases against various threats. In Phase V (2015-2024), Japan’s financial and technological support continued to be minimal, reflecting South Korea’s robust economic growth.[5] However, logistical and operational support saw an increase, driven by Japan’s implementation of further measures to protect US bases and an expansion of the Japan Self-Defense Forces’ (JSDF) role in potential Korean contingencies. This enhancement was markedly influenced by the 2015 Defense Guidelines and Japan’s 2015 security legislation. Japan as an Active Participant in a Korean Contingency Based on the elements discussed, two major implications emerge. First, considering the size of South Korea’s economy, it is unlikely that Japan would revert to some level of financial and technological support for South Korea’s security in the near future. This type of contribution occurred primarily during Phase III, when South Korea required significant funding for full-fledged industrialization in the 1970s and the development of social infrastructure in the 1980s, during a time when other foreign funding sources, particularly from the United States, were inadequate. However, given South Korea’s current economic status, this type of cooperation is simply not necessary anymore. Second, the current level of logistical and operational support is likely to persist indefinitely, regardless of political regime changes in Tokyo or Seoul, due to irreversible structural developments. Since no all-out war similar to the Korean War has occurred since the 1953 Korean Armistice, the extent of Japan’s potential contribution in such a scenario remains uncertain. However, it is clear that Japan has significantly enhanced and expanded its capacity to support US forces operationally in a Korean contingency, largely due to the 2015 security legislation.[6] This legislation marked a shift from Japan’s previous policy of acting solely in self-defense, allowing the JSDF to engage in foreign conflicts. It is also evident that Japan would take every measure to protect US bases within its territory in accordance with Operation Plan 5055, which is crucial in the initial phase of a Korean contingency. During this phase, US forces stationed in Japan would be deployed from these bases to the Korean Peninsula before the main reinforcements arrived from the US mainland. Many Japanese defense experts and officials I have interviewed believe that if a full-scale war were to erupt on the Korean Peninsula, Japan would likely provide logistical and operational support to the US, at least equivalent to what was provided during the Korean War period. Recommendations Given these factors, challenges to sustaining or even enhancing ROK-Japan security relations on a longer-term basis exist. In this context, two policy recommendations emerge. Policy Recommendation Number One: South Korea and Japan should establish a Military Committee Meeting (MCM)-like mechanism to discuss the extent of logistical and operational support Japan could offer in the event of a Korean contingency, such as the allocation of North Korean ground targets.[7] To be sure, such a bilateral mechanism should operate within the framework of the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework. After discussions with both South Korean and Japanese defense officials, there will predictably be issues where the two sides do not see eye to eye. For instance, in the case of a North Korean invasion of South Korea, the South Korean military firmly rejects any potential deployment of the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Force to the Korean Peninsula for any reason. However, the Japanese side has indicated that the Self-Defense Forces might be deployed to evacuate Japanese citizens from major South Korean cities and that Japan could exercise its right to self-defense if attacked by North Korean forces while carrying out evacuations within South Korean territory.[8] Another point of disagreement is likely to be around the potential circumstances under which Japan might use its recently adopted (2022) -counterstrike capability.- Some South Korean and Japanese security experts believe in integrating Japan’s enhanced capabilities with South Korea’s three-axis system, although numerous challenges must be addressed to do so, including matters of sharing target information and allocating targets. Prioritizing these issues should be a key focus of future South Korea-Japan security cooperation, with discussions occurring regularly rather than sporadically. To address the concerns mentioned above (such as the potential deployment of the JSDF on the Korean Peninsula and the alignment of Japan’s enemy base strike capability with South Korea’s three-axis system) in greater detail, South Korea and Japan should review their respective contingency plans (South Korea’s OPLAN 5015 and Japan’s OPLAN 5055) and discuss the aspects that may involve both countries using the MCM-like mechanism. Policy Recommendation Number Two: The US, South Korea and Japan should develop a coordinated plan to address a potential two-front war scenario. As tensions have risen in the Taiwan Strait in recent years, the US and Japan have engaged in detailed discussions about their potential responses to a Taiwan contingency. The nature of these responses could vary, depending on the extent of China’s military actions towards Taiwan. However, South Korean defense experts have expressed concerns that such a scenario could diminish the capabilities of US Forces Japan and Japan itself in responding to a crisis on the Korean Peninsula. They worry that if Kim Jong Un views the situation in Taiwan as an opportunity, he might initiate military provocations on the Korean Peninsula. In this kind of multi-front scenario, many South Koreans believe that the US and Japan might be unable to assist South Korea as their resources could be maxed out defending Taiwan. In such a case, while Operation Plan 5015 (detailing actions by US Forces Korea and South Korean forces in a Korean contingency) would be activated, Operation Plan 5055 (outlining the response of US Forces Japan and Japan in a Korean contingency) might not be fully implementable due to the diversion of resources to Taiwan. One Japanese SDF official explained in an interview, for instance, that in a scenario involving conflicts on two fronts, Japan would likely be preoccupied with protecting Taiwan, deploying most of its available aircraft and naval vessels there, except those needed for the defense of Japan, since securing the Taiwan Strait is a top priority for Japan. Although the likelihood of such a critical two-front war scenario is not high, it is imperative that the United States, South Korea and Japan devise measures that could deter Kim Jong In from misjudging the potential for North Korean success in such a situation. These include: 1) reaffirming that OPLAN 5015 will be fully implemented under any circumstances if North Korea decides to invade South Korea; 2) ensuring that nuclear decoupling among the United States, South Korea and Japan will not occur; and 3) confirming that the US extended nuclear deterrence remains intact. Conclusion Historical issues have consistently affected the relationship between South Korea and Japan since normalizing relations in 1965. However, recent developments have made reliable security cooperation between the two countries essential within the context of the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework. With North Korea’s nuclear-tipped missiles capable of targeting both Seoul and Tokyo, a potential crisis in the Taiwan Strait could prompt Kim Jong Un to take provocative actions on the Korean Peninsula as well. Kim is well aware that a united front among the US, South Korea and Japan would greatly reduce the likelihood of success for any North Korean military aggression against South Korea. Consequently, he is likely to attempt to exploit the weakest link within this tripartite structure: the relationship between South Korea and Japan. The upcoming US election in November could introduce further complications. If Trump wins and seeks to significantly raise the costs of stationing US forces in both South Korea and Japan, the two countries may respond differently. Such varied responses could lead to a rift within the alliance, potentially convincing Kim Jong Un of a lack of cohesion among the US, South Korea, and Japan. It is crucial for the tripartite to work diligently to prevent this, as a division would leave them ill-prepared to handle a crisis in Taiwan, on the Korean Peninsula or both.

Work Progresses at Wonsan-Kalma Beach Resort	Commercial satellite imagery shows activity has picked up at North Korea’s Wonsan-Kalma Beach Resort following Kim Jong Un’s visit last month. Construction has resumed on several parts of the resort that have been stalled since the start of the pandemic, as crews work to meet Kim’s new target of May 2025 to open the resort. The most notable progress has been on the replacement for a recently demolished amphitheater. While Kim has also mandated a -readjustment of even some of the construction projects of national importance- to prioritize rebuilding areas in the northern part of the country damaged by flooding, imagery from September 4 shows that work at Wonsan continues, demonstrating the special status this resort seems to hold among the country’s construction-based economic initiatives. Amphitheater Previous reports note that the seaside amphitheater was demolished shortly after Kim Jong Un’s July 16 visit to the site. Prior to demolition, the venue had hardly been used, if at all. Such changes are not uncommon after Kim’s visits to ongoing construction projects. Imagery from September 4 shows the beginnings of a new theater or amphitheater at the site. It appears foundation work is underway, but it is too early to tell exactly what form the replacement structure will take. Grading and expanding of the sea wall to either side of the new facility is also underway. Water Park At the water park, piles of aggregate—probably mixing sand—can be seen around the site, appearing to have been brought in mid- to late-August. No other work has yet been observed. It can be expected that pool coating, pool furniture, and landscaping will be installed closer to the resort’s opening due to the upkeep these types of finishings and furnishings would require. Possible Arena At the building, which was identified as a possible arena, the blue material that had covered about a third of the roof since early June appears to have been removed. Additional construction material is also visible in the area around the building. It remains to be seen what the completion of this work will look like.

Kaesong Industrial Complex: A Tortured History and Uncertain Future	Overview The Kaesong Industrial Complex (KIC), a joint venture between North Korea and South Korea that hosted South Korean manufacturers inside North Korea and employed North Korean labor, shut down in 2016 amid deteriorating relations. Recent commercial imagery analysis shows a moderate uptick in activity—especially since 2023. This renewed activity could signal that North Korea is preparing to restart some industrial activity at the KIC with internal resources or is refurbishing the complex to attract allies more aligned with North Korea. Activity The Kaesong Industrial Complex was opened in December 2004 as a symbol of efforts to create peace and stability on the Peninsula. The complex—situated just north of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)—was designed to host South Korean factories and manufacturers who would employ North Korean workers. The KIC operated for more than a decade despite ebbs and flows in the inter-Korean relationship. While similar initiatives were susceptible to the broader political climate, Kaesong appeared to withstand administration changes in South Korea and provocations from either side of the border until 2016. Even once it closed, there was still hope in Seoul and Pyongyang to restart operations, as most recently evidenced by its inclusion in the Panmunjom Declaration in 2018. But like broader North-South relations, those dreams faded quickly after the failure of the US and North Korea to sign an agreement in Hanoi in 2019, which would have paved the way for greater cooperative activity to move forward but instead resulted in the DPRK returning to more of an isolated approach to its foreign relations. Inter-Korean relations today have reached a new low point, with Pyongyang rejecting the notion of peaceful reunification and dismantling its related institutions. As tensions escalate between North and South, the dream of resuming operations at the KIC and other cooperative projects seems from an era long gone. South Korea has disbanded the Kaesong Industrial Foundation, which managed operations at the KIC, and unconfirmed reports suggest North Korea has eyes on using KIC to build its own industrial base. Commercial satellite imagery suggests there has, indeed, been a resurgence of activity at the KIC in recent months that would indicate plans to use the facility are moving forward, without South Korean partnership. Background The pilot phase of KIC development included around 15 South Korean companies with manufacturing facilities. The initial phase—including the pilot—was intended to house 300 ROK companies, 100,000 DPRK workers, and occupy 800 acres. Though the complex was never fully built out, the final vision for the project, intended to be complete by 2012, was designed to be able to accommodate 1,500 South Korean companies, 350,000 North Korean workers, and span 4,800 acres plus 1,600 acres of supporting area—an exponentially large number of employees, factories and auxiliary/support facilities. This vision, of course, was never fully realized. At the time of its closure, KIC contained over 120 South Korean manufacturers and employed over 50,000 North Korean workers. Initial plans grouped factories into sectors based on the types of goods produced, including electricity and electronics; machinery and metals; chemicals, rubbers and plastics; textiles, sewing and apparel; leather, bags and shoes; and mixed industries and/or undefined manufacturing sectors. The complex also held several support elements, including a hospital and medical center, a landfill/open garbage dump, a water/waste treatment plant, city government offices complex, the Kaesong Industrial District Management Committee office, a quarry and concrete batch plant, and importantly, a bus depot where vehicles transporting workers to and from the complex were kept, potentially alluding to the level of activity occurring within the confines of the KIC. In 2018, as inter-Korean relations improved, an Inter-Korean Joint Liaison Office was also established within the compound. The complex briefly shuttered in spring 2013 when North Korea unilaterally recalled its workers and closed borders to the South in response to broader inter-Korean tensions. This period was marked by a series of North Korean nuclear tests, North Korea unilaterally ending inter-Korean peace pacts, and general hostility coming from both sides of DMZ. Despite these tensions, negotiations to reopen the complex began a few months later, and by September, operations had restarted. After North Korea’s satellite launch in February 2016, South Korea’s President Park Geun-hye unilaterally announced the ROK would close the KIC, asserting that North Korea was utilizing funds from the complex to fuel its WMD program. The South then moved to shut off electricity supply to the area. Upon closure in February 2016, some equipment and materials were left behind in hopes of a near-term reopening, much like the brief closure and reopening in 2013. Yet, despite multiple attempts to reach consensus to reopen the KIC, it has since remained shuttered. The Rise and Fall of the Inter-Korean Liaison Office In 2018, the two Koreas pushed for the revival of large-scale inter-Korean economic projects, including the KIC, as committed under the Panmunjom Declaration. An Inter-Korean Liaison Office was established in the center of the KIC, with hopes that further implementation of the agreement would follow swiftly. However, neither side was able to secure the sanctions exemptions needed to move forward, and eventually, both US-DRPK and inter-Korean negotiations collapsed in 2019. In June 2020, North Korea destroyed the inter-Korean liaison office as a dramatic display of how much inter-Korean relations had deteriorated. North Korean state media reported the building as being -tragically ruined with a terrific explosion, calling it an -eyesore- that was -unnecessary and useless.- Of the two buildings in the complex, the explosion was targeted at the joint liaison office but also caused significant damage to the Kaesong Industrial District Management Committee office nearby. (Figures 3a-3c) There have been rumors that North Korea has coopted various parts of the KIC since its shutdown in 2016. It is difficult to corroborate these assertions using only satellite imagery due to a shortage of outwardly visible signatures for factory operations and the infrequency of imagery captured. However, some observable activity around the complex provides clues as to its operating status in recent years, especially around the support facilities. Bus Depot Though there are few consistent indicators of the full extent of the KIC’s operation, vehicle parking patterns at the bus depot provide some insights. At full operation, South Korean-owned buses were utilized to transport North Korean workers to KIC each day and remained parked at a depot located toward the east of the complex’s boundary overnight. The number of vehicles became a relative measure of the size of the workforce employed at Kaesong—as the complex grew, so did the number of buses parked at the depot. In 2015—around the peak of activity at KIC—approximately 300 buses were routinely observed in the parking lot, arranged in an orderly fashion, alongside additional support vehicles like trucks, mobile cranes and large trailers. During operations, these types of vehicles could be observed at factories around the complex, whereas buses typically remained in the lot. With this as a baseline, subsequent imagery reveals a gradual fluctuation in the number of buses and other vehicles over time. On imagery from June 2020, the total number of buses parked at the depot was around 280 at the time of capture. Most vehicles remained in the same positions they occupied four years prior, although some were observed in different positions within the depot, indicating at least some activity had taken place. While day-to-day movements at the KIC are impossible to determine from satellite imagery alone, especially given infrequent coverage of the site, the relative positions suggest very little activity during that four-year period. However, on imagery from May 2024, half the buses parked at the depot since 2016 were dispersed throughout the complex. Moreover, several images from 2020 to the present show buses parked near various factories and sectors. While not enough evidence to fully discern which building(s), if any, are in use, the locations of these buses throughout the site provide some clues as to which factories have been in operation, were being refurbished, or where parts and equipment were being transferred within the KIC or removed from the complex altogether. For example, buses have been observed outside of factories in sectors such as machinery and metals, electronics and electricity, textiles, sewing, apparel and mixed industry. (Figures 5-10) Activity surrounding buildings in this area remained minimal until March 2021, when unidentified materials were observed on the ground within a rectangular enclosure located in the main parking lot. Materials remained through the end of September 2021. The purpose of these materials is unclear. On imagery from April 17, 2024, three buses and large crowds of people—presumably workers—were seen in the area adjacent to Jahwa Electronics and Korea Terminal Industry buildings. The crowds were unusual to the area. Workers may have been gathered for refurbishment activity, training for new plant employees, or cleaning and maintenance at the factories or for their operation, though it cannot be determined with certainty based on imagery alone. The area surrounding machinery and metals factories remained frozen in time until April 2023, when a mobile crane previously parked in the central lot was observed in a different location, and scrap materials had been removed from one of the buildings and piled outside. On imagery from April 2024, two buses, several trucks, and other equipment were observed at the site, and the amount of scrap material stockpiled had increased. Though the exact nature of the materials is unclear, they vary in nature and do not appear to be sourced from the same place. It cannot be said what exactly the scrap material is a result of, but the fluctuation of the size of the pile does signify that workers have returned to the factory for cleaning and/or refurbishment. Chemical, Rubber and Plastics Section Unidentified materials observed near a compound in the eastern part of this area were gradually removed starting in 2016 until they had been completely removed by April 2020. Much of the material was covered by dark tarping, suggesting the need to protect it from the elements, likely for reuse elsewhere throughout the site. Imagery from April 17, 2024 showed only one bus was parked outside this same compound, with no additional activity observed. Textiles, Sewing and Apparel Section Two areas of the complex house factories that manufacture textiles—the larger is located in the south-central portion of the KIC, and the other is on the west side. In 2016, a gathering of private vehicles—automobiles, vans and small trucks—was observed outside of a building within the larger grouping of textile factories. It is possible they belonged to South Korean workers at the KIC. All had been removed by 2017. Little activity was observed throughout the area until April 2023, when five buses, a tractor-trailer and approximately a dozen cars were present. The presence of vehicles continues and can be confirmed as late as imagery dated June 2024. In the smaller grouping of textile factories, no activity was observed until personnel and buses were seen on imagery from April 17, 2024. North Korea has been rumored to be utilizing textile factories to develop an industrial base, and, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, to operate these facilities to fulfill orders from China. According to Radio Free Asia (RFA), a North Korean official stated that Pyongyang had -renovated and expanded the clothing and footwear factories- at the KIC. While satellite imagery alone cannot confirm these reports, the presence of vehicles and crowds suggests some kind of activity is occurring in this sector. Mixed Industries Section The mixed industries sector is composed of a breadth of different factories, including electronics, car pumps, watches, semiconductors, cosmetics, garments, etc. Unlike most of the other sectors, the mixed industries area revealed activity on imagery from September 26, 2021, where nine buses had parked together next to the Jaeyoung Solutech Telecom Components building. Buses and workers were observed in the same area on imagery from September 2022. In April of 2023 and 2024, buses continued to be observed in this specific area, as well as scattered near several other factory buildings throughout the sector, suggesting some kind of ongoing operations. Korea Industrial Complex Corporation Factory Apartments Located in the southernmost area of the KIC’s boundaries is the Korea Industrial Complex Corporation Factory Apartments, built throughout 2006 and 2007 by the Korea Industrial Complex Corporation and opened to workers in September 2007. The building was reported to be a factory-apartment, housing 33 companies and 2,500 workers from both Koreas and rented for 4,500 won ($4.90 USD at the time) per square meter. A second factory-apartment building was also built by the Kaesong Industrial District Management Committee the following year. During the construction period, a bus lot located immediately to the west of the building was typically filled with private cars. Discernable activity around the building appeared to cease in 2016. However, imagery from April 17, 2024 revealed two buses and a van, along with scores of people in large, organized groupings or formations in the parking lot. The purpose of this assembly is unclear, though could be attributed to workers living onsite due to the residential nature of the building. This gathering of people was observed on the same day as large crowds were observed in the Electricity and Electronics sector. Non-manufacturing facilities within the KIC also require monitoring—such as the landfill, the concrete batch plant and city government offices. Landfill At the landfill, the amount of waste deposited began to increase significantly in 2021 after four years of little observed change. The increase in waste—comparing levels in 2016 to levels in 2024—could indicate that efforts to clean or refurbish factories throughout the complex may be underway, and possibly a sign of growth in operations. For instance, at the east waste pond, there were approximately 1,916 square yards of surface waste in 2016, compared to 3,004 square yards in 2021 and 4,417 in 2024 (0.4, 0.62, and 0.91 acres, respectively), representing more than double the surface footprint. However, this is not a measure of volume, so the total amount of waste cannot be captured completely. Located at the north end of the complex, a concrete batch plant played a significant role in providing materials for the construction of factories at the beginning of Kaesong’s operation. The plant remained dormant until 2021, when imagery revealed subtle signs of activity beginning with the arrival of unidentified linear materials and material having been removed from a pile of aggregate—loosely compacted material fragments. Imagery from April 17, 2024 revealed the number of mixing stations dropped from two to one, suggesting a lower possible output. A new support building had been added at the south end of the quarry, and vehicles were observed moving bulk materials around the facility. Small piles of aggregate near several factories also suggest that some level of refurbishment of those buildings may be ongoing. Figure 13a.

City Government Offices At the City Government offices, a long vehicle shed was built in 2020, covering a previously open parking lane and preventing imagery from capturing whether or not vehicles were parked there. No other activity in the area has been observed. The framework for the partially demolished Inter-Korean Liaison Office remained in place until April 2024, when the remaining structure was reduced to rubble. The adjacent Kaesong Industrial Zone Management Office was also damaged in the blast, but the structure remains relatively intact. Figure 14a. Open vehicle parking outside of Kaesong Industrial complex city government offices. Copyright © 2018 Maxar; Figure 14b. Imagery from September 2021 shows a vehicle garage has been constructed to conceal previously open parking. Copyright © 2021 Maxar. Look Ahead Initial indicators of a gradual, but unofficial take-over have been observed as early as 2021. The indicators are more apparent in April 2023, when activity began to increase in each of the industrial sectors when buses, trucks and scores of people were readily observed. In some sectors, materials and equipment were removed from factories, either for transport elsewhere or consolidation within other factories. It is likely that at least some of the materials and/or equipment were scrapped, evidenced by piles of garbage outside a few of the factories and the ever-increasing amount of waste being deposited in the northeast dump site. The questions remaining are how many of the factories will be used, whether North Korea might maintain control over the complex as a basis for building its own industrial base, or if it might try to shop out the complex to another partner – one whose political relations are more stable than the rocky North-South relations.

North Korea’s International Network for Artificial Intelligence Research	In recent years, North Korea has undertaken substantial efforts to bolster its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. These endeavors include reforming legal and institutional frameworks and promoting specialized AI education programs within academia. However, the extent to which the nation is cultivating talent and acquiring necessary technology for AI development beyond its borders remains uncertain. Because AI is a dual-use technology with potential military applications, exploring North Korea’s international collaboration in AI development is crucial, particularly given United Nations Security Council Resolution 2321, adopted in November 2016, which prohibits scientific and technical cooperation with North Korea. As part of 38 North’s AI-focused series, this report investigates North Korea’s foreign collaborations in AI development, drawing from analysis of co-authorships of DPRK scientific journal articles on AI, and select case studies to get a better sense of the country’s position within the global AI landscape. The findings are significant, especially considering North Korea’s continued engagement in collaborative AI research with foreign universities and individuals—especially those in China, the US and South Korea—where stringent sanctions and export controls are implemented. Methodology Capturing a comprehensive view of a country’s international collaborations for AI development at the national level is challenging. AI technology is comprised of a broad set of techniques akin to a field of study that lacks a single and universally adopted definition. It also serves as a horizontal technology, applicable across various platforms to enhance functionality rather than as a standalone product. Consequently, this study employs a keyword-based analysis focusing on AI-related technical terms rather than conceptual or end-use-based words to acquire more direct insight into North Korea’s research activities. This study focuses on open-source publication data, including scientific journal articles and conference papers on AI that involve North Korean researchers, extracted from a database of peer-reviewed literature. A list of search keywords was generated using two types of information sources: North Korea’s legal national standards for AI and technical terms in the index sections of AI-related educational materials. North Korea established legally binding national standards, called KPS (국규), for AI-related terms in the early 2000s. The KPS for AI is aligned with International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standards 2382-28, 29, 31 and 34.[1] However, many terms defined in the respective ISO/IEC standards are conceptual and applicable across a broad range of academic fields, such as domain knowledge, knowledge base, and knowledge acquisition. Some terms more related to end-uses of AI, such as speech analysis and speech synthesis, were not considered in this analysis. Furthermore, the ISO/IEC standards do not encompass many AI-specific technical terms. Because of this, the study sourced technical terms from the index of an AI-dedicated educational book to ensure comprehensive coverage. The keyword list derived from this index also includes terms for statistical methods commonly employed in AI research but not exclusive to AI, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). The project included such words to capture the widest possible scope of technical efforts by North Korea, albeit with the caveat of capturing scientific studies that are not strictly focused on AI. Utilizing the keyword list of approximately 800 terms, this project gathered data on research studies published in North Korea from 2017 to 2023, a period subject to international sanctions. The data cleaning process included standardizing the names of universities and research institutes, as well as correcting misclassifications where South Korean entities were erroneously identified as North Korean. North Korea’s Global Standing in Global AI Development From a global perspective, when looking at the country’s publication volume, North Korea is not among the leading countries in AI development. From 2017 to 2023, 160 countries published over 2.5 million articles potentially involving AI, with China at the forefront, having published approximately 860,000 articles. China is followed by the United States, India, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Canada, and South Korea (Figure 1). Meanwhile, North Korea ranks 145th, with only 161 publications, comparable to the output of African countries like Togo and Swaziland. However, using publication numbers as a quantitative measure may not accurately reflect the country’s AI capabilities, as the publication output is not necessarily proportional to technical capability. Furthermore, the database omits articles from North Korean domestic journals like the Journal of Kim Il Sung University and Information Science, which do not focus exclusively on AI but frequently feature AI-related content. Lastly, the project’s keyword list is a living document and may not encompass all AI and machine learning (ML)-related terms that North Korea might be focusing on. Nevertheless, the significantly lower volume of publications from North Korea indicates that the country lags behind in academic research compared to other leading countries. In general, academia is crucial for supporting the AI industry by cultivating talent and conducting foundational studies, underpinning commercial AI development. Promoting AI-focused domestic educational programs and seeking international collaborations could be one of the major tasks that North Korea may need to focus on to keep abreast of progress made by other leading countries. North Korea’s Research Collaborators for AI Development During the specified period, North Korea co-authored with institutions from at least 12 countries across Asia, Europe, Africa and America. These countries include China, South Korea, Japan, Germany, Lithuania, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Egypt, Uganda, Canada and the United States. China was the most frequent collaborator, participating in roughly 70 publications, including studies directly involving AI. Many publications with other countries did not directly involve AI or were only nominally involved in co-authorship, such as writing a review paper summarizing an event in which North Korean scholars participated. Meanwhile, researchers affiliated with universities in South Korea and the United States each jointly published a paper on AI with North Korean scholars during the subject period, as covered in the select case studies below. A total of 45 universities and research institutes share co-authorships with North Korean entities. Several Chinese universities in geographical proximity to North Korea, including Northeast Normal University, Northeastern University, Northeast Forestry University, Harbin Institute of Technology, and Harbin Engineering University, have been particularly active in potential AI research engagements with North Korea. Other notable collaborators include the University of Detroit Mercy in the United States and George Mason University’s campus in South Korea. These foreign universities primarily cooperated with three North Korean institutes: Kim Il-Sung University, National Academy of Science and Kim Chaek University of Technology. This suggests that North Korea’s international scientific collaborations on AI and related subjects have persisted despite the 2016 ban on such activities, including individuals affiliated with universities from the United States and South Korea. Furthermore, several Chinese universities that have collaborated with North Korea are currently on the US trade deny list called the Entity List due to their linkage with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA). While there is no indication that North Korea’s international AI collaborations involve direct military applications, it remains critical to closely monitor these partnerships since technical know-how and tacit knowledge gained through these collaborations could potentially be diverted toward military AI development. North Korea’s Research Collaborations on AI Development: Select Case Studies North Korea’s research on AI between 2017 and 2023 spanned a wide array of industries, applications and academic fields. The relevant AI techniques were applied to textiles, robotics, telecommunications, aerospace and cybersecurity sectors. In addition, North Korea’s AI applications ranged from object detection to visual tracking, text-to-speech synthesis to remote sensing, and cryptocurrency. AI research topics extend into environmental, educational, medical, and geological studies, demonstrating North Korea’s broad scope of interest and investment in AI research. Case Study 1: A Joint Publication With Chinese and American Universities In 2017, North Korea published -Adaptive robust speed control based on recurrent elman neural network for sensorless PMSM servo drives.- The study aims to develop adaptive control schemes for sensorless permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSM) by employing a recurrent Elman neural network (RENN), suitable for processing sequential data.[2] PMSM is utilized in automation controls for industrial robots due to its high-power density, reliability, efficiency and controllability.[3] Furthermore, the removal of sensors from PMSMs can decrease their size and cost, enhancing their efficiency. However, this -sensorless- approach requires precise control to maintain the performance of PMSM, and North Korea applied AI techniques to tackle this technical hurdle. The study explicitly specified the intended end use of sensorless PMSM as joint motors in industrial robots. Possible dual-use applications of North Korea’s PMSM could include computer numerically controlled (CNC) machine tools, given the country’s heavy emphasis on CNC in its economic development. In addition, PMSM can also be used for a wide range of applications, such as aerospace science, the shipbuilding industry and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The study involves North Korean and Chinese universities that have most actively collaborated on potential AI research, as well as individuals affiliated with a university in the United States. North Korean author Myongguk Jong is a professor at Kim Chaek University of Technology. Another North Korean scholar, Ryongho Jon, earned his PhD from the School of Information Science and Engineering at Northeastern University in China, where Chinese scientist Zhanshan Wang is a professor. As a correspondence author, Wang might have played a crucial role in the project and brought extensive experience to the research given his extensive publications on PMSM and AI.[4] Moreover, the study involves Chaomin Luo, a scholar affiliated with the University of Detroit Mercy in the United States at the time of publication. Wang and Luo’s involvement in the project does not necessarily constitute a violation of the sanctions. For instance, in 2016, the four scholars had already published a paper on sensorless PMSM under grants identical to the study published in 2017, provided by Chinese foundations such as the National Natural Science Foundation of China and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities.[5] This indicates the publications could have been deliverables for a multi-year project that commenced and had possibly concluded before the adoption of the sanctions measures on technical cooperation in 2016. Case Study 2: A Joint Publication With South Korean Universities In June 2019, South Korea and North Korea jointly published -A Study on Features for Improving Performance of Chinese OCR by Machine Learning.- Specifically, the study involves Chul Kim, a scholar affiliated with George Mason University in Incheon, South Korea, and Jangsu Kim and U Ju Kim from Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. Three scholars applied ML techniques, including k-Nearest-Neighbor (KNN) and tree classifier, to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of an optical character recognition system (OCR) designed to convert printed Chinese characters into digital information. The paper states that the authors planned to focus on behavioral authentication as a future endeavor by developing a signature verification system applicable to both off- and online domains. It is uncertain if the collaboration has continued for the authentication system as there has been no other publication by the authors added to the database since 2019. Conclusion Amid global advancements in AI, North Korea lags behind leading countries like China and the United States. However, despite sanctions, North Korea persists in academic partnerships for potential AI research, often relying heavily on China. Given China’s prominent role in the global AI landscape, it is crucial to consider how its collaborations with North Korea may influence North Korea’s AI capabilities. Specifically, monitoring cooperation between Chinese universities with known relations with North Korea and its institutions is crucial in assessing the North’s AI research direction, as well as monitoring sanctions compliance. Universities could also establish internal compliance programs (ICP) to ensure that all students’ and faculty members’ activities meet sanctions and nonproliferation regulations. Furthermore, other countries’ academia could be exploited by North Korea, highlighting the need for enhancing due diligence in international collaborations.

Quick Take: Kim Jong Un’s Words	According to a Radio Free Asia (RFA) report, Kim Jong Un’s recent speech to flood victims in North Pyongan Province attracted attention for his use of South Korean terms, which are banned in North Korea.[1] However, approximately half of the seven expressions cited in the report have been used regularly by North Korean print media for years, which seems to suggest a discrepancy between media language and daily colloquialism, at least in North Pyongan Province.[2] The other half of the seven examples have also appeared in North Korean print media, although rarely, which helps explain North Koreans’ reported -shock.- This may suggest that acceptable language is still evolving in North Korea despite the country’s efforts to standardize the language. The terms in question included -주민 [inhabitants],- -TV,- and -음료수 [drinking water],- which have appeared regularly in the country’s print media since at least May 2005, including in Kim’s own speeches.[3] It is unusual for a Kim leader to directly address the people as -dear inhabitants [주민 여러분],- however: The more common expressions would be -comrades [동지들]- or -people [인민들].- Notably, Kim’s speech specifically referred to people -from the flood-stricken area- in this manner. The distinction between -inhabitants- and both -comrades- and -people- is that the former is in reference to people residing in specific areas. The term -험지 [unfamiliar areas]- was used in North Korean print media only occasionally before September 2020, in the wake of the floods, but has appeared more often since then.[4] Meanwhile, North Korean print media’s use of -폄훼 [slights],- -어르신 [the elderly],- and -병약자 [sick persons]- has ranged from extremely rare, rare, and on occasion, in that order. In North Korea, nothing can be more important than the Kim leader’s words. In that vein, we have to assume that Kim’s language was chosen with the greatest of care, intended to maximize appeal to the masses. Without over-parsing the meaning of every change, it would be worth tracking the evolution of North Korean propaganda language over time, if not for signs of increased acceptance of outside influence, for hints of change in North Korean society.
