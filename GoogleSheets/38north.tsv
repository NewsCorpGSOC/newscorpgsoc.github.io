Trump in Pyongyang?	Donald Trump’s recent pronouncement that he plans to reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should come as no surprise. Trump held three summits with Kim during his first term in office, the first sitting president to meet a North Korean dictator. However, while Trump is right that summitry is the only way to solve tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, the president is wrong if he thinks Kim will quickly agree to a meeting. The world is a different place today than it was in 2018. North Korea has pivoted away from seeking better relations with Washington to building closer ties with America’s two top rivals: Russia and China. Pyongyang’s thousands of troops in Kursk fighting alongside Russian soldiers are the most tangible sign of that pivot. Kim told his country’s elite that the United States was an implacable foe that must be weakened and confronted. North Korea has also accelerated the deployment of nuclear-armed missiles that can destroy both regional targets and American cities. This buildup has triggered a regional arms race, with both South Korea and Japan also building up their missile arsenals. South Korea’s debate over its own nuclearization rages on, with Tokyo likely to follow suit. Tensions are high. In this kind of environment, one misstep could trigger a nuclear war. Trump’s confidence also ignores the fact that he humiliated Kim during their last two meetings. The February 2019 Hanoi session collapsed when an impatient president couldn’t sit still and walked out.[1] An angry Kim returned to his hotel room and slammed the door.[2] Even Trump seemed to have doubts. He called the South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in, as Air Force One lifted off from Hanoi and asked him six times to reach out to Kim. A snap summit at the Demilitarized Zone three months later was a public relations triumph, Kim responded overnight to a last-minute tweet invitation from Trump, but a policy disaster. The two leaders agreed to restart negotiations. Trump, however, didn’t keep his promise to Kim to postpone an upcoming US-South Korean military exercise, prompting the dictator to accuse the president of making Kim look like an idiot in a secret letter.[3] Creating a new round of engagement and summit-driven diplomacy is not impossible, but it will not likely be as easy to engineer as Trump seems to believe. Pyongyang’s disillusionment with Trump’s last shot at diplomacy, its reluctance after three decades of failed negotiations with Washington, as well as its newfound closeness with Russia will be hard to overcome. It will require time, patience, and a series of enticing initiatives to have any chance of success. President Trump’s first move shouldn’t be a summit with Kim—it should be with Moscow and Beijing. Russia’s support for an American initiative will be crucial given its close ties with North Korea. If Trump can play a positive role in brokering a deal settling the war in Ukraine, the door may open to easing tensions in US-Russian relations and increasing consultation on how to resolve the situation in Northeast Asia. As for China, while its relationship with North Korea is at a low ebb, Beijing’s support for an American initiative will still be important in view of its enduring political and economic ties with Pyongyang. Still, Washington shouldn’t waste any time signaling to Kim that it is willing to resume dialogue. The president checked that box in his Fox News interview. He should follow up with a resumption of his correspondence with Kim that ended when Trump left office. While the media ridiculed the letters, they contained valuable clues from both leaders about how to move negotiations forward. One immediate objective should be to renew face-to-face talks between the two countries, either between senior officials like the Secretary of State or at the working level. The main reason would be to arrange an early summit between Trump and Kim where they would lay out a gameplan for moving forward with substantive talks. President Trump should also adopt more realistic goals. Given Pyongyang’s growing nuclear arsenal, Washington should ditch its longstanding near-term objective of denuclearizing North Korea for another near-term goal, reducing the danger of nuclear war. A weapons of mass destruction (WMD) test ban would halt significant improvements and deployment of new weapons. A suspension of visits to the Peninsula by American aircraft and submarines capable of carrying nuclear weapons would calm tensions. The president will have in his tool-kit other steps to propel talks forward. Lifting sanctions, establishing diplomatic relations, and suspending US-ROK military exercises are some of those measures. Since it’s been almost six years since any talks, which ones Kim will be interested in can only be figured out through in-person meetings. Maximum pressure may be still necessary. Hiking up sanctions will be ineffective given Chinese and Russian opposition. Instead, President Trump could threaten to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, a risky move that could feed the regional arms race. But it could also serve diplomacy, if the United States offered to stop the deployment in return for progress in talks. If North Korea reverses course, seeks better relations with Washington and reaches agreements to ease tensions, Donald Trump himself may be the biggest attraction of all. A trip by the American president to Pyongyang would be proof positive that the two countries were on track to averting a dangerous clash and ending the 70-year-old Cold War in Northeast Asia. For President Trump, a Pyongyang summit would be a public relations bonanza, guaranteed to attract the largest worldwide audience ever. He would be a shoo-in for the Nobel Prize that he has obsessed over since he took office in 2017. Finally, inside-the-Beltway critics on Capitol Hill and the media may harp about appeasement. On the other hand, the average American citizen will be all for anything that smacks of reducing the danger of war and the peacemaker president who can make it happen.[4] The post Trump in Pyongyang? appeared first on 38 North.	https://www.38north.org/2025/01/trump-in-pyongyang/	2025-01-31T11:23:33-08:00	
Signs Point to Continued Expansion of Nampho Port	North Korea’s Nampho Port continues to be the focus of construction and expansion activity, emphasizing its growing importance within North Korea’s economic and military infrastructure. Commercial satellite imagery shows continued work to expand the dual-use shipbuilding area, the completion of new petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) storage and berthing facilities, and movement at the commercial container port. Background Nampho is North Korea’s largest commercial port and is known for its large coal, petroleum, oil and commercial goods import and export facilities. Its position on the west coast of the country offers a more direct route to China and most of the rest of Asia. Alongside commercial operations, the port also includes construction and repair halls that cater to both commercial vessels and fishing boats, as well as some naval vessels and barges. In late December 2024, North Korean state media reported the construction of a new destroyer- or frigate-like warship at Nampho. This announcement—and continued activity—may indicate the site’s utility in expanding and modernizing the country’s navy. Ship Repair and Construction Area At the new shipbuilding hall, installation of its roof was completed in November and construction has advanced on a number of adjacent buildings. They appear to be part of the same project. Work on these auxiliary structures began at the same time as the new construction hall, although the purpose of each building is unclear. Work to seal off the former secure boat basin off from the river has progressed significantly since it began to be backfilled with soil in late August 2024 and appears nearly complete. Its original wall remains but has been extended to the west, now connecting the area to the mainland on both ends. The additional land creates space for further construction activity in the shipyard. Part of this preparatory work is the excavation of 12 large, circular holes alongside a road. The holes are among at least 60 that have appeared across the entire port area. Those adjacent to the new construction hall are, in appearance, reminiscent of those seen in February 2024 that proved to be the footers for the support columns of the new shipbuilding hall. Other holes observed on imagery from January 23 vary in size and placement, suggesting they may not be intended for building construction. For example, some smaller holes line one of the interior access roads, possibly for planting trees. Whether the range of holes will be for construction or other efforts remains to be seen. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) Storage Area Four new POL storage tanks that were under construction in a September report have been completed. Preparatory work for the tanks had been visible for several years. At the end of two nearby wharfs, piers have been built. Previous reporting identified concrete blocks that had been placed into the water to serve as the base for the piers. On imagery from January 23, the surfacing of the pier blocks appeared in progress, signifying the construction work was nearing completion. In addition to the POL tanks, another has been added to the storage area since early November 2024, as well as two bases for two new tanks. Container Port The commercial container port appears busy with the movement of many containers evident in January compared with imagery from September and November 2024. While infrequent imagery does not allow for precise tracking of the flow of containers, imagery shows containers in different locations and configurations, indicating some level of movement has taken place. Bulk carriers are located nearby on imagery; however, it cannot be determined if goods are being loaded, unloaded, or both. This level of activity is high compared to what has been observed over the last few years when, despite some movement, many containers appeared to remain in the same spot for months at a time. There are also several tractor trailers queued outside the container port, appearing to be waiting to pick up goods from the port.

The January 2025 Session of the North Korean Parliament: An Unusual Oath and the Absence of a -Russi...	Introduction Whatever the size and economic impact of North Korea’s support of Russia’s war in Ukraine really is, it has so far had no visible impact on economic data and policies as announced during the recent session of the Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA). Abstractly speaking, we are relatively certain that there is a cause, but we cannot see the effect. Ironically, the opposite is true for a loyalty oath taken by North Korea’s Premier. It is unprecedented and hence must have very serious reasons. While these are most likely of a domestic nature, their potentially crucial details remain in the dark. Kim Jong Un’s harsh and widely publicized criticism of misbehavior of officials in the southeastern Onchon County a few days after the SPA session could be related. It is possible that the upcoming 9th Congress of the Korean Worker’s Party (WPK) will shed further light on what caused the unusual loyalty oath. Main Issues The North Korean legislature, the Supreme People’s Assembly, met in Pyongyang for its annual meeting on January 22-23, 2025. Unlike the year before, leader Kim Jong Un was not present. However, his absence is not unusual. He was neither present at the SPA sessions of 2023 nor of 2022. The SPA followed the standard routine for such sessions. The Premier of the Cabinet reviewed the work of the cabinet for the past year and outlined major tasks for the current year. The Minister of Finance spoke about the fulfilled 2024 and the planned 2025 state budget. In addition, the SPA deliberated on several legal and organizational issues. Two points stand out as being most noteworthy: Both issues will be discussed in more detail below. Apart from these, the main points in the 2025 reports can be summarized as follows: The Premier’s Oath In a highly unusual move, Premier Pak Thae Song swore an oath on behalf of all Cabinet members. There was even a separate Rodong Sinmun article devoted to this. Three issues are worth discussing: The final point aligns most closely with the economic policy narrative in North Korea that has been familiar over the past few years. What is particularly noteworthy here is that the Premier, despite several years of explicitly emphasizing the leading role of the state in the economy, still considers it important to highlight this point again and in such strong terms. One might speculate that it is apparently not easy to undo the measures of economic decentralization and liberalization introduced during the phase of cautious quasi-reforms under Kim Jong Il. From an objective perspective, this would be hardly surprising; people around the world tend to value freedoms they have once acquired and often strive to make their reversal difficult or impossible within their means. However, there is no concrete evidence that the new middle class and other beneficiaries of the reform policies are resisting to an extent that it would justify such a rare public loyalty oath from the Premier. Rather, it is conceivable that loyalty to the constitution is the core of the oath. This is particularly relevant in light of the situation in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol has been accused of violating the constitution with his declaration of martial law on December 3, 2024. Although South Korea is not directly mentioned in any of the official reports on the SPA session, it is plausible that North Korea’s leadership is explicitly declaring its constitutional loyalty in contrast to its archenemy. Apart from the North Korean population itself, which we should always assume to be the primary target audience for the state’s announcements, another intended recipient of this message would be the South Korean public, pointing at a greater-than admitted interest of Pyongyang in its southern neighbor. Whether this also contains a warning to the North Korean elite to refrain from unconstitutional acts is difficult to say. The constitution is regularly amended to reflect the leader’s wishes, so that its weight and relevance in the North Korean rule-by-law autocracy is entirely different from that in South Korea’s democracy with its principle of rule-of-law. If viewed together with the report about serious misdeeds by officials in Onchon County a few days later, the oath might have been intended to instill greater discipline in state officials and to avoid an extension of the leader’s wrath to other parts of the state apparatus. No Visible -Russia Effect- The annual state budget is one of the few instances when North Korea regularly publishes some rudimentary economic data. These can be used as a proxy for economic growth. In an economic system where almost all enterprises are owned and managed by the state, it is appropriate to assume a close correlation between the state’s income and spending, and the overall gross domestic product (GDP). North Korea’s media provide only incomplete insights into the budget reports, which are assumed to be available in more detail to all or some SPA deputies. Typically, only growth rates and no absolute numbers are reported. Moreover, detail is not always provided consistently, making a comparison over the years complicated. However, reporting is very constant on aggregate figures such as actual and expected revenue and expenditure of the state. Graph 1 shows this data since 2000. We notice a rebound of the economy in 2024, with revenue growing by over 4%. The most striking observation is that this rebound is relatively weak, remaining below the growth rates before the pandemic, and that the state’s expectations for 2025 are moderate. The expected growth rate of state revenue in 2025 by only 2% is not very optimistic, especially if we consider news in Western media about huge income generated by selling arms and by sending troops to Russia. A look at trade data (available up to 2023) points in the same direction: a moderate rebound but no dramatic effect. The nominal import value is very low (under 3 billion US$), so that any significant inflow of funds from Russia should be strongly reflected. South Korea, by contrast, is experiencing a huge positive economic effect due to its arms exports. These are expected to reach 23 billion USD in 2025, fueling hopes to become the fourth largest global arms exporter in 2027. Both the graphs for the state budget and for trade continue showing a deficit. The state expects its expenditure to grow more strongly than its revenue, and observed imports are much higher than exports. It is tempting to see this as proof of the existence of Russian transfers; however, these deficits have existed for many years before, so that such a causality is not easy to establish. The assumption of the absence of any significant inflow of war-related income from Russia into North Korea’s economy is further supported by the development of the North Korean won (KPW)-United States dollar exchange rate. The sale of arms and men to a foreign country generates income in foreign currency. Assuming stable demand, this should drive the price of foreign currency down and the value of domestic currency up.[2] However, the opposite is happening. While on May 17, 2024, North Koreans had to pay 8,800 North Korean won for one USD, the exchange rate doubled until October 11 and reached an all-time high of 28,000 on November 29. As of January 21, 2025, it stood at 21,000. What should be noted is that the abnormal depreciation of the KPW started very abruptly around May 2024. This does indeed correspond with an intensified bilateral relationship between North Korea and Russia, as evidenced by the visit of Russian president Putin in Pyongyang in June and the conclusion of a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty, ratified in December 2024. However, since other reasons cannot be excluded, this might turn out to be a mere correlation. Discussion All of the above is based on very questionable data, both in terms of the sources’ sincerity and their methodology. Budget figures are reported by the Party newspaper; trade statistics are based on reverse statistics with data from countries that might have an interest in not disclosing all their interactions with North Korea; and market prices are based on a few random reports from North Korean individuals. However, this only calls the reliability of nominal data into question. The relative development of data over time seems to be more credible, assuming the same errors or biases being in place continuously. The observed phenomena can have different causes. It could be argued, for example, that transfers from Russia to North Korea happen not in cash but in kind, e.g. in the form of goods or technologies, and hence do not impact money supply. Moreover, trade data with Russia are so far only available for 2023. It is further possible that the Russian transfers in whatever form are channeled directly to the North Korean military and thereby do not show up in the state’s official statistics. However, the so-called -Second Economy-, i.e. the part of the economy that is run by the military, is not limited to the production of arms and ammunition and is very much integrated into the overall North Korean economy. Therefore, we would have to expect at least some substitution effects: resources that the military gets from Russia should now be available for the civilian economy. Also, the available foreign money in the hands of military individuals or enterprises should eventually reach the civilian markets. All this makes the interpretation of the SPA reports challenging. Nevertheless, and the actual causes notwithstanding, the very absence of any visible effect on the state’s revenue and expenditure in 2024 and the lack of an optimistic outlook for 2025 remain striking. The same is true for the Premier’s oath. Regardless of how we understand its cause, it is highly unprecedented. For otherwise very stable systems like that of North Korea, such deviations are important indicators of unusual and irregular developments, even though their full nature and extent might be revealed only much later.

Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area: A Slow Shedding of South Korean Influence	Overview The Mt. Kumgang Tourist Region was a popular South Korean tourist destination until a security incident led to its closure in 2008. Despite optimism after the 2018 Panmunjom Summit that long-stalled inter-Korean economic projects would resume, no progress was made before the summit process fell apart. In late 2019, Kim Jong Un visited Mt. Kumgang, denouncing South Korean claims on the resort and instructing it be rebuilt according to North Korean standards and tastes. Progress on renovating the site has been slow, and initial plans were likely impacted by the pandemic. Activity picked up in 2022 to finish razing the majority of South Korean-built facilities, but it is unclear when serious construction may begin, especially with renewed emphasis on finishing the Wonsan-Kalma Beach Resort. Given North Korea’s separation of ties with South Korea, it is also unclear who the target audience for the renovated resort will be. Introduction The Mt. Kumgang Tourist Region—a special administrative region carved out of North Korea’s Kangwon Province in 2002—was initially opened to foreign tourists, including those from South Korea, in 1998. It began under the umbrella of the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone, which includes sites such as Wonsan, Masikryong Ski Resort, and Mt. Kumgang, among others. The project quickly became a beacon of hope in inter-Korean economic cooperation, with South Korea’s Hyundai Asan—the conglomerate also part of the Kaesong Industrial Complex joint venture—receiving a decades-long contract to build-out the area’s infrastructure. However, not unlike other inter-Korean cooperative projects, the stability and longevity of the area ebbed and flowed with the political tides of North-South relations. In 2008, a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean guard, resulting in Seoul banning its citizens from visiting Mt. Kumgang until Pyongyang agreed to a joint investigation of the incident and safety guarantees for future tourists. North Korea never agreed to these terms—and the site has remained closed to South Korean tourists. It is unlikely tours of any form have taken place since. Beginning of the End Despite optimism that inter-Korean economic projects, including the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area, would resume after the signing of the Panmunjom Declaration in 2018, no progress was made before both the inter-Korean and US-DPRK summit processes fell apart. As a result, Kim Jong Un visited the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area in October 2019, asserting that the buildings around the site were a -hotchpotch- devoid of national character, and -built like makeshift tents in a disaster-stricken area.- He went on to dispel any notions that Mt. Kumgang was a common property of both North and South Korea, and that an improvement in inter-Korean ties would lead to a resumption of tourism in the area. He ordered the removal and/or remodel of existing facilities that were relics of the inter-Korean initiative that Mt. Kumgang once was. In December 2020, Premier Kim Tok Hun, a member of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, visited Mt. Kumgang, calling for work to turn the site into a -modern and all-inclusive international tourist and cultural area- to push forward with a phased approach. Significant activity was not observed until 2022, when several prominent sites were demolished. The cycle repeated again in 2023. In July 2023, South Korean media reported the chairwoman of Hyundai Asan sent—and consequently withdrew after the North’s refusal to acknowledge it—an application to visit Mt. Kumgang. In response, the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement indicating Pyongyang had no intention to allow the visit to take place and reaffirmed that the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area is solely a part of North Korea’s territory. The 30th Plenary Meeting of the 14th SPA Standing Committee of DPRK—held in February 2024—adopted a decree abolishing any formal agreement on North-South economic cooperation, formally cementing the end of the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area as a cooperative project. North Korea has since severed additional ties to its southern neighbor—both in law and in practice—meaning the future of Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone is unlikely to bear resemblance to the inter-Korean project of the past. North Korea’s demolition of border links on both the west coast highway (Asian Highway-1, or AH-1) connecting South Korea with the Kaesong Industrial Complex and the east coast highway (Asian Highway-6, or AH-6) connecting to the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone in October 2024 now physically prohibits access to Mt. Kumgang from the South by road. Rail lines connecting the two countries have also been severed, While North Korea’s vision for Mt. Kumgang as solely its own initiative has not been announced in state media, imagery around the complex reveals that much of the structures from the inter-Korean cooperative era has been demolished, and little has been done to revitalize and rebuild the area. Floating Hotel and Pier Without a doubt, the most recognizable location in the tourist zone was the floating Hotel Haegumgang. Originally built in Singapore, the 200 room-hotel was first a Four Seasons hotel near the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. It was later sold and moved to Vietnam before its purchase by Hyundai Asan in 1998 and consequent move to Kosong port. Throughout its time in Kosong, the hotel was moored with large cables to a dock. A sea wall and two adjacent piers kept the structure relatively protected from the open water. Close to the dock on land was an additional residential area. In 2005, the area had 34 chalets and sometime between then and 2010, a neighboring plot was developed that could house up to 20 caravans. Several support buildings were also added and ground work at the site hinted that more had been planned. By 2010, satellite imagery showed the resort and the floating hotel, chalets and caravans sat unchanged until 2022. In October 2019, the hotel served as a backdrop in state media images of Kim Jong Un during his visit, upon which he instructed South Korean-owned structures to be removed—including the Haegumgang Hotel. However, it was not until the spring of 2022 that work to dismantle the hotel and neighboring caravan park and chalets commenced. By the end of that year, they were gone. Currently, the site remains clear of any new construction, but activity at the piers picked up during 2024. Several vessels visited during the year for short periods of time, including a cargo ship and at least one North Korean Navy vessel, likely from Kosong Naval Base located across the bay. Ananti Golf Resort and Spa (Diamond Mountain Golf Resort and Spa) For a few weeks, one of the major attractions in the tourist zone was the Ananti Golf and Spa Resort, located near Diamond Mountain. The facility sat on hills overlooking Kosong port and was only about a kilometer from the water’s edge, but its opening was spectacularly poorly timed. It opened its doors in May 2008, less than two months before the site was shut down. Like other structures at the site, it sat vacant for much of the followin years, although between April 9 and 10, 2022, about a month after workers began tearing down the floating Hotel Haegumgang, satellite imagery showed the lodging buildings were destroyed. State media reported their destruction as a result of a forest fire, though the validity of these claims is unclear based on commercial satellite imagery. However, imagery does show that the resort apartments or condos were razed between April 8 and April 10, 2022. The main club and spa building remained in tact at the time, but satellite imagery from October 23, 2024 captured work to dismantle the structure underway. Bay Area In addition to the main facilities at the site, numerous smaller buildings have been removed or are being removed across the tourism zone to leave no reminders of the original project. In late August 2022, the Kosong Bay Sushi Restaurant was demolished. The building sat alongside the bay and had once served as the inter-Korean transit office, but later became a restaurant. The sushi restaurant was near a large, paved area that housed logistical offices and units and a South Korean-run gas station. The logistics area was largely cleared of structures in 2016. Additional demolition work was carried out in the summer of 2023. The canopy of the gas station still stands, making it one of the last remaining structures in the area. However, it was shown in a state of decay in on-the-ground photos taken in 2017 so the integrity of it today is likely poor. For several years, more than 40 buses that had been used to ferry tourists around the region were parked on the paved area, but they were eventually repurposed for domestic purposes and observed sporadically throughout other areas of the site. Other Hotel &amp; Resort Area Sometime between September 2 and 7, 2022, the Kumgang Cultural Center was destroyed. The distinct domed building previously served as the meeting point during the 2018 North-South family reunion. The family reunions—held only once since 2015—occurred mere months after the inter-Korean Panmunjom Declaration was signed, representing a time of peace and hope in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul. The House of Culture was among the sites included in Kim’s 2019 declaration that Mt. Kumgang’s facilities lacked national identity and needed an overhaul. This structure differed from the Kumgang Family Reunion Center, a 12-story hotel initially constructed in 2008 that hosted participants in family reunions in 2009, 2010, and 2014. Through May 2022, the complex surrounding the Family Reunion Center was left largely untouched. However, by October the same year, furnishings and materials from inside the hotel were removed and piled up in the parking lot. Debris remained in the area until early 2024. Possible cargo containers lining portions of the complex perimeter appeared around the time demolition began, and are still observed on imagery from October 2024. The hotel&#8217;s exterior appears to be unchanged. In mid-2022, a tourist building opposite the Kumgang Cultural Center site was razed, and the logistics area was cleared. The logistics area had housed over 100 cargo containers but they were removed when the building was razed. A year later, a South Korean-built fire station in front of the Kumgang Family Reunion Center was demolished. Access and Future of the Sites When Kim Jong Un visited the site in 2019, he spoke of the need to modernize the facility, removing South Korean buildings and replacing them with a number of new projects including a passenger port, an airport and a new train service to connect the airport with the resort. As the removal of South Korean buildings approaches its end, none of the new projects appear to have been started. Given Kim’s instructions and the devolving state of North-South relations, this tourist zone, when rebuilt, will not depend on South Korean tourists or investments. North Korea’s push to eliminate any special relations with the South and the recent removal of road and rail links between the two Koreas means the only feasible way into the Mt. Kumgang region at present by way of South Korea is via road or rail from the north. It is possible that should South Korean tourists be allowed to visit again in the future, they could fly into Wonsan Kalma Airport, about 60 kilometers to the north, or come from other areas within the country by car or train. Based on Kim’s 2019 guidance, it appears that a direct air route is preferred. With party resources focused on opening the Wonsan-Kalma Tourist Zone next year, some six years late, it seems unrealistic that serious work on revitalizing the Mt. Kumgang area will start anytime soon. It is also unclear who the target audience for such a resort might be.

Kim Jong Un Welcomes Donald J. Trump to Second Term	A year ago on these pages we warned that Kim Jong Un had made a -strategic decision to go to war.- Many interpreted this to mean that we were predicting an imminent attack and since over the past year no war has broken out, they argue that the warning we sounded was mistaken. We disagree. A strategic decision to go to war is not the same as a war plan, nor does it necessarily imply imminence of hostilities. Rather, we viewed it as a decision for patient, calculated preparations in three main areas: building up military strength; lulling, distracting, and befuddling the enemy; and bolstering the patriotic fervor of the civilian population for eventual sacrifice. To list only a few developments which could be seen in one of the above: Each of these by itself might not be so alarming but seen together they suggest a strategy—a coherent plan rather than mere episodic efforts to -gain attention.- If Kim offered sending North Korean troops to Ukraine rather than responding to a request from Russia’s President Putin, that fits with a long-term effort to prepare his army for hostilities. In declaring the DPRK a separate state apart from South Korea (ROK), Kim explicitly laid the groundwork for justifying the use of force against the ROK. All of this could be seen as a worst-case scenario, but at this point, it is certainly no less likely than the alternatives. Ultimately it will be up to governments to decide and prepare—or not. The greatest danger is still, as we asserted a year ago, that Washington and Seoul cling to the belief their alliance backed by -ironclad- deterrence will stop Kim from military action, and that he would never attack for fear of being destroyed. Potentially, a development that could be interpreted as Kim stepping back from his frequent calls for war preparations is his stated goal for massively redeveloping provincial and local economies. On the surface, this would seem to be incompatible with war preparations, certainly in the short-term. In our view, if this new push on local economic development goes hand-in-hand with a clear diminution of emphasis on the military—which we have yet to see—and a revival of the internal debate over military spending (evidence for which will be hard to read in any case) these might signal new decisions in Pyongyang. The Trump Factor There is considerable speculation about how President Trump will deal with Kim a second time around—and how Kim may respond. On the campaign trail, Trump said, -Kim Jong-un [is] very smart, very tough, but he liked me, and I got along really well with him, and we were safe.&#8221; Trump and his team must realize, however, that if Kim keeps the door to engagement with the US a crack open, it leads to a very different room from where things were in February 2019. Kim’s goals have changed, his sense of North Korea’s place in the world has changed, and his view of the long-term weakness of the US has changed. We agree that re-engagement could be a serious effort on Kim’s behalf, but it could also be a deception to buy more time for war preparations. Kim may preempt Trump by resuming his letter writing to make sure Trump understands that it’s a new room he is about to enter. We pen such a hypothetical Kim-to-Trump letter based on our understanding of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Dear Mr. President: I write to you after a long silence. Much has happened over the years since we last met, and it will be good to explore what that means before we consider whether it is useful to begin anew serious contact. I know you will agree that if we are to engage with any hope of fruitful results, this will have to start from an entirely new place. The past is past. Let us not be burdened by it but look ahead. To be frank, the chasm between our countries has widened and deepened. I fear there is nothing to be done to bridge the gap anymore. If you think otherwise, I will of course listen to your views. Let me lay out what I see. For a long time, we in the DPRK knew the world to be a dangerous place, with untrustworthy neighbors prepared to squeeze us to death. In such a situation, the logical course was to pursue relations with the United States which, at the time of the collapse of the USSR and the Eastern bloc, was the preeminent force on the world stage. We are a practical people; we see reality for what it is. What we see today and what we saw then are worlds apart. The United States is no longer preeminent. And after so many years of effort, in which we sacrificed much and compromised often, we have become convinced those years were wasted. The United States thought we were gullible, that we would sacrifice our honor for a handful of candy, and that once weakened it could smash us apart, wipe us off the face of the earth as it has done time after time to other countries. But we did not yield. And we will not. Though it would cost us dearly, we are prepared for an inevitable, final struggle. I hope it will not come to that, but we will not turn away if it does. You will note that I have declared the DPRK a separate, sovereign state totally apart from the ROK. This was a painful decision but not as strange as it might first seem. Although we are one people, for centuries we were divided into separate kingdoms. Eventually, the strongest of them conquered the others. I’m sure recent events in South Korea have been very troubling to you. To speak honestly about our previous exchange of correspondence, it accomplished little. Though they contained serious ideas, my letters were mocked and belittled in your media. One message I sought to reinforce to you over and over was that I cannot simply give, give, give. I must have something concrete to show my people. You must as well. On that basis, we should have been able to make progress. It did not come to pass. There were consequences from failure. We have formed a strategic alliance with Russia, and we are much stronger today in every respect than we were then. And we will become stronger still, of that you can be assured. To be clear, we are both the leaders of nuclear-weapons states. We are not friends, though we can respect each other and, perhaps, work together to solve pressing regional and global problems. I give you fair warning—we cannot be brow beaten; we are not dogs who can be trained to heel. As you treat us, so we will treat you. Such a letter would allow Kim to let Trump know that he is still interested in talking, but the ball is now in Trump’s court, and the court itself has changed. The post Kim Jong Un Welcomes Donald J.

Half A Loaf: Third Hwasong-16 Solid IRBM Test Shows Booster is Ready but HGV Payload Needs Work	On January 6, North Korea test-launched a Hwasong-16B (HS-16B) solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) payload. This was the third apparently successful flight of the HS-16 booster (two with HGVs, the other with a maneuvering reentry vehicle (MaRV) payload), probably meaning that the North considers the booster ready for operational deployment. The success of the HGV payload, however, cannot be confirmed, marking three apparently lackluster MaRV flights (one on a liquid booster); several successful flights over at least a few years probably will be needed before the HGV is ready for deployment. The HS-16 would be deployable in the near-term with the previously-flown MaRV or a yet-to-be-seen traditional reentry vehicle. The North reported using -new composite carbon fiber material- in the HS-16 booster and updated guidance technology, but the nature of these improvements and their effect on system performance are unknown. The latest test underscores North Korea’s continuing commitment both to IRBMs to strike Guam and other farther-flung theater targets, and to HGVs as an eventual means of further challenging US missile defenses in Guam and the western Aleutians. But the high cost of HGVs and the limited set of targets for which they offer comparative advantages (mostly key ground-based missile defense sensors) mean that relatively few will be deployed. Information to Date Japan’s Ministry of Defense reported on January 6 the launch that day of a ballistic missile from North Korea to the northeast, falling into the sea at a distance of about 1,100 km with a maximum altitude of about 100 km after about a ten minute flight. The South Korean military confirmed the range of what it termed a -midrange missile- but did not report the altitude, claiming that launch preparations had been detected in advance. (It is not clear whether this detection was in addition to the military’s December 23 warning that the DPRK could launch an IRBM with a hypersonic warhead around its end-of-year plenum.) On January 7, North Korean press reported the previous day’s -test-fire of [a] new-type intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile- that demonstrated a -first peak height of 99.8 kilometers and the second peak height of 42.5 kilometers at the speed amounting to twelve times of the speed of sound, and accurately landed on the simulated target waters in the open sea 1,500 kilometers away.- This missile reportedly used rocket motors incorporating -a new composite carbon fiber material- and its guidance system included -a new comprehensive and effective method based on the already-accumulated technologies.- The test was said to have confirmed -the effectiveness of the missile system that fully meets the expected military specifications- and -the successful development of the new-type strategic weapon system.- Accompanying photos and video showed the -cold launch- from a canister mounted on a seven-axle road-mobile launcher of a solid-propellant missile tipped with a wedge-shaped HGV payload. The images generally matched those of the HS-16B solid-propellant IRBM that was last launched on April 2, 2024 and also carried an HGV. On January 7, the South Korean military characterized North Korea’s announced performance as an exaggeration, reporting that South Korea, Japan, and the US agreed the missile flew about 1,100 km with no second apogee (peak height) reached during the flight. The ROK military assessed the North’s claims as -highly likely deception.- Analysis and Implications The IRBM booster. This is the third apparently successful flight of the solid-propellant booster portion of the HS-16 system, including the April 2024 test and the January 2024 test that carried a MaRV rather than an HGV. (Moreover, the HS-16 booster is based on that of the HS-18 solid intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM], which was tested successfully three times in 2024.) By traditional North Korean standards, that would be sufficient for the booster to be considered ready for operational deployment. This may be what the North was referring to in announcing -successful development- of the system. The HGV payload. This is the third known test of the HGV, including on the April 2024 HS-16B test and a September 2021 flight on a version of the Hwasong-12 liquid-propellant IRBM booster that the North dubbed Hwasong-8 and later HS-12B. There is no clear open-source evidence that any of the three HGVs flew successfully after release from the booster. Indeed, reminiscent of the latest flight, the ROK in April 2024 claimed the US agreed with its assessment of a shorter range and fewer maneuvers than claimed by North Korea. If the US did in fact agree with the ROK assessments, then we can be highly confident the last two HGV flights failed given Washington’s substantial missile detection and tracking capabilities. It should not be surprising that North Korea is struggling with the HGV. This is a very demanding technology given the need to cope with the temperatures and pressures of sustained hypersonic flight, which are compounded by the maneuvering needed to evade missile defenses (the comparative advantage of HGVs over other payloads), as well as the challenges of accurate guidance in such an environment. China and Russia needed numerous flight-tests over several years to successfully develop deployable HGVs, and the US is still working on it. Pyongyang likely has at least several successful flight-tests yet to go, even if it were to obtain assistance from Russia or China. Although the HGV is clearly not ready for prime time, North Korea might choose for political and propaganda reasons, or in an effort to complicate allied planning, to claim the payload is deployed even if remains under development. (For example, North Korea released a photo in October 2024 in conjunction with Kim Jong Un’s visit to -strategic missile bases- showing Kim in an underground missile facility standing next to HGV-equipped HS-12B liquid IRBMs.[1]) In any case, the North could still deploy the HS-16 with the MaRV tested in January 2024, which was also flown twice on the -Hwasong-8- in January 2022, or with a traditional reentry vehicle that has yet to be seen on the HS-16. Composite carbon fiber. There is no open-source information on the nature of the -new composite carbon fiber material- reportedly used -in the manufacture of the engine body of the missile,- much less on whatever material had been used previously. The North’s -engine- phraseology would seem to apply not to the body of the HGV payload, but rather to the solid booster motors. Use of a new motor case or nozzle material might explain why Pyongyang announced in March 2024 the conduct of -a ground jet test [static test] of a solid-fueled engine for a new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,- the reported success of which allowed -a timetable for completing the development of the new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile weapon system- to be set.[2] Composite materials incorporating carbon fiber &#8212; and there is no information on what proportion of the North’s new material is carbon fiber, or the quality of that fiber &#8212; generally are desirable because they can be stronger than other composites, provide equal strength with less weight, or some combination. Lower-weight motor cases or nozzles would permit using the energy of the solid booster to propel the payload farther, to loft a heavier payload, or some combination of the two. Although it is possible that the purpose of using a new material would be to strengthen the motor cases to permit putting the booster into more stressful flight trajectories, it is at least as likely that the original HS-16 booster was sufficiently sturdy to handle HGV flights (as North Korea did with that booster in April 2024) but Pyongyang now is looking to provide that sturdiness at lower weight and thus with more boost performance. Improved guidance. Obtaining satisfactory accuracy while engaging in hypersonic maneuvers is one of the main challenges in HGV development, so it certainly makes sense that North Korea would want to improve its HGV accuracy. That said, there is no open-source information on what the guidance system or accuracy of the North’s previously-tested HGVs was, what technological improvements were made in the latest payload, or what effect those improvements had on accuracy. Indeed, given the apparently checkered flight-test history of its HGVs, Pyongyang itself may currently lack information on the degree of any improvement. The Bottom Line Although the latest HS-16B test underscores that the booster portion of the system probably is regarded by North Korea as ready for deployment, the HGV payload has several successful flight-tests and thus probably at least a few years to go. The nature and impact of the -new composite carbon fiber material- and updated guidance technology used in the latest test are unclear. The test does show Pyongyang’s continued commitment to IRBMs, which pose a deterrent threat to US territory in Guam and the southwest Aleutians and can disrupt bases in Guam, the Philippines, and farther-flung reaches of Japan that could support US operations against North Korea. The test also shows continued commitment to the HGV development program, which if successful, will offer another means of combatting US missile defenses in Guam and the Aleutians. Moreover, the HGV is invoked by North Korea as a sign of technical sophistication (-a technical force which is by no means easy to achieve…a remarkable achievement- that only -a few countries in the world might possess,- as the media claimed on January 7) and of deterrent credibility and resolve (-through the current test…we… clearly showed the enemies what we are doing and that we are fully ready to use any means to defend our legitimate interests-). Even if successful, the high cost of HGVs and the limited set of targets for which they offer comparative advantages (mostly key ground-based missile defense sensors) mean that relatively few will be deployed to fulfill niche roles revolving around missile defense suppression. The HS-16 likely will end up being deployed in larger numbers with MaRVs and perhaps even traditional reentry vehicles, especially if North Korea eventually develops sufficient accuracy to make conventionally armed IRBMs militarily feasible.

K-Coup and its Limits: Popular Sovereignty, Civic Virtue, and Political Science Blind Spots	When abrupt, consequential political events happen, we tend to have recourse to the general to explain the particular. That is, we use models and heuristics as tools for understanding a novel, often unexpected phenomenon. In politics especially, we employ theories for this purpose. This is both necessary—theory is unavoidable, as it allows us to construct a framework for what is perceived as relevant information/data deserving attention—and valuable for comprehending mechanisms of events. If X is often correlated with Y in context Z, and there occurs a series of new events similar to X in a situation resembling Z, then exploring the potential role of something like Y in those new events is warranted. Beyond hot takes and description of the facts, much analysis of the December 3 martial law declaration (and its aftermath) by South Korean president Yoon Seok Yul has been a textbook application of general theoretical principles to help understand the particular situation and events in South Korea. For instance, scholars have applied theories of self-coups, the psychology of leaders in isolated information bubbles, and democratic resilience as frameworks for understanding what happened on December 3 and during the ensuing political chaos. Perhaps the best of this approach has been from Aurel Croissant, who astutely analyzes South Korea’s -reactive- versus -preventive- democratic resilience. Inter alia, he concludes that South Korea demonstrates high levels of citizen activism to -re-equilibrate- democracy after it breaks down, while the country’s mechanisms for preventing democratic backsliding are weak and dysfunctional. Certainly this is valuable work, but as important as it is to understand a particular event through the application of general theoretical principles, it is also important to go in the opposite analytical direction. That is, the facts of a particular case should be analyzed to help us update or modify our concepts and theoretical models. In the case of South Korea, Yoon’s self-coup attempt and the reaction to it may have something to contribute to our understanding of important notions in political science. There are numerous possibilities, but two stand out. First, Yoon’s attempted self-coup provides a data point about the concept of sovereignty, namely that authoritarian efforts to subvert popular sovereignty may increasingly rely on mimicking liberal rhetoric and co-opting or sidelining the legislature (rather than the military, as is more traditionally the case). And second, Yoon’s black swan decision to decree martial law illustrates how political science has weaknesses in terms of factoring the behavior of individuals (especially outliers), rather than systemic variables, into its models. Rule of Law or Godwin’s Law? Yoon Suk Schmitt, Sovereignty, and the State of Exception First, Yoon’s self-coup attempt clarifies some things about the contestation of sovereignty—one of the oldest political concepts—in the contemporary era. Beyond Yoon’s formal decree of martial law in the service of a self-coup lies something more profound: a usurpation of sovereignty. The foundation of both the power and legitimacy of democracy—regardless of variant of regime, government, election system, etc.—is popular sovereignty. In fact, this notion is inherent in the word democracy: in Greek, -demos- means -people- and -kratos- translates as -power.- Despite his rhetoric justifying martial law as a restoration of liberal democratic sovereignty, Yoon in fact subverted democracy by appealing to a different, illiberal form of sovereignty, one defined more than a century ago by Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt. In response to the question -Who is the sovereign?- Schmitt (in)famously answered: -Sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception.-[1] Yoon’s martial law declaration, ostensibly on the basis of national emergency, was precisely a decision to announce the imposition of a -state of exception,- the annulment of constitutional processes and protections, suspension of the power of the legislature, and arrogation to himself (and the military under his command) of all political and executive power for a period of his determination. Fundamentally, Yoon tried to make himself the sovereign in South Korea. That he failed to do so was the result of contestation, the re-assertion of popular sovereignty as the rejection of Yoon’s state of exception and the demand to the return of constitutional order. This re-assertion of popular sovereignty occurred through mobilization of both citizen masses (on the streets) and their legislative representatives in the National Assembly, who refused the forceful suspension of the legislature and convened to overturn the martial law decree. So, what might the particular South Korean experience of the state of exception tell us about sovereignty more generally? At least three things seem possible. First, leader efforts at self-coups—the suspension of popular sovereignty—may increasingly be based on populist rhetoric and disingenuous ideological appeal to upholding liberal values. This was precisely Yoon’s rhetoric, which invoked -legislative dictatorship,- anti-liberal (and pro-North Korea) communist forces, and supposed election fraud as justifications for martial law. It is noteworthy that US president Donald Trump’s January 6 self-coup attempt (via overturning the 2020 presidential election, and thus thwarting popular sovereignty as expressed through voting) was based on supposed election fraud as well. Deploying liberal rhetoric to legitimate a self-coup driven by a state of exception to cause a shift from popular sovereignty to autocratic sovereignty is an innovation, as more classically this shift is justified through fear (often of outside threats) and appeals to a need for the supposed higher good of state security that the autocrat can provide. Second, the contestation of sovereignty—popular versus autocratic—in the contemporary world may heavily involve the role of the legislature. This is in contrast to how we typically think of the state institutions involved in contested coups and self-coups: historically the primary actor supporting or hindering the coup leader is usually the military (or paramilitary), and the main determinate of success is whether or not armed forces are sufficiently unified in supporting the overturning of the status quo. Certainly, the military played an important role in Yoon’s self-coup (with elements both supporting and undermining Yoon), but in the case of South Korea, the National Assembly managed to convene to revoke the martial law order before it was blocked from doing so, and thus overcame the state of exception and maintained the popular nature of sovereignty. Again, it is noteworthy the significant role played by the legislature during the January 6 self-coup attempt by Trump (which was unorthodox in featuring no military role at all). It was US Congress that Trump encouraged to invalidate the presidential election results, and it was Congress that refused and instead voted to uphold the Electoral College result confirming Joe Biden as president-elect. Third, in modern democracies, rapid[2] autocratic usurpation of sovereignty from the people may be harder than in previous eras. The historical, archetypal execution of a state of exception involves (inter alia) control over information outlets, a task which is considerably more difficult in today’s internet-connected and distributed world of digital devices, variegated information platforms, and social media. South Korea on December 3 was a case in point, as both the National Assembly and general population communicated instantaneously to share information and coordinate strategies (legislative and popular, respectively) to re-assert popular sovereignty in the face of Yoon’s attempt to assert autocratic sovereignty through imposing a state of exception. South Korean Democracy: Institutions, Civic Virtue, and the Government the People Deserve A second major thing that South Korea’s particular martial law experience can tell us about general political concepts relates to a sub-discipline of political science known as comparative politics. Comparative politics studies the world’s political systems by comparing their various features—regime type, election methods, governance structure and output, etc. across geography and historical time. The key word in this definition is -system.- Political scientists like to examine systems—institutions, structures, decision-making processes, political norms and culture, party landscape—because they are measurable, persistent, and consistent over time. In short, these factors reduce the messy inscrutability of individual humans and outlier events. This is understandable from a social scientific perspective, but it can also be misleading. South Korea’s K-coup experience reflects this by reminding us individuals matter. In the wake of Yoon’s self-coup attempt, South Korea has been correctly praised for the reactive resilience of some of its political institutions (National Assembly procedures for lifting martial law, constitutional impeachment process, etc.), while other political institutions (an -imperial- presidency, a corrupt and gerontocratic party landscape, partisan and toxic political media) have also been correctly criticized for their lack of resilience in preventing Yoon and his co-conspirators from nearly usurping popular sovereignty (and thus placing South Korea under the stress of needing reactive resilience in the first place). But as important as South Korea’s institutional systems are, at base the self-coup attempt by Yoon and his cabal was a product of their individual moral, psychological, intellectual/judgment, and dispositional failures. One notes also that South Korea’s left-oriented opposition—especially Democratic Party leader Lee Jae Myung, Reform Party leader Cho Kuk, and a host of others—has also shown a massive failure of integrity and a propensity for malfeasance. Despite their important role ending martial law, they are not heroes of South Korean democracy, as international media have intimated. Cho Kuk is currently imprisoned for fraud. Lee Jae Myung—the Democratic Party favorite to run in the next presidential election unless disqualified—has been convicted of violating election law and faces numerous ongoing criminal cases for corruption. In short, there are a staggering number of unfit politicians—power hungry, venal, and corrupt—in South Korean government and politics. South Korea’s party and election systems have allowed these people to attain power, and South Koreans have voted them into office. In democracies, the people get the government they deserve. South Korea’s K-coup experience—and its fallout—demonstrates that no system of institutions can ever be perfect, which means that politics is ultimately reliant on the civic virtue of politicians and the individual voters who elect them. This civic virtue is hard for political science to theorize, measure, and test. But developing better tools to this end is important, if political scientists want to improve understanding of and prediction about its objects of study. South Korea is the perfect exemplar of this hard truth: South Korea’s political systems and institutions are well understood, yet almost no one (and certainly not political scientists) predicted Yoon’s self-coup attempt, which will likely lead to significant consequences for inter-Korean relations, the US-South Korea alliance, and East Asian geopolitics. Mencken, Churchill, and the Way Forward for South Korea -Democracy,- quipped H.L. Mencken, -is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.- For the optimist, this classic ironic statement of the travails of democratic societies pairs well with Churchill’s famous dictum that -democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.- Democratic South Korea has put itself in a frightful situation through electing Yoon Seok Yul, which is perhaps a symptom of decay as much as a cause, considering that South Korea’s democratic credentials have been weakening for nearly a decade. Political reform both of institutions—curtailing the -imperial presidency- and modifying martial law provisions; improving political party structures; preparing for a world of artificial intelligence, deepfakes, and other tools for manipulating public opinion[3]; etc.—and civic virtue among individual politicians and the general public is critical to South Korea remaining strong domestically and in the face of growing threats from North Korea, China, Russia, and other malign actors. Whether or not South Korea succeeds at this is currently an open question. If it does, perhaps political science as a discipline can learn something from South Korea’s potential positive evolution, just as it should learn something from its disastrous flirtation with the state of exception.

Quick Take: Kim’s New Year’s Greetings to Putin	North Korean media’s readout of the annual year-end party plenary meeting in 2024 revealed relatively little about its defense and foreign policy goals for 2025. Despite the dearth of details, references to a -strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction- and North Korea’s achievements in building -a righteous multi-polar world-—an expression the North typically uses in connection with its cooperation with Russia—seem to suggest Pyongyang will maintain its hardline policy toward the United States and continue to deepen ties with Moscow this year. Kim Jong Un’s unusual New Year’s message to the Russian president, published just days after the Party plenary meeting closed, reinforces this notion.[1] According to North Korean media’s summary of Kim’s message, he seemed to indicate a new level of military-to-military relationship between the two countries. He offered -best wishes to the fraternal Russian people and all the service personnel of the brave Russian army in the name of his own, the Korean people and all the service personnel of the armed forces of the DPRK .- [Emphasis added.] In the past, Kim gave a nod to the Russian military without linking the two armed forces. For example, in his last message to Putin in October 2024, Kim expressed -our [North Korea’s]- support for the -army and people of Russia.- During a meeting with the visiting Russian defense minister in November, Kim voiced support of -the DPRK government, army and people- for -the Russian Federation- policy of defending national sovereignty, not the Russian military itself. Two additional changes stand out in this New Year’s greeting. First, Kim’s characterization of his relationship to Putin has an added dimension, referring to him as his -closest friend and comrade.-[2] By comparison, Kim’s message to the Russian president in October called him only his -closest comrade.- Second, Kim described North Korea and Russia as -sworn friends,- an unusual term for the North to use in connection with Russia, at least in modern history. In contrast, as per usual practice, North Korean media simply listed Xi Jinping and his wife as being among those foreign dignitaries who sent New Year’s cards to Kim Jong Un. Whether Pyongyang’s decision to offer little information on its defense and foreign policy direction for the New Year was driven more by a desire to maintain policy flexibility ahead of Trump’s second term or simply keep the outside world guessing about its intentions is unclear. A close examination of North Korean official statements and media commentary—past and future—will be needed to help fill the gaps. Kim’s latest letter to Putin is just one indication; more will be revealed in the coming months.

Impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol: Impact on US-Japan-ROK Cooperation	The recent impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol has created many uncertainties not only about the fate of domestic political affairs in the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea), but also about the impact it may have on Seoul’s foreign and national security strategies. Amid political transitions in the United States and Japan as well, this rapid and unforeseen political crisis in South Korea adds greatly to concerns within and between the security communities of all three countries over its potential impact on the US-Japan-ROK trilateral security partnership as well as Japan-ROK bilateral relations which have been the crucial but most fragile link in the triangle. Reversal of the bilateral and trilateral cooperation efforts cultivated in recent years will create vulnerabilities against the ever-growing threats posed by China, North Korea, and Russia, which could destabilize the Indo-Pacific security environment. To avoid this, the US, Japan, and the ROK must work to ensure that trilateral security cooperation, as well as Seoul-Tokyo bilateral ties, are sustained and strengthened through these tumultuous times. Effects of the Aftermath From the viewpoint of Japan-ROK relations and the US-Japan-ROK trilateral security partnership, the greatest question has been who will lead the next administration in Seoul. While much remains uncertain, the populist Lee Jae Myung, leader of the progressive Democratic Party (DPK), has stood out. Not only does the DPK along with other liberal and progressive parties have the overwhelming majority in the National Assembly, but Lee has been the driving force against the policies of Yoon Suk Yeol and the ruling People’s Power Party. However, while the DPK has gained momentum through Yoon’s martial law ordeal, there are serious questions about how it will direct the ROK’s foreign and national security policies, given that many of its members subscribe to nationalistic revisionism and hold strong biases against Japan and the US. The impeachment motion filed by the progressive opposition parties in early December claimed Yoon’s foreign and national security policies as having isolated the ROK in East Asia by antagonizing North Korea, China, and Russia while currying favor with Japan. While one may argue that this was merely symbolic rhetoric to deny every aspect of the Yoon administration, it nonetheless bolstered concerns in both Japan and the US about how a DPK oriented administration—if it comes into power—would work to revise the ROK’s initiatives with Japan and the trilateral framework with the US. Problems are also compounded by the incoming Trump administration, which may de-prioritize the alliance commitments with Japan and the ROK, as well as trilateral cooperation. Consequently, the Trump administration may do little to promote, or even sustain, the trilateral framework and may be uninterested in the consequences of souring ties between Japan and the ROK. The combination of the above raises grave concerns over how the efforts for trilateral coordination and cooperation over the past two years may be revised in the near- to mid-term future, given how much hinged on Yoon’s willingness to push forward despite deep-seated controversies in the ROK over closer relations with Japan. Even if the conservatives hold onto power, there are questions over how much political capital they have left to continue the path Yoon carved out in advancing Japan-ROK relations and US-Japan-ROK trilateral security cooperation. Such concerns are not unfamiliar to many, where past attempts at institutionalizing trilateral cooperation either faded or fell short of making any significant impact—such as in the case of the Trilateral Coordination and Oversight Group, which was inaugurated in 1999 but dissolved in 2003. Even for the Defense Trilateral Talks and Japan-ROK bilateral defense dialogues, as well as other initiatives, their successes were highly dependent on the political climate among and within the states at the time, leading to inconsistencies in outcomes through political leadership changes, making coordination and cooperation unsustainable in the long run. What is at Stake? The -Spirit of Camp David- issued at the Biden-Kishida-Yoon summit in August 2023 and the initiatives undertaken by the US, Japan, and the ROK were about making the trilateral framework more resilient to domestic political affairs. The commitments are underpinned not simply by the shared threat perceptions of North Korea, but the three countries’ will to connect their Indo-Pacific security concerns and strategies. Even in Japan-ROK bilateral relations, the revival of -shuttle diplomacy-—regular, reciprocal summits—along with various exchanges have brought back much confidence between the governments and warmer interactions between the citizens of the two countries. One only needs to look at the progress of the past two and a half years to understand what is at stake. At the strategic level, dialogues have taken place between the leaders, ministers, and chiefs of staff, agreeing on close coordination and institutionalization of initiatives. Greater developments have been evident at the operational level as well, with the operationalization of real-time information sharing regarding North Korean missile launches and trilateral defense drills, including the initiation of the -Freedom Edge- trilateral multi-domain exercises. Although the aforementioned efforts are still young, they were nevertheless essential steps in filling the defense and deterrence gaps against growing threats posed by China, North Korea, and Russia. The problems are not simply about the continued military modernization and ever-increasing assertive operations of all three countries, but also the growing cooperation among them. Unwinding or even slowing down US-Japan-ROK trilateral defense efforts could potentially open up vulnerabilities against these adversarial threats, fueling tensions that could lead to further instability in the Indo-Pacific security environment. Glimmer of Hope? Although the US-Japan-ROK security framework hangs in the balance, not all is over, and there is still some hope on the horizon. Above all, the circumstances surrounding the Korean Peninsula have changed dramatically since 2019. On the down side, North Korea has resumed its missile launches with much greater frequency and pushed forward with its military modernization program, as well as issued its new policy toward the South. The implications of these developments go beyond the significant rise of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but have created greater insecurity in the Indo-Pacific as a whole. Moreover, tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait and combined with the current political crisis on the Korean Peninsula, there are understandable concerns about the risk of a simultaneous contingency in the region. However, on the more positive side, the increasingly volatile regional security environment has served as a driver for both Japan and the ROK to recognize that their security interests are intertwined, making close trilateral coordination and cooperation with the US mutually beneficial and essential. Such perceptions are shared among the security communities in Japan and the ROK, with some notable improvements in public opinion in both countries as well. The other important point is that the aforementioned systemization in trilateral coordination and cooperation in recent years has set strong institutional and procedural precedents for the future. Japan-ROK relations have been repeatedly taken one step forward and one step back. Numerous times, steps toward Japan-ROK security cooperation through dialogues, exercises, operations, and institutionalization were either halted or reversed due to political differences over historical and sovereignty issues or strategic diversions due to change of administrations in Seoul. Yet the initiatives undertaken in recent years have been two or three steps forward, making it difficult to completely reverse progress and providing a solid starting point that the states can come back to in the future. Steps Needed Ahead To sustain and further develop the trilateral partnership in a time when there are uncertainties concerning future leadership, the US, Japan, and the ROK must work together in the interim to prove that the framework is vital and beneficial for all parties at both national and regional security levels. Even if the political capital is limited in making further advancements, the three governments can still communicate and promote the benefits and feasibility of the trilateral framework, as well as highlight the agendas ahead. Naturally, there are areas that need improvements going forward. At the strategic level, the three countries need to establish a formal trilateral consultative group to discuss and coordinate matters relating to their respective strategies, as well as extended deterrence. Such mechanisms will be vital not just to coordinate strategies and plans of the US, Japan, and the ROK, but to identify and work with gaps in expectations, visions, and capacity. At the operational level, the three countries’ defense and law enforcement organs need to further coordinate their readiness for multi-domain operations, going beyond missile defense and anti-submarine warfare, and extending to areas such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; remote island defense; cyber and electronic warfare; naval mine warfare; outer space; logistics; as well as humanitarian operations. To do this, however, the focus should not be just about formulating and practicing coordinated missions, but also on enhancing interoperability. Conclusion In South Korea, the US-Japan-ROK trilateral security framework is susceptible to becoming a domestic political football, and the partnership will be tested in the coming months. At the same time, there is no denying that the regional security environment has worsened because of the long-term revisionist ambitions of China, North Korea, and Russia. While diplomatic solutions are undoubtedly desirable, coordinated defense measures must continue to be pursued to ensure that both national and regional security is not compromised. In the end, it is not about who is preferred as South Korea’s next leader, but rather how they can pragmatically, productively, and realistically work with the US and Japan for regional security and stability while also repairing the state of domestic political affairs.
