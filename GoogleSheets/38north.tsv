Goals, Delays and Mystery: International Football Coverage on Korean Central Television	If you’re a fan of the English Premier League and live in North Korea, the good news is that coverage of the 2024-2025 season is finally underway on state television, beginning on January 13. But you shouldn’t get too excited. If 2025 is like recent years, only a handful of games will be shown, they’ll be subject to frequent repeats and fans will never get to see which team wins the league. But perhaps that doesn’t matter too much. With propaganda making its way into almost every aspect of North Korean television, international sports coverage is one of the few moments each day when state TV is not trying to send an overt or underlying message to its viewers, so that may be sufficient to make it enjoyable. That is not to say that politics never make their way into sports coverage. In fact, choosing which teams and players are televised tends to be politically-driven. During coverage of the 2022 World Cup, for example, South Korea was not featured until it fell out of the tournament, and in 2023, North Korean TV graphics labeled South Korea as &#8220;puppets&#8221; during coverage of the team’s 4-1 victory in the Women’s Football tournament at the Asian Games. North Korea went on to lose 4-1 to Japan in the final, so perhaps that was payback by the sporting gods. While the amount of sports broadcast on Korean Central Television (KCTV) is probably greater than it has ever been, the station often waits days or weeks to air events. The competitive international sports rights market likely also puts the country at a disadvantage as its broadcast is relatively poor and there are no paid TV channels, but this could be the basis for a future soft diplomacy effort largely devoid of politics. Methodology To analyze football (soccer) coverage on Korean Central Television, we used the author’s archive of North Korean TV broadcasts received via satellite, and a database of TV program schedules compiled by South Korea’s Ministry of Unification. The analysis covered the period from April 2022 to January 2025. The analysis does not cover the digital Sport TV channel. Available information suggests that channel broadcasts for a handful of hours on weekends but does not carry a greater variety of sports than KCTV does, which is available to every home nationwide. Background Sports coverage has long had a place on Korean Central Television. It became more important in mid-2022 when, amid a country-wide COVID-19 outbreak, the station almost doubled its daily broadcasting output from 8 hours to 14 hours. On most days, at least an hour of that extra programming was filled with sports—that is still the case today and much of that sport continues to be football. In 2022, KCTV aired matches from the English, German, French, Spanish and Italian leagues, but since 2023 has settled exclusively on the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and FIFA World Cup. Today, most afternoons include a sports broadcast in the hour or two immediately before the 5pm news bulletin. While football is the most common sports broadcast, other sports popular in North Korea, such as table tennis, volleyball, power lifting, wrestling, badminton, gymnastics, taekwondo, tennis, judo and longbow, receive airtime as well, although in much more limited coverage. Football matches are usually shown edited, and 90 minutes of play is typically squeezed into about 60 minutes of programming. On-air graphics in English are overlayed with Korean graphics and any other logos present on the video are blurred. At one stage, KCTV even blurred the pitch-side advertising, but it no longer does that. Premier League Coverage Coverage of the current season of the English Premier League began on KCTV on January 13 with a match between Ipswich and Liverpool—150 days after it took place on August 16, 2024. The next game to be broadcast, two days later, was also an August 2024 game. That broadcast was aired 144 days after it was played. With coverage of the 2024-2025 season having just begun, there is insufficient data available to analyze the current season. However, looking at last year’s coverage reveals that such delays are not unusual. Each Premier League season consists of 380 regular season games. KCTV carries only a fraction of the games; those that are televised are typically repeated three times or more. Of the games in the 2023-2024 season, only 21 were aired. The chart below shows each of the 21 games televised, the date they were played, (in green) and the date of the broadcast and repeats (in red). The first match that was televised in North Korea was an August 11, 2023, game between Burnley and Manchester City. It was shown on September 27, 2023, 47 days after it was played. The following two football broadcasts were repeats of the same game. From August 11 to the end of 2023, KCTV aired an additional 16 Premier League matches. All were originally played in August or September; by the end of the year, the time elapsed between the games and their broadcast on KCTV had grown to three months. It was not until May 2024 that coverage of the Premier League resumed. Rather than jumping forward in the season, coverage picked up with matches played in England in September and October 2023, and reruns of earlier games. The final match of the season to be broadcast was on September 14, 2024. It was a game between Manchester United and Manchester City originally played on October 29, 2023—a delay of 321 days. But that wasn’t the longest delay. The September 3 match between Liverpool and Aston Villa was repeated for a fifth time on September 2—a year after it was played. None of the matches from the latter two-thirds of the season were shown. The selection of games did not cover all the teams. For the 2023-2024 season, excluding repeats, Manchester City was the most televised team with eight of their matches shown on KCTV. Chelsea followed with six matches and Liverpool with four. Manchester United, supposedly Kim Jong Un’s favorite team, was only televised three times—but if Kim is indeed a fan, he probably is not relying on KCTV to follow the team. While foreign media is banned for almost everyone in North Korea, Kim likely has access to South Korean TV channels that show the matches live, if he wants them. Several teams were not shown at all: Brentford, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Everton, Spurs and Wolves. It is perhaps not a coincidence that three of those teams—Brentford, Spurs and Wolves—were not broadcast, as they have South Korean players in their teams. A similar pattern played out a year earlier during the 2022-2023 season. Then, KCTV aired 29 of the 380 games, with average delays of around 4 months. None of the games televised were played after February 2023, depriving viewers of the latter parts of the season. UEFA Champions League In contrast to the Premier League, North Korean TV viewers did see the final stages of the UEFA Champions League—the annual tournament between Europe’s top club teams— but those trying to keep tabs on the contest had to contend with the games being shown out of order. Coverage of the 2023-2024 championship began with the round-of-16 matches that were played in February and March in Europe. KCTV televised them between July and November. Most of the 16 games in the round were shown four times but two, the home and away matches between Paris St. Germain (PSG) and Real Sociedad were not shown. This is likely because PSG fields a South Korean player, Lee Kang-in. At the quarterfinal stage, PSG was again ignored when it played Barcelona and KCTV didn’t air the quarterfinal matches between Arsenal and Bayern Munich, despite showing both teams at the earlier stage. PSG was finally aired when it reached the semifinal, although the game saw it lose to Borussia Dortmund. The Champions League final was aired on December 24, almost seven months after it was originally played on June 1 in London. It has since been repeated on January 10. The chart below shows all of the games that were played from the round of 16 onwards (green) and their air dates on KCTV (red). Games with no red dots were not aired on KCTV. FIFA World Cup One of the underlying constants when analyzing North Korea is that things are often not quite what they seem. The data presented so far appears to suggest that Korean Central Television has difficulty and/or little sense of urgency in turning around international sporting content. Indeed, the state’s complete control of all media would also suggest that fans are unable to follow contests from week-to-week, so fast coverage probably does not matter. But KCTV’s coverage of some sporting events demonstrates that whatever the reason for the delays, it is probably not technical. The TV station closely covered the 2022 World Cup. Games were typically televised one or two days after they were played and, on some days, KCTV broadcast four games a day. It showed every game of the tournament bar four: all three South Korean games in the group stage and the match between the United States and Wales. The latter might have been for technical reasons, but politics likely dictated the lack of coverage of South Korea. KCTV did show the match where they were knocked out of the tournament by Brazil. Most of the knockout stage games were broadcast hours after they took place, as was the World Cup Final. Quarter-final and later games were repeated twice during December. Coverage of last year’s Under-20s Women’s World Cup, which took place in Colombia, was also impressive. At the tournament, North Korea beat Austria, Brazil and, on September 18, beat the United States to secure a place in the final. Its impressive progress apparently lit a fire under KCTV, which aired the three winning games on successive nights from September 20. The team went on to beat Japan 1-0 in the final and become world champions. The game was played in Bogota at 17:00 local time on September 22, which was 07:00 local time in Pyongyang on September 23. KCTV aired the match at 20:30 that evening—a delay of just 13.5 hours. State media showed scenes of North Koreans watching the match in homes, restaurants, public facilities and on large public TV screens. Sports TV Rights Of course, the national team being crowned world champions will always command more local attention than, say, a match between Wolves and Chelsea, but it leaves open the mystery of why the coverage of foreign football looks like it does and especially why is it so late? KCTV coverage of World Cup games has proved it has the technical ability to receive, edit and air multiple games in a matter of hours or days. But there is an important difference between the World Cup and other tournaments highlighted here. In the past, Korean Central Television has worked through the Asian Broadcasting Union to secure rights to the World Cup and the Olympics, usually for no cost, but for European football that does not appear to be the case. Both the English Premier League and Champions League list Eclat Media Group and its SPOTV channel as rights holders in South Korea, but no rights are listed for North Korea, so how KCTV gets the footage is a mystery. The long delay between games being played and broadcast could be down to lack of sufficient access, and perhaps that the European championships are just not as important to a North Korean audience as tournaments that they play in. For organizations wishing to engage North Korea in non-traditional diplomacy, the provision of sporting rights to KCTV could be one way to accomplish that and provide the domestic audience with greater international programming options for their entertainment and enjoyment.

New Alliance Dynamics in and Around Korea	While most commentary on the Russo-North Korea (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK) alliance emerging from Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has concentrated on what each side offers the other and the activity of North Korean troops in Ukraine, it tends to ignore the dynamics of Russia-North Korea-China relations in error. These dynamics affect not only these countries but also South Korea (Republic of Korea or ROK), Japan and the US as well as the war in Ukraine, making their impact simultaneously regional and global. Here we must remember that Putin has called China Russia’s ally and that Kim Jong Un has called Russia, based on the Russo-DPRK treaty, an ally. Russia calls its relations with China an alliance, while China studiously refrains from doing so, however, Chinese military behavior in tandem with Russia shows all the earmarks of an alliance, i.e., joint military action. As Stephen Walt wrote in 1987, an alliance is -a formal or informal agreement for security cooperation between two or more sovereign states.- In this context, Alexander Lanoszka commented in 2022 that -China and Russia arguably engage in more military cooperation now than some treaty allies have had historically.-[1] And the evidence now shows that he was right as this dimension of bilateral cooperation, particularly in military affairs, continues to grow. For Pyongyang, having treaties with both Russia and China that include mutual defense clauses may represent a regeneration of the -Northern Alliance- or -Grand Strategic Triangle- of the 1950s with Moscow and Beijing. This process began around 2017, when Russia and China declared a joint approach to Korean security issues that has essentially endured into the present. But while Russia and China have long collaborated to undermine the UN sanctions regime on North Korea and are its primary partners, this shared approach is not exempt from the tensions that observers frequently find when analyzing alliances. The Russo-North Korea treaty has, for instance, revealed some of those fractures, as much of the commentary on China’s reaction to this treaty has emphasized Beijing’s discomfort with the arrangement for reducing its leverage over North Korea, playing the two big powers against each other. As a result of the Russo-DPRK treaty both Russia and North Korea appear to have increased their spheres of discretion vis-à-vis China and thus caused some anxiety in Beijing about its ability to restrain its partners’ behavior. But apart from these alliance dynamics, the evolving relationship among these three states now raises the possibilities of Russia and/or North Korea taking more unilateral and thus potentially escalatory steps in either or both Ukraine and against South Korea. While this does not mean escalation is imminent or likely, it does enhance escalation risks in both theaters. Deterrence Dynamics in Northeast Asia: China’s Diminished Leverage on North Korea and Russia Although China tends to claim that it is a neutral observer of the war in Ukraine, it appears increasingly clear that without the economic support given by China to Russia in the form of buying Russian oil and gas and providing Russia with crucial dual use goods and components, Russia would be hard-pressed to continue the war in Ukraine. Furthermore, despite the many comments that this Russo-North Korean alliance has, to a greater or lesser degree, disturbed China, limiting its economic leverage over North Korea by increased Russian trade, aid and capital flows, China continues to support North Korea. For example, China’s $2.3 billion trade with North Korea accounted for nearly all the latter’s trade in 2023. But beyond eroding China’s economic-political leverage over North Korea’s behavior and the credibility of Beijing’s -neutrality- in this war despite its abundant and visible economic support for Russia, the Russo-North Korean relationship also weakens China’s ability to employ its economic power to restrain North Korea’s military policies. That erosion of China’s control over North Korean escalation potential must generate anxiety among Chinese leaders. The diminution of China’s leverage over North Korea’s inclinations for provocative behavior manifests itself in three ways. First, Russia’s increasing dependence on North Korea makes the question of North Korea’s quid pro quo more urgent. To date, according to South Korean officials, -North Korea has also provided Russia with 20,000 shipping containers’ worth of weapons, including millions of artillery shells, newly developed ballistic missiles, multiple-launch rocket systems and long-range howitzers&#8230;- Moreover, North Korea, according to ROK intelligence, will send still more troops to Russia. In return, the DPRK has already obtained up to $5.5 billion through arms deals with Russia. This report also estimated that North Korea could earn up to to $572 million annually through deploying troops if this type of arrangement is continued​. This money has gone, inter alia, to the DPRK’s defense sector leading Kim Jong Un to urge mass production of more attack drones and dual-capable KN-23 IRBMs. Apart from this defense construction North Korean forces are gaining valuable battlefield experience even if they suffer heavy casualties, as well as large amounts of oil and food from Russia. Beyond all this, North Korea has received air defenses from Russia that are vital to its defenses given its inferiority vis-à-vis US or ROK air and missile strikes. Receiving these defenses plus reputed help with satellites increases North Korea’s deterrence capabilities. This may encourage Pyongyang to take more provocative risks vis-à-vis Seoul that could escalate and force China into defending the North or abandoning an ally who might otherwise provoke nuclear escalation. Second, Beijing knows full well that mass production of dual-capable North Korean missiles, acquisition of air defenses, and potential Russian transfers of missile and even nuclear technology to North Korea only incentivizes Washington, Seoul, and Tokyo to reciprocate by moving more US dual or nuclear-capable IRBMs to Japan and South Korea, a move that only heightens its own perception of threat from Washington and its allies. Moreover, if Washington were to approve of allied proliferation, it would be difficult to prevent Seoul and perhaps eventually Tokyo from going nuclear. That outcome would wreck one of the pillars of China’s strategy of no more nuclear states in Northeast Asia. One recent view may exaggerate the danger posed by North Korean nuclearization to China as a -strategic liability- but otherwise correctly highlights the threat that its proliferation represents to Northeast Asia. For China, North Korea—and particularly its nuclear program—is a strategic liability. China prioritizes stability in its neighborhood, but North Korea purposefully pursues instability right next to China. This conflict of interests between the treaty allies exacerbates Chinese national security concerns, particularly regarding the United States and its hub-and-spoke system in the Indo-Pacific area. In response to North Korea’s rapid nuclear and missile developments, the United States has significantly ramped up its military presence on and around the Korean Peninsula, in consultation with its ally, South Korea. That includes the regular deployment of strategic (i.e., nuclear-capable) US assets to the region, something China is not comfortable with. Likewise, Tong Zhao wrote that, -North Korea’s advancing nuclear and missile programs, for example, are major drivers of US development of homeland missile defenses and some US allies’ development of theater missile defenses. China believes both types of missile defense systems pose a threat to its nuclear deterrent.- Therefore the intensified US alliance network that will emerge from North Korea’s Russia-backed provocations will be both anti-Chinese and anti-Russian. Russia has long and increasingly fulminated against US missile emplacements in Northeast Asia considering them a threat to which it will respond by placing more Russian missiles in Asia. While this supposed threat is one strong motive for the Russo-Chinese alliance; it also justifies Moscow’s alliance with Pyongyang and support for its proliferation. But Russian missile deployments in Asia, given its alliances, merely generate intensified South Korean and Japanese threat perceptions to which both those governments and the US must respond, further discomfiting China. So, here China’s -escalation control- over North Korea and Russia also diminishes leaving it trapped in an escalating arms race across Northeast Asia. Finally, China now has two allies who regularly make cavalier nuclear threats to make everyone else take them seriously. The frequent, almost daily Russian nuclear threats through 2024 represent a conscious strategy to deter the West from helping Ukraine. But beyond that, it appears that there is a discernible domestic faction that sees nuclear weapons—or at least tactical nuclear weapons—as warfighting instruments that should actually be used. Until now China’s steadfast opposition to nuclear weapons use has helped stay their hand. However, a deeper look at alliance relations among these three states reveals potentially disturbing trends. We have long known that for Russia, nuclear weapons are a talisman of its great global power status. This veritable obsession with status grips Russian political actors across the board. Moreover, as I’ve argued earlier, one reason for Russia’s many resorts to force, not only in Ukraine, is to prove to China and itself that it truly is a great power that is worthy of alliance with China (Bundnisfahig in German). Thus it has loosened the conditions of its deterrence and if facing a catastrophic defeat (which in Ukraine is any defeat), especially if supported by Western deliveries of conventional missiles capable of attacking Russia, will face severe internal pressures for nuclear use. In addition, one key point of the Russo-North Korea treaty is that it allowed Russia to compensate for its rising dependence on China to prosecute the war in Ukraine. Observers report that one reason China is uneasy about this treaty is that it reduces its leverage on North Korea. But it also arguably reduces its leverage on Russia who now has a new ally or partner in Northeast Asia. This treaty offers Russia an opportunity to act independently of China in Asia thereby asserting itself as the great Asian power that it wishes to see in the mirror. Since it does the same thing for North Korea, for both powers it represents a way to enlarge their sphere of discretion vis-à-vis China more closely to them because of its anxiety about losing control or leverage over its partners if not allies at a time of growing American pressure on China. Thus, this treaty seemingly reduces Beijing’s -escalation control- over them, allowing them to act more provocatively and freely while China, who has found that it has no other reliable alternatives, must accept their behavior. Conclusion Therefore, if we examine these alliance and deterrence dynamics closely, we find some disturbing parallels to the Hohenzollern-Hapsburg double alliance of World War I where both powers trapped themselves and Europe in their obsession with showing everyone else that they were true great powers who would not be elbowed out of their place in the sun. China has thus found that it has no partners or allies other than these states. It now tries to exercise a measure of leverage to prevent them from behaving excessively provocatively or recklessly lest it and they all be driven into a cauldron of fire against their interests. Thus, as stated above, if we ignore these three states’ alliance and deterrence dynamics, we do so at our genuine peril.

Trump in Pyongyang?	Donald Trump’s recent pronouncement that he plans to reach out to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un should come as no surprise. Trump held three summits with Kim during his first term in office, the first sitting president to meet a North Korean dictator. However, while Trump is right that summitry is the only way to solve tensions between Washington and Pyongyang, the president is wrong if he thinks Kim will quickly agree to a meeting. The world is a different place today than it was in 2018. North Korea has pivoted away from seeking better relations with Washington to building closer ties with America’s two top rivals: Russia and China. Pyongyang’s thousands of troops in Kursk fighting alongside Russian soldiers are the most tangible sign of that pivot. Kim told his country’s elite that the United States was an implacable foe that must be weakened and confronted. North Korea has also accelerated the deployment of nuclear-armed missiles that can destroy both regional targets and American cities. This buildup has triggered a regional arms race, with both South Korea and Japan also building up their missile arsenals. South Korea’s debate over its own nuclearization rages on, with Tokyo likely to follow suit. Tensions are high. In this kind of environment, one misstep could trigger a nuclear war. Trump’s confidence also ignores the fact that he humiliated Kim during their last two meetings. The February 2019 Hanoi session collapsed when an impatient president couldn’t sit still and walked out.[1] An angry Kim returned to his hotel room and slammed the door.[2] Even Trump seemed to have doubts. He called the South Korean leader, Moon Jae-in, as Air Force One lifted off from Hanoi and asked him six times to reach out to Kim. A snap summit at the Demilitarized Zone three months later was a public relations triumph, Kim responded overnight to a last-minute tweet invitation from Trump, but a policy disaster. The two leaders agreed to restart negotiations. Trump, however, didn’t keep his promise to Kim to postpone an upcoming US-South Korean military exercise, prompting the dictator to accuse the president of making Kim look like an idiot in a secret letter.[3] Creating a new round of engagement and summit-driven diplomacy is not impossible, but it will not likely be as easy to engineer as Trump seems to believe. Pyongyang’s disillusionment with Trump’s last shot at diplomacy, its reluctance after three decades of failed negotiations with Washington, as well as its newfound closeness with Russia will be hard to overcome. It will require time, patience, and a series of enticing initiatives to have any chance of success. President Trump’s first move shouldn’t be a summit with Kim—it should be with Moscow and Beijing. Russia’s support for an American initiative will be crucial given its close ties with North Korea. If Trump can play a positive role in brokering a deal settling the war in Ukraine, the door may open to easing tensions in US-Russian relations and increasing consultation on how to resolve the situation in Northeast Asia. As for China, while its relationship with North Korea is at a low ebb, Beijing’s support for an American initiative will still be important in view of its enduring political and economic ties with Pyongyang. Still, Washington shouldn’t waste any time signaling to Kim that it is willing to resume dialogue. The president checked that box in his Fox News interview. He should follow up with a resumption of his correspondence with Kim that ended when Trump left office. While the media ridiculed the letters, they contained valuable clues from both leaders about how to move negotiations forward. One immediate objective should be to renew face-to-face talks between the two countries, either between senior officials like the Secretary of State or at the working level. The main reason would be to arrange an early summit between Trump and Kim where they would lay out a gameplan for moving forward with substantive talks. President Trump should also adopt more realistic goals. Given Pyongyang’s growing nuclear arsenal, Washington should ditch its longstanding near-term objective of denuclearizing North Korea for another near-term goal, reducing the danger of nuclear war. A weapons of mass destruction (WMD) test ban would halt significant improvements and deployment of new weapons. A suspension of visits to the Peninsula by American aircraft and submarines capable of carrying nuclear weapons would calm tensions. The president will have in his tool-kit other steps to propel talks forward. Lifting sanctions, establishing diplomatic relations, and suspending US-ROK military exercises are some of those measures. Since it’s been almost six years since any talks, which ones Kim will be interested in can only be figured out through in-person meetings. Maximum pressure may be still necessary. Hiking up sanctions will be ineffective given Chinese and Russian opposition. Instead, President Trump could threaten to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, a risky move that could feed the regional arms race. But it could also serve diplomacy, if the United States offered to stop the deployment in return for progress in talks. If North Korea reverses course, seeks better relations with Washington and reaches agreements to ease tensions, Donald Trump himself may be the biggest attraction of all. A trip by the American president to Pyongyang would be proof positive that the two countries were on track to averting a dangerous clash and ending the 70-year-old Cold War in Northeast Asia. For President Trump, a Pyongyang summit would be a public relations bonanza, guaranteed to attract the largest worldwide audience ever. He would be a shoo-in for the Nobel Prize that he has obsessed over since he took office in 2017. Finally, inside-the-Beltway critics on Capitol Hill and the media may harp about appeasement. On the other hand, the average American citizen will be all for anything that smacks of reducing the danger of war and the peacemaker president who can make it happen.[4] The post Trump in Pyongyang? appeared first on 38 North.	https://www.38north.org/2025/01/trump-in-pyongyang/	2025-01-31T11:23:33-08:00	
Signs Point to Continued Expansion of Nampho Port	North Korea’s Nampho Port continues to be the focus of construction and expansion activity, emphasizing its growing importance within North Korea’s economic and military infrastructure. Commercial satellite imagery shows continued work to expand the dual-use shipbuilding area, the completion of new petroleum, oil and lubricants (POL) storage and berthing facilities, and movement at the commercial container port. Background Nampho is North Korea’s largest commercial port and is known for its large coal, petroleum, oil and commercial goods import and export facilities. Its position on the west coast of the country offers a more direct route to China and most of the rest of Asia. Alongside commercial operations, the port also includes construction and repair halls that cater to both commercial vessels and fishing boats, as well as some naval vessels and barges. In late December 2024, North Korean state media reported the construction of a new destroyer- or frigate-like warship at Nampho. This announcement—and continued activity—may indicate the site’s utility in expanding and modernizing the country’s navy. Ship Repair and Construction Area At the new shipbuilding hall, installation of its roof was completed in November and construction has advanced on a number of adjacent buildings. They appear to be part of the same project. Work on these auxiliary structures began at the same time as the new construction hall, although the purpose of each building is unclear. Work to seal off the former secure boat basin off from the river has progressed significantly since it began to be backfilled with soil in late August 2024 and appears nearly complete. Its original wall remains but has been extended to the west, now connecting the area to the mainland on both ends. The additional land creates space for further construction activity in the shipyard. Part of this preparatory work is the excavation of 12 large, circular holes alongside a road. The holes are among at least 60 that have appeared across the entire port area. Those adjacent to the new construction hall are, in appearance, reminiscent of those seen in February 2024 that proved to be the footers for the support columns of the new shipbuilding hall. Other holes observed on imagery from January 23 vary in size and placement, suggesting they may not be intended for building construction. For example, some smaller holes line one of the interior access roads, possibly for planting trees. Whether the range of holes will be for construction or other efforts remains to be seen. Petroleum, Oil and Lubricants (POL) Storage Area Four new POL storage tanks that were under construction in a September report have been completed. Preparatory work for the tanks had been visible for several years. At the end of two nearby wharfs, piers have been built. Previous reporting identified concrete blocks that had been placed into the water to serve as the base for the piers. On imagery from January 23, the surfacing of the pier blocks appeared in progress, signifying the construction work was nearing completion. In addition to the POL tanks, another has been added to the storage area since early November 2024, as well as two bases for two new tanks. Container Port The commercial container port appears busy with the movement of many containers evident in January compared with imagery from September and November 2024. While infrequent imagery does not allow for precise tracking of the flow of containers, imagery shows containers in different locations and configurations, indicating some level of movement has taken place. Bulk carriers are located nearby on imagery; however, it cannot be determined if goods are being loaded, unloaded, or both. This level of activity is high compared to what has been observed over the last few years when, despite some movement, many containers appeared to remain in the same spot for months at a time. There are also several tractor trailers queued outside the container port, appearing to be waiting to pick up goods from the port.

The January 2025 Session of the North Korean Parliament: An Unusual Oath and the Absence of a -Russi...	Introduction Whatever the size and economic impact of North Korea’s support of Russia’s war in Ukraine really is, it has so far had no visible impact on economic data and policies as announced during the recent session of the Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA). Abstractly speaking, we are relatively certain that there is a cause, but we cannot see the effect. Ironically, the opposite is true for a loyalty oath taken by North Korea’s Premier. It is unprecedented and hence must have very serious reasons. While these are most likely of a domestic nature, their potentially crucial details remain in the dark. Kim Jong Un’s harsh and widely publicized criticism of misbehavior of officials in the southeastern Onchon County a few days after the SPA session could be related. It is possible that the upcoming 9th Congress of the Korean Worker’s Party (WPK) will shed further light on what caused the unusual loyalty oath. Main Issues The North Korean legislature, the Supreme People’s Assembly, met in Pyongyang for its annual meeting on January 22-23, 2025. Unlike the year before, leader Kim Jong Un was not present. However, his absence is not unusual. He was neither present at the SPA sessions of 2023 nor of 2022. The SPA followed the standard routine for such sessions. The Premier of the Cabinet reviewed the work of the cabinet for the past year and outlined major tasks for the current year. The Minister of Finance spoke about the fulfilled 2024 and the planned 2025 state budget. In addition, the SPA deliberated on several legal and organizational issues. Two points stand out as being most noteworthy: Both issues will be discussed in more detail below. Apart from these, the main points in the 2025 reports can be summarized as follows: The Premier’s Oath In a highly unusual move, Premier Pak Thae Song swore an oath on behalf of all Cabinet members. There was even a separate Rodong Sinmun article devoted to this. Three issues are worth discussing: The final point aligns most closely with the economic policy narrative in North Korea that has been familiar over the past few years. What is particularly noteworthy here is that the Premier, despite several years of explicitly emphasizing the leading role of the state in the economy, still considers it important to highlight this point again and in such strong terms. One might speculate that it is apparently not easy to undo the measures of economic decentralization and liberalization introduced during the phase of cautious quasi-reforms under Kim Jong Il. From an objective perspective, this would be hardly surprising; people around the world tend to value freedoms they have once acquired and often strive to make their reversal difficult or impossible within their means. However, there is no concrete evidence that the new middle class and other beneficiaries of the reform policies are resisting to an extent that it would justify such a rare public loyalty oath from the Premier. Rather, it is conceivable that loyalty to the constitution is the core of the oath. This is particularly relevant in light of the situation in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol has been accused of violating the constitution with his declaration of martial law on December 3, 2024. Although South Korea is not directly mentioned in any of the official reports on the SPA session, it is plausible that North Korea’s leadership is explicitly declaring its constitutional loyalty in contrast to its archenemy. Apart from the North Korean population itself, which we should always assume to be the primary target audience for the state’s announcements, another intended recipient of this message would be the South Korean public, pointing at a greater-than admitted interest of Pyongyang in its southern neighbor. Whether this also contains a warning to the North Korean elite to refrain from unconstitutional acts is difficult to say. The constitution is regularly amended to reflect the leader’s wishes, so that its weight and relevance in the North Korean rule-by-law autocracy is entirely different from that in South Korea’s democracy with its principle of rule-of-law. If viewed together with the report about serious misdeeds by officials in Onchon County a few days later, the oath might have been intended to instill greater discipline in state officials and to avoid an extension of the leader’s wrath to other parts of the state apparatus. No Visible -Russia Effect- The annual state budget is one of the few instances when North Korea regularly publishes some rudimentary economic data. These can be used as a proxy for economic growth. In an economic system where almost all enterprises are owned and managed by the state, it is appropriate to assume a close correlation between the state’s income and spending, and the overall gross domestic product (GDP). North Korea’s media provide only incomplete insights into the budget reports, which are assumed to be available in more detail to all or some SPA deputies. Typically, only growth rates and no absolute numbers are reported. Moreover, detail is not always provided consistently, making a comparison over the years complicated. However, reporting is very constant on aggregate figures such as actual and expected revenue and expenditure of the state. Graph 1 shows this data since 2000. We notice a rebound of the economy in 2024, with revenue growing by over 4%. The most striking observation is that this rebound is relatively weak, remaining below the growth rates before the pandemic, and that the state’s expectations for 2025 are moderate. The expected growth rate of state revenue in 2025 by only 2% is not very optimistic, especially if we consider news in Western media about huge income generated by selling arms and by sending troops to Russia. A look at trade data (available up to 2023) points in the same direction: a moderate rebound but no dramatic effect. The nominal import value is very low (under 3 billion US$), so that any significant inflow of funds from Russia should be strongly reflected. South Korea, by contrast, is experiencing a huge positive economic effect due to its arms exports. These are expected to reach 23 billion USD in 2025, fueling hopes to become the fourth largest global arms exporter in 2027. Both the graphs for the state budget and for trade continue showing a deficit. The state expects its expenditure to grow more strongly than its revenue, and observed imports are much higher than exports. It is tempting to see this as proof of the existence of Russian transfers; however, these deficits have existed for many years before, so that such a causality is not easy to establish. The assumption of the absence of any significant inflow of war-related income from Russia into North Korea’s economy is further supported by the development of the North Korean won (KPW)-United States dollar exchange rate. The sale of arms and men to a foreign country generates income in foreign currency. Assuming stable demand, this should drive the price of foreign currency down and the value of domestic currency up.[2] However, the opposite is happening. While on May 17, 2024, North Koreans had to pay 8,800 North Korean won for one USD, the exchange rate doubled until October 11 and reached an all-time high of 28,000 on November 29. As of January 21, 2025, it stood at 21,000. What should be noted is that the abnormal depreciation of the KPW started very abruptly around May 2024. This does indeed correspond with an intensified bilateral relationship between North Korea and Russia, as evidenced by the visit of Russian president Putin in Pyongyang in June and the conclusion of a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty, ratified in December 2024. However, since other reasons cannot be excluded, this might turn out to be a mere correlation. Discussion All of the above is based on very questionable data, both in terms of the sources’ sincerity and their methodology. Budget figures are reported by the Party newspaper; trade statistics are based on reverse statistics with data from countries that might have an interest in not disclosing all their interactions with North Korea; and market prices are based on a few random reports from North Korean individuals. However, this only calls the reliability of nominal data into question. The relative development of data over time seems to be more credible, assuming the same errors or biases being in place continuously. The observed phenomena can have different causes. It could be argued, for example, that transfers from Russia to North Korea happen not in cash but in kind, e.g. in the form of goods or technologies, and hence do not impact money supply. Moreover, trade data with Russia are so far only available for 2023. It is further possible that the Russian transfers in whatever form are channeled directly to the North Korean military and thereby do not show up in the state’s official statistics. However, the so-called -Second Economy-, i.e. the part of the economy that is run by the military, is not limited to the production of arms and ammunition and is very much integrated into the overall North Korean economy. Therefore, we would have to expect at least some substitution effects: resources that the military gets from Russia should now be available for the civilian economy. Also, the available foreign money in the hands of military individuals or enterprises should eventually reach the civilian markets. All this makes the interpretation of the SPA reports challenging. Nevertheless, and the actual causes notwithstanding, the very absence of any visible effect on the state’s revenue and expenditure in 2024 and the lack of an optimistic outlook for 2025 remain striking. The same is true for the Premier’s oath. Regardless of how we understand its cause, it is highly unprecedented. For otherwise very stable systems like that of North Korea, such deviations are important indicators of unusual and irregular developments, even though their full nature and extent might be revealed only much later.

Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area: A Slow Shedding of South Korean Influence	Overview The Mt. Kumgang Tourist Region was a popular South Korean tourist destination until a security incident led to its closure in 2008. Despite optimism after the 2018 Panmunjom Summit that long-stalled inter-Korean economic projects would resume, no progress was made before the summit process fell apart. In late 2019, Kim Jong Un visited Mt. Kumgang, denouncing South Korean claims on the resort and instructing it be rebuilt according to North Korean standards and tastes. Progress on renovating the site has been slow, and initial plans were likely impacted by the pandemic. Activity picked up in 2022 to finish razing the majority of South Korean-built facilities, but it is unclear when serious construction may begin, especially with renewed emphasis on finishing the Wonsan-Kalma Beach Resort. Given North Korea’s separation of ties with South Korea, it is also unclear who the target audience for the renovated resort will be. Introduction The Mt. Kumgang Tourist Region—a special administrative region carved out of North Korea’s Kangwon Province in 2002—was initially opened to foreign tourists, including those from South Korea, in 1998. It began under the umbrella of the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone, which includes sites such as Wonsan, Masikryong Ski Resort, and Mt. Kumgang, among others. The project quickly became a beacon of hope in inter-Korean economic cooperation, with South Korea’s Hyundai Asan—the conglomerate also part of the Kaesong Industrial Complex joint venture—receiving a decades-long contract to build-out the area’s infrastructure. However, not unlike other inter-Korean cooperative projects, the stability and longevity of the area ebbed and flowed with the political tides of North-South relations. In 2008, a South Korean tourist was shot by a North Korean guard, resulting in Seoul banning its citizens from visiting Mt. Kumgang until Pyongyang agreed to a joint investigation of the incident and safety guarantees for future tourists. North Korea never agreed to these terms—and the site has remained closed to South Korean tourists. It is unlikely tours of any form have taken place since. Beginning of the End Despite optimism that inter-Korean economic projects, including the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area, would resume after the signing of the Panmunjom Declaration in 2018, no progress was made before both the inter-Korean and US-DPRK summit processes fell apart. As a result, Kim Jong Un visited the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area in October 2019, asserting that the buildings around the site were a -hotchpotch- devoid of national character, and -built like makeshift tents in a disaster-stricken area.- He went on to dispel any notions that Mt. Kumgang was a common property of both North and South Korea, and that an improvement in inter-Korean ties would lead to a resumption of tourism in the area. He ordered the removal and/or remodel of existing facilities that were relics of the inter-Korean initiative that Mt. Kumgang once was. In December 2020, Premier Kim Tok Hun, a member of the Central Committee of the Workers’ Party of Korea, visited Mt. Kumgang, calling for work to turn the site into a -modern and all-inclusive international tourist and cultural area- to push forward with a phased approach. Significant activity was not observed until 2022, when several prominent sites were demolished. The cycle repeated again in 2023. In July 2023, South Korean media reported the chairwoman of Hyundai Asan sent—and consequently withdrew after the North’s refusal to acknowledge it—an application to visit Mt. Kumgang. In response, the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement indicating Pyongyang had no intention to allow the visit to take place and reaffirmed that the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area is solely a part of North Korea’s territory. The 30th Plenary Meeting of the 14th SPA Standing Committee of DPRK—held in February 2024—adopted a decree abolishing any formal agreement on North-South economic cooperation, formally cementing the end of the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Area as a cooperative project. North Korea has since severed additional ties to its southern neighbor—both in law and in practice—meaning the future of Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone is unlikely to bear resemblance to the inter-Korean project of the past. North Korea’s demolition of border links on both the west coast highway (Asian Highway-1, or AH-1) connecting South Korea with the Kaesong Industrial Complex and the east coast highway (Asian Highway-6, or AH-6) connecting to the Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone in October 2024 now physically prohibits access to Mt. Kumgang from the South by road. Rail lines connecting the two countries have also been severed, While North Korea’s vision for Mt. Kumgang as solely its own initiative has not been announced in state media, imagery around the complex reveals that much of the structures from the inter-Korean cooperative era has been demolished, and little has been done to revitalize and rebuild the area. Floating Hotel and Pier Without a doubt, the most recognizable location in the tourist zone was the floating Hotel Haegumgang. Originally built in Singapore, the 200 room-hotel was first a Four Seasons hotel near the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. It was later sold and moved to Vietnam before its purchase by Hyundai Asan in 1998 and consequent move to Kosong port. Throughout its time in Kosong, the hotel was moored with large cables to a dock. A sea wall and two adjacent piers kept the structure relatively protected from the open water. Close to the dock on land was an additional residential area. In 2005, the area had 34 chalets and sometime between then and 2010, a neighboring plot was developed that could house up to 20 caravans. Several support buildings were also added and ground work at the site hinted that more had been planned. By 2010, satellite imagery showed the resort and the floating hotel, chalets and caravans sat unchanged until 2022. In October 2019, the hotel served as a backdrop in state media images of Kim Jong Un during his visit, upon which he instructed South Korean-owned structures to be removed—including the Haegumgang Hotel. However, it was not until the spring of 2022 that work to dismantle the hotel and neighboring caravan park and chalets commenced. By the end of that year, they were gone. Currently, the site remains clear of any new construction, but activity at the piers picked up during 2024. Several vessels visited during the year for short periods of time, including a cargo ship and at least one North Korean Navy vessel, likely from Kosong Naval Base located across the bay. Ananti Golf Resort and Spa (Diamond Mountain Golf Resort and Spa) For a few weeks, one of the major attractions in the tourist zone was the Ananti Golf and Spa Resort, located near Diamond Mountain. The facility sat on hills overlooking Kosong port and was only about a kilometer from the water’s edge, but its opening was spectacularly poorly timed. It opened its doors in May 2008, less than two months before the site was shut down. Like other structures at the site, it sat vacant for much of the followin years, although between April 9 and 10, 2022, about a month after workers began tearing down the floating Hotel Haegumgang, satellite imagery showed the lodging buildings were destroyed. State media reported their destruction as a result of a forest fire, though the validity of these claims is unclear based on commercial satellite imagery. However, imagery does show that the resort apartments or condos were razed between April 8 and April 10, 2022. The main club and spa building remained in tact at the time, but satellite imagery from October 23, 2024 captured work to dismantle the structure underway. Bay Area In addition to the main facilities at the site, numerous smaller buildings have been removed or are being removed across the tourism zone to leave no reminders of the original project. In late August 2022, the Kosong Bay Sushi Restaurant was demolished. The building sat alongside the bay and had once served as the inter-Korean transit office, but later became a restaurant. The sushi restaurant was near a large, paved area that housed logistical offices and units and a South Korean-run gas station. The logistics area was largely cleared of structures in 2016. Additional demolition work was carried out in the summer of 2023. The canopy of the gas station still stands, making it one of the last remaining structures in the area. However, it was shown in a state of decay in on-the-ground photos taken in 2017 so the integrity of it today is likely poor. For several years, more than 40 buses that had been used to ferry tourists around the region were parked on the paved area, but they were eventually repurposed for domestic purposes and observed sporadically throughout other areas of the site. Other Hotel &amp; Resort Area Sometime between September 2 and 7, 2022, the Kumgang Cultural Center was destroyed. The distinct domed building previously served as the meeting point during the 2018 North-South family reunion. The family reunions—held only once since 2015—occurred mere months after the inter-Korean Panmunjom Declaration was signed, representing a time of peace and hope in relations between Pyongyang and Seoul. The House of Culture was among the sites included in Kim’s 2019 declaration that Mt. Kumgang’s facilities lacked national identity and needed an overhaul. This structure differed from the Kumgang Family Reunion Center, a 12-story hotel initially constructed in 2008 that hosted participants in family reunions in 2009, 2010, and 2014. Through May 2022, the complex surrounding the Family Reunion Center was left largely untouched. However, by October the same year, furnishings and materials from inside the hotel were removed and piled up in the parking lot. Debris remained in the area until early 2024. Possible cargo containers lining portions of the complex perimeter appeared around the time demolition began, and are still observed on imagery from October 2024. The hotel&#8217;s exterior appears to be unchanged. In mid-2022, a tourist building opposite the Kumgang Cultural Center site was razed, and the logistics area was cleared. The logistics area had housed over 100 cargo containers but they were removed when the building was razed. A year later, a South Korean-built fire station in front of the Kumgang Family Reunion Center was demolished. Access and Future of the Sites When Kim Jong Un visited the site in 2019, he spoke of the need to modernize the facility, removing South Korean buildings and replacing them with a number of new projects including a passenger port, an airport and a new train service to connect the airport with the resort. As the removal of South Korean buildings approaches its end, none of the new projects appear to have been started. Given Kim’s instructions and the devolving state of North-South relations, this tourist zone, when rebuilt, will not depend on South Korean tourists or investments. North Korea’s push to eliminate any special relations with the South and the recent removal of road and rail links between the two Koreas means the only feasible way into the Mt. Kumgang region at present by way of South Korea is via road or rail from the north. It is possible that should South Korean tourists be allowed to visit again in the future, they could fly into Wonsan Kalma Airport, about 60 kilometers to the north, or come from other areas within the country by car or train. Based on Kim’s 2019 guidance, it appears that a direct air route is preferred. With party resources focused on opening the Wonsan-Kalma Tourist Zone next year, some six years late, it seems unrealistic that serious work on revitalizing the Mt. Kumgang area will start anytime soon. It is also unclear who the target audience for such a resort might be.
