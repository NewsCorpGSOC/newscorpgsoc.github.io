North Korea’s Nuclear-Powered Missile Submarine: A Mystery Wrapped Around a Riddle and an Enigma	On March 8, North Korean (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK) media reported that Kim Jong Un, during undated visits to major shipyards, -learned about the building of a nuclear-powered strategic guided missile submarine, which is being pushed forward according to the decisions of the Eighth Congress of the WPK [Workers Party of Korea].-[1] Associated photos showed Kim walking past a portion of the hull of a new-type submarine (sub) under construction inside a building. The key components of a nuclear missile sub are the hull, the missile system it carries, and the nuclear reactor wrapped within it. The current status of all three is uncertain. The time required to complete all three of these components, plus fitting out and sea trials, means there is probably still a good amount of time, and likely quite a few observables, before the hull seen in the construction hall turns into an actual threat. But a single SSBN provides little additional strategic capability; an SSBN force of at least several boats will be required, taking yet more time. Even then, this force would almost certainly remain significantly less capable and survivable than North Korea’s much larger (and probably still growing) force of land-based road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). The Mystery: Nature and Progress of the Submarine Hull It is unclear from the North Korean photos how much of the new submarine has been built (the bow and stern are not depicted, for example, nor the uppermost portions), or its final intended size and configuration. Extrapolating from Kim Jong Un’s height leads analysts to estimate the new sub’s diameter at 11.5 to 12.5 meters, much larger than North Korea’s previously widest indigenously-produced submarine, the Gorae-class one-tube missile test sub (6.7 m diameter). This diameter has led analysts to suggest the new sub will have a weight (displacement) of some 5,000 to 8,000 tons,[2] much larger than the 3,000 tons ascribed to the Sinpo-C, the North’s new conventionally-powered missile submarine (SSB), converted from a Soviet-designed Romeo-class sub, which was rolled out of its construction hall in September 2023. Although the full hull has not been seen, one source puts the new sub’s length at -at least 117 m,- perhaps based on the length of the building at the Pongdae Submarine Factory in Sinpho South Shipyard—where the sub is being constructed—being about 195 m long. It is unclear how long the new North Korean sub has been under construction, or when it may be complete. As is often the case with North Korea, publicly available information is sparse and sporadic, complicated by the indoor construction of the submarine and likely DPRK concealment practices. Putting these pieces together, the overall nuclear submarine program may have started as early as 2014 (given when extension of the construction hall started). The hull of the new sub appears to have been under construction for some eight years, although construction may have been suspended for about three of those years due to COVID-19 and may have lagged from late 2022 until early 2024. Without knowing how much of the sub has already been completed, its final intended configuration, or the status of any nuclear reactor for it (see below), there is really no reliable way of assessing when construction might be complete. Other sources have estimated the new sub could be launched in one to two years, or two to three years. Even if launched, however, it remains to be seen whether a suitable missile or especially a nuclear reactor is ready at the same time. The Riddle: What Missile(s) the New Sub Will Carry The available information does not permit associating the new submarine with a specific missile system; the new photos do not show the top of the sub where the missile hatches would be, and it is not even clear whether the missile section of the sub has been built yet. (One analyst nonetheless opined that the sub can carry -around 10- missiles, perhaps keying off the number carried by the Sinpo-C SSB.) Many outside analysts interpret the North Korean description -strategic guided missile submarine- as indicating the new sub will carry nuclear-armed (thus -strategic- missiles).[10] One analyst apparently has interpreted the North’s use of -guided missile submarine- rather than -ballistic missile- to indicate that the new sub -will carry cruise missiles but not ballistic ones,- making it a nuclear-powered cruise missile sub (SSGN). Most other analysts assume the sub will carry submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), making it an SSBN. The most interesting thing about North Korea’s characterization of the sub as being -strategic- is how that distinguishes the new sub from the Sinpo-C SSB launched in 2023, which Kim Jong Un called a -tactical nuclear attack submarine- and is apparently to be armed with a mix of short- or medium-range ballistic missiles and vertically launched land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs). This suggests the new sub is intended to carry longer-range missiles than the SSB, and to have a mission other than theater strike. The new sub is most likely intended to carry a longer-range SLBM, perhaps the -solid-fuel engine-propelled inter-continental underwater ballistic rocket- mentioned by Kim Jong Un in his January 2021 report as being in development. Use of an SLBM on the new sub technically would not be inconsistent with the North’s -guided missile submarine- characterization, since both cruise and ballistic missiles (like any -missile-) are -guided.- A sufficiently long-range SLBM also would allow deploying SSBNs close to North Korea so they can be defended by DPRK naval, air, and air defense forces against the substantial anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities of the US and its allies. Using long-range SLBMs in this way would be the most sensible way for the North to maintain the most survivable, credible, sea-based deterrent against the US.[11] A LACM payload, or a mixed SLBM/LACM payload like the Sinpo-C, cannot be ruled out. But to strike the US with LACMs a DPRK nuclear-powered submarine would have to make a long transit through Allied submarine detection networks to locations within missile range—North Korea’s have thus far demonstrated ranges of 1,500-2,000 km[12]—leaving the sub highly vulnerable to US and Allied ASW forces. This would be particularly true if, as is commonly assessed, a North Korean-made nuclear sub (and a first-generation one in particular) will be very noisy and thus quite susceptible to acoustic detection. The best current candidate for deployment on the SSBN is the largest SLBM thus far revealed by North Korea, presumably designated the Pukguksong-6. It was first paraded in April 2022 but not yet flight-tested. Based on its size (about 13 meters long and 2.2 meters in diameter), this missile, in theory, could be capable of a range of upwards of about 12,000 km (comparable to the similar-size 1990 US Trident-II/D5 SLBM)—enough to strike all of the continental US from waters close to North Korea. (The North probably would use a taller -turtleback- missile section to accommodate a 13-meters-long missile and its ejection and launch gear in a sub with an 11.5-12.5 meter- diameter hull.) If North Korea intends to deploy a longer-range SLBM on the new sub, we can expect it to conduct ground (static) testing of the missile’s main stage motors, to modify land-based test facilities and/or one of its test barges to permit -pop-up- ejection tests of the larger new missile, and begin missile flight-tests from land and/or a barge and then from the Gorae-class test sub. This entire sequence could take a few years, although it is possible that some of the early steps might have already taken place without open-source indications and Kim Jong Un could mandate a faster timeline. As of now, however, there would appear to be plenty of time for SLBM development to occur before a new sub with an operating reactor was ready to put to sea. The Enigma: Status of a Submarine Nuclear Power Plant[13] The biggest apparent gap in realizing a North Korean nuclear-powered submarine is the small nuclear reactor that would power it, and without which there is no nuclear sub.[14] Unlike the sub and its candidate missiles, North Korea has made no mention of a naval reactor program distinct from the above references to -nuclear-powered submarines;- no associated photos or videos of a small reactor have been released either. That said, the above analysis suggesting the nuclear submarine program may have started as recently as 2014 would also imply that work on a suitable reactor started at least that recently. There is no open-source reporting that North Korea has yet built or tested such a reactor, although it cannot be ruled out that concealed development work has been going on. Based on other countries’ practice, the North would be highly likely to build and test a land-based prototype of a submarine reactor prior to installing it in a sub (although this is not strictly required), but no test reactor has thus far been identified. Pyongyang’s construction and initial operation of a pressurized water reactor (PWR) known as the EWLR (Experimental Light Water Reactor), would give it basic familiarity with building a PWR for a sub. But the industrial-sized EWLR using low-enriched uranium is a far cry from the very small and compact, higher-pressure reactor probably using highly-enriched uranium (HEU) needed for a submarine. Moreover, a sub reactor would need to be engineered to remain operational and reasonably reliable at depth in a moving submarine with no outside support under combat conditions, and provided with heavy shielding to protect its crew from radiation at least long enough to complete a potentially long deployment. Although a number of US nuclear experts and former submariners have opined that North Korea would be unable to build a submarine nuclear reactor or a nuclear submarine on its own without foreign assistance, the history of North Korean weapons programs indicates that a fully indigenous -good enough for the DPRK- nuclear-powered submarine cannot be ruled out. It may take a long time (or may have taken a long time thus far), and may not be very good, but an eventual indigenous nuclear-powered submarine is within the realm of possibility. How long the reactor for such a sub would take, and how far along the North is in developing one, is anybody’s guess. But the EWLR began construction in November 2010 and did not begin operating until October 2023, suggesting a sub reactor could take at least several years. Clearly, the most feasible way for North Korea to get a reasonable submarine nuclear power plant soon would be with foreign assistance. The degree to which Pyongyang has or will receive such aid is unknown. Russia would be the most likely governmental source of such assistance given the strengthened Kim-Putin relationship and North Korea’s provision of assistance to Russia’s war in Ukraine. Western governments clearly are concerned about Russia providing nuclear sub technology,[15] but there is no open-source evidence of this apart from a few claims by Ukrainian officials[16] that may at least in part serve propaganda purposes. Assistance from China or Chinese entities also cannot be ruled out, although there has been no evidence of this kind of cooperation either. If substantial Russian nuclear submarine assistance is being provided to North Korea, it presumably started in the wake of the September 2023 Kim visit to Russia. That does not provide a great deal of time until now for any assistance to have been assembled and provided by the Russians, and received, assimilated, and incorporated into hardware by the North Koreans. The new submarine structure apparently was already under construction in September 2023. The sub’s reactor presumably is much less far along, and so there is more opportunity for Russian assistance to be useful and have a tangible effect, and North Korea probably would benefit more from reactor assistance in any case. That said, even extensive Russian nuclear submarine assistance does not necessarily translate into quick results. India started receiving comprehensive aid from the Soviet Union and then Russia in the 1980s, including leasing and operating actual nuclear submarines, extensive assistance in submarine reactor design (after India’s indigenous efforts proved unsuccessful), design and construction assistance for nuclear submarines, Russian equipment to help fit out the actual constructed submarines, and SLBM technology.[17] Even so, its Advanced Technology Development program, which started in 1983, did not result in a commissioned SSBN until 2016. North Korea might not take as long to build a sub reactor with Russian assistance, but it might only shave a few years off what the North Koreans could do on their own. Implications We are probably at least several years away from a fully complete, reactor-equipped North Korean SSBN with adequately tested SLBMs. Even then, as with the first Sinpo-C SSB that has not yet begin sea trials, a year or two of fitting out probably would be required before an SSBN rolled out of the construction hall was ready for sea trials, with additional time required to reach operational status. This means there is likely still a good amount of time, and likely quite a few observables, before the hull seen in the construction hall turns into an actual threat. Moreover, a single SSBN provides little additional strategic capability compared to North Korea’s established force of road-mobile ICBMs that presumably will still be growing. An SSBN force of at least several boats will be required—more depending on each sub’s missile and warhead load—to begin to make a substantial contribution to Pyongyang’s strategic forces, taking yet more time to eventuate. But even this force would almost certainly remain significantly less capable and survivable than the much larger mobile ICBM force.

Sohae Satellite Launching Station: Expansion of Road and Rail Infrastructure Continues	As springtime brings warmer weather and softer ground, work to expand the road and rail infrastructure throughout North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station continues. Recent commercial satellite imagery indicates that efforts to cut a new road, or possible rail bed, connecting the east tunnel entrance with the coastal launch pad and southern seaport are underway, which could allow for vehicles or launch materials to easily travel to and from the various parts of the complex. No known satellite launches have been attempted since the failed launch of the Malligyong-1-1 reconnaissance satellite in May 2024. Despite South Korean intelligence reports in late 2024 that North Korea likely received cooperation from Russia and appeared ready to conduct another launch, Pyongyang has made no launch notifications to relative authorities, and there are no typical indicators of an imminent launch observed at the site. Pyongyang announced plans in 2024 to place three reconnaissance satellites into orbit, but failed to achieve that goal. Whether efforts to complete that plan will be resumed or a new target number of satellite launches will be announced for 20215 remains to be been. New Roads Notably, a new road segment is under construction that will connect the east tunnel entrance to the coastal road that leads to the coastal launch pad and seaport. It is possible that this roadway will connect all the way up to the new assembly building. The new road will remove the need to make a tight turn when exiting the tunnel, making it easier for larger vehicles to travel throughout the site. Slightly south of the east tunnel entrance, the coastal roadway is being widened. The road sits atop a berm. Construction machinery can be observed dumping earth to the side of the berm to widen the top. The work appears to be linked to the new road construction. While the exact nature of the activity is unclear, it is likely these efforts will result in a widened road or could serve as the basis for additional railway tracks. There are no current indicators suggesting the connection of the new assembly building and the seaport by rail, but if this is the goal, further tunnelling throughout the site’s mountainous terrain is probable. New Assembly Building After roof trusses were installed in October 2024, the first signs of the roof installation were visible on imagery from November 21. By December 2, roofing was completed on the largest section of the building, which remains the only covered portion on imagery from March 13, 2025. Track accommodations have been installed to allow for SLV components to enter the building via rail. Around the new assembly building, the planned flow of rail traffic is becoming clear. It appears rail cars entering the Sohae Satellite Launching Station will sweep past the building on a yet-to-be-built curved section of track and then come to a halt before backing into the building via a side track connected to the rail spur from the main rail line. VIP Observation and Control Area Little has changed at the VIP Observation Area that Kim Jong Un used to view the May 2024 satellite launch. It appears there will be an inclined entryway on the building’s west side. The purpose of this—and the extent to which this area is to be utilized—is unclear. Seaport The jetty extension progresses at the southern seaport. Imagery from March indicates that workers are using large concrete blocks to form the edge and widen the jetty. Several vehicles are observed. The activity is likely intended to form a jetty dock to allow for deeper draft vessels to be unloaded. Main Launch Pad The main launch pad remains quiet. While not used for a launch since 2016, work around the pad’s infrastructure began in 2022 as part of the site-wide modernization efforts. That year, fuel/oxidizer bunkers were demolished, and work began on replacements along with the early stages of installing new tracks to the tunnel under the launch pad. To date, both of these projects remain incomplete and no further progress has been observed. Coastal Launch Pad No significant activity is observed at the coastal launch pad.

North Korea’s Efforts to Attain De Facto Nuclear Weapon State Status and ROK-US Response Strategy	United States President Donald Trump has already made at least one statement referring to North Korea as a nuclear power, although has subsequently walked back those remarks. While China continues to call for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, Russia appears to have abandoned that agenda, embracing its treaty ally’s nuclear status. This article examines what -de facto- recognition of a country’s nuclear status looks like and how North Korea is steadily making progress toward those milestones. To effectively counter North Korea’s strategic ambitions, it is imperative for the ROK (Republic of Korea)-US alliance to maintain a unified stance on the objective of North Korea’s denuclearization and to ensure the credible implementation of extended deterrence commitments in response to the security threats posed by North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. Background A de facto nuclear weapon state (DNWS) refers to a nuclear-armed country that is not officially recognized under the international nonproliferation regime (NPT) but has acquired diplomatic recognition from authoritative nuclear powers (P5 states) regarding its nuclear capability, survivability, and the perceived lack of necessity for sanctions. Such a state enjoys legal rights and obligations virtually identical to those of officially recognized nuclear weapon states (de jure NWS). The legally recognized nuclear-armed states (de jure NWS) within the international community are those that had completed nuclear tests before the establishment of the NPT regime in 1970. Since the NPT does not apply retroactively, countries that developed nuclear weapons after 1970 are, in principle, not eligible for legal recognition as nuclear weapon states under international law. However, India, Pakistan, and Israel—despite developing nuclear weapons outside the NPT framework—have successfully secured the status of de facto nuclear weapon states. Recognizing that it cannot gain formal NWS status within the NPT framework, North Korea is expected to focus on securing de facto recognition, following a path similar to that of India and Pakistan. Achieving DNWS status requires more than just nuclear capability; it necessitates technical proficiency, strategic deterrence, resilience to sanctions, and gradual diplomatic recognition. States that successfully navigate these four stages can transition from nuclear-capable entities to de facto recognized nuclear powers, securing a place in the global security order despite their non-NPT status. Based on historical cases, four key ‘recognition thresholds’ define this pathway.[1] First, the foundational requirement for DNWS status is the successful development of nuclear weapons and their integration with reliable delivery systems. This entails securing a sustainable supply of fissile material, mastering weaponization technology, and demonstrating operational readiness. Second, a credible nuclear deterrent depends on the ability to withstand a preemptive strike and still retaliate. This involves developing survivable second-strike capabilities, such as hardened missile silos, mobile launch platforms, or submarine-based nuclear forces, ensuring the survivability of a state’s nuclear arsenal. Third, states pursuing DNWS status should be resilient to sanctions and international pressure. India and Pakistan encountered severe international backlash after their 1998 nuclear tests but successfully endured these pressures, demonstrating their commitment to maintaining nuclear capabilities despite external opposition. Lastly, the final and most critical stage is gaining diplomatic recognition from the international community. Over time, DNWS must secure diplomatic engagement from major powers and multilateral institutions, often through strategic partnerships, trade agreements, and nuclear-related deals. India, for instance, gained de facto recognition after signing the U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement, enabling civil nuclear cooperation despite India’s non-NPT status. Challenges to North Korea’s DNWS Recognition Despite achieving significant technological milestones in nuclear weapons development, Pyongyang has yet to overcome key barriers to international recognition, including the survivability of its second-strike capability, the mitigation of sanctions, and the establishment of diplomatic relations. First, the survivability of North Korea&#8217;s nuclear force has not yet been definitively proven. It remains uncertain whether North Korea possesses a survivable second-strike capability against the US mainland. While Pyongyang appears to have successfully developed intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in terms of range, there is still no decisive evidence that it has successfully miniaturized nuclear warheads for missile delivery. North Korea has not yet conducted a real-distance test to verify its mastery of atmospheric reentry technology. Second, North Korea remains largely isolated from the international community due to an extensive regime of international and bilateral sanctions imposed on the country due to its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons technologies. Since the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 2270 in 2016, global sanctions on North Korea have shifted toward a comprehensive framework, significantly impacting its economy. Despite North Korea’s efforts to exploit global tensions—such as US-China strategic competition, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and its deepening ties with Russia—to weaken the international sanctions regime, the US-led sanctions network appears to remain effective. Third, North Korea has yet to secure diplomatic recognition from the United States. Since its first nuclear test in 2006, it has engaged in bilateral and multilateral negotiations, including the Six Party Talks and the 2018-2019 summits, to gain concessions in exchange for partial denuclearization. However, the international community, including Washington, has not provided Pyongyang with a credible pathway toward normalized diplomatic relations. North Korea’s Strategic Approach to a De Facto Nuclear Weapon State North Korea&#8217;s pursuit of de facto nuclear weapon state status follows a trajectory distinct from that of India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan achieved DNWS recognition from the United States by prioritizing regional deterrence, maintaining cooperative diplomatic relations, and demonstrating strategic significance to US interests. In contrast, North Korea’s direct threat to the United States, adversarial relations, and limited strategic value present significant obstacles to attaining comparable recognition. North Korea is likely to escalate its ability to strike the US mainland, induce fear, and pressure Washington into nuclear arms control talks as a means of solidifying its DNWS status. To accomplish this plan, North Korea will probably pursue three primary objectives: To achieve these objectives, North Korea is likely to adopt a three-tiered strategic approach. First, North Korea will continue strengthening its alliance with Russia by providing military support to escape diplomatic isolation and sanctions, especially amid the ongoing Russia–Ukraine war and increasing US–China competition over Taiwan. In return for supporting Putin’s war, North Korea may be expecting to receive advanced military technologies, such as atmospheric reentry, guidance systems, and nuclear-powered submarines. As its relationship with Moscow deepens, Pyongyang may also seek to reengage China, aligning more closely with Beijing amid US-China tensions. Second, North Korea will aim to create conditions conducive to negotiations with the United States that seek to secure concessions for potential limits or restrictions to North Korea’s nuclear development rather than toward full denuclearization. Given Trump’s diplomatic style, Pyongyang may seek to resume high-profile summits to secure these concessions, especially sanctions relief, effectively reinforcing its nuclear status. Third, North Korea is likely to escalate military tensions on the Korean Peninsula as a coercive tool to shift negotiations toward short-term risk reduction and arms control measures rather than continued focus on full denuclearization. Pyongyang may amplify its rhetoric on &#8220;subjugating the whole territory of the south&#8221; and reinforce the perception of South Korea as a &#8220;nuclear hostage&#8221; to pressure Washington into concessions.[2] US-ROK Strategic Response to North Korea’s Nuclear Ambitions In response to North Korea’s persistent efforts to establish itself as a de facto nuclear weapon state, the United States and South Korea should adhere to the following principles to uphold regional stability and nonproliferation norms. First, the United States and South Korea must maintain a steadfast commitment to North Korea’s complete denuclearization. Recognizing North Korea as a nuclear-armed state would undermine the global nonproliferation regime and destabilize security in Northeast Asia. Fortunately, Trump’s new administration reaffirmed its resolute commitment to the -complete denuclearization of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK)- in accordance with the UNSCRs. However, any shift in US nonproliferation policy would not only weaken South Korea’s strategic position, but also increase the risk of a further nuclear proliferation. Multiple surveys in South Korea already indicate broad public support for indigenous nuclear armament if North Korea retains its nuclear arsenal. For instance, an October 2024 survey by JoongAng Ilbo and the East Asia Institute (EAI), indicated 71.4 percent of South Koreans favored nuclear development under such circumstances, while 47.4 percent expressed mistrust in US extended deterrence. This trend suggests that existing measures, such as the US-ROK Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG), extended deterrence, and nuclear operational guidelines, have not sufficiently alleviated public anxiety regarding North Korea’s nuclear threat. Second, the denial of diplomatic recognition and economic relief is critical to preventing North Korea from consolidating its nuclear status. To uphold the international nonproliferation regime, maintaining stringent sanctions and blocking North Korea’s access to diplomatic normalization is paramount. However, sustaining a unified sanctions regime remains a persistent challenge. Historical precedents, such as the inconsistent enforcement of sanctions on India, Pakistan, Iran, and North Korea, illustrate the difficulties in maintaining long-term pressure on proliferating states. In parallel, engagement with North Korea must be approached with caution. Previous efforts, particularly the 2018-2019 US-North Korea negotiations under the Trump administration, demonstrated the risks of a top-down approach that sought a comprehensive resolution. The Trump-Kim summits exemplify how past nuclear negotiations with North Korea have significantly challenged South Korea’s security by allowing Pyongyang to bypass or selectively engage Seoul based on strategic considerations. These risks were further underscored by unilateral US decisions, such as the suspension of joint military exercises, which created unforeseen security vulnerabilities for South Korea. North Korea is likely to demand extensive political, military, and economic concessions—including the withdrawal of US forces, a suspension of joint military exercises, and economic incentives—in exchange for limited denuclearization measures. However, any future negotiation must be carefully structured to avoid unilateral concessions that could weaken the security framework of the Korean Peninsula. Third, to counter North Korea’s efforts to establish itself as a de facto nuclear weapon state, the US and South Korea must prioritize deterrence and strategic stability. North Korea’s nuclear and missile advancements, coupled with deepening military ties with Russia, necessitate a robust deterrence posture that emphasizes credible and integrated extended deterrence. Additionally, the US, South Korea and Japan should coordinate diplomatic efforts to prevent formal recognition of North Korea’s nuclear status by Russia and China. A concerted strategy, incorporating diplomatic pressure, military preparedness, and economic measures, is essential to countering the evolving security dynamics and ensuring that North Korea does not gain international legitimacy as a nuclear state. Conclusion Responding effectively to North Korea’s pursuit of de facto nuclear weapon state status requires a robust US-ROK alliance. The Trump administration’s ambiguous policy on alliances and North Korea engagement could add uncertainty to a ‘denuclearization’ strategy. There is a significant risk that North Korea might seek DNWS status by either partially abandoning its nuclear arsenal in exchange for sanctions relief or by leveraging US-ROK extended deterrence as a bargaining chip to initiate nuclear arms control with the United States. Either scenario could seriously undermine South Korea’s security interests. Therefore, any engagement with North Korea must be built on a foundation of a strong alliance and mutual trust between the United States and South Korea, thereby reducing security uncertainties. Ultimately, addressing the North Korean nuclear challenge calls for a comprehensive strategy that harnesses the full spectrum of national power while ensuring that the safety and well-being of the alliance remain paramount.

Quick Take: First Footprints of New Pyongyang Housing Project Appear	The first signs of work on the fifth and final stage of a project to build 50,000 new apartments in Pyongyang are now apparent. Commercial satellite imagery from March 13 shows that since a groundbreaking ceremony on February 16, building foundations have been excavated at the southern end of the Hwasong District as workers race to meet the year-end deadline. The footers for around 20 buildings are observed in the Hwawon 2-dong neighborhood in the Hwasong District. About half of the neighborhood was built up during the stage of the housing project and this new stage looks to fill most of the rest of the vacant land. Similar work appears to be taking place in neighboring Hwasong 1-dong, although with fewer building footprints. An additional 20-odd footings are also observed in Taesong-dong in the adjacent Taesong Distict, where the groundbreaking ceremony took place last month. The footings have been built on vacant land between the Hwasong District and the Pyongyang Zoo. This is the final year of the plan to build 50,000 new apartments in Pyongyang over five years as part of efforts to modernize the capital city. To date, state media says the project is on track. Satellite imagery has confirmed significant progress has been made against the plan. At the groundbreaking for this final stage, Kim Jong Un announced plans for additional future projects in the capital city, although the timing of those projects remains unclear.

Kim Jong Un Plots Continued Renewal of Pyongyang	Kim Jong Un’s ambitious plan to build 50,000 new apartments in Pyongyang over a five-year period is entering its final year and appears on track for accomplishing this goal.[1] On February 16, Kim attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the fifth and final stage of the project that has to-date created two entirely new neighborhoods in Pyongyang and redeveloped a third. The final stage of the project will further expand one of those new neighborhoods, the Hwasong District, with an additional 10,000 apartments. Beyond the housing push, Kim also announced an ambitious plan to develop eastern Pyongyang and redevelop three existing districts near the city’s center. Pyongyang’s modernization runs parallel to the rural development initiative and -project for regional development,- two projects that have emphasized the need to improve rural communities. Kim’s latest announcement indicates that the intense push for rural development is not coming at the expense of Pyongyang’s continued modernization. The Final Push in Hwasong The final phase of the five-year Pyongyang housing construction project includes building up the southern end of the Hwasong District, according to renders of the project shown in state media images. The Hwasong District, in northwest Pyongyang, was farmland before development work began in 2022. It currently consists of multiple high-rise apartment buildings, shops and schools clustered around two major roads. The first phase built up along Hwasong Street and the second phase, along Rimhung Street. This third phase appears to continue along Rimhung Street and possibly expand beyond Hwasong District’s boundary. The groundbreaking took place in an area that is currently part of the neighboring Taesong District, making it possible the boundary of Hwasong will be redrawn to include this area. Eastward Development In his speech at the groundbreaking, Kim noted that after the Hwasong development is done, -We plan to implement with serious intent the policy of extending streets of Pyongyang towards Kangdong as the second stage.- Kangdong is a rural district of Pyongyang on the eastern edge of the city that is connected via the four-lane Pyongyang-to-Kangdong Road. Before reaching Kangdong, it runs through Samsok District. Kim appears to have plans for that area too. -As major science research institutes, technology universities, and officers' schools will be built in Taesong District, [we] wish to build tens of thousands of modern houses in the section between the Hwasong area and Samsok District's Songmun-dong,- he said State media did not offer any detailed plans of the development, but it could encompass a sizable area, including large stretches of agricultural land. The goal of this additional project would be to -create another wonderful scientific, cultural and dwelling area in Pyongyang,- said Kim. Central Pyongyang While large parts of Pyongyang have been redeveloped since Kim came to power in late 2011, there are still many neighborhoods of decades-old, single-story houses. -We will transform such culturally backward metropolitan areas and suburbs … thereby eliminating and renovating all the elements unbecoming of the appearance of the capital city in its overall formation,- Kim said. He named three districts: Tungme-dong in Songyo District, Wolhyang-dong in Moranbong District and Hadang-dong in Hyongjesan District. Tungme-dong is an area in southeast Pyongyang. It is near the Songsin and Songhwa developments that were part of the 50,000 apartments plan in 2022. The neighborhood is made up of mostly single-story houses and includes some factories along its southern edge, including the Pyongyang Steel Factory. Wolhyang-dong is immediately northwest of the Arch of Triumph roundabout and already contains a number of high-rise structures, although many are at least 20 years old. Curiously, just north of Wolhyang is Jinhung-dong, a largely residential district of single-story houses that appears to be a less developed area of the city, but hasn’t been mentioned as part of the plan. Hadang-dong is in northwest Pyongyang and includes a large area of single-story housing and an undeveloped area alongside a river. It is also home to the Pyongyang University of Transport and the Railway Research Institute. It is unclear when these newly announced projects will begin. North Korea’s current five-year plan, which included the 50,000 apartment project for Pyongyang, is scheduled to end this year. Commercial satellite imagery does not show any current preparations in the three districts mentioned by Kim, so his announcement could be a preview of his next five-year plan for the capital.

The Shadow of Low Birth Rate in North Korea and Its Implications for the Economy	The correlation between a declining population and a country’s economy is that low birth rates negatively affect labor supply and aggregate demand over time. For this reason, North Korea’s population problem and its potential implications for the economy merit closer study. There are conflicting assessments about North Korea’s population trends. According to UN estimates, North Korea’s population has been in slow decline, suggesting, therefore, that the problem is not as serious as some have feared. However, this author’s own research indicates that the North’s birth rate has fallen much more rapidly than what UN data have shown. Furthermore, various datasets confirm that the continued low birth rate in North Korea has started to take a toll on the country’s labor supply and market activities. Making matters worse, the low birth rate in North Korea is accelerating the aging of the population. If these two trends continue, the country is highly likely to witness a vicious cycle of a further decline in economic vitality that in turn results in an even greater population problem. To understand the broader trends of the North Korean economy, it is necessary to closely monitor the future trends of the country’s demographics and the Kim government’s response to the population issue. The Problem According to the United Nation Population Fund (UNFPA), the sole statistical agency on North Korea’s birth rate, the country’s declining population does not appear to be a serious issue. The UN’s -World Population Prospects 2024- estimates that the country’s birth rate has slowly declined from 2.17 in the 1990s and 1.92 in the 2000s, to 1.86 in the 2010s. In addition, this same dataset shows that the total number of births per year in North Korea already surpassed those of South Korea in 2018. These UN statistics have led several South Korean researchers to publish studies noting that South Korea could enjoy a population bonus in case of Korean unification.[1] However, several scholars, including Eberstadt , question the reliability of the UN’s North Korean population statistics.[2] Furthermore, Lee and Kim measured North Korea&#8217;s total fertility rate based on interviews with North Korean defectors, which tended to contradict the UN statistics.[3] According to our study, North Korea’s total fertility rate fell much faster than the UN estimates, from 1.91 in the 1990s to 1.59 in the 2000s, and 1.38 in the 2010s. Meanwhile, South Korea’s total fertility rate stood at 1.15 in the 2010s. If it is true that both Koreas’ birth rates are low, the possibility of North Korea’s total number of births per year exceeding that of South Korea’s will converge to zero. This means the population bonus for South Korea would not be that great even if North and South were to unify. Low birth rates affect labor supply and aggregate demand over time. Various datasets confirm that the continued low birth rate in North Korea has started to have a negative impact on labor supply and market activities, such as forcing women to go back to work and diminishing the vitality of the market. The population trend estimates based on North Korea’s total fertility rate as measured by Lee and Kim are the main source of data for this paper. This paper also draws on North Korean defector testimonials, North Korean laws and regulations, and reports from North Korean-run media outlets. The 2010s: Low Birth Rates Help to Raise Living Standards It is assumed that the decline in North Korean married couples’ total fertility rate is mainly due to the Arduous March in the 1990s and the ensuing major changes in the country’s economic structure. Among those born in the 1970s who reached the marriageable age during the Arduous March, those engaged as retailers in the jangmadang markets increased significantly in number. In addition to the poor childbirth conditions of these markets, retailers risked losing customers to competitors when they returned after childbirth due to intensifying competition in the markets. This resulted in a further decline in the fertility rate. In the 2010s, low birth rates mainly had a positive effect on living standards. Living conditions began to improve as the average number of children per household decreased to one or two. In contrast to the stagnation of GDP in the 2010s, the indicators of living standards for households showed a marked improvement during this decade. In particular, according to North Korean Social Change 2012-2020, published by the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies (IPUS) at Seoul National University, access to better food increased significantly during those years. That study said the number of households with rice as their staple food increased from 48 percent in 2011-2014 to 79 percent in 2018-2020, and the number of households that consumed meat at least once a week went up from 34 percent in 2011-2014 to 58 percent in 2018-2020. Clothing consumption also improved significantly in the 2010s, according to this author’s interviews with North Korean defectors in 2024. Defectors who had experience working in clothing retail in North Korean markets testified that overall sales decreased only slightly despite a drop in sales volume, as high-end products sold well. They also said children preferred branded clothes and parents with only one child were generally willing to buy such clothing for their children. A North Korean defector who lived in South Pyongan Province and defected in 2019, for example, testified that adolescents mainly wore Adidas gym clothes, which they called -leaf-shaped gym clothes.- In addition, a significant number of adolescents joining the Socialist Patriotic Youth League since the 2010s purchased expensive red ties as part of their required uniform. In terms of housing conditions, the residential area per person appears to have increased, particularly for adults. Housing construction in North Korea had been sluggish since the Arduous March, and the average space of residential housing remained the same. However, the space per adult seems to have increased significantly due to a decline in the number of children per household. According to this author&#8217;s estimates, the living space of adults aged 20 and older increased by nearly 10 percent in 2017 compared to 2007.[4] The Mid-2010s: Early Signs of Negative Impact—Decrease in Military Service Manpower Low birth rates began to have a negative impact only in the latter half of the 2010s. North Korea’s military service recruitment department appears to have been the first to be affected, when those born in the 1990s reached the age of military service. As noted above, North Korea’s birth rate fell during the Arduous March in the 1990s. As a result, the pool of those eligible for military service—generally 17- to 26-year-olds—had shrunk significantly by the mid-2010s. In North Korea, people enlist in the military, continue on to college, or get a job starting at the age of 17, after graduating from high school. In response to the manpower shortages in the military, the North Korean authorities in the late 2010s reportedly lowered the eligibility criteria for military service, including height, and changed the military recruitment system from a volunteer system to a de facto conscription system. Reflecting this, Article 12 of the Youth Education Guarantee Act enacted in 2021 stipulates that -youths must actively volunteer for the People’s Army.- Article 41 of the same law also prescribes that early marriage or unfair physical examinations for the purpose of avoiding military service are prohibited. The author surveyed North Korean defectors about their relatives and acquaintances and found that approximately 5 percent of women born in the 1970s served in the military. However, more than 10 percent of women born in the 1990s are estimated to have served in the military. The number of women joining the military is reportedly increasing over time. The 2020s: Low Birth Rate Starts Having a Visible Impact Neither North Korea’s total population nor its working-age population declined throughout the 2010s. There was, however, a change only in the population structure by age group: the youth segment decreased. It appears, therefore, that neither the negative impact of the low birth rate nor the North Korean authorities&#8217; positive measures to combat this problem manifested themselves. However, it is estimated that the North’s total population and the working-age population have begun to decline in earnest since 2020. In particular, according to Lee and Kim , North Korea&#8217;s working-age population is estimated to have been in decline by nearly 1 percent annually since 2020. Labor Shortages in Production Sites The negative ramifications of the low birth rate most clearly showed in the form of labor shortages in production sites such as farms and mines. In response, the North Korean authorities began to force young adults to apply for jobs in agriculture and mining, which are labor-intensive industries. For example, according to a 2021 report by the North Korea-specialty website Daily NK, thousands of young adults across the country were forced to -volunteer- to work in cooperative farms and mines. In addition to mobilizing large numbers of youth to farms, mines, and other labor-intensive industries, the North has attempted to address labor shortages by stepping up married women’s labor participation. North Korean Party instructions and ministries’ regulations on labor stipulate that women are exempt from labor obligations after marriage. However, since the emphasis of women’s labor at the Fifth National Conference of Mothers in December 2023, married women have begun to volunteer to work at production sites. The North Korean Party daily Rodong Sinmun in November 2024 reported that more than 79,000 women had entered the workforce since the beginning of the year. In the past, married women were mobilized only to construction sites, but now they are mobilized to production sites such as factories and mines as well. The widened scope of mobilization may be related to the first appointment of a woman as the director of the Workers’ Organizations Department of the Workers Party of Korea in July 2024. Stagnation in Jangmadang Markets North Korea’s increased crackdown on jangmadang and foreign currency shortages are often attributed to the decline in market activity, but these are short-term factors. According to this author’s interviews with defectors, the long-term cause is population decline. Aggregate demand across the North Korean economy appears to have fallen since the 2020s due to a decline in the total population, leading to stagnation in markets. A North Korean economic research firm, NKID, estimated that North Korea’s market sales in 2024 had not bounced back to pre-COVID levels.[5] According to this author’s interviews with North Korean defectors, some merchants are said to be finding other jobs such as herb picking or gold digging in addition to their normal sales activities in markets. In particular, North Korean markets are losing their vitality as the number of people in their 20s and 30s is shrinking. This age group’s role in markets is quite important for two reasons. First, wholesalers and retailers in their 20s and 30s have physical stamina, which means they can actively interact with producers in distant areas to develop new items and also supply products to remote areas. Second, people in their 20s and 30s tend to be innovative, and thus they can provide creative services. For example, in the case of electronic product sales, repair services are often provided; in the case of heavy products, delivery services are often offered once products have been sold. A decline in the number of people in their 20s and 30s, who play a pivotal role in keeping up the diversity and creativity of products in the markets, appears to be a key factor causing the markets to stagnate. Conclusion The negative impact of the rapidly declining birth rate in North Korea since the Arduous March is already visible in labor supply and markets. Accordingly, the North Korean authorities took issue with the declining birth rate at the Fifth National Conference of Mothers in December 2023 and have since introduced various policies to address this issue. The Childcare Act, enacted in February 2022, obliges the state to provide free dairy products to children.[6] The Housing Act, revised in January 2023, requires municipal and county administrative committees to give priority to housing for families with multiple children.[7] According to a North Korean defector who lived in Pyongyang and defected in 2019, the authorities had already rolled out a policy in the late 2010s that required people to have at least two children to become administrative officials. In addition, the low birth rate in North Korea, which has continued for a long time, is now accelerating the aging of the population. According to this author&#8217;s estimate, North Korea is expected to enter into an aging society, with more than 14 percent of its population being 65 or older by 2025. If these trends continue, North Korea will likely face a vicious cycle in which the low birth rate and an aging population will cause a further decline in economic vitality, which in turn, will further aggravate the low birth rate and aging population problems. Monitoring these demographic trends and North Korea’s responses will be critical to understanding the country’s economic potential.

Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center: Snowfall Shows Activity	Commercial satellite imagery of North Korea’s Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center indicates activity is ongoing throughout the site. Recent snowfall provided a short period to observe activity, based on snow melt. Intermittent smoke at the thermal plant of the Radiochemical Laboratory (RCL), discharge from the 5 MWe Reactor and Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR), and snow melt at the Uranium Enrichment Plant (UEP) and throughout the uranium conversion complex suggest efforts to fulfill Kim Jong Un’s orders to expand fissile material production for the country’s nuclear weapons program are proceeding. Radiochemical Laboratory Work has continued to repurpose a small compound located approximately 0.5 km northeast of the RCL and just southwest of the never-completed 50 MWe Reactor that has been associated with military construction brigades; its potential new purpose is yet unclear. Imagery from early December 2024 revealed more than 40 holes had been dug in the courtyard of the compound, laid out in a grid-like pattern. An additional 100 or so holes were dug in a small field just east of the compound. These holes were squared-off, measuring approximately 1.5 m x 1.5 m. On imagery from January 31, the roof of the long building separating the two sets of holes had been removed. By February 9, the building was completely razed, along with two others at the compound. By February 22, a rectangular excavation alongside one of the series of holes had appeared. Machinery can be seen operating in between the two sets of holes. The squared holes may serve as footings for pillars to support two new buildings or one larger building with solid foundations, as observed in similar construction processes. A new series of smaller holes, measuring approximately 0.5 m in diameter, had been dug around the compound’s perimeter by February 9. By February 22, a solid wall had been built around the complex, resembling that encompassing the RCL and suggesting greater security for the facility. Possible propaganda placards have been placed along sections of the wall. The road connecting this facility to Building 500—a suspected radioactive waste storage facility—was laden with tracks in the snow on January 31, indicating some level of activity. Workers were also observed on the access road on that date. In the same image, two cargo trucks are seen parked along the access road to the RCL’s spent fuel receipt building. One of these trucks has a red cab, such as the type of truck often observed at the 5 MWe Reactor. By February 9, the vehicles had departed, and by February 22, another two appeared. Thermal (Steam) Plant On imagery from January 30 and January 31, smoke was observed emanating from the thermal plant located to the south of the RCL. The roof had a patch free of snow, and coal dust residue was observed between the coal crushing building and the thermal plant, indicating traffic and activity in both buildings. By February 9, satellite imagery revealed that the emissions stopped. Smoke was observed again on February 22, along with steam emissions at the RCL. Past indications of spent fuel reprocessing and plutonium extraction at the RCL have been continuous smoke from the thermal plant and emissions from the RCL for several weeks at a time. Since major renovations to the thermal plant were completed around July 2024, smoke has only been observed intermittently. While a pattern of intermittent smoke emissions does not indicate that a reprocessing cycle has begun, it may mean a lower-level activity is taking place, such as radioactive waste processing or preparation for a reprocessing campaign, which is preceded by the transfer of chemicals to the process area. Reactor Area 5 MWe Reactor Imagery from January 31 reveals that the rooftops of the 5 MWe Reactor’s main reactor building and turbine generator are free of snow and steam vapor can be seen emanating from the turbine generator building. The adjacent spent fuel storage building also shows signs of snow melt due to heat from the spent fuel likely discharged during the mid-October 2024 shutdown of the reactor. Water discharge is observed from the 5 Mwe Reactor discharge point on imagery from January 31 through February 22. All observed signatures indicate that the reactor is operating again after the shutdown. ELWR The roofs of the ELWR reactor building and turbine generator building are clear of snow. Heavy warm water discharge is seen emanating from the ELWR discharge point on imagery from both January 31 and February 9. These signatures have been observed with few interruptions since November 2023, and likely indicate preoperational testing and certification, including running and testing the reactor, steam generators, and turbine-generators. Whether or not fuel has already been loaded for testing cannot be concluded from imagery alone. Snow melt is also observed on the roof of the high bay structure adjacent to the ELWR and the pump house associated with the ELWR. Winter ice in the Kuryong River seems to be stressing the overflow dam just south of the ELWR pump house. Imagery from late January and early February indicate sections of the dam have been breached, allowing the flow of too much water. As a stopgap measure, an earthen dam has been constructed. Uranium Enrichment Plant Previous reporting observed that renovation work at the UEP and uranium conversion facilities appeared complete, given the removal of support materials and equipment located around the complex. However, the purpose of changes made inside these facilities during that construction period is unknown. Imagery from January 31 shows snow melt at multiple buildings within the complex. Notably, there is only snow melt on Hall 1 of the centrifuge building, suggesting that Hall 2 is either not operating or has better isolation. Two buildings south of the uranium conversion area constructed in 2023, were secured with fencing in the spring of 2024. The purpose of these buildings is unclear, but their isolation within the Yongbyon complex is unusual. The western building is free of snow, indicating some kind of operations are taking place inside. Snow melt can also be seen on the roofs of the suspected Isotope Production Plant, indicating some operations are taking place inside as well.

Quick Take: First Look at North Korea’s Airborne Early Warning Aircraft	North Korea appears close to completing its first airborne early warning aircraft (AEW)—a significant upgrade for an air force that has not seen new airborne capabilities in years. Commercial satellite imagery shows an Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft parked alongside a maintenance hangar at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport, with a large radome mounted on top of the fuselage. The radome has a distinctive triangle design on top, similar to what is seen on some Chinese AEW aircraft, but not used on US or Russian aircraft. For Chinese aircraft, the triangle signifies the placement of three non-rotating phased array radars arranged to cover 120-degree sectors. This could indicate support or influence from China, although the triangle alone is not conclusive proof. Timeline The aircraft was one of three IL-76s previously used by North Korea’s national airline, Air Koryo, on cargo routes. It was moved into the maintenance facility in October 2023, and almost immediately thereafter a security fence was erected around the aircraft. In November 2023, work began in a section on top of the fuselage. Conversion to an AEW was suspected, but had not been confirmed until now. Work continued throughout 2024 and in November the aircraft—without the radome—was moved into the adjacent hangar. It remained there until late February 2025, when it appeared outside the hangar with the radome mounted. To date, North Korean state media has not disclosed the project.

Kim Jong Un’s 20×10 Project Achieves Year One Successes	North Korea’s push to modernize its regional industry and geographically diversify its production base is off to a strong start. Just over a year since Kim Jong Un first announced the -20&#215;10- plan, new factories producing clothing, food and household goods have opened in 20 cities across the country, and work has already begun on the second year of the initiative’s construction projects. This article is the first in a series that will examine the 20&#215;10 plan and its role in the overall regional development narrative in North Korea, delving into the locations of the newly-built facilities, what they are producing, and what is known to-date about the second phase of the initiative. The 20x10 Plan The 20x10 plan, announced at the Tenth Session of the 14th Supreme People’s Assembly in January 2024, seeks to build regional production bases in 20 cities a year for the next ten years. The objective, as Kim Jong Un bluntly put it, is to -eliminate the century-old backwardness of regions,- and came with a bold promise to raise -the basic material and cultural living standards of the people in all cities and counties and … across the country within ten years.- Kim said the plan represented -another gigantic change and revolution, not just empty words.- The 20x10 plan was launched as the nation was in the midst of two other major development projects: the initiative to bring 50,000 new apartments to Pyongyang between 2021 and 2025, and an ongoing campaign to replace outdated and dilapidated rural housing with modern, new homes. If distributed evenly over the next ten years, the 20x10 project should mean every county in North Korea gets at least one new factory or facility. Project Origins The inspiration for the project can be traced back to heavy flooding that hit several regions of North Korea in August 2020. Among the areas most affected included Kimhwa Country in Kangwon Province, where almost a meter of rain fell. According to North Korean state media, over 1,000 houses were destroyed, and the infrastructure was badly damaged. Kim Jong Un visited the site in October of that year, shortly after the disaster, to guide the reconstruction. While he was there, he called for the modernization of local industrial facilities to help the local economy and improve people’s lives. By the end of 2020, people were moving into new houses in Kimhwa, but it wasn’t until June 2022 that new factories were inaugurated. Four were built: a food factory, clothing factory, daily goods factory and a paper mill. Kim revisited Kimhwa in February 2024, about three weeks after announcing the 20x10 plan, reportedly to -learn once again about the modernization and management of the regional-industry factories.- While positive on the impact the factories were having, Kim criticized the design and layout and said -considerable mistakes- were made in the architectural design and that they were not practical. -He gave detailed instructions on the design of industrial buildings,- state media reported. Groundbreaking On February 29, 2024, the regional development project moved from the planning to the construction phase when a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Songchon. Kim Jong Un attended the ceremony and spoke to hundreds of local residents and soldiers, who were charged with building the factories. Construction and Opening Throughout 2024, construction projects sprung up in 20 locations across the country, resulting in new factories in every province except for Rason and Pyongyang. Kim visited several of the sites during the year. In November 2024, he returned to Songchon and, likely much to the relief of local party leaders, was satisfied with the area’s progress. On December 20, Kim made his third announced trip to the site to inaugurate the factories. Hundreds of local residents attended the ceremony and looked around the three factories, charged with production of food, clothing and daily necessities. While Kim has not reportedly attended other openings, similar inauguration ceremonies were held at the other 19 currently-completed sites with the most recent taking place on February 11, 2025, in Kim Hyong Jik, Ryanggang province. With that ceremony, the first year of the 20x10 plan was declared an initial success. But further tasks lie ahead for each of the factories if the plan is to be a long-term success. The factories need to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials and maintain quality levels if production and demand for the goods continues. Kim outlined both issues in several speeches during 2024 but did not offer any solutions, instead saying the responsibility was up to local party officials. -If the factories fail to run on a normal footing owing to shortage of raw and other materials or any other problems after their production buildings have been set up in a splendid way and equipped with modern facilities, it will be a crime before the Party and the state, the people and the soldier builders,- he said at the Songchon groundbreaking. We will examine the 20 sites and factories in more depth in subsequent installments of this series. Future Plans While the 2024 projects were focused solely on factories, there is greater diversity among the planned (to date) 2025 locations.
