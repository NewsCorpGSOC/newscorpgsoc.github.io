Quick Take: North Korea’s Coverage of Russian War Against Ukraine	In a speech at a Korean People’s Army conference on November 15, Kim Jong Un said the United States was -sustaining their [its] military assistance to Ukraine- and claimed -the United States and other Western countries are using Ukraine as a shock force in the war against Russia.- This speech was carried for both domestic and external audiences. Kim’s unusual, but not unprecedented, direct reference to the Russia-Ukraine war offers a good opportunity to review how North Korean propaganda outlets have handled this topic since the war began. North Korea has taken two widely different approaches to the coverage of the war, depending on the audience.[1] Outlets targeting external audiences were quick and decisive in reporting on the war and siding with Russia. By contrast, domestically oriented media were first observed to mention the Ukraine situation in March 2023, more than a year after the war began.[2] North Korea became more forward-leaning in its domestic coverage of the war as its relationship with Russia continued to deepen. North Korea’s cautious and more calibrated approach to the war in Ukraine vis-à-vis the domestic public indicates sensitivities surrounding the topic. In that vein, it should be no surprise the country’s domestic media, unlike its external websites, remain silent on the extent of North Korea’s role in the war. External Versus Domestic Coverage External outlets reacted within days of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Two days after the invasion, the Foreign Ministry website carried a bylined article blaming the United States and supporting Russia’s position on Ukraine. An official Foreign Ministry statement reiterated this same line two days later. North Korean external platforms, led by the Foreign Ministry website, have since carried articles and statements consistent with Russia’s position on Ukraine, including North Korean Foreign Ministry officials’ press statements directly voicing support for Russia. Pyongyang’s quick and decisive support for Russia’s war against Ukraine is in line with one of the earliest signs of its foreign policy reorientation in August 2021, when the Foreign Ministry website started to regularly carry reports and articles introducing or supporting Russian positions on international and foreign policy issues. Domestic media’s first observed reference to the war in Ukraine was in a party daily article on March 30, 2023 citing the Chinese Foreign Ministry’s claim that the United States was encouraging the -Ukrainian crisis- for economic benefits. Domestic media have since published news reports, articles, and commentaries that aligned with Russia’s position on Ukraine and were critical of the United States and the West. Domestic media coverage of the war in Ukraine has increased since March 2024, shortly after the Foreign Ministry indicated, based on the foreign minister’s trip to Russia in January 2024, that Putin would be visiting Pyongyang and a new treaty would be signed. It was also after this announcement that domestic media started to provide more details about the war and carry Foreign Ministry statements on the war in Ukraine, which had hitherto been reserved for external websites. Choe Son Hui’s Russia visit in January 2024 seems to have given North Korea greater confidence in its relationship with Moscow, prompting it to give clearer signals domestically on its position on the war. That notwithstanding, domestic media refrained from directly voicing support for the war. In two instances, they indirectly acknowledged North Korea’s support for Russia’s -special military operation- by citing Putin (July 2023) or Russia (January 2024). Putin’s visit to Pyongyang in June 2024, however, was a turning point. In a departure from past practice, a party daily editorial explicitly voiced -full support and encouragement for the special military operation against Ukraine- on the day of Putin’s scheduled arrival in Pyongyang. In his talks with the visiting Russian vice defense minister the following month, Kim Jong Un himself expressed -strong support for and firm solidarity with- Russia on -the special military operations in Ukraine,- echoing the same promise he made during the summit with Putin.

Quick Take: Video Shows More of Suspected Airborne Early Warning Aircraft	A video shot by a tourist in North Korea has provided a close-up view of an Air Koryo Ilyushin IL-76 that could be the country’s first Airborne Early Warning (AEW) aircraft. The IL-76 was captured in footage taken aboard an Air Koryo flight departing from Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport in October. The aircraft, which had been part of Air Koryo’s cargo fleet, has been in a maintenance facility at the airport for a little over a year. Commercial satellite imagery since October 2023 has revealed work on top of the fuselage that is consistent with a radar pedestal. The new video shows the aircraft from the side, with the structure visible on top of the fuselage. It was shot from approximately 0.5 kilometers away, meaning fine details of the structure are difficult to make out. However, the structure on the plane does appear similar to a radar pedestal. A fence is also visible around the aircraft, which serves to both keep personnel from the plane and hide materials from view. Since the video was taken, commercial satellite imagery indicates the aircraft has been moved from its position adjacent to the maintenance hangar. Unfortunately, available imagery is not sufficiently detailed to determine if the radome has been added and the conversion is complete.

Munchon Naval Complex Construction Progresses	Two months after Kim Jong Un visited Tapchon Port on North Korea’s east coast and announced plans to build a large naval base, commercial satellite imagery shows no signs of construction advancing at the site. Tapchon is part of a larger complex of naval facilities in the Munchon area, previously the home of the KPA East Fleet Headquarters. However, across the bay, there is significant work to expand the existing October 3 Dockyard and Korean People’s Army (KPA) Navy Unit 155 Base. Together with Tapchon Port, these facilities are all part of the Munchon Naval Complex. Kim visited the future site of the Tapchon naval base in early September and said its construction would be a -pressing task- if the country’s navy were able to moor -large surface warships and submarines which cannot be anchored at the existing facilities.- Long piers and several buildings were constructed at the port between 2015 and 2022, but none appear to have been put into regular use. Some still remain incomplete on imagery from November 6. While perhaps a less-than-auspicious start for the naval base project, Kim’s emphasis on the importance of this new base to the navy’s future suggests work should pick up in the near future. A slow start following Kim’s visit is not uncommon—for example, at Sohae Satellite Launching Station, modernization and expansion efforts did not begin in earnest immediately following Kim’s mandate. Tapchon Port There have been no discernable changes at the Tapchon port area since Kim’s visit in September, despite Kim calling the site’s expansion a pressing task. Fishing boats are still using some of the piers, numerous buildings remain half-finished, and no new land clearance has begun. Around the site, large concrete blocks remain scattered where they have sat for years. Similar blocks are usually used throughout the country to build up sea walls, although the walls around Tapchon Port appear to be well-fortified. October 3 Dockyard At the nearby October 3 Dockyard, home to KPA Navy Unit 597, many of the vessels on the repair way do not appear to have moved in the last two months. The dockyard was almost completely rebuilt in 2015 after Kim visited and called for its modernization. The latest image reveals work on a new building near the entrance of the site has been completed, and a second adjacent building appears to be under construction. KPA Navy Unit 155 Base Just south, construction progress has occurred at the KPA Navy Unit 155 site. The entire facility is being redeveloped with several new buildings. Satellite imagery from November 6 reveals roofs have been added to some buildings, and second floors are being added to others. Two new round buildings are under construction. The internal partitioning and unique design suggest they are likely to be headquarters or administrative buildings. Additionally, the sea wall has been extended and appears set to snake around the edge of the bay. It may be that the stepped-up efforts at KPA Navy Unit 155 are a prelude to the final phase of construction at Tapchon.

Sohae Satellite Launching Station: No Observable Indications of Launch Preparations	Commercial satellite imagery shows that work at North Korea’s Sohae Satellite Launching Station is progressing. South Korean intelligence reported on October 29 that North Korea appears to be ready to conduct another satellite launch attempt—with the acquisition of parts and technological cooperation with Russia—in what would be its first attempt since the failed launch of the Malligyong-1-1 reconnaissance satellite in May 2024. While modernization efforts progress throughout the site, no typical indicators of an imminent launch have been observed in recent weeks. In addition, North Korea has not made any imminent launch notifications to relevant authorities, a practice they have complied with in the last several satellite launches. Coastal Launch Pad The coastal launch pad has been used for the past three launch attempts. Imagery from throughout October 2024 and, most recently, November 6 shows no observable activities on the pad itself. Around the failed satellite launch in May 2024, support vehicles were observed parked underneath a structure covered in camouflage. Vehicles have not been parked under the same camouflage since late June. On imagery from November 6, the camouflage appears to have been removed from the framing. Roadside revetments near the entry to the launch pad also remain empty. To the south of the launch pad, support buildings were constructed in the spring of 2023. At one of the southwest support buildings, paving of the surrounding area has progressed since August 2024, and as recently as November 6, materials remain in the lot. Tunnel Area Between the east tunnel entrance and the VIP observation area, a section was cleared—resembling a larger revetment—prior to the last satellite launch. In May, equipment was observed underneath camouflage in this area before the last launch. Imagery throughout September and October shows objects in the same area, the nature of which is unclear. The east tunnel entrance remains quiet, with few observable changes. At the west tunnel entrance, work continues. The rectangular opening on top of the tunnel entrance is still visible on imagery from November 6, and roof trusses remain in the surrounding areas. Engine Test Stand Area On imagery from November 6, a blue van and smaller vehicles are observed on the road connecting the engine test stands, moving away from the Horizontal Engine Test Stand. While the purpose of this vehicle movement cannot be determined, the vehicles may have been purposed for test monitoring or could have been carrying test-related equipment for installation or a small upper stage for testing. Other Vehicle Activity On November 6, buses were observed at the mountaintop tracking station and the administration and security check-in building located at the entrance to the site. Their presence may indicate a VIP visit to the facility. On that same date, several white packages or stacks of material were observed in front of the same administration and security check-in building. Their purpose is unclear. A vehicle was also observed at the old Horizontal Assembly Building. New Assembly Building Notably, roof trusses began to be installed between October 8 and October 20. Previous reports observed trusses in the area surrounding the building. By October 31, more than half of the frames have been installed over the top of the building. As of November 6, all but one section of roof trusses has been put in place. Paving around the perimeter of the new assembly building that began in early September 2024 progresses. Imagery from late October shows the paving blocks begin to connect to the main site road. Seaport Activity progresses to extend the jetty at the southern seaport. Between September 23 and September 28, blocks began to be placed on the west and south sides of the end of the jetty. In early October, blocks were placed along the east side as well. Work continues through the end of October. This activity is likely to define a dock or quay at the end of the jetty that allows for the unloading of deeper draft vessels. Work also progresses on the coastal highway, connecting the jetty to the rest of the site.

Construction Expands at Nampho Port	Commercial satellite imagery of Nampho Port indicates previously identified work on a ship repair way is part of a much larger project that will significantly upgrade the facility. Nampho, located on the west coast of North Korea, is both the country’s primary ship construction and repair facility and its largest commercial port, known for its coal, petroleum, oil and commercial goods imports and exports. This work on Nampho’s shipbuilding facilities, together with the recent reveal of a new naval base being built on the east coast, appear to be part of larger efforts to upgrade the Korean People’s Navy. Marine Repair Way Construction At the center of the port, construction of a large structure on one of the two marine repair ways has been progressing since September 2023. As of late September 2024, the structure was walled off on four sides, likely to effectively shield construction of shipbuilding work on the repair way from overhead surveillance. On imagery from November 2, a roof or covering is being installed over the top of the structure. The green covering is semi-transparent and possibly a tarp or netting material. As it does not appear sturdy enough to support the weight of a snowfall as winter nears, it is likely just a temporary measure to conceal activity taking place. The structure could possibly become a shipbuilding hall, but the framing and covering differ from other construction halls throughout the country. Measuring 30 meters by 170 meters, the hall would be among the largest in North Korea. White blocks or slabs appear to lay on the lattice gridwork. The blocks are likely being offloaded by a nearby crane barge, lifting the blocks onto the gridwork from the hold of the utility cargo ship next to the crane barge. On the adjacent repair way, a similar grid lattice is also visible. These gridworks may support the staging of component parts for ships under construction. This work appears to be part of efforts to build up the repair ways and could possibly mirror the work being done on its neighbor. Secure Boat Basin In imagery from September 2024, work had begun to fill in the secure boat basin. By November 2, multiple piles had been driven into the riverbed in the basin area and around the end of the other repair way with grid lattice. It appears the entirety of the basin will eventually be filled. East Repair Ways On the east side of the ship repair area, the two ship repair ways are also abuzz with activity. One has a similar grid lattice to that seen on the west side of the site. A white building was constructed between the lattice work and the water in October and November of 2023. While the purpose of the building is unclear, it blocks the path between the repair way and the water. Building Construction A number of new buildings are also being erected near the west repair ways, where land was cleared earlier this year. Their purpose is yet unclear.

North Korean Non-kinetic Attacks: A Problem for Incheon Airport	North Korea has recently engaged in -non-kinetic- forms of provocations against South Korea. These operations include waste-laden balloons, GPS spoofing, electronic jamming and cyberattacks. It has sometimes been difficult for South Korea to identify appropriate countermeasures for these non-kinetic provocations because the Rules of Engagement—set by the United Nations Command, which has monitored and managed crises between the two Koreas since the Armistice Agreement of 1953—have not kept pace with these evolving threats. Recently, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) destroyed the northern sections of the unused road and rail routes linking it with South Korea, seen as a symbolic protest of the hardline policies of the Republic of Korea’s (ROK or South Korea) President Yoon Suk Yeol. On October 31, North Korea launched a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile, dubbed Hwasong-19, from a new 24-wheel mobile launcher. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un declared it was in reaction to the 56th US-ROK Security Consultative Meeting, held in Washington the day before. The ROK intelligence agency said that North Korea may have obtained some critical technical assistance from Russia as a quid pro quo for North Korean involvement in the Ukraine War. These actions have symbolic and political implications both for the ROK and the US, with North Korea aiming to demonstrate that it still poses an intractable threat to the ROK. In recent years, larger physical (kinetic) conflicts have become rare, the most recent being the Yeonpyeong Island naval skirmishes of 1999 and 2002, which also included a North Korean artillery bombardment of the island and then the sinking of ROK Navy (ROKN) corvette, the Cheonan, in 2010. North Korea’s continued psychological warfare, however, increases tensions and is probably a tactic of -escalate to de-escalate- to acquire leverage for later negotiations with South Korea. The situation is also exacerbating South Korean political polarization over North Korea policy, which the regime of Kim Jong Un presumably sees as a win. While some sectors of South Korea’s defense infrastructure are prepared to respond to non-kinetic threats, Incheon Airport—a vital hub for the ROK’s economy and international connectivity—is especially vulnerable. North Korea’s shift toward non-kinetic provocations underscores the need for modernizing security systems and coordination efforts at critical sites such as Incheon Airport. Recent Non-kinetic Attacks Since May 2024, North Korea has been sending hundreds of waste-laden balloons, typically containing plastic bottles and paper, across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). In response, since July 21, the ROK Armed Forces have reinstated an operation in which fixed speakers regularly broadcast messages across the DMZ. Waste balloons have been released at least 20 times and have been found in more than 5,500 locations nationwide. One balloon caught fire after bursting on the rooftop of a residential building in Gyeonggi Province, where Incheon International Airport, South Korea’s main aerial gateway, is located. Just in this province, waste balloons have been discovered in more than 2,000 locations in recent days. The airport has been directly affected by North Korean waste balloons: runway operations have been halted 12 times for a total of 265 minutes. Besides the balloons, North Korea has also increasingly been jamming civil aircraft using Incheon Airport. Broadcasting of false signals, deliberately intended to confuse GPS systems, has been reported 578 times between January and August this year, compared to 39 last year and only 26 in the three years before that. Most of these cases have been traced back to North Korea. Such cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated and are potentially effective against unmanned aerial vehicles operated by US Forces Korea stationed in the South. No major aviation incidents have resulted to date, but GPS interference can endanger commercial airlines flying in poor visibility, and it is a violation of international conventions on navigational safety. Most of the jamming occurred between May 29 and June 2, when hundreds of civilian aircraft and ships reported suspected GPS jamming near the de facto inter-Korean sea border in the West Sea, the Northern Limit Line. The GPS interference sometimes lasted a few minutes and sometimes several hours. The Vulnerability of Incheon Airport Every year, Incheon Airport carries 56 million people and 3.6 million tons of cargo, but it is less than 100 kilometers from North Korea and, therefore, very vulnerable to trash balloons, electronic jamming, and other cyberattacks on flight control systems. Besides electronic jamming of aircraft navigation systems, other forms of cyberattacks are suspected: during the last decade, Incheon Airport has experienced several technical problems that have affected aircraft navigation and air traffic control. Incheon Airport is an important hub connecting East Asia with North America, so many parties could conceivably be responsible, but it is difficult to see how any of them have an interest in disrupting regular flight schedules, except for North Korea. The ROK’s intelligence community has verified that North Korea has conducted frequent cyberattacks and electronic jamming directed against Incheon Airport, and they are seriously concerned about the potential impact on domestic and international aircraft. The unexplained disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 (MH370/MAS370) on March 8, 2014 offers a grim warning of what could happen: the cause remains mysterious, but a cyberattack has not been excluded. Certainly, if a similar unexplained disappearance should occur with an Incheon flight, then a North Korean cyberattack would top the list of possible causes to be investigated. The environment of Incheon Airport is also unusually challenging for search and rescue (SAR) operations, being situated on a muddy island, Yeongjong-do, with a tidal range exceeding 10 meters. This makes it difficult for traditional surface vessels to operate, so the ROK Coast Guard (KCG) and the ROKN have deployed specialized platforms and other equipment. KCG has a number of hovercraft capable of amphibious operations, which can provide an immediate response to any emergency in the vicinity.[1] ROKN also possesses some hydrofoils, which are deployed to Incheon Defense Command, based in Incheon.[2] These are available to support SAR operations in coastal areas near Incheon International Airport, and some joint SAR exercises have been conducted with KCG to build operational experience. Policy Recommendations Such SAR cooperation is essential for an effective response to an aircraft accident near Incheon International Airport, especially now that the recent escalation in North Korean non-kinetic attacks threatens the safety and security of South Korean airspace. KCG is well prepared, but ROKN could improve its monitoring, for example with unmanned aerial vehicles and unmanned surface vessels. It is also essential to coordinate systems and technology between the ROK’s SAR center, the KCG, the ROKN, and various other authorities, including local governments. Given the complexity of this situation, it is recommended that a procedural manual should be created for joint SAR operations near Incheon Airport. A standard operational manual between ROKN and KCG should be established first, which can then be expanded to become the Chungmu emergency plan, encompassing other government and civic organizations. The recent escalation in North Korean electromagnetic jamming and cyberattacks needs to be countered more effectively. The ROK is bidding to host an international cybersecurity conference with representatives from the militaries of 24 countries in the Indo-Pacific region, and collaborative cybersecurity exercises would also be useful. Following the announcement of the ROK’s cybersecurity strategy in February, the ROK National Security Council has drawn up the National Cybersecurity Basic Plan after consulting with 14 government agencies. This plan seeks to secure the ROK’s industrial infrastructure and other facilities against cyber threats, using both defensive and offensive measures. The ROK Ministry of National Defense is working together with various countries to coordinate cybersecurity responses and has joined international partnerships such as Cyber Alliance and Cyber Flag drill. Conclusion North Korean balloons, GPS spoofing, and other non-kinetic attacks have the potential to seriously compromise the safety of Incheon Airport. The worst-case scenario is an airliner crashing in muddy littoral areas where timely SAR operations and cybersecurity would be very challenging. The complexity of the threat from North Korean non-kinetic operations requires whole-of-government measures. Besides South Korean military and security organizations, civil organizations are also working to deal with these challenges, notably the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization. Existing SAR capabilities are not adequate to protect Incheon International Airport from North Korean non-kinetic operations. Multilateral cybersecurity protocols are needed, and the ROK is well-placed to take the lead in developing them.

North Korea Tests New Solid ICBM Probably Intended for MIRVs	On October 31, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK or North Korea) conducted the initial flight test of the new Hwasong-19 (HS-19) solid-propellant intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). Photos show the missile is longer than the North’s first solid ICBM, the Hwasong-18 (HS-18). This explains the increased boost capability shown in the missile’s longer flight time and higher maximum altitude, and thus is not an indication of technological assistance from Russia, as some analysts have speculated. Because the HS-18 can already reach targets throughout the US, the HS-19’s additional boost capability will probably be used to loft heavier payloads. A multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV)-associated probable post-boost vehicle (PBV) was shown in stage-separation photos from the launch released by Pyongyang. One or two more successful flight tests will likely be needed before considering the HS-19 booster ready for deployment, but a MIRV payload would require at least several successful tests over at least a few years to be ready. The most likely reason for developing another solid ICBM with more boost capability than the existing HS-18 is to loft a heavier MIRV payload to a similar range. Deployment of MIRVs on the HS-19 (and probably the larger, liquid-propellant HS-17), in combination with single-RV versions and the HS-18 force, will significantly boost the number of deployed North Korean warheads for a given number of missiles and launchers, increase the number of targets that a surviving missile force can retaliate against after absorbing a first strike, and further complicate the task of allied missile defenses by forcing them to cope with more relatively small objects in the same timeframe. But this potential depends on how the North chooses to allocate its relatively limited nuclear warhead production among many different weapons systems. Information to Date On October 30, it was reported that South Korean military intelligence had detected signs North Korea would soon launch an ICBM, including the placement of a missile and its mobile launcher. The Japanese Ministry of Defense reported the launch of an ICBM-class missile on October 31 from the suburbs of Pyongyang to the northeast, landing in the sea after a flight of about 86 minutes covering some 1,000 kilometers (km) at a maximum altitude of over 7,000 km. South Korea’s military confirmed the launch and impact areas, as well as a highly lofted trajectory. Images in the Japanese media of apparent reentering objects suggested the flight was successful. That same day, the North Korean press announced -an ICBM test-fire,- but provided no further technical information. North Korean media provided further information on November 1, reporting the ICBM was -the latest-type ICBM Hwasongpho-19- (aka Hwasong-19 or HS-19), which flew for 85.93 minutes to a maximum altitude of 7,687.5 km and a distance of 1,001.2 km. Accompanying photos depicted the launch of a three-stage, solid-propellant missile from a canister mounted on an 11-axle road mobile launcher (TEL, or transporter-erector-launcher), and also depicted missile staging, including a photo captioned -third stage separation- of two rocket nozzles remaining on the bottom of the missile’s payload section as the expended third stage falls away. North Korean TV video shows the missile being -cold launched- from its canister on an 11-axle TEL. Analysis The missile. The HS-19’s use of an 11-axle TEL indicates that the new missile is longer than North Korea’s first solid-propellant ICBM, the HS-18, which uses a nine-axle TEL. Initial analyses differ on whether the HS-19 is larger in diameter, as well. Either way, the size increase provides for additional solid propellant to increase the HS-19’s total boost capability—which is consistent with the new missile’s increased flight time (about 13 minutes) and altitude (some 1,100 km altitude) compared to the most recent HS-18 launch on December 18, 2023. Although the increased boost capability could be used to extend the HS-19’s range, the HS-18 can already cover anywhere in the United States from anywhere in North Korea. It is much more likely that the new missile’s increased capability will be used to boost a heavier payload. The payload. In the North Korean photos, the nozzles protruding from the bottom of the payload section, which remained in place after third-stage separation, are consistent with the presence of a PBV, a rocket-powered platform used to maneuver between drop-off locations for MIRVs. The PBV dispenses each reentry vehicle (RV) onto its own discrete trajectory toward a separate target. The payload of a MIRVed missile has to include the weight of the PBV and its propellant, not just that of the multiple RVs, and so a MIRV payload would be a good use for the increased boost capability of the HS-19. We do not know if the apparent PBV in the HS-19 test was operational or a dummy, if it carried actual RVs or payload simulators, if it maneuvered or was used for range extension, or if it released any RVs—although there is no reporting of unusual reentry objects. Although North Korea first mentioned interest in multiple warheads in January 2021 and conducted what it claimed was a MIRV test in June 2024 (that probably failed before RV release), it has yet to successfully demonstrate MIRV capability. The June test used a booster based on the first stage of the HS-16 solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM), which is probably based on the first stage of the HS-18 and, according to North Korea, was intended to release three RVs and a decoy. This may be reflective of the payload intended for the HS-19. The weight of the payloads flown on the HS-18 and HS-19 is unknown. The increased payload capability of the HS-19 would more easily accommodate the 1960s-style heavier, blunter RVs that North Korea probably deploys on its ICBMs to have sufficient confidence they will survive reentry at operational ranges despite the lack of flight testing to such ranges. (All of the North’s ICBM tests to date have been highly lofted, with much shorter ranges than targets in the US.) If the HS-19 is larger in diameter than the HS-18, it would also better accommodate multiple such RVs. Implications No sign of recent Russian assistance. Although some instant commentary attributed the greater performance of the October 31 launch over previous HS-18 launches to the recent receipt of technical assistance from Russia—even to the provision of -a key propellant component that can boost a missile’s engine thrust-—there is no open-source evidence of this occurring. Moreover, the increased performance of the new missile is fully explainable by the increased size of the HS-19, which is itself fully obtainable from the HS-18 technology base that was probably catalyzed some 7-10 years ago. That said, any assistance North Korea has or will obtain from Russia for its ICBM program is a continuing wildcard that could increase the capability, reliability, and/or timeliness of strategic missile developments. More tests to come. The apparent success of the first HS-19 test continues the impressive reliability demonstrated by North Korean solid-propellant ballistic missiles, even as such missiles have gotten larger in diameter and thus more challenging to produce with good quality control. One or two more successful flight tests would probably be sufficient in the eyes of the North Koreans to qualify the HS-19 booster for deployment. However, if the missile has a MIRV payload, this is a demanding technology, and at least several successful payload tests on the HS-19 over at least a few years are likely before North Korea operationally deploys MIRVs. Assistance from Russia could somewhat accelerate the timeline but would not obviate the likely need for at least a few successful MIRV flight tests. Likely to augment rather than replace. According to North Korean media, the HS-19 is intended to be used -along with Hwasongpho-18…as the primary core means in defending the DPRK.- It remains to be seen whether HS-19s carry MIRVs and HS-18s carry single RVs, but except perhaps for the deployment of extremely large, high-yield warheads, the HS-18 has enough range/payload capability to deliver single RVs to any place North Korea might reasonably want to target. North Korea is likely to deploy a mix of MIRV and single RV payloads to cover different missions and use scenarios, to hedge against the potential loss of multiple RVs on a single booster to reliability problems or enemy action, and to help manage the challenges of allocating a relatively limited number of nuclear weapons across a large number and variety of potential delivery systems. Moreover, the HS-19 is likely to share MIRV duty with the large, liquid-propellant HS-17 ICBM. The probable greater payload capability and larger diameter of the latter make it extremely well suited to carry MIRVs—and potentially more RVs and/or decoys per missile than the HS-19. Construction over the past year at North Korea’s key liquid-propellant strategic rocket engine production facility, the Thaesong Machine Factory, is consistent with a continuing role for liquid ICBMs. It will be survivable. Some have contended that the larger size of the HS-19 renders it too visible and too hard to move, imperiling its survivability. Although the length and weight of the HS-19 and its TEL will keep it from using some roads and off-road areas available to smaller North Korean mobile ICBMs, it will still be able to move out of garrison to remote locations and be camouflaged during a pre-war crisis period or in the run-up to any DPRK-initiated crisis or conflict. Once dispersed over hundreds of square miles of wooded terrain, the increased size of the HS-19 would not appreciably increase its detectability. If caught in garrison, even smaller mobile ICBMs would be highly vulnerable; the larger HS-19 is unlikely to be much worse off. As with the probably heavier (when fueled) HS-17, North Korea also has the option of putting the HS-19 on a rail-mobile launcher if it sees the need. What about the 12-axle TEL? Immediately after the October 31 launch, it was speculated that the new missile might have been launched from the new 12-axle TEL revealed in North Korean photos released in September 2024 in conjunction with factory visits by Kim Jong Un. Now that it is clear the HS-19 was launched from an 11-axle TEL (albeit one resembling the 12-axle vehicle rather than the type of 11-axle TEL used with the HS-17), the question remains of what system(s) the 12-axle TEL supports. As noted previously in 38 North, the new TEL could be used with a longer variant of the HS-17 or HS-18 (or now the HS-19), a space-launch vehicle, a space-launch version of an existing ICBM (which would have a longer payload section), or to improve the mobility of the existing HS-17. The Bottom Line The revelation of an apparent PBV on North Korean photos from the HS-19 test is consistent with the use of a MIRV payload. In a few years, with or without additional Russian help, North Korea is likely to complete MIRV development via the requisite flight testing, resulting in an ICBM force with more flexibility, able to cover more targets, and possessing a more robust second-strike capability.

Quick Take: China Marks Up New Customs Area	Commercial satellite imagery indicates China continues to take steps towards completion of a new, modern customs post on its border with North Korea across the New Yalu River Bridge. Work at the facility near Dandong has been ongoing despite no observable preparation on the North Korean side that might signal an imminent opening of the new border crossing. Background The New Yalu River Bridge, a large cable-stayed bridge, was completed ten years ago and has never been used. Work on the Chinese customs area stalled soon after the bridge was completed but resumed in 2022. Since then, new border and customs control points have been constructed and paved, and work continues. Recent Activity Currently, road patterns around the facility are being rerouted, the latest appearing by early October. The first new traffic patterns were painted between early May and mid-June 2024 and repainted in early October as well. Until recently, the road off the bridge bypassed the customs facility and connected directly to the Chinese road network, but now new gates block off direct access and lane markings indicate vehicles will be funneled through checkpoints. While the latest work is another sign that the facility is moving closer to opening, there remains no indication of preparations on the North Korean side. The bridge was not connected to the North Korean road network until 2020, when the highway was completed. At that time, a large area of land adjacent to the road and near the bridge landing was cleared. Although this appeared to be creating space for a new North Korean customs facility, no further progress has been observed.

Quick Take: Large Trenches Across Former Border Links	Commercial satellite imagery shows that two large, well-defined trenches now slice through the land that once carried roads and railways that linked North and South Korea. The work began almost immediately after North Korean troops demolished the border links on October 15. As of October 30, construction continues. West Coast Route (Asian Highway-1) At the west coast crossing, which connected South Korea to the Kaesong Industrial Zone (also written as Kaesong Industrial Complex), a 125-meter-long trench has been dug perpendicular to the road, a few meters past the military demarcation line (MDL) that divides the two countries. The trench measures approximately seven meters wide, and large piles of dirt sit on either side of it. The purpose of the trench and dirt is unclear beyond it being some type of blockade that is intended to sever the transportation links. The mound could be part of the barrier, or it could be a temporary product of the construction work. East Coast Route (Asian Highway-6) The east coast crossing—previously connecting South Korea and the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone—has similarly been bisected by a large trench. Medium-resolution satellite imagery does not reveal the same level of detail as imagery of the AH-1 crossing, but the trench is clear. It is slightly longer at 150 meters and differs from the trench at the west coast crossing in that dirt and land clearance are only observed on one side of the trench. Continued Work Several trucks are still visible at the west coast, indicating that work is not yet complete. As construction efforts continue, we may gain more understanding about the reason for the trench and how North Korea intends to seal these two border crossings.

Quick Take: -The Old SOF Shoe-	Citing an anonymous source, Kyodo News reported that North Korea’s special operations forces (SOF) commander, three-star Colonel General Kim Yong Bok, arrived in Russia on October 24 to assume -command- of Korean People’s Army (KPA) SOF personnel deployed to Russia. His presence in Russia was corroborated and publicized by a Republic of Korea (ROK) delegation briefing NATO officials in Brussels on October 28, in which he was identified as -commander-in-chief&#8221; of KPA forces in Russia. Estimates on the KPA presence in Ukraine have been contradictory, ranging from approximately 3,500 to 10,000, which is one to two KPA SOF brigades. Neither the Russian nor the North Korean government has denied North Korea’s deployment. Prior to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov’s tacit admission of the KPA deployment, Pyongyang (and Ukraine) watchers were relying on a combination of official sanctioned releases and anonymous media leaks. There was incomplete provenance of sources or placement of caveats on the information, such as DPRK personnel finding their way into eavesdropped conversations. There were no analytical hedges, such as positing alternative scenarios like the KPA SOF serving as rear area guards. This creates an effect in which kernels of accurate information, such as North Korea’s largest troop deployment outside the Korean Peninsula since the Vietnam War, are overshadowed by speculation. This brings us to Colonel General Kim Yong Bok’s purported in-country presence in Russia. In March of this year, he was identified as Vice Chief of the KPA General Staff, placing him in the KPA’s high command. By dint of this position, he is Kim Jong Un’s top advisor on light infantry and the SOF. He attended seven of Kim’s public engagements and inspections in 2024, three of which involved SOF exercises, one a live fire artillery drill and two flood reconstruction efforts in North Pyongan Province. The number of disclosed SOF exercises was probably a tell-tale sign that North Korea would deploy some personnel to Russia. One can write off his presence at the artillery drill in the context of his high military command position. However, by publicizing his presence at flood reconstruction work, to which he has no seeming connection (with the hedge that the KPA SOF has construction units which could contribute to such work), Pyongyang was telecasting that their SOF commander has direct, unfettered access to Kim. Characterizing Colonel General Kim Yong Bok as -commander- of KPA forces in Russia is deliberately ambiguous. It would lead many observers to assume that he will take up a field command role. From this perspective, Kim Jong Un is sending one of his best people to personally oversee the deployment. On the other hand, why would Kim subject a reliable, close aide with whom he presumably shares a good rapport into the line of fire? Moreover, three-star colonel generals do not command brigade-sized units. If Colonel General Kim has traveled to Russia, a more sensible interpretation would be that he is supervising the KPA SOF’s transition into the Ukraine theater and consolidating command and control over all KPA assets, including munitions technicians, in the Ukraine theater. He is also probably coordinating with Russian counterparts and creating a reporting framework between deployed personnel and Pyongyang.

North Korea Construction at the East and West Border Crossings	Just over a week since North Korea demolished the two main road and rail links connecting it to South Korea, commercial satellite imagery indicates work has begun on a new border fortification or obstacle where the road and railways once sat. On both the east and west sides of the Korean Peninsula, North Korean soldiers are clearing land and digging wide trenches with what appear to be concrete sides. The nature of the construction is uncertain, but the structures appear similar on each road. Together, they add a level of permanence to the severed cross-border infrastructure. West Coast Crossing The west coast crossing connected South Korea’s Dorasan border station with a North Korean road that led into the Kaesong Industrial Zone (also written as Kaesong Industrial Complex). The crossing is part of the Asian Highway 1 (AH-1), a United Nations-backed highway scheme that connects Tokyo in the east to Turkey in the west. While both South Korea and North Korea are signatories to the Asian Highway plan, driving through North Korea has only ever been theoretically possible. The section inside the demilitarized zone (DMZ) is approximately 4.7 kilometers (km) long and is fenced-in at either end. The South Korean border post is located immediately south of the gate, but the North Korean checkpoint is located one kilometer up the road, just before the Kaesong Industrial Zone. The military demarcation line (MDL) runs through the DMZ approximately 600 meters from the North Korean gate. It is marked by a slight change in the road surface and signs on each side of the line. The South Korean sign declared the beginning of Kaesong City and strikingly included the words -Good bye- in English. A few meters north, just over the MDL, a North Korean site informed the distance to Kaesong City was five km. The road has not regularly been used since the complex was shuttered in February 2016. Fences on either side have meant that, like much of the DMZ, the area rarely receives visitors. Around early December 2023, a series of trenches were dug across the road just north of the South Korean gate. Imagery from February 2024 shows the trenches measuring approximately 180 meters long, running between wooded areas on either side of the road. Their purpose is unclear, although they could be designed to stop traffic from traversing the road. Notably, the trenches appeared weeks before Kim Jong Un delivered his January 2024 speech, deeming South Korea an -enemy state.- However, it is not possible to determine if these two actions are linked. In mid-2024, the trenches appeared to have been filled in with dirt or other aggregate. On October 15, explosives ripped up the inter-Korean road and railway just a few meters north of the MDL. Footage released by the South Korean government shows North Korean workers clearing away the roadway debris using backhoes. The North Korean road sign declaring the distance to Kaesong City was also knocked down. Electrical power lines parallel the road, connecting the North to the South, although they have not transmitted electricity since 2018. It remains to be seen if they will stay in place or also be destroyed. Since the detonation, the excavation work has expanded. Imagery from October 17 shows a 50-meter portion of the roadway has been ripped up, and a trench is being dug across the area where the road and railway used to run. As of October 19, the trench was approximately 4 meters wide by 130 meters long. East Coast Crossing The east coast crossing was used to shuttle visitors from South Korea to the Mt. Kumgang Tourist Zone until tours ended in 2008. Like the west coast route, it has not seen any regular traffic in many years. Notionally, it makes up part of the AH-6 route that is meant to run from Busan, South Korea, to Russia’s border with Belarus. North and South Korea have gates on either side of this section of the DMZ as well, which measures approximately 1.3 kilometers. The MDL lies roughly 300 meters south of the North Korean gate. A single-track railway line runs along the west side of the road. Work also began here in December 2023 when a rectangular, dark brown area appeared on the road on the North Korean side of the MDL. There is no imagery record of what occurred just prior to this December activity, so it cannot be determined whether trenches similar to those on AH-1 had been dug to disrupt this stretch of the road surface. Regardless, the nature of this darkened stretch of road is unclear. The detonation occurred just over the MDL on the North Korean side, as it did on the west coast road. Imagery from October 23 shows similar work is taking place, with road clearance and a 140-meter-long trench dug across the road and railway line. The trench is approximately 5 meters wide. Other Roads There appear to be no recent changes to the roadways at Panmunjom and Arrowhead Hill. The former is required for North Korean vehicles to reach the Joint Security Area, while the latter was reconstructed in 2018 to aid an operation looking for remains of war. Earlier this year, the South Korean government said it had detected North Korean soldiers laying landmines along a portion of the road.
