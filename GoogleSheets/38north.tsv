Kim Jong Un Plots Continued Renewal of Pyongyang	Kim Jong Un’s ambitious plan to build 50,000 new apartments in Pyongyang over a five-year period is entering its final year and appears on track for accomplishing this goal.[1] On February 16, Kim attended a groundbreaking ceremony for the fifth and final stage of the project that has to-date created two entirely new neighborhoods in Pyongyang and redeveloped a third. The final stage of the project will further expand one of those new neighborhoods, the Hwasong District, with an additional 10,000 apartments. Beyond the housing push, Kim also announced an ambitious plan to develop eastern Pyongyang and redevelop three existing districts near the city’s center. Pyongyang’s modernization runs parallel to the rural development initiative and -project for regional development,- two projects that have emphasized the need to improve rural communities. Kim’s latest announcement indicates that the intense push for rural development is not coming at the expense of Pyongyang’s continued modernization. The Final Push in Hwasong The final phase of the five-year Pyongyang housing construction project includes building up the southern end of the Hwasong District, according to renders of the project shown in state media images. The Hwasong District, in northwest Pyongyang, was farmland before development work began in 2022. It currently consists of multiple high-rise apartment buildings, shops and schools clustered around two major roads. The first phase built up along Hwasong Street and the second phase, along Rimhung Street. This third phase appears to continue along Rimhung Street and possibly expand beyond Hwasong District’s boundary. The groundbreaking took place in an area that is currently part of the neighboring Taesong District, making it possible the boundary of Hwasong will be redrawn to include this area. Eastward Development In his speech at the groundbreaking, Kim noted that after the Hwasong development is done, -We plan to implement with serious intent the policy of extending streets of Pyongyang towards Kangdong as the second stage.- Kangdong is a rural district of Pyongyang on the eastern edge of the city that is connected via the four-lane Pyongyang-to-Kangdong Road. Before reaching Kangdong, it runs through Samsok District. Kim appears to have plans for that area too. -As major science research institutes, technology universities, and officers' schools will be built in Taesong District, [we] wish to build tens of thousands of modern houses in the section between the Hwasong area and Samsok District's Songmun-dong,- he said State media did not offer any detailed plans of the development, but it could encompass a sizable area, including large stretches of agricultural land. The goal of this additional project would be to -create another wonderful scientific, cultural and dwelling area in Pyongyang,- said Kim. Central Pyongyang While large parts of Pyongyang have been redeveloped since Kim came to power in late 2011, there are still many neighborhoods of decades-old, single-story houses. -We will transform such culturally backward metropolitan areas and suburbs … thereby eliminating and renovating all the elements unbecoming of the appearance of the capital city in its overall formation,- Kim said. He named three districts: Tungme-dong in Songyo District, Wolhyang-dong in Moranbong District and Hadang-dong in Hyongjesan District. Tungme-dong is an area in southeast Pyongyang. It is near the Songsin and Songhwa developments that were part of the 50,000 apartments plan in 2022. The neighborhood is made up of mostly single-story houses and includes some factories along its southern edge, including the Pyongyang Steel Factory. Wolhyang-dong is immediately northwest of the Arch of Triumph roundabout and already contains a number of high-rise structures, although many are at least 20 years old. Curiously, just north of Wolhyang is Jinhung-dong, a largely residential district of single-story houses that appears to be a less developed area of the city, but hasn’t been mentioned as part of the plan. Hadang-dong is in northwest Pyongyang and includes a large area of single-story housing and an undeveloped area alongside a river. It is also home to the Pyongyang University of Transport and the Railway Research Institute. It is unclear when these newly announced projects will begin. North Korea’s current five-year plan, which included the 50,000 apartment project for Pyongyang, is scheduled to end this year. Commercial satellite imagery does not show any current preparations in the three districts mentioned by Kim, so his announcement could be a preview of his next five-year plan for the capital.

The Shadow of Low Birth Rate in North Korea and Its Implications for the Economy	The correlation between a declining population and a country’s economy is that low birth rates negatively affect labor supply and aggregate demand over time. For this reason, North Korea’s population problem and its potential implications for the economy merit closer study. There are conflicting assessments about North Korea’s population trends. According to UN estimates, North Korea’s population has been in slow decline, suggesting, therefore, that the problem is not as serious as some have feared. However, this author’s own research indicates that the North’s birth rate has fallen much more rapidly than what UN data have shown. Furthermore, various datasets confirm that the continued low birth rate in North Korea has started to take a toll on the country’s labor supply and market activities. Making matters worse, the low birth rate in North Korea is accelerating the aging of the population. If these two trends continue, the country is highly likely to witness a vicious cycle of a further decline in economic vitality that in turn results in an even greater population problem. To understand the broader trends of the North Korean economy, it is necessary to closely monitor the future trends of the country’s demographics and the Kim government’s response to the population issue. The Problem According to the United Nation Population Fund (UNFPA), the sole statistical agency on North Korea’s birth rate, the country’s declining population does not appear to be a serious issue. The UN’s -World Population Prospects 2024- estimates that the country’s birth rate has slowly declined from 2.17 in the 1990s and 1.92 in the 2000s, to 1.86 in the 2010s. In addition, this same dataset shows that the total number of births per year in North Korea already surpassed those of South Korea in 2018. These UN statistics have led several South Korean researchers to publish studies noting that South Korea could enjoy a population bonus in case of Korean unification.[1] However, several scholars, including Eberstadt , question the reliability of the UN’s North Korean population statistics.[2] Furthermore, Lee and Kim measured North Korea&#8217;s total fertility rate based on interviews with North Korean defectors, which tended to contradict the UN statistics.[3] According to our study, North Korea’s total fertility rate fell much faster than the UN estimates, from 1.91 in the 1990s to 1.59 in the 2000s, and 1.38 in the 2010s. Meanwhile, South Korea’s total fertility rate stood at 1.15 in the 2010s. If it is true that both Koreas’ birth rates are low, the possibility of North Korea’s total number of births per year exceeding that of South Korea’s will converge to zero. This means the population bonus for South Korea would not be that great even if North and South were to unify. Low birth rates affect labor supply and aggregate demand over time. Various datasets confirm that the continued low birth rate in North Korea has started to have a negative impact on labor supply and market activities, such as forcing women to go back to work and diminishing the vitality of the market. The population trend estimates based on North Korea’s total fertility rate as measured by Lee and Kim are the main source of data for this paper. This paper also draws on North Korean defector testimonials, North Korean laws and regulations, and reports from North Korean-run media outlets. The 2010s: Low Birth Rates Help to Raise Living Standards It is assumed that the decline in North Korean married couples’ total fertility rate is mainly due to the Arduous March in the 1990s and the ensuing major changes in the country’s economic structure. Among those born in the 1970s who reached the marriageable age during the Arduous March, those engaged as retailers in the jangmadang markets increased significantly in number. In addition to the poor childbirth conditions of these markets, retailers risked losing customers to competitors when they returned after childbirth due to intensifying competition in the markets. This resulted in a further decline in the fertility rate. In the 2010s, low birth rates mainly had a positive effect on living standards. Living conditions began to improve as the average number of children per household decreased to one or two. In contrast to the stagnation of GDP in the 2010s, the indicators of living standards for households showed a marked improvement during this decade. In particular, according to North Korean Social Change 2012-2020, published by the Institute for Peace and Unification Studies (IPUS) at Seoul National University, access to better food increased significantly during those years. That study said the number of households with rice as their staple food increased from 48 percent in 2011-2014 to 79 percent in 2018-2020, and the number of households that consumed meat at least once a week went up from 34 percent in 2011-2014 to 58 percent in 2018-2020. Clothing consumption also improved significantly in the 2010s, according to this author’s interviews with North Korean defectors in 2024. Defectors who had experience working in clothing retail in North Korean markets testified that overall sales decreased only slightly despite a drop in sales volume, as high-end products sold well. They also said children preferred branded clothes and parents with only one child were generally willing to buy such clothing for their children. A North Korean defector who lived in South Pyongan Province and defected in 2019, for example, testified that adolescents mainly wore Adidas gym clothes, which they called -leaf-shaped gym clothes.- In addition, a significant number of adolescents joining the Socialist Patriotic Youth League since the 2010s purchased expensive red ties as part of their required uniform. In terms of housing conditions, the residential area per person appears to have increased, particularly for adults. Housing construction in North Korea had been sluggish since the Arduous March, and the average space of residential housing remained the same. However, the space per adult seems to have increased significantly due to a decline in the number of children per household. According to this author&#8217;s estimates, the living space of adults aged 20 and older increased by nearly 10 percent in 2017 compared to 2007.[4] The Mid-2010s: Early Signs of Negative Impact—Decrease in Military Service Manpower Low birth rates began to have a negative impact only in the latter half of the 2010s. North Korea’s military service recruitment department appears to have been the first to be affected, when those born in the 1990s reached the age of military service. As noted above, North Korea’s birth rate fell during the Arduous March in the 1990s. As a result, the pool of those eligible for military service—generally 17- to 26-year-olds—had shrunk significantly by the mid-2010s. In North Korea, people enlist in the military, continue on to college, or get a job starting at the age of 17, after graduating from high school. In response to the manpower shortages in the military, the North Korean authorities in the late 2010s reportedly lowered the eligibility criteria for military service, including height, and changed the military recruitment system from a volunteer system to a de facto conscription system. Reflecting this, Article 12 of the Youth Education Guarantee Act enacted in 2021 stipulates that -youths must actively volunteer for the People’s Army.- Article 41 of the same law also prescribes that early marriage or unfair physical examinations for the purpose of avoiding military service are prohibited. The author surveyed North Korean defectors about their relatives and acquaintances and found that approximately 5 percent of women born in the 1970s served in the military. However, more than 10 percent of women born in the 1990s are estimated to have served in the military. The number of women joining the military is reportedly increasing over time. The 2020s: Low Birth Rate Starts Having a Visible Impact Neither North Korea’s total population nor its working-age population declined throughout the 2010s. There was, however, a change only in the population structure by age group: the youth segment decreased. It appears, therefore, that neither the negative impact of the low birth rate nor the North Korean authorities&#8217; positive measures to combat this problem manifested themselves. However, it is estimated that the North’s total population and the working-age population have begun to decline in earnest since 2020. In particular, according to Lee and Kim , North Korea&#8217;s working-age population is estimated to have been in decline by nearly 1 percent annually since 2020. Labor Shortages in Production Sites The negative ramifications of the low birth rate most clearly showed in the form of labor shortages in production sites such as farms and mines. In response, the North Korean authorities began to force young adults to apply for jobs in agriculture and mining, which are labor-intensive industries. For example, according to a 2021 report by the North Korea-specialty website Daily NK, thousands of young adults across the country were forced to -volunteer- to work in cooperative farms and mines. In addition to mobilizing large numbers of youth to farms, mines, and other labor-intensive industries, the North has attempted to address labor shortages by stepping up married women’s labor participation. North Korean Party instructions and ministries’ regulations on labor stipulate that women are exempt from labor obligations after marriage. However, since the emphasis of women’s labor at the Fifth National Conference of Mothers in December 2023, married women have begun to volunteer to work at production sites. The North Korean Party daily Rodong Sinmun in November 2024 reported that more than 79,000 women had entered the workforce since the beginning of the year. In the past, married women were mobilized only to construction sites, but now they are mobilized to production sites such as factories and mines as well. The widened scope of mobilization may be related to the first appointment of a woman as the director of the Workers’ Organizations Department of the Workers Party of Korea in July 2024. Stagnation in Jangmadang Markets North Korea’s increased crackdown on jangmadang and foreign currency shortages are often attributed to the decline in market activity, but these are short-term factors. According to this author’s interviews with defectors, the long-term cause is population decline. Aggregate demand across the North Korean economy appears to have fallen since the 2020s due to a decline in the total population, leading to stagnation in markets. A North Korean economic research firm, NKID, estimated that North Korea’s market sales in 2024 had not bounced back to pre-COVID levels.[5] According to this author’s interviews with North Korean defectors, some merchants are said to be finding other jobs such as herb picking or gold digging in addition to their normal sales activities in markets. In particular, North Korean markets are losing their vitality as the number of people in their 20s and 30s is shrinking. This age group’s role in markets is quite important for two reasons. First, wholesalers and retailers in their 20s and 30s have physical stamina, which means they can actively interact with producers in distant areas to develop new items and also supply products to remote areas. Second, people in their 20s and 30s tend to be innovative, and thus they can provide creative services. For example, in the case of electronic product sales, repair services are often provided; in the case of heavy products, delivery services are often offered once products have been sold. A decline in the number of people in their 20s and 30s, who play a pivotal role in keeping up the diversity and creativity of products in the markets, appears to be a key factor causing the markets to stagnate. Conclusion The negative impact of the rapidly declining birth rate in North Korea since the Arduous March is already visible in labor supply and markets. Accordingly, the North Korean authorities took issue with the declining birth rate at the Fifth National Conference of Mothers in December 2023 and have since introduced various policies to address this issue. The Childcare Act, enacted in February 2022, obliges the state to provide free dairy products to children.[6] The Housing Act, revised in January 2023, requires municipal and county administrative committees to give priority to housing for families with multiple children.[7] According to a North Korean defector who lived in Pyongyang and defected in 2019, the authorities had already rolled out a policy in the late 2010s that required people to have at least two children to become administrative officials. In addition, the low birth rate in North Korea, which has continued for a long time, is now accelerating the aging of the population. According to this author&#8217;s estimate, North Korea is expected to enter into an aging society, with more than 14 percent of its population being 65 or older by 2025. If these trends continue, North Korea will likely face a vicious cycle in which the low birth rate and an aging population will cause a further decline in economic vitality, which in turn, will further aggravate the low birth rate and aging population problems. Monitoring these demographic trends and North Korea’s responses will be critical to understanding the country’s economic potential.

Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center: Snowfall Shows Activity	Commercial satellite imagery of North Korea’s Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center indicates activity is ongoing throughout the site. Recent snowfall provided a short period to observe activity, based on snow melt. Intermittent smoke at the thermal plant of the Radiochemical Laboratory (RCL), discharge from the 5 MWe Reactor and Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR), and snow melt at the Uranium Enrichment Plant (UEP) and throughout the uranium conversion complex suggest efforts to fulfill Kim Jong Un’s orders to expand fissile material production for the country’s nuclear weapons program are proceeding. Radiochemical Laboratory Work has continued to repurpose a small compound located approximately 0.5 km northeast of the RCL and just southwest of the never-completed 50 MWe Reactor that has been associated with military construction brigades; its potential new purpose is yet unclear. Imagery from early December 2024 revealed more than 40 holes had been dug in the courtyard of the compound, laid out in a grid-like pattern. An additional 100 or so holes were dug in a small field just east of the compound. These holes were squared-off, measuring approximately 1.5 m x 1.5 m. On imagery from January 31, the roof of the long building separating the two sets of holes had been removed. By February 9, the building was completely razed, along with two others at the compound. By February 22, a rectangular excavation alongside one of the series of holes had appeared. Machinery can be seen operating in between the two sets of holes. The squared holes may serve as footings for pillars to support two new buildings or one larger building with solid foundations, as observed in similar construction processes. A new series of smaller holes, measuring approximately 0.5 m in diameter, had been dug around the compound’s perimeter by February 9. By February 22, a solid wall had been built around the complex, resembling that encompassing the RCL and suggesting greater security for the facility. Possible propaganda placards have been placed along sections of the wall. The road connecting this facility to Building 500—a suspected radioactive waste storage facility—was laden with tracks in the snow on January 31, indicating some level of activity. Workers were also observed on the access road on that date. In the same image, two cargo trucks are seen parked along the access road to the RCL’s spent fuel receipt building. One of these trucks has a red cab, such as the type of truck often observed at the 5 MWe Reactor. By February 9, the vehicles had departed, and by February 22, another two appeared. Thermal (Steam) Plant On imagery from January 30 and January 31, smoke was observed emanating from the thermal plant located to the south of the RCL. The roof had a patch free of snow, and coal dust residue was observed between the coal crushing building and the thermal plant, indicating traffic and activity in both buildings. By February 9, satellite imagery revealed that the emissions stopped. Smoke was observed again on February 22, along with steam emissions at the RCL. Past indications of spent fuel reprocessing and plutonium extraction at the RCL have been continuous smoke from the thermal plant and emissions from the RCL for several weeks at a time. Since major renovations to the thermal plant were completed around July 2024, smoke has only been observed intermittently. While a pattern of intermittent smoke emissions does not indicate that a reprocessing cycle has begun, it may mean a lower-level activity is taking place, such as radioactive waste processing or preparation for a reprocessing campaign, which is preceded by the transfer of chemicals to the process area. Reactor Area 5 MWe Reactor Imagery from January 31 reveals that the rooftops of the 5 MWe Reactor’s main reactor building and turbine generator are free of snow and steam vapor can be seen emanating from the turbine generator building. The adjacent spent fuel storage building also shows signs of snow melt due to heat from the spent fuel likely discharged during the mid-October 2024 shutdown of the reactor. Water discharge is observed from the 5 Mwe Reactor discharge point on imagery from January 31 through February 22. All observed signatures indicate that the reactor is operating again after the shutdown. ELWR The roofs of the ELWR reactor building and turbine generator building are clear of snow. Heavy warm water discharge is seen emanating from the ELWR discharge point on imagery from both January 31 and February 9. These signatures have been observed with few interruptions since November 2023, and likely indicate preoperational testing and certification, including running and testing the reactor, steam generators, and turbine-generators. Whether or not fuel has already been loaded for testing cannot be concluded from imagery alone. Snow melt is also observed on the roof of the high bay structure adjacent to the ELWR and the pump house associated with the ELWR. Winter ice in the Kuryong River seems to be stressing the overflow dam just south of the ELWR pump house. Imagery from late January and early February indicate sections of the dam have been breached, allowing the flow of too much water. As a stopgap measure, an earthen dam has been constructed. Uranium Enrichment Plant Previous reporting observed that renovation work at the UEP and uranium conversion facilities appeared complete, given the removal of support materials and equipment located around the complex. However, the purpose of changes made inside these facilities during that construction period is unknown. Imagery from January 31 shows snow melt at multiple buildings within the complex. Notably, there is only snow melt on Hall 1 of the centrifuge building, suggesting that Hall 2 is either not operating or has better isolation. Two buildings south of the uranium conversion area constructed in 2023, were secured with fencing in the spring of 2024. The purpose of these buildings is unclear, but their isolation within the Yongbyon complex is unusual. The western building is free of snow, indicating some kind of operations are taking place inside. Snow melt can also be seen on the roofs of the suspected Isotope Production Plant, indicating some operations are taking place inside as well.

Quick Take: First Look at North Korea’s Airborne Early Warning Aircraft	North Korea appears close to completing its first airborne early warning aircraft (AEW)—a significant upgrade for an air force that has not seen new airborne capabilities in years. Commercial satellite imagery shows an Ilyushin IL-76 aircraft parked alongside a maintenance hangar at Pyongyang’s Sunan International Airport, with a large radome mounted on top of the fuselage. The radome has a distinctive triangle design on top, similar to what is seen on some Chinese AEW aircraft, but not used on US or Russian aircraft. For Chinese aircraft, the triangle signifies the placement of three non-rotating phased array radars arranged to cover 120-degree sectors. This could indicate support or influence from China, although the triangle alone is not conclusive proof. Timeline The aircraft was one of three IL-76s previously used by North Korea’s national airline, Air Koryo, on cargo routes. It was moved into the maintenance facility in October 2023, and almost immediately thereafter a security fence was erected around the aircraft. In November 2023, work began in a section on top of the fuselage. Conversion to an AEW was suspected, but had not been confirmed until now. Work continued throughout 2024 and in November the aircraft—without the radome—was moved into the adjacent hangar. It remained there until late February 2025, when it appeared outside the hangar with the radome mounted. To date, North Korean state media has not disclosed the project.

Kim Jong Un’s 20×10 Project Achieves Year One Successes	North Korea’s push to modernize its regional industry and geographically diversify its production base is off to a strong start. Just over a year since Kim Jong Un first announced the -20&#215;10- plan, new factories producing clothing, food and household goods have opened in 20 cities across the country, and work has already begun on the second year of the initiative’s construction projects. This article is the first in a series that will examine the 20&#215;10 plan and its role in the overall regional development narrative in North Korea, delving into the locations of the newly-built facilities, what they are producing, and what is known to-date about the second phase of the initiative. The 20x10 Plan The 20x10 plan, announced at the Tenth Session of the 14th Supreme People’s Assembly in January 2024, seeks to build regional production bases in 20 cities a year for the next ten years. The objective, as Kim Jong Un bluntly put it, is to -eliminate the century-old backwardness of regions,- and came with a bold promise to raise -the basic material and cultural living standards of the people in all cities and counties and … across the country within ten years.- Kim said the plan represented -another gigantic change and revolution, not just empty words.- The 20x10 plan was launched as the nation was in the midst of two other major development projects: the initiative to bring 50,000 new apartments to Pyongyang between 2021 and 2025, and an ongoing campaign to replace outdated and dilapidated rural housing with modern, new homes. If distributed evenly over the next ten years, the 20x10 project should mean every county in North Korea gets at least one new factory or facility. Project Origins The inspiration for the project can be traced back to heavy flooding that hit several regions of North Korea in August 2020. Among the areas most affected included Kimhwa Country in Kangwon Province, where almost a meter of rain fell. According to North Korean state media, over 1,000 houses were destroyed, and the infrastructure was badly damaged. Kim Jong Un visited the site in October of that year, shortly after the disaster, to guide the reconstruction. While he was there, he called for the modernization of local industrial facilities to help the local economy and improve people’s lives. By the end of 2020, people were moving into new houses in Kimhwa, but it wasn’t until June 2022 that new factories were inaugurated. Four were built: a food factory, clothing factory, daily goods factory and a paper mill. Kim revisited Kimhwa in February 2024, about three weeks after announcing the 20x10 plan, reportedly to -learn once again about the modernization and management of the regional-industry factories.- While positive on the impact the factories were having, Kim criticized the design and layout and said -considerable mistakes- were made in the architectural design and that they were not practical. -He gave detailed instructions on the design of industrial buildings,- state media reported. Groundbreaking On February 29, 2024, the regional development project moved from the planning to the construction phase when a groundbreaking ceremony was held in Songchon. Kim Jong Un attended the ceremony and spoke to hundreds of local residents and soldiers, who were charged with building the factories. Construction and Opening Throughout 2024, construction projects sprung up in 20 locations across the country, resulting in new factories in every province except for Rason and Pyongyang. Kim visited several of the sites during the year. In November 2024, he returned to Songchon and, likely much to the relief of local party leaders, was satisfied with the area’s progress. On December 20, Kim made his third announced trip to the site to inaugurate the factories. Hundreds of local residents attended the ceremony and looked around the three factories, charged with production of food, clothing and daily necessities. While Kim has not reportedly attended other openings, similar inauguration ceremonies were held at the other 19 currently-completed sites with the most recent taking place on February 11, 2025, in Kim Hyong Jik, Ryanggang province. With that ceremony, the first year of the 20x10 plan was declared an initial success. But further tasks lie ahead for each of the factories if the plan is to be a long-term success. The factories need to ensure sufficient supply of raw materials and maintain quality levels if production and demand for the goods continues. Kim outlined both issues in several speeches during 2024 but did not offer any solutions, instead saying the responsibility was up to local party officials. -If the factories fail to run on a normal footing owing to shortage of raw and other materials or any other problems after their production buildings have been set up in a splendid way and equipped with modern facilities, it will be a crime before the Party and the state, the people and the soldier builders,- he said at the Songchon groundbreaking. We will examine the 20 sites and factories in more depth in subsequent installments of this series. Future Plans While the 2024 projects were focused solely on factories, there is greater diversity among the planned (to date) 2025 locations.

Quick Take: Sinpo-C Class Submarine Leaves Drydock	Commercial satellite imagery indicates North Korea’s newest ballistic missile submarine (SSB), the Sinpo-C (Hero Kim Kun Ok), has left the drydock after an extended period. First moved to the drydock in mid-May 2024, a protective covering was built in July, and both the submarine and the covering were shifted to the south end of the drydock in late November, where it remained until recently. Imagery shows the Sinpo-C left the drydock sometime after February 11. On imagery from February 18, the drydock is empty, and the submarine had returned to the shipyard’s secure boat basin. The Sinpo-C&#8217;s stern portion is just visible, peeking out from under the awning. The Sinpo-B class submarine is tied up along the outboard side of the Sinpo-C. On imagery from February 11, a mobile crane and a vehicle were present on the quay. By February 18, the crane and vehicle were gone and all other vessels had been removed from the basin. The purpose of these movements is unclear, but may suggest that the fitting-out period is complete.

North Korea’s Military Intervention in Kursk: A High Casualty Learning Curve	On February 8, North Korea’s (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK) Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un issued his strongest statement of support yet for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. By vowing to -invariably support and encourage the just cause of the Russian Army,- Kim implicitly acknowledged North Korea’s direct participation in the Ukraine War. Kim’s comments followed warnings from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that Russia-North Korea cooperation would continue to expand and reports that a second wave of North Korean force deployments to Russia’s Kursk region was imminent. While it appears as if North Korea is staying the course, its military performance thus far should give it room for pause. During the first three months after their arrival in October 2024, North Korea lost 40 percent of its 11,000-strong force contingent. An estimated 1,000 of those troops perished while 3,000 more were too severely injured to continue fighting. Presumably due to these staggering rates of attrition and urgent needs for additional training, North Korean troops were noticeably absent in Kursk in mid-January. North Korea’s heavy casualties can be attributed to their unfamiliarity with high-intensity frontline combat, technological shortcomings and morale crises. Despite this troika of countervailing forces, North Korea’s security partnership with Russia will likely continue to strengthen. While much attention is paid to potential Russian assistance to North Korea’s weapons of mass destruction (WMD) capabilities, aid to its conventional forces could be much more consequential. The Challenges Afflicting North Korea’s Military Performance in Kursk Despite mounting evidence of high North Korean casualties in Kursk, Russian officials and state-aligned commentators have engaged in a systematic deny-and-deflect campaign. Shortly after North Korean forces arrived on the frontline, State Duma Deputy Konstantin Zatulin accused Zelensky of invoking the North Korean -bogeyman- to scare the West into providing additional support to Ukraine. Russian ultranationalist commentator Kirill Fedorov attacked reports that North Korean supplied Russia with multiple-launch rocket systems (MLRS) disguised as ordinary trucks and called them -shamefully done- fakes of -practically static objects.- North Korea augmented this cover up by telling families of dispatched soldiers that they were participating in military exercises. As these denials were increasingly implausible, some Russian commentators made a complete 180-degree-pivot and hailed the purported battlefield successes of North Korean troops. Russian ultranationalist media outlet Tsargrad hailed North Korea’s delivery of camouflaged MLRS systems and claimed that it learnt from innovations by Iran-aligned militias in Iraq and Syria. Russian commentators rushed to congratulate North Korean troops for their triumph over Ukraine in Plekhovo. War correspondent Vladimir Romanov described the North Korean victory in especially propagandistic terms, declaring -They passed through like a hurricane, did not take prisoners. The enemy lost more than 300 servicemen,- and boasting that North Korean Special Operations Forces won in two hours. This narrative of North Korean military strength is detached from realities on the ground. Since the 1950-1953 Korean War, North Korean forces have been deployed to a wide range of combat theatres. These include North Vietnam, Egypt during the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, Syria during the post-2011 civil war and African countries like Angola, Mozambique and Zimbabwe. In these battlefields, North Korean troops have served as force multipliers for local militaries, provided specialized military training and engaged in aerial operations as fighter pilots. The North Korean Storm Corps that were deployed to Kursk are trained to infiltrate and conduct sabotage operations behind enemy lines. This experience, while valuable, does not equate with modern offensive warfare. This discrepancy has caused North Korean troops in Kursk to fall back to antiquated Korean War-era offensive techniques. Konoval Ihor Ihorovych (aka Sahara), the commander of the reserve group of the 4th Company of Ukraine’s 33rd Assault Regiment, quipped that North Korean forces would charge forward from tree lines -like in a World War II movie.- Due to their lack of experience in modern warfare, North Korean troops were unprepared for Ukraine’s extensive utilization of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in Kursk. When UAVs moved in their direction, North Korean forces reportedly formed groups of threes to foil their path. Via this trio formation, one North Korean soldier would lure the drone in his direction in the hopes of stopping its advance and his compatriots would attempt to shoot the drone down. This logistically clumsy strategy to shoot down UAVs yielded disastrous results. On December 23, Ukraine’s Special Operations Forces claimed that they killed 77 North Korean troops and injured 40 more in the battle of Kurshchyna. Ukrainian UAV operators have also recorded a friendly fire exchange as North Korean troops frantically sought to shoot down UAVs. As North Korean forces were overwhelmed by mechanized warfare, they were implored by their commanders to engage in high-risk missions. On December 27, White House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby claimed that North Korea were using -human wave tactics- in Kursk. Kirby highlighted incidences of North Korean forces engaging in offensive operations when there were no apparent indicators of success. To expedite the military momentum of Russian troops, North Korean personnel have been sacrificed as -human mine detectors.- These tactics caused the Institute for the Study of War to conclude that North Korea’s entire 11,000-strong contingent would have been obliterated by April without a drawdown or strategic transformation. North Korea’s Capacity for Tactical Adaptations on the Battlefield Due to the underwhelming performance of their forces in Kursk, familiar tropes about the North Korean military have resurfaced. The most pronounced stereotypes are that North Korean troops are too brainwashed and inflexible to become more potent frontline combatants. Kirby linked North Korea’s reliance on human wave tactics to ideological indoctrination. Aside from the highly-trained Storm Corps, some North Korean troops sent to Kursk were farm and construction workers who have been exposed to state propaganda since childhood. A devotion to service to the Supreme Leader, which detaches them from familial obligations, drives North Korean forces to fight in a far-off land. This ideological fanaticism triggers seemingly irrational actions on the battlefield and reinforces a totalitarian command structure. Ukrainian servicemen have vividly described how North Korean troops opt to self-immolate with grenades to evade capture. This dashed Ukraine and South Korea’s churlish optimism that psychological warfare could lead to mass battlefield defections. Ihorovych recounted how North Korean forces shuttled inexplicably between buildings as the Ukrainian military fired artillery barrages at them from 500 meters away. Despite this supporting evidence, are these stereotypes about the North Korean army accurate? A closer examination suggests that they are dangerous oversimplifications. North Korean forces have a degree of resilience that cannot be explained by indoctrination and adaptability that defies the stereotype of command structure rigidity. Even though North Korean troops undergo rigorous training in mountainous terrain that does not resemble Kursk, that experience provides them with a high degree of physical fitness. Ukrainian Armed Forces spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Yaroslav Chepurnyi has also extolled the small arms capabilities of North Korean forces. Yuriy Bondar, a Ukrainian soldier from the 80th Separate Airborne Assault brigade, declared -compared to the soldiers of the DPRK, Wagner mercenaries circa 2022 are just children.- North Korean forces have made numerous command structure shifts since entering Kursk. They have established observation posts to more effectively pre-empt Ukrainian UAV strikes. By congregating in small units of 20-30 forces and advancing in units of six at a time, North Korean forces can stealthily carry out military operations. Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence agency chief Vadym Skybytskyi acknowledges this tactical transformation. Skybytskyi anticipates that the next tranche of North Korean forces will perpetuate it and enhance their UAV capabilities. How Russia will Help Enhance North Korea’s Combat Capabilities After North Korean forces arrived in Kursk, they swiftly found themselves fighting as subordinates to Russian commanders. This role did not go to plan. Aside from recordings of racist language from Russian soldiers to North Korean troops, the food shortages and logistical challenges that impeded Russia’s war in Ukraine undermined the efficacy of North Korean forces. In early December, Russian Major General Mevlutov provided emergency redistributions of rations from Russia’s 111th Separate Air Assault Brigade to North Korean troops. Russia’s attempts to showcase its military technology also failed, as North Korean forces were often better-equipped than their Russian commanders. Despite these travails, there are still gaps in North Korea’s conventional military capabilities that Russia is well-equipped to fill. After North Korea expressed alarm about South Korea’s alleged ability to drop propaganda leaflets on its territory, Russia shipped anti-air missiles to Pyongyang. Building on its conversion of Iranian Shahed drones into domestically mass-produced Geran-2s, Russia is reportedly helping North Korea ramp up its UAV production. The Russian military’s enhancement of the precision of KN-23/Hwasong-11Ga ballistic missile strikes, which can be fired from 500 miles away, has overwhelmed Ukraine’s air defence systems. This advance provides a valuable advantage for North Korean forces. These contributions, which are paired with grain and hard currency deliveries, torpedo the United Nations sanctions regime against North Korea and leave Pyongyang better equipped for a future conventional war in Northeast Asia. While Ukraine can claim victory over the first tranche of North Korean forces, the war is far from over. Through tactical innovations and enhanced Russian assistance, North Korea is accruing critical combat experience. As President Donald Trump seeks out a path to re-engage with North Korea on regulating its nuclear weapons program, the US must pay equal attention to the expansion of Pyongyang’s conventional weapons capabilities.

North Korea Leaving Maneuvering Room with the US While Preparing for Long-Term Confrontation	North Korea’s (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK) public messaging in recent years has been unequivocally and consistently clear that it will not give up its nuclear weapons and instead, will continue to strengthen its capabilities. This was perhaps most vividly demonstrated by Kim Jong Un’s unprecedented visits to nuclear-material production facilities and the Nuclear Weapons Institute (NWI) in September 2024 and in January 2025.[1] The nuclear signaling aligns with Pyongyang’s renunciation of its three-decade policy centered on normalizing bilateral diplomatic ties with the United States by working toward denuclearization. What is less clear is whether the re-election of Donald Trump as US President may impact Pyongyang’s tactics toward Washington. North Korean media’s unusually brief readout of the annual year-end Party plenary meeting in 2024 offered limited insight into the country’s foreign policy outlook for 2025.[2] Its mention of a -strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction- seemed to point to more or less the same policy, but not much else. As expected, official statements and media commentaries following the party plenum have helped to fill some of the void. They suggest that Pyongyang is leaving room for diplomatic maneuvering if it wishes to reengage the Trump administration, while continuing on a path of a -long-term confrontation- with the United States. Creating Space for Diplomatic Maneuverability &#8230; If the lack of details in North Korea’s latest party plenum report was intended to create some room for diplomatic maneuvering vis-à-vis the new Trump administration, there have been a trail of signs that would seem to support that assessment. First, the North’s January 22 coverage of Trump’s inauguration—and belated acknowledgement of his election—marked a shift from its initial decision to remain silent on the US presidential election outcome in November. Moreover, this report was carried in media outlets targeting the domestic public as well as external audiences, suggesting North Korea has started priming its people for reengagement with Trump if and when appropriate. Second, despite the steady stream of official statements and media commentaries criticizing the United States, North Korea’s anti-US rhetoric has softened since early December 2024. Notably, the North’s use of -the US imperialists- has since decreased significantly. This is true for Kim’s public remarks as well, which are regarded as the most authoritative in North Korea. For instance, Kim’s speech at the Defense Ministry on February 8 was the toughest on and the most detailed about the United States since his speech at a national defense exhibition in November 2024. However, unlike in his multiple past speeches at defense-related locations or events, he did not use derogatory terms such as -the US imperialists.- In fact, Kim’s last reported use of the term -the US imperialists- was his defense exhibition speech last November. While there has been an uptick in criticism of the United States since early February, as shown by a series of -KCNA commentary- pieces, the broader trend from December still holds. Third, North Korean media have refrained from mentioning Trump by name, even when being critical of US statements or actions. When criticism has been issued, it has referred only to -the new US administration- or -the present administration.-[4] The February 12 -KCNA commentary- on the Gaza Strip, for example, blamed the -present US administration- for the plan to take over Gaza, omitting Trump’s name. These pieces were all carried by media outlets targeting the domestic public, probably because they addressed foreign policy issues that are not directly relevant to North Korea. By contrast, the North Korean Foreign Ministry’s criticism of Rubio’s -rogue state- remark was carried only on external websites and was withheld from the domestic audience. This enabled Pyongyang to go on record as rebuffing the remarks to external audiences, while controlling the narrative about the Trump administration at home. Pyongyang also seems to be creating diplomatic space by attempting to influence Washington’s thinking as it awaits the Trump administration’s new North Korea policy. Its Defense Ministry said the United States was -openly ignoring the security concern of the DPRK- in reference to a US nuclear-powered submarine entering a South Korean port, an unusually direct accusation of the United States -ignoring- its security concerns. When we consider the flip side of this message—do not ignore North Korea’s security concerns—this is in effect Pyongyang’s call on the new administration to factor its -security concerns- into its policy on North Korea. … But Let Us Not Be Mistaken Despite these signals, there is not yet evidence that North Korea intends to change its nuclear policy or its policy on the United States. As noted at the outset of this article, North Korea remains consistently clear that it will continue to bolster its defense capabilities. Kim Jong Un’s latest public remarks, including a -strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction- at the December 2024 party plenum, a -nuclear response posture without limits- at the NWI in January, and the North’s -unshakable policy of more highly developing the nuclear forces- at the Defense Ministry in February, only reaffirm that the country’s preparations for a long-term confrontation with Washington continue.[5] Perhaps more important is that North Korea’s thinking on the very essence of the United States and its longer-term relationship with Washington may be evolving. Despite its brevity, there was one passage in the 2024 year-end Party plenum report that was particularly interesting: -… the U.S. is the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy…- The unusual connection between the United States and -anti-communism-—-imperialist- would be the typical association—is significant because since 2021, North Korea has consistently presented communism as North Korea’s ultimate destination.[6] This passage alone, without further context, would seem to imply that the two countries are fundamentally incompatible in their goals and values, going beyond North Korea’s decades-long US -hostile policy- complaint. This is not necessarily an ideological issue. It could be something more practical, such as North Korea and the United States belonging to two opposing blocs. Looking Ahead While North is clearly in no hurry to engage the Trump administration, it has started to create some wriggle room for diplomatic maneuvering. However, we should not expect Pyongyang to change its strategy toward the United States. The key factors that led to the fundamental shift in North Korea’s US policy—Kim’s lesson learned from the Hanoi summit’s collapse that North Korea-US relations are in for a -long-term confrontation,- and intensifying great-power competition—remain intact. In fact, burgeoning Pyongyang-Moscow relations and North Korea’s changed perception of its own self on the global stage make it even less likely that its strategy toward the United States will take a positive turn in the foreseeable future. Kim’s strong show of support for the Russian war against Ukraine in his recent speech at the Defense Ministry underlines the complexities of the situation. Keep in mind, this is also the final year for North Korea to complete the comprehensive -five-year plan- presented at the Eighth Party Congress in January 2021. That means Pyongyang will prioritize achieving unfinished tasks presented in this plan, including weapons development and testing, over new initiatives—diplomatic or otherwise. Yet, if Kim sees signs that the Trump administration will factor his key security concerns into its new North Korea policy—Kim recently reiterated that the presence of US strategic assets in the region, US-led joint military drills, and US-South Korea-Japan trilateral security cooperation were a grave security challenge—we may see US-North Korea engagement more quickly than anticipated.

North Korea’s Lethal Aid to Russia: Current State and Outlook	Like all foreign military aid to a warring party, North Korea’s (Democratic People’s Republic of Korea or DPRK) lethal aid to Russia largely falls into two broad categories. First, old and/or surplus equipment and ammunition sent to replenish Moscow’s depleted stocks. Second, new weapons and main battlefield equipment that can be field-tested in Ukraine. If the war drags on, North Korean weapon provision to Russia is most likely to escalate further. The combat performance of these hardware in Ukraine will give Pyongyang a valuable opportunity to evaluate and refine its domestic weapon systems. In return for Pyongyang’s lethal aid, Moscow will likely reciprocate with weapons and/or military technologies, further strengthening North Korea’s offensive and defensive capabilities on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. Old Weaponry and Ammunition North Korea’s ammunition deliveries to Russia were first revealed by the US government in October 2023, when Pyongyang allegedly provided Moscow with over 1,000 containers of military equipment and ammunition. By October 2024, South Korea estimated that North Korea had shipped around 20,000 containers to Russia, which could carry approximately 9.4 million 152 mm shells when fully stocked. Some Western intelligence sources estimated in late 2024 that North Korea supplied -half of the shells used by Russia in Ukraine,- while the Ukrainian intelligence estimated that 60 percent of shells fired by Russian army were provided by North Korea. Given the sheer quantity of shells provided, this ammunition is critical to Russia’s war efforts. To date, the old equipment and ammunition have included: New Weaponry New and/or more powerful weapons have also been sent to Russia. The provision of these weapons not only helps reinforce the Russian army’s capabilities, but also allows North Korea to assess the real-world combat performance of its domestic weapon systems. So far, there has been evidence or allegations of the following systems: What Might Come Next For North Korea, providing lethal aid to Russia offers multiple benefits, such as: 1) disposing of outdated ammunition with questionable quality and replacing it with newly-produced stock under presumably better quality control, 2) field-testing new and main battle weaponry under realistic combat conditions, 3) receiving foreign currency, energy, goods, services, and technology transfers from Russia in return, and 4) reducing Pyongyang’s isolation and breaking international sanctions. If the war in Ukraine drags on, Pyongyang may supply more modern weapons to the battlefield. Depending on Russia’s needs, these could potentially include: In addition to the possible provision of new weapons, Pyongyang is highly likely to continue supplying Russia with ammunition from stockpiles, along with other older weapon systems, depending on their availability and Russia’s needs. These may primarily include older tanks, towed artillery and armored vehicles (including older SPGs). The provision of liquid-propellant SCUD SRBMs (Hwasong-5/6）and MRBMs (Mainly the Hwasong-7) remains a low possibility, as Russia no longer has the personnel or infrastructure to support the operation of liquid-fuel SRBMs and MRBMs. However, Pyongyang could choose to send Strategic Rocket Force personnel to operate these missiles. Conclusion As demonstrated by: 1) receiving North Korean arms and troops, 2) providing Pyongyang with more oil than the annual cap set by UNSC resolutions, and 3) disbanding the UN Panel of Experts (PoE), Russia has effectively abandoned arms control and non-proliferation norms regarding North Korea. Consequently, Moscow is highly likely to reciprocate with weapons and/or military technologies.[9] Although the war in Ukraine has depleted much of Russia’s weapon stockpiles, and both Russian and North Korean weaponry rely heavily on foreign electronics, Moscow still possesses a considerable amount of hardware, expertise, and technology that it could offer in return.

Goals, Delays and Mystery: International Football Coverage on Korean Central Television	If you’re a fan of the English Premier League and live in North Korea, the good news is that coverage of the 2024-2025 season is finally underway on state television, beginning on January 13. But you shouldn’t get too excited. If 2025 is like recent years, only a handful of games will be shown, they’ll be subject to frequent repeats and fans will never get to see which team wins the league. But perhaps that doesn’t matter too much. With propaganda making its way into almost every aspect of North Korean television, international sports coverage is one of the few moments each day when state TV is not trying to send an overt or underlying message to its viewers, so that may be sufficient to make it enjoyable. That is not to say that politics never make their way into sports coverage. In fact, choosing which teams and players are televised tends to be politically-driven. During coverage of the 2022 World Cup, for example, South Korea was not featured until it fell out of the tournament, and in 2023, North Korean TV graphics labeled South Korea as &#8220;puppets&#8221; during coverage of the team’s 4-1 victory in the Women’s Football tournament at the Asian Games. North Korea went on to lose 4-1 to Japan in the final, so perhaps that was payback by the sporting gods. While the amount of sports broadcast on Korean Central Television (KCTV) is probably greater than it has ever been, the station often waits days or weeks to air events. The competitive international sports rights market likely also puts the country at a disadvantage as its broadcast is relatively poor and there are no paid TV channels, but this could be the basis for a future soft diplomacy effort largely devoid of politics. Methodology To analyze football (soccer) coverage on Korean Central Television, we used the author’s archive of North Korean TV broadcasts received via satellite, and a database of TV program schedules compiled by South Korea’s Ministry of Unification. The analysis covered the period from April 2022 to January 2025. The analysis does not cover the digital Sport TV channel. Available information suggests that channel broadcasts for a handful of hours on weekends but does not carry a greater variety of sports than KCTV does, which is available to every home nationwide. Background Sports coverage has long had a place on Korean Central Television. It became more important in mid-2022 when, amid a country-wide COVID-19 outbreak, the station almost doubled its daily broadcasting output from 8 hours to 14 hours. On most days, at least an hour of that extra programming was filled with sports—that is still the case today and much of that sport continues to be football. In 2022, KCTV aired matches from the English, German, French, Spanish and Italian leagues, but since 2023 has settled exclusively on the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and FIFA World Cup. Today, most afternoons include a sports broadcast in the hour or two immediately before the 5pm news bulletin. While football is the most common sports broadcast, other sports popular in North Korea, such as table tennis, volleyball, power lifting, wrestling, badminton, gymnastics, taekwondo, tennis, judo and longbow, receive airtime as well, although in much more limited coverage. Football matches are usually shown edited, and 90 minutes of play is typically squeezed into about 60 minutes of programming. On-air graphics in English are overlayed with Korean graphics and any other logos present on the video are blurred. At one stage, KCTV even blurred the pitch-side advertising, but it no longer does that. Premier League Coverage Coverage of the current season of the English Premier League began on KCTV on January 13 with a match between Ipswich and Liverpool—150 days after it took place on August 16, 2024. The next game to be broadcast, two days later, was also an August 2024 game. That broadcast was aired 144 days after it was played. With coverage of the 2024-2025 season having just begun, there is insufficient data available to analyze the current season. However, looking at last year’s coverage reveals that such delays are not unusual. Each Premier League season consists of 380 regular season games. KCTV carries only a fraction of the games; those that are televised are typically repeated three times or more. Of the games in the 2023-2024 season, only 21 were aired. The chart below shows each of the 21 games televised, the date they were played, (in green) and the date of the broadcast and repeats (in red). The first match that was televised in North Korea was an August 11, 2023, game between Burnley and Manchester City. It was shown on September 27, 2023, 47 days after it was played. The following two football broadcasts were repeats of the same game. From August 11 to the end of 2023, KCTV aired an additional 16 Premier League matches. All were originally played in August or September; by the end of the year, the time elapsed between the games and their broadcast on KCTV had grown to three months. It was not until May 2024 that coverage of the Premier League resumed. Rather than jumping forward in the season, coverage picked up with matches played in England in September and October 2023, and reruns of earlier games. The final match of the season to be broadcast was on September 14, 2024. It was a game between Manchester United and Manchester City originally played on October 29, 2023—a delay of 321 days. But that wasn’t the longest delay. The September 3 match between Liverpool and Aston Villa was repeated for a fifth time on September 2—a year after it was played. None of the matches from the latter two-thirds of the season were shown. The selection of games did not cover all the teams. For the 2023-2024 season, excluding repeats, Manchester City was the most televised team with eight of their matches shown on KCTV. Chelsea followed with six matches and Liverpool with four. Manchester United, supposedly Kim Jong Un’s favorite team, was only televised three times—but if Kim is indeed a fan, he probably is not relying on KCTV to follow the team. While foreign media is banned for almost everyone in North Korea, Kim likely has access to South Korean TV channels that show the matches live, if he wants them. Several teams were not shown at all: Brentford, Brighton &amp; Hove Albion, Everton, Spurs and Wolves. It is perhaps not a coincidence that three of those teams—Brentford, Spurs and Wolves—were not broadcast, as they have South Korean players in their teams. A similar pattern played out a year earlier during the 2022-2023 season. Then, KCTV aired 29 of the 380 games, with average delays of around 4 months. None of the games televised were played after February 2023, depriving viewers of the latter parts of the season. UEFA Champions League In contrast to the Premier League, North Korean TV viewers did see the final stages of the UEFA Champions League—the annual tournament between Europe’s top club teams— but those trying to keep tabs on the contest had to contend with the games being shown out of order. Coverage of the 2023-2024 championship began with the round-of-16 matches that were played in February and March in Europe. KCTV televised them between July and November. Most of the 16 games in the round were shown four times but two, the home and away matches between Paris St. Germain (PSG) and Real Sociedad were not shown. This is likely because PSG fields a South Korean player, Lee Kang-in. At the quarterfinal stage, PSG was again ignored when it played Barcelona and KCTV didn’t air the quarterfinal matches between Arsenal and Bayern Munich, despite showing both teams at the earlier stage. PSG was finally aired when it reached the semifinal, although the game saw it lose to Borussia Dortmund. The Champions League final was aired on December 24, almost seven months after it was originally played on June 1 in London. It has since been repeated on January 10. The chart below shows all of the games that were played from the round of 16 onwards (green) and their air dates on KCTV (red). Games with no red dots were not aired on KCTV. FIFA World Cup One of the underlying constants when analyzing North Korea is that things are often not quite what they seem. The data presented so far appears to suggest that Korean Central Television has difficulty and/or little sense of urgency in turning around international sporting content. Indeed, the state’s complete control of all media would also suggest that fans are unable to follow contests from week-to-week, so fast coverage probably does not matter. But KCTV’s coverage of some sporting events demonstrates that whatever the reason for the delays, it is probably not technical. The TV station closely covered the 2022 World Cup. Games were typically televised one or two days after they were played and, on some days, KCTV broadcast four games a day. It showed every game of the tournament bar four: all three South Korean games in the group stage and the match between the United States and Wales. The latter might have been for technical reasons, but politics likely dictated the lack of coverage of South Korea. KCTV did show the match where they were knocked out of the tournament by Brazil. Most of the knockout stage games were broadcast hours after they took place, as was the World Cup Final. Quarter-final and later games were repeated twice during December. Coverage of last year’s Under-20s Women’s World Cup, which took place in Colombia, was also impressive. At the tournament, North Korea beat Austria, Brazil and, on September 18, beat the United States to secure a place in the final. Its impressive progress apparently lit a fire under KCTV, which aired the three winning games on successive nights from September 20. The team went on to beat Japan 1-0 in the final and become world champions. The game was played in Bogota at 17:00 local time on September 22, which was 07:00 local time in Pyongyang on September 23. KCTV aired the match at 20:30 that evening—a delay of just 13.5 hours. State media showed scenes of North Koreans watching the match in homes, restaurants, public facilities and on large public TV screens. Sports TV Rights Of course, the national team being crowned world champions will always command more local attention than, say, a match between Wolves and Chelsea, but it leaves open the mystery of why the coverage of foreign football looks like it does and especially why is it so late? KCTV coverage of World Cup games has proved it has the technical ability to receive, edit and air multiple games in a matter of hours or days. But there is an important difference between the World Cup and other tournaments highlighted here. In the past, Korean Central Television has worked through the Asian Broadcasting Union to secure rights to the World Cup and the Olympics, usually for no cost, but for European football that does not appear to be the case. Both the English Premier League and Champions League list Eclat Media Group and its SPOTV channel as rights holders in South Korea, but no rights are listed for North Korea, so how KCTV gets the footage is a mystery. The long delay between games being played and broadcast could be down to lack of sufficient access, and perhaps that the European championships are just not as important to a North Korean audience as tournaments that they play in. For organizations wishing to engage North Korea in non-traditional diplomacy, the provision of sporting rights to KCTV could be one way to accomplish that and provide the domestic audience with greater international programming options for their entertainment and enjoyment.
