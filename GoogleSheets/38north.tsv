Kim Jong Un Welcomes Donald J. Trump to Second Term	A year ago on these pages we warned that Kim Jong Un had made a -strategic decision to go to war.- Many interpreted this to mean that we were predicting an imminent attack and since over the past year no war has broken out, they argue that the warning we sounded was mistaken. We disagree. A strategic decision to go to war is not the same as a war plan, nor does it necessarily imply imminence of hostilities. Rather, we viewed it as a decision for patient, calculated preparations in three main areas: building up military strength; lulling, distracting, and befuddling the enemy; and bolstering the patriotic fervor of the civilian population for eventual sacrifice. To list only a few developments which could be seen in one of the above: Each of these by itself might not be so alarming but seen together they suggest a strategy—a coherent plan rather than mere episodic efforts to -gain attention.- If Kim offered sending North Korean troops to Ukraine rather than responding to a request from Russia’s President Putin, that fits with a long-term effort to prepare his army for hostilities. In declaring the DPRK a separate state apart from South Korea (ROK), Kim explicitly laid the groundwork for justifying the use of force against the ROK. All of this could be seen as a worst-case scenario, but at this point, it is certainly no less likely than the alternatives. Ultimately it will be up to governments to decide and prepare—or not. The greatest danger is still, as we asserted a year ago, that Washington and Seoul cling to the belief their alliance backed by -ironclad- deterrence will stop Kim from military action, and that he would never attack for fear of being destroyed. Potentially, a development that could be interpreted as Kim stepping back from his frequent calls for war preparations is his stated goal for massively redeveloping provincial and local economies. On the surface, this would seem to be incompatible with war preparations, certainly in the short-term. In our view, if this new push on local economic development goes hand-in-hand with a clear diminution of emphasis on the military—which we have yet to see—and a revival of the internal debate over military spending (evidence for which will be hard to read in any case) these might signal new decisions in Pyongyang. The Trump Factor There is considerable speculation about how President Trump will deal with Kim a second time around—and how Kim may respond. On the campaign trail, Trump said, -Kim Jong-un [is] very smart, very tough, but he liked me, and I got along really well with him, and we were safe.&#8221; Trump and his team must realize, however, that if Kim keeps the door to engagement with the US a crack open, it leads to a very different room from where things were in February 2019. Kim’s goals have changed, his sense of North Korea’s place in the world has changed, and his view of the long-term weakness of the US has changed. We agree that re-engagement could be a serious effort on Kim’s behalf, but it could also be a deception to buy more time for war preparations. Kim may preempt Trump by resuming his letter writing to make sure Trump understands that it’s a new room he is about to enter. We pen such a hypothetical Kim-to-Trump letter based on our understanding of the situation on the Korean Peninsula. Dear Mr. President: I write to you after a long silence. Much has happened over the years since we last met, and it will be good to explore what that means before we consider whether it is useful to begin anew serious contact. I know you will agree that if we are to engage with any hope of fruitful results, this will have to start from an entirely new place. The past is past. Let us not be burdened by it but look ahead. To be frank, the chasm between our countries has widened and deepened. I fear there is nothing to be done to bridge the gap anymore. If you think otherwise, I will of course listen to your views. Let me lay out what I see. For a long time, we in the DPRK knew the world to be a dangerous place, with untrustworthy neighbors prepared to squeeze us to death. In such a situation, the logical course was to pursue relations with the United States which, at the time of the collapse of the USSR and the Eastern bloc, was the preeminent force on the world stage. We are a practical people; we see reality for what it is. What we see today and what we saw then are worlds apart. The United States is no longer preeminent. And after so many years of effort, in which we sacrificed much and compromised often, we have become convinced those years were wasted. The United States thought we were gullible, that we would sacrifice our honor for a handful of candy, and that once weakened it could smash us apart, wipe us off the face of the earth as it has done time after time to other countries. But we did not yield. And we will not. Though it would cost us dearly, we are prepared for an inevitable, final struggle. I hope it will not come to that, but we will not turn away if it does. You will note that I have declared the DPRK a separate, sovereign state totally apart from the ROK. This was a painful decision but not as strange as it might first seem. Although we are one people, for centuries we were divided into separate kingdoms. Eventually, the strongest of them conquered the others. I’m sure recent events in South Korea have been very troubling to you. To speak honestly about our previous exchange of correspondence, it accomplished little. Though they contained serious ideas, my letters were mocked and belittled in your media. One message I sought to reinforce to you over and over was that I cannot simply give, give, give. I must have something concrete to show my people. You must as well. On that basis, we should have been able to make progress. It did not come to pass. There were consequences from failure. We have formed a strategic alliance with Russia, and we are much stronger today in every respect than we were then. And we will become stronger still, of that you can be assured. To be clear, we are both the leaders of nuclear-weapons states. We are not friends, though we can respect each other and, perhaps, work together to solve pressing regional and global problems. I give you fair warning—we cannot be brow beaten; we are not dogs who can be trained to heel. As you treat us, so we will treat you. Such a letter would allow Kim to let Trump know that he is still interested in talking, but the ball is now in Trump’s court, and the court itself has changed. The post Kim Jong Un Welcomes Donald J.

Half A Loaf: Third Hwasong-16 Solid IRBM Test Shows Booster is Ready but HGV Payload Needs Work	On January 6, North Korea test-launched a Hwasong-16B (HS-16B) solid-propellant intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) carrying a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV) payload. This was the third apparently successful flight of the HS-16 booster (two with HGVs, the other with a maneuvering reentry vehicle (MaRV) payload), probably meaning that the North considers the booster ready for operational deployment. The success of the HGV payload, however, cannot be confirmed, marking three apparently lackluster MaRV flights (one on a liquid booster); several successful flights over at least a few years probably will be needed before the HGV is ready for deployment. The HS-16 would be deployable in the near-term with the previously-flown MaRV or a yet-to-be-seen traditional reentry vehicle. The North reported using -new composite carbon fiber material- in the HS-16 booster and updated guidance technology, but the nature of these improvements and their effect on system performance are unknown. The latest test underscores North Korea’s continuing commitment both to IRBMs to strike Guam and other farther-flung theater targets, and to HGVs as an eventual means of further challenging US missile defenses in Guam and the western Aleutians. But the high cost of HGVs and the limited set of targets for which they offer comparative advantages (mostly key ground-based missile defense sensors) mean that relatively few will be deployed. Information to Date Japan’s Ministry of Defense reported on January 6 the launch that day of a ballistic missile from North Korea to the northeast, falling into the sea at a distance of about 1,100 km with a maximum altitude of about 100 km after about a ten minute flight. The South Korean military confirmed the range of what it termed a -midrange missile- but did not report the altitude, claiming that launch preparations had been detected in advance. (It is not clear whether this detection was in addition to the military’s December 23 warning that the DPRK could launch an IRBM with a hypersonic warhead around its end-of-year plenum.) On January 7, North Korean press reported the previous day’s -test-fire of [a] new-type intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile- that demonstrated a -first peak height of 99.8 kilometers and the second peak height of 42.5 kilometers at the speed amounting to twelve times of the speed of sound, and accurately landed on the simulated target waters in the open sea 1,500 kilometers away.- This missile reportedly used rocket motors incorporating -a new composite carbon fiber material- and its guidance system included -a new comprehensive and effective method based on the already-accumulated technologies.- The test was said to have confirmed -the effectiveness of the missile system that fully meets the expected military specifications- and -the successful development of the new-type strategic weapon system.- Accompanying photos and video showed the -cold launch- from a canister mounted on a seven-axle road-mobile launcher of a solid-propellant missile tipped with a wedge-shaped HGV payload. The images generally matched those of the HS-16B solid-propellant IRBM that was last launched on April 2, 2024 and also carried an HGV. On January 7, the South Korean military characterized North Korea’s announced performance as an exaggeration, reporting that South Korea, Japan, and the US agreed the missile flew about 1,100 km with no second apogee (peak height) reached during the flight. The ROK military assessed the North’s claims as -highly likely deception.- Analysis and Implications The IRBM booster. This is the third apparently successful flight of the solid-propellant booster portion of the HS-16 system, including the April 2024 test and the January 2024 test that carried a MaRV rather than an HGV. (Moreover, the HS-16 booster is based on that of the HS-18 solid intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM], which was tested successfully three times in 2024.) By traditional North Korean standards, that would be sufficient for the booster to be considered ready for operational deployment. This may be what the North was referring to in announcing -successful development- of the system. The HGV payload. This is the third known test of the HGV, including on the April 2024 HS-16B test and a September 2021 flight on a version of the Hwasong-12 liquid-propellant IRBM booster that the North dubbed Hwasong-8 and later HS-12B. There is no clear open-source evidence that any of the three HGVs flew successfully after release from the booster. Indeed, reminiscent of the latest flight, the ROK in April 2024 claimed the US agreed with its assessment of a shorter range and fewer maneuvers than claimed by North Korea. If the US did in fact agree with the ROK assessments, then we can be highly confident the last two HGV flights failed given Washington’s substantial missile detection and tracking capabilities. It should not be surprising that North Korea is struggling with the HGV. This is a very demanding technology given the need to cope with the temperatures and pressures of sustained hypersonic flight, which are compounded by the maneuvering needed to evade missile defenses (the comparative advantage of HGVs over other payloads), as well as the challenges of accurate guidance in such an environment. China and Russia needed numerous flight-tests over several years to successfully develop deployable HGVs, and the US is still working on it. Pyongyang likely has at least several successful flight-tests yet to go, even if it were to obtain assistance from Russia or China. Although the HGV is clearly not ready for prime time, North Korea might choose for political and propaganda reasons, or in an effort to complicate allied planning, to claim the payload is deployed even if remains under development. (For example, North Korea released a photo in October 2024 in conjunction with Kim Jong Un’s visit to -strategic missile bases- showing Kim in an underground missile facility standing next to HGV-equipped HS-12B liquid IRBMs.[1]) In any case, the North could still deploy the HS-16 with the MaRV tested in January 2024, which was also flown twice on the -Hwasong-8- in January 2022, or with a traditional reentry vehicle that has yet to be seen on the HS-16. Composite carbon fiber. There is no open-source information on the nature of the -new composite carbon fiber material- reportedly used -in the manufacture of the engine body of the missile,- much less on whatever material had been used previously. The North’s -engine- phraseology would seem to apply not to the body of the HGV payload, but rather to the solid booster motors. Use of a new motor case or nozzle material might explain why Pyongyang announced in March 2024 the conduct of -a ground jet test [static test] of a solid-fueled engine for a new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile,- the reported success of which allowed -a timetable for completing the development of the new-type intermediate-range hypersonic missile weapon system- to be set.[2] Composite materials incorporating carbon fiber &#8212; and there is no information on what proportion of the North’s new material is carbon fiber, or the quality of that fiber &#8212; generally are desirable because they can be stronger than other composites, provide equal strength with less weight, or some combination. Lower-weight motor cases or nozzles would permit using the energy of the solid booster to propel the payload farther, to loft a heavier payload, or some combination of the two. Although it is possible that the purpose of using a new material would be to strengthen the motor cases to permit putting the booster into more stressful flight trajectories, it is at least as likely that the original HS-16 booster was sufficiently sturdy to handle HGV flights (as North Korea did with that booster in April 2024) but Pyongyang now is looking to provide that sturdiness at lower weight and thus with more boost performance. Improved guidance. Obtaining satisfactory accuracy while engaging in hypersonic maneuvers is one of the main challenges in HGV development, so it certainly makes sense that North Korea would want to improve its HGV accuracy. That said, there is no open-source information on what the guidance system or accuracy of the North’s previously-tested HGVs was, what technological improvements were made in the latest payload, or what effect those improvements had on accuracy. Indeed, given the apparently checkered flight-test history of its HGVs, Pyongyang itself may currently lack information on the degree of any improvement. The Bottom Line Although the latest HS-16B test underscores that the booster portion of the system probably is regarded by North Korea as ready for deployment, the HGV payload has several successful flight-tests and thus probably at least a few years to go. The nature and impact of the -new composite carbon fiber material- and updated guidance technology used in the latest test are unclear. The test does show Pyongyang’s continued commitment to IRBMs, which pose a deterrent threat to US territory in Guam and the southwest Aleutians and can disrupt bases in Guam, the Philippines, and farther-flung reaches of Japan that could support US operations against North Korea. The test also shows continued commitment to the HGV development program, which if successful, will offer another means of combatting US missile defenses in Guam and the Aleutians. Moreover, the HGV is invoked by North Korea as a sign of technical sophistication (-a technical force which is by no means easy to achieve…a remarkable achievement- that only -a few countries in the world might possess,- as the media claimed on January 7) and of deterrent credibility and resolve (-through the current test…we… clearly showed the enemies what we are doing and that we are fully ready to use any means to defend our legitimate interests-). Even if successful, the high cost of HGVs and the limited set of targets for which they offer comparative advantages (mostly key ground-based missile defense sensors) mean that relatively few will be deployed to fulfill niche roles revolving around missile defense suppression. The HS-16 likely will end up being deployed in larger numbers with MaRVs and perhaps even traditional reentry vehicles, especially if North Korea eventually develops sufficient accuracy to make conventionally armed IRBMs militarily feasible.

K-Coup and its Limits: Popular Sovereignty, Civic Virtue, and Political Science Blind Spots	When abrupt, consequential political events happen, we tend to have recourse to the general to explain the particular. That is, we use models and heuristics as tools for understanding a novel, often unexpected phenomenon. In politics especially, we employ theories for this purpose. This is both necessary—theory is unavoidable, as it allows us to construct a framework for what is perceived as relevant information/data deserving attention—and valuable for comprehending mechanisms of events. If X is often correlated with Y in context Z, and there occurs a series of new events similar to X in a situation resembling Z, then exploring the potential role of something like Y in those new events is warranted. Beyond hot takes and description of the facts, much analysis of the December 3 martial law declaration (and its aftermath) by South Korean president Yoon Seok Yul has been a textbook application of general theoretical principles to help understand the particular situation and events in South Korea. For instance, scholars have applied theories of self-coups, the psychology of leaders in isolated information bubbles, and democratic resilience as frameworks for understanding what happened on December 3 and during the ensuing political chaos. Perhaps the best of this approach has been from Aurel Croissant, who astutely analyzes South Korea’s -reactive- versus -preventive- democratic resilience. Inter alia, he concludes that South Korea demonstrates high levels of citizen activism to -re-equilibrate- democracy after it breaks down, while the country’s mechanisms for preventing democratic backsliding are weak and dysfunctional. Certainly this is valuable work, but as important as it is to understand a particular event through the application of general theoretical principles, it is also important to go in the opposite analytical direction. That is, the facts of a particular case should be analyzed to help us update or modify our concepts and theoretical models. In the case of South Korea, Yoon’s self-coup attempt and the reaction to it may have something to contribute to our understanding of important notions in political science. There are numerous possibilities, but two stand out. First, Yoon’s attempted self-coup provides a data point about the concept of sovereignty, namely that authoritarian efforts to subvert popular sovereignty may increasingly rely on mimicking liberal rhetoric and co-opting or sidelining the legislature (rather than the military, as is more traditionally the case). And second, Yoon’s black swan decision to decree martial law illustrates how political science has weaknesses in terms of factoring the behavior of individuals (especially outliers), rather than systemic variables, into its models. Rule of Law or Godwin’s Law? Yoon Suk Schmitt, Sovereignty, and the State of Exception First, Yoon’s self-coup attempt clarifies some things about the contestation of sovereignty—one of the oldest political concepts—in the contemporary era. Beyond Yoon’s formal decree of martial law in the service of a self-coup lies something more profound: a usurpation of sovereignty. The foundation of both the power and legitimacy of democracy—regardless of variant of regime, government, election system, etc.—is popular sovereignty. In fact, this notion is inherent in the word democracy: in Greek, -demos- means -people- and -kratos- translates as -power.- Despite his rhetoric justifying martial law as a restoration of liberal democratic sovereignty, Yoon in fact subverted democracy by appealing to a different, illiberal form of sovereignty, one defined more than a century ago by Nazi jurist Carl Schmitt. In response to the question -Who is the sovereign?- Schmitt (in)famously answered: -Sovereign is he who decides on the state of exception.-[1] Yoon’s martial law declaration, ostensibly on the basis of national emergency, was precisely a decision to announce the imposition of a -state of exception,- the annulment of constitutional processes and protections, suspension of the power of the legislature, and arrogation to himself (and the military under his command) of all political and executive power for a period of his determination. Fundamentally, Yoon tried to make himself the sovereign in South Korea. That he failed to do so was the result of contestation, the re-assertion of popular sovereignty as the rejection of Yoon’s state of exception and the demand to the return of constitutional order. This re-assertion of popular sovereignty occurred through mobilization of both citizen masses (on the streets) and their legislative representatives in the National Assembly, who refused the forceful suspension of the legislature and convened to overturn the martial law decree. So, what might the particular South Korean experience of the state of exception tell us about sovereignty more generally? At least three things seem possible. First, leader efforts at self-coups—the suspension of popular sovereignty—may increasingly be based on populist rhetoric and disingenuous ideological appeal to upholding liberal values. This was precisely Yoon’s rhetoric, which invoked -legislative dictatorship,- anti-liberal (and pro-North Korea) communist forces, and supposed election fraud as justifications for martial law. It is noteworthy that US president Donald Trump’s January 6 self-coup attempt (via overturning the 2020 presidential election, and thus thwarting popular sovereignty as expressed through voting) was based on supposed election fraud as well. Deploying liberal rhetoric to legitimate a self-coup driven by a state of exception to cause a shift from popular sovereignty to autocratic sovereignty is an innovation, as more classically this shift is justified through fear (often of outside threats) and appeals to a need for the supposed higher good of state security that the autocrat can provide. Second, the contestation of sovereignty—popular versus autocratic—in the contemporary world may heavily involve the role of the legislature. This is in contrast to how we typically think of the state institutions involved in contested coups and self-coups: historically the primary actor supporting or hindering the coup leader is usually the military (or paramilitary), and the main determinate of success is whether or not armed forces are sufficiently unified in supporting the overturning of the status quo. Certainly, the military played an important role in Yoon’s self-coup (with elements both supporting and undermining Yoon), but in the case of South Korea, the National Assembly managed to convene to revoke the martial law order before it was blocked from doing so, and thus overcame the state of exception and maintained the popular nature of sovereignty. Again, it is noteworthy the significant role played by the legislature during the January 6 self-coup attempt by Trump (which was unorthodox in featuring no military role at all). It was US Congress that Trump encouraged to invalidate the presidential election results, and it was Congress that refused and instead voted to uphold the Electoral College result confirming Joe Biden as president-elect. Third, in modern democracies, rapid[2] autocratic usurpation of sovereignty from the people may be harder than in previous eras. The historical, archetypal execution of a state of exception involves (inter alia) control over information outlets, a task which is considerably more difficult in today’s internet-connected and distributed world of digital devices, variegated information platforms, and social media. South Korea on December 3 was a case in point, as both the National Assembly and general population communicated instantaneously to share information and coordinate strategies (legislative and popular, respectively) to re-assert popular sovereignty in the face of Yoon’s attempt to assert autocratic sovereignty through imposing a state of exception. South Korean Democracy: Institutions, Civic Virtue, and the Government the People Deserve A second major thing that South Korea’s particular martial law experience can tell us about general political concepts relates to a sub-discipline of political science known as comparative politics. Comparative politics studies the world’s political systems by comparing their various features—regime type, election methods, governance structure and output, etc. across geography and historical time. The key word in this definition is -system.- Political scientists like to examine systems—institutions, structures, decision-making processes, political norms and culture, party landscape—because they are measurable, persistent, and consistent over time. In short, these factors reduce the messy inscrutability of individual humans and outlier events. This is understandable from a social scientific perspective, but it can also be misleading. South Korea’s K-coup experience reflects this by reminding us individuals matter. In the wake of Yoon’s self-coup attempt, South Korea has been correctly praised for the reactive resilience of some of its political institutions (National Assembly procedures for lifting martial law, constitutional impeachment process, etc.), while other political institutions (an -imperial- presidency, a corrupt and gerontocratic party landscape, partisan and toxic political media) have also been correctly criticized for their lack of resilience in preventing Yoon and his co-conspirators from nearly usurping popular sovereignty (and thus placing South Korea under the stress of needing reactive resilience in the first place). But as important as South Korea’s institutional systems are, at base the self-coup attempt by Yoon and his cabal was a product of their individual moral, psychological, intellectual/judgment, and dispositional failures. One notes also that South Korea’s left-oriented opposition—especially Democratic Party leader Lee Jae Myung, Reform Party leader Cho Kuk, and a host of others—has also shown a massive failure of integrity and a propensity for malfeasance. Despite their important role ending martial law, they are not heroes of South Korean democracy, as international media have intimated. Cho Kuk is currently imprisoned for fraud. Lee Jae Myung—the Democratic Party favorite to run in the next presidential election unless disqualified—has been convicted of violating election law and faces numerous ongoing criminal cases for corruption. In short, there are a staggering number of unfit politicians—power hungry, venal, and corrupt—in South Korean government and politics. South Korea’s party and election systems have allowed these people to attain power, and South Koreans have voted them into office. In democracies, the people get the government they deserve. South Korea’s K-coup experience—and its fallout—demonstrates that no system of institutions can ever be perfect, which means that politics is ultimately reliant on the civic virtue of politicians and the individual voters who elect them. This civic virtue is hard for political science to theorize, measure, and test. But developing better tools to this end is important, if political scientists want to improve understanding of and prediction about its objects of study. South Korea is the perfect exemplar of this hard truth: South Korea’s political systems and institutions are well understood, yet almost no one (and certainly not political scientists) predicted Yoon’s self-coup attempt, which will likely lead to significant consequences for inter-Korean relations, the US-South Korea alliance, and East Asian geopolitics. Mencken, Churchill, and the Way Forward for South Korea -Democracy,- quipped H.L. Mencken, -is the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.- For the optimist, this classic ironic statement of the travails of democratic societies pairs well with Churchill’s famous dictum that -democracy is the worst form of government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.- Democratic South Korea has put itself in a frightful situation through electing Yoon Seok Yul, which is perhaps a symptom of decay as much as a cause, considering that South Korea’s democratic credentials have been weakening for nearly a decade. Political reform both of institutions—curtailing the -imperial presidency- and modifying martial law provisions; improving political party structures; preparing for a world of artificial intelligence, deepfakes, and other tools for manipulating public opinion[3]; etc.—and civic virtue among individual politicians and the general public is critical to South Korea remaining strong domestically and in the face of growing threats from North Korea, China, Russia, and other malign actors. Whether or not South Korea succeeds at this is currently an open question. If it does, perhaps political science as a discipline can learn something from South Korea’s potential positive evolution, just as it should learn something from its disastrous flirtation with the state of exception.

Quick Take: Kim’s New Year’s Greetings to Putin	North Korean media’s readout of the annual year-end party plenary meeting in 2024 revealed relatively little about its defense and foreign policy goals for 2025. Despite the dearth of details, references to a -strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction- and North Korea’s achievements in building -a righteous multi-polar world-—an expression the North typically uses in connection with its cooperation with Russia—seem to suggest Pyongyang will maintain its hardline policy toward the United States and continue to deepen ties with Moscow this year. Kim Jong Un’s unusual New Year’s message to the Russian president, published just days after the Party plenary meeting closed, reinforces this notion.[1] According to North Korean media’s summary of Kim’s message, he seemed to indicate a new level of military-to-military relationship between the two countries. He offered -best wishes to the fraternal Russian people and all the service personnel of the brave Russian army in the name of his own, the Korean people and all the service personnel of the armed forces of the DPRK .- [Emphasis added.] In the past, Kim gave a nod to the Russian military without linking the two armed forces. For example, in his last message to Putin in October 2024, Kim expressed -our [North Korea’s]- support for the -army and people of Russia.- During a meeting with the visiting Russian defense minister in November, Kim voiced support of -the DPRK government, army and people- for -the Russian Federation- policy of defending national sovereignty, not the Russian military itself. Two additional changes stand out in this New Year’s greeting. First, Kim’s characterization of his relationship to Putin has an added dimension, referring to him as his -closest friend and comrade.-[2] By comparison, Kim’s message to the Russian president in October called him only his -closest comrade.- Second, Kim described North Korea and Russia as -sworn friends,- an unusual term for the North to use in connection with Russia, at least in modern history. In contrast, as per usual practice, North Korean media simply listed Xi Jinping and his wife as being among those foreign dignitaries who sent New Year’s cards to Kim Jong Un. Whether Pyongyang’s decision to offer little information on its defense and foreign policy direction for the New Year was driven more by a desire to maintain policy flexibility ahead of Trump’s second term or simply keep the outside world guessing about its intentions is unclear. A close examination of North Korean official statements and media commentary—past and future—will be needed to help fill the gaps. Kim’s latest letter to Putin is just one indication; more will be revealed in the coming months.

Impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol: Impact on US-Japan-ROK Cooperation	The recent impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol has created many uncertainties not only about the fate of domestic political affairs in the Republic of Korea (ROK or South Korea), but also about the impact it may have on Seoul’s foreign and national security strategies. Amid political transitions in the United States and Japan as well, this rapid and unforeseen political crisis in South Korea adds greatly to concerns within and between the security communities of all three countries over its potential impact on the US-Japan-ROK trilateral security partnership as well as Japan-ROK bilateral relations which have been the crucial but most fragile link in the triangle. Reversal of the bilateral and trilateral cooperation efforts cultivated in recent years will create vulnerabilities against the ever-growing threats posed by China, North Korea, and Russia, which could destabilize the Indo-Pacific security environment. To avoid this, the US, Japan, and the ROK must work to ensure that trilateral security cooperation, as well as Seoul-Tokyo bilateral ties, are sustained and strengthened through these tumultuous times. Effects of the Aftermath From the viewpoint of Japan-ROK relations and the US-Japan-ROK trilateral security partnership, the greatest question has been who will lead the next administration in Seoul. While much remains uncertain, the populist Lee Jae Myung, leader of the progressive Democratic Party (DPK), has stood out. Not only does the DPK along with other liberal and progressive parties have the overwhelming majority in the National Assembly, but Lee has been the driving force against the policies of Yoon Suk Yeol and the ruling People’s Power Party. However, while the DPK has gained momentum through Yoon’s martial law ordeal, there are serious questions about how it will direct the ROK’s foreign and national security policies, given that many of its members subscribe to nationalistic revisionism and hold strong biases against Japan and the US. The impeachment motion filed by the progressive opposition parties in early December claimed Yoon’s foreign and national security policies as having isolated the ROK in East Asia by antagonizing North Korea, China, and Russia while currying favor with Japan. While one may argue that this was merely symbolic rhetoric to deny every aspect of the Yoon administration, it nonetheless bolstered concerns in both Japan and the US about how a DPK oriented administration—if it comes into power—would work to revise the ROK’s initiatives with Japan and the trilateral framework with the US. Problems are also compounded by the incoming Trump administration, which may de-prioritize the alliance commitments with Japan and the ROK, as well as trilateral cooperation. Consequently, the Trump administration may do little to promote, or even sustain, the trilateral framework and may be uninterested in the consequences of souring ties between Japan and the ROK. The combination of the above raises grave concerns over how the efforts for trilateral coordination and cooperation over the past two years may be revised in the near- to mid-term future, given how much hinged on Yoon’s willingness to push forward despite deep-seated controversies in the ROK over closer relations with Japan. Even if the conservatives hold onto power, there are questions over how much political capital they have left to continue the path Yoon carved out in advancing Japan-ROK relations and US-Japan-ROK trilateral security cooperation. Such concerns are not unfamiliar to many, where past attempts at institutionalizing trilateral cooperation either faded or fell short of making any significant impact—such as in the case of the Trilateral Coordination and Oversight Group, which was inaugurated in 1999 but dissolved in 2003. Even for the Defense Trilateral Talks and Japan-ROK bilateral defense dialogues, as well as other initiatives, their successes were highly dependent on the political climate among and within the states at the time, leading to inconsistencies in outcomes through political leadership changes, making coordination and cooperation unsustainable in the long run. What is at Stake? The -Spirit of Camp David- issued at the Biden-Kishida-Yoon summit in August 2023 and the initiatives undertaken by the US, Japan, and the ROK were about making the trilateral framework more resilient to domestic political affairs. The commitments are underpinned not simply by the shared threat perceptions of North Korea, but the three countries’ will to connect their Indo-Pacific security concerns and strategies. Even in Japan-ROK bilateral relations, the revival of -shuttle diplomacy-—regular, reciprocal summits—along with various exchanges have brought back much confidence between the governments and warmer interactions between the citizens of the two countries. One only needs to look at the progress of the past two and a half years to understand what is at stake. At the strategic level, dialogues have taken place between the leaders, ministers, and chiefs of staff, agreeing on close coordination and institutionalization of initiatives. Greater developments have been evident at the operational level as well, with the operationalization of real-time information sharing regarding North Korean missile launches and trilateral defense drills, including the initiation of the -Freedom Edge- trilateral multi-domain exercises. Although the aforementioned efforts are still young, they were nevertheless essential steps in filling the defense and deterrence gaps against growing threats posed by China, North Korea, and Russia. The problems are not simply about the continued military modernization and ever-increasing assertive operations of all three countries, but also the growing cooperation among them. Unwinding or even slowing down US-Japan-ROK trilateral defense efforts could potentially open up vulnerabilities against these adversarial threats, fueling tensions that could lead to further instability in the Indo-Pacific security environment. Glimmer of Hope? Although the US-Japan-ROK security framework hangs in the balance, not all is over, and there is still some hope on the horizon. Above all, the circumstances surrounding the Korean Peninsula have changed dramatically since 2019. On the down side, North Korea has resumed its missile launches with much greater frequency and pushed forward with its military modernization program, as well as issued its new policy toward the South. The implications of these developments go beyond the significant rise of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, but have created greater insecurity in the Indo-Pacific as a whole. Moreover, tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait and combined with the current political crisis on the Korean Peninsula, there are understandable concerns about the risk of a simultaneous contingency in the region. However, on the more positive side, the increasingly volatile regional security environment has served as a driver for both Japan and the ROK to recognize that their security interests are intertwined, making close trilateral coordination and cooperation with the US mutually beneficial and essential. Such perceptions are shared among the security communities in Japan and the ROK, with some notable improvements in public opinion in both countries as well. The other important point is that the aforementioned systemization in trilateral coordination and cooperation in recent years has set strong institutional and procedural precedents for the future. Japan-ROK relations have been repeatedly taken one step forward and one step back. Numerous times, steps toward Japan-ROK security cooperation through dialogues, exercises, operations, and institutionalization were either halted or reversed due to political differences over historical and sovereignty issues or strategic diversions due to change of administrations in Seoul. Yet the initiatives undertaken in recent years have been two or three steps forward, making it difficult to completely reverse progress and providing a solid starting point that the states can come back to in the future. Steps Needed Ahead To sustain and further develop the trilateral partnership in a time when there are uncertainties concerning future leadership, the US, Japan, and the ROK must work together in the interim to prove that the framework is vital and beneficial for all parties at both national and regional security levels. Even if the political capital is limited in making further advancements, the three governments can still communicate and promote the benefits and feasibility of the trilateral framework, as well as highlight the agendas ahead. Naturally, there are areas that need improvements going forward. At the strategic level, the three countries need to establish a formal trilateral consultative group to discuss and coordinate matters relating to their respective strategies, as well as extended deterrence. Such mechanisms will be vital not just to coordinate strategies and plans of the US, Japan, and the ROK, but to identify and work with gaps in expectations, visions, and capacity. At the operational level, the three countries’ defense and law enforcement organs need to further coordinate their readiness for multi-domain operations, going beyond missile defense and anti-submarine warfare, and extending to areas such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; remote island defense; cyber and electronic warfare; naval mine warfare; outer space; logistics; as well as humanitarian operations. To do this, however, the focus should not be just about formulating and practicing coordinated missions, but also on enhancing interoperability. Conclusion In South Korea, the US-Japan-ROK trilateral security framework is susceptible to becoming a domestic political football, and the partnership will be tested in the coming months. At the same time, there is no denying that the regional security environment has worsened because of the long-term revisionist ambitions of China, North Korea, and Russia. While diplomatic solutions are undoubtedly desirable, coordinated defense measures must continue to be pursued to ensure that both national and regional security is not compromised. In the end, it is not about who is preferred as South Korea’s next leader, but rather how they can pragmatically, productively, and realistically work with the US and Japan for regional security and stability while also repairing the state of domestic political affairs.

Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center: Construction Nearing Completion at Radiochemical Labora...	Recent commercial satellite imagery of the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center indicates roof repairs at the Radiochemical Laboratory’s (RCL) Thermal (Steam) Plant appears complete, covering recently-installed new or refurbished steam boilers. While occasional smoke emissions have been observed coming from the plant—a usual indicator of reprocessing activity—the inconsistent frequency suggests a reprocessing campaign is not underway. Excavation of a grid-like series of holes is underway at a nearby facility, the purpose of which is unclear. Full water discharge from the 5 MWe Reactor indicates it is operating again after a three-month-long hiatus, and start-up testing appears to be ongoing at the Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR). These activities appear consistent with Kim Jong Un’s orders to expand the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal, laying the groundwork for continued stockpiling of fissile material. Radiochemical Laboratory In the past, an indicator for reprocessing at the RCL has been smoke emanating from the thermal plant located to the south. Major renovations began on the thermal plant in March 2024 and appeared to be completed by July. While emissions were seen coming from the thermal plant on imagery from December 3, the plant has not gone into extended operation, so there is no indication that another reprocessing cycle has begun. Imagery from December 9 showed approximately 40 holes had been dug in the courtyard of a small compound located 0.5 km northeast of the RCL, previously associated with military construction brigades. A similar series of around 20 holes had also been dug in a small field just outside of the compound to its east. These series of holes were laid out in grid-like pattern and measured approximately one meter in diameter. As of imagery from December 24, the total number of holes had more than doubled. On the west side of the compound, holes have been squared-up and covered, measuring approximately 1.5 by 1.5 meters. Large numbers of workers are observed at the site. These holes do not appear to be associated with construction activity, leaving questions as to their purpose. Given the location of this facility and its proximity to other radioactive waste burial sites—the Old Waste Site and Building 500—it remains to be seen whether this construction is also related to radioactive waste management. The digging does not yet appear complete given the number of personnel still present at each site. Of note, on imagery from December 9, a cargo truck was seen on the road adjacent to Building 500. On December 24, a cargo truck was seen on the access road to the RCL’s spent fuel receipt building. Reactor Area 5MWe Reactor The 5 MWe Reactor is critical for the country’s production of weapons-grade plutonium. In the past, key signatures of activity in the reactor area have included the presence of vehicles near the building and the existence (or lack of) of cooling water flow from the discharge point. In a previous report from May 2024, water discharge had stopped, likely indicating a refueling operation. Currently, there is a full water discharge, indicating it is operating again. Imagery from December 24 revealed significant ice melt from the 5 MWe outflow. In late September 2024, imagery revealed land near the spent fuel storage building had been excavated, three square possible vault covers were opened in the courtyard. By mid-November, the three openings were covered over. On imagery since December 9, the area appeared to be walled-in, with a small building within the enclosure. The purpose of these activities is unclear. ELWR Intermittent water discharge at the ELWR continues, indicative of ongoing testing and certification. As the first light water reactor in North Korea, a thorough testing cycle is to be expected. Reactors take time to bring into operation and undergo a period of continuous testing. A probable testing phase began in October 2023. Six months later, water discharge stopped for the month of April 2024. Water discharge was restored through August, when it again was shut off. Outflow resumed once again in mid-November. On imagery from December 24, small and large ELWR outflows were running. Warm water outflow was observed just north of the ELWR pump house. Uranium Enrichment Plant (UEP) and Conversion Facilities The UEP and uranium conversion facilities have also been undergoing renovations for the past three years. Imagery from December 9 reveals work on the conversion buildings—seemingly the last in the area to be refurbished—appears to be complete, and the surrounding grounds have been tidied of construction materials and other objects. It is unclear what has changed inside these facilities, but there have not yet been signatures indicating operations have resumed. Levee Construction Located on either side of a large bend in the Kuryong River, the Yongbyon complex is prone to flooding due to elevation variations in the river. Work has been done over time to manage the flow of the river during both the wet and dry seasons, largely by the construction of causeways and dam reconstruction. The river at this location is relatively shallow and meanders through the landscape. In the past, these efforts have largely failed to protect the growing fields in the face of heavy annual rains. However, imagery from December 9 reveals work to reinforce flood protection measures. In two locations along the river, work is being conducted to harden the levees along the west bank of the river—at and above the reactor area and main research and administration area—and on the east side of the riverbank at the bridge and causeway crossing near the RCL and UEP facilities. This differs from previous water management efforts as the height of the levee is being raised and the riverside facing is being hardened. It is unclear how extensive these embankments will be.

Open-source Intelligence and North Korea: An Interview With UK Air-Vice Marshal (Ret.) Sean Corbett	Open-source intelligence (OSINT) for some time has been a widely used term among North Korea watchers, not just in governments, but also academia and think tanks. There seem to be multiple definitions of the term OSINT, however, with some challenging its raison d’être. What is OSINT exactly, and what are its uses and limitations for -hard targets- like North Korea? 38 North met with Sean Corbett for a discussion on these issues, with a focus on the use of satellite imagery to enhance our understanding of North Korea. Sean retired from the Royal Air Force in September 2018 as a two-star general after a 30-year career as a professional intelligence officer. His last appointment in the military was in Washington, DC, as the first non-US deputy director of a major US intelligence agency. He is currently the chairman of the Janes National Security Advisory Board and is a senior associate fellow of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). 38 North: OSINT has a long history, but it seems to have become a more prevalent theme in recent years. What is your definition of OSINT? Sean Corbett: Without making this an essay on definitions, to an extent, the answer depends on how you define the broader term of -intelligence- within a national security context. For me, intelligence comprises the ethical and legal collection and analysis of often incomplete, -actionable- information that needs to be validated. It also informs decision-making that benefits the organization conducting it, giving insight into issues that the subject does not want to reveal. An analogy I like to use is trying to complete a jigsaw with several pieces missing, pieces of a different puzzle mixed in, and several pieces where the image on the front has been peeled off. It is important to distinguish between information and intelligence. Information collected must be applied to a specified and specific problem set or requirement, which cannot be fully addressed or answered without research, analysis and assessment. Intelligence must provide added value to what would be provided by the raw information: the -so what?- For example, a commercial satellite image of a military cantonment area may reveal numbers and even types of military vehicles present. To be characterized as true intelligence, however, it requires an assessment, for example, of the overall capability of those vehicles, the readiness state, and even the intent of the deployment. OSINT, simply put, is derived from information that is publicly or commercially available to all. It may need to be paid for or require specialist tactics, techniques, and procedures to collect and analyze it, but any member of the public must be able to access the source information. Responsible OSINT must also be obtained from legal and ethical means and applied in legal and ethical ways. Within those definitions, there is an implied imperative that OSINT must be subject to rigorous tradecraft and analytical standards. 38 North: The definition of -open-source intelligence- seems somewhat challenged these days, with some even asserting there is no such thing as OSINT. What is your view on this? Sean Corbett: It is a great question, and as you indicate, not as simple to answer as it may first appear. There is no universally established definition of OSINT as an intelligence discipline, although the Intelligence Community has now updated and published its definition, which is helpful. This may be in part because, unlike the other single source disciplines—for example, signals intelligence (SIGINT), geospatial intelligence (GEOINT), and human intelligence (HUMINT)—it encompasses elements of each, the difference being it is derived from publicly or commercially available information. That is one reason why some still do not recognize OSINT as a separate category; instead, they link the respective specializations with their classified counterparts, for example, commercial imagery analysis coming under GEOINT. There are even those who consider that, for a dataset to be defined as intelligence at all, it needs to be from classified sources and under direct governmental control. In my view, however, OSINT is not only a legitimate intelligence specialization but is also an increasingly important one. The sheer amount of information now available at the unclassified level is simply too great to be ignored and can provide a broader perspective than that provided by classified intelligence and to a wider audience. At some stage in the future, the use of open-source material may be normalized and fully integrated into government organizations. We are starting to see signs of that, such as the new guidance just released by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence. It should be noted that comparing OSINT with the other types of intelligence is a false comparison. OSINT comprises each of the disciplines listed above but at the publicly or commercially available level. The specific advantages of OSINT, though, are clear: It encompasses a much broader spectrum of data points than are available within the classified domain, and being unclassified (which does not necessarily mean not sensitive) can be disseminated and shared far more easily. This includes dissemination by governmental organizations that may wish to share assessments with -non-traditional- partners without revealing highly classified sources or techniques. It is worth reinforcing the fact that OSINT is not a substitute for classified intelligence, derived from exquisite and highly classified collection capabilities, but complementary. 38 North: What does the OSINT process or cycle look like? For example, by what process would you produce an intelligence report on a North Korean weapons production facility? Sean Corbett: Another insightful question, as the traditional model of the intelligence cycle is now being challenged by the sheer volume of data available and the way we access it. Traditionally, the intelligence cycle is how intelligence has been managed. It is a pretty much universally agreed model that, to this day, provides a useful, standardized framework through which the function of conducting intelligence is described. Doctrinally, it has been adopted by intelligence organizations internationally, as well as by many law enforcement and other security-related organizations. As the name suggests, it comprises a cyclical, repeatable process with four basic steps: direction, collection, processing, and dissemination. Although there are nuances with the way these are articulated, they can be applied to any form of intelligence and are as applicable to OSINT as other disciplines.[1] Turning to your specific example of a North Korean weapons production facility, the question implies that the facility is already known, although there is often new construction at existing facilities, and the building of new facilities is not uncommon. If I were addressing it as a new intelligence target, I would first review all available existing source data and reporting to determine what is already known and assess the function and output of a particular site. Once you have a good understanding of what data already exists and, more importantly, the knowledge gaps, source validation and content are absolutely essential. Regardless of the provenance of existing analyses, it is not good enough to take reporting at face value. Every report needs to be critically evaluated. You will have heard me say many times that North Korea is arguably the hardest intelligence target due to the closed and controlled nature of the regime and North Korean society.[2] That puts a premium on reliable, assured source data, and the analyst needs to be very aware of circular reporting (i.e., the same few reports being referenced and considered as new material). Specifically, from a satellite imagery point of view, the North Koreans are extremely adept at counter-surveillance and masking what they are doing, to the extent that many of their more sensitive facilities are hidden underground. The scale of underground and buried facilities throughout North Korea is quite extraordinary. However, for something like a weapons production facility, even if built underground, there will be telltale signs such as access points, ventilation points and roads, and probably associated air defense sites, all of which may be identifiable on commercial satellite imagery. For uncovered facilities, of course, the challenge is more straightforward, although it still takes a high degree of specialist imagery analytical techniques, an understanding of the processes involved in weapons manufacture, and a familiarity with the layout of the respective functional areas and component buildings. Moreover, analyzing a single facility in isolation will only get you so far in characterizing a particular capability. An end-to-end systems approach, from raw material and component importation to production, testing and fielding, and an analysis of other associated facilities, will give you a much better idea of the overall capability. 38 North: Let us pull on the thread of satellite imagery in the context of North Korea. What are the applications of satellite imagery to North Korea research, and how does satellite imagery complement other types of intelligence on North Korea? Sean Corbett: As I alluded to above, North Korea is an extremely difficult intelligence challenge that offers two primary sources of publicly available information: a) what the regime allows to be carried via its propaganda outlets; and b) intelligence collected through commercial earth observation capabilities, predominantly space-based. A sizeable amount of foundational intelligence available at the unclassified level also comes from historical defector reporting, much of which is now very dated or, as is common with most HUMINT, is not always reliable and, therefore, can no longer be relied upon. The acceleration in commercial satellite remote sensing capabilities has been of great benefit for the OSINT practitioner over recent years. Image resolution, frequency of cover (revisit rates), and the increase in sensor types have all been pivotal. Advances in synthetic aperture radar (SAR), for example, have been particularly useful in notoriously cloudy regions, such as North Korea. Future developments in hyperspectral and infrared sensors will also provide new perspectives. Despite the unfavorable atmospheric conditions in North Korea, there is still a lot that can be determined from satellite imagery and the country is extensively covered on a regular basis. This has helped us to create a comprehensive imagery baseline. Having that allows us to focus on what is new or what has changed. The principles of imagery analysis are the same regardless of the area or point of interest, and the tried and tested approach is to use the Hamshaw-Thomas technique that focuses on eight factors: location, size, shape, shadow, color and tone, texture, patterns, and associated objects. A particular challenge with analysis of North Korea is their often dated and non-standard equipment and the unique nature of the defense industrial base. This can make positive identification difficult. An excellent case in point is in trying to identify processes and outputs from their heavy industrial sites. These are hard subjects anyway due to the multi-role utility of materials and equipment, made even harder by the bespoke nature of much of their construction because of international sanctions and other import constraints. However, at the strategic level, characterizing the national infrastructure provides invaluable insight into defense capabilities. By taking a systemic approach and focusing on likely processes, e.g., identifying raw materials and connectivity with processes (heating, fractional distillation, drying, packaging), it is possible to build up a picture of likely production capabilities. Earth observation capabilities, however, can only reveal so much, and as previously stated, the North Koreans are very surveillance-aware. As an overall rule, it is dangerous to rely on a single data source when making an assessment of any capability, and every piece of information needs to be considered and weighted for accuracy and relevance. 38 North: What types of training are needed for up-and-coming OSINT analysts? Sean Corbett: The pursuance of rigorous and auditable tradecraft and analytical standards should be common to all analysts, and a coherence of techniques and procedures between the intelligence community (IC) and industry will go a long way to integrating -trusted- commercial OSINT into the mainstream. There is a debate within the IC that is starting to be reflected in industry with respect to the skills and training required. Is it now better, for example, to have a -subject matter expert- with a deep understanding of the geopolitical, economic, military, and cultural situation of the region or country under consideration, or is it better to have someone who understands analytical techniques, data analytics, and how to best use large language models to make the best of the huge amounts of data available? The answer in a perfect world, of course, would be both, but individuals with that range of skillsets or who can learn them are few and far between. In terms of specific training, responsible OSINT is very much more than learning how to effectively search the Internet; it involves a plethora of different activities. Internet searching is obviously one element, but analysts need to be trained in doing so effectively (an ability to data mine the full spectrum of online data sources), safely and legally, and without being compromised by potential hostile intelligence services or bad actors. Once the data has been collected, often in an automated manner, it needs to be assured, and misinformation, disinformation, and bad data must be filtered out. It needs to be wrangled and triaged to facilitate analysis of the most applicable data. To be done effectively, all of this requires specialist training and the use of ever-expanding tools and applications. Further specialist training is required, for example, in the analysis and interpretations of earth observation. This is, again, not a simple case of -looking at an image.- Basic imagery analyst courses for the IC typically involve monthslong intensive training, and additional specialist training on topics such as SAR and infrared imagery (IR) analysis is added on. Only when all of this has been conducted can the analytical -so what- be applied. This requires the application of structured analytical techniques such as reframing, forecasting, and backcasting, although there are many others. Finally, education in legal and ethical constraints in the conduct of responsible OSINT is essential. The bottom line is that being an effective and credible OSINT analyst requires significant specialist training.

Workings of North Korea’s Illegal Foreign Currency Transactions	In 2017, the international financial communications platform SWIFT, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, disconnected the last four remaining North Korean banks on its system as part of the international community’s efforts to curb the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s (DPRK or North Korea) growing nuclear and missile programs. Despite being expelled from the global banking system, however, North Korea has still managed to find ways to bring hard currency into the country. The DPRK has resorted to a variety of tactics, from the more traditional methods like dumping coal, minerals, and sand camouflaged as trash, using diplomatic pouches, and utilizing currency exchange counters, to using legal and illegal Chinese bank accounts to ensure cash flows into the country. In all cases, China stands at the heart of North Korea’s illicit money laundering and transfer activities. In that vein, the international community should continue to remind China of its obligations as a responsible player on the global stage that it purports to be and persuade Beijing to enforce sanctions against Pyongyang. How North Korea Earns Foreign Currency—and Brings It Home This section introduces three main cases of how North Korea earns foreign currency and the methods by which the country brings the money back home. Case One: Smuggling Smuggling coal and minerals remains North Korea’s top source of illegal income. The country reportedly earned approximately $2.15 billion from 2017 to 2023 through this activity. A widely known smuggling method involves North Korea working with Chinese business people to fake documents or tamper with ship tracking systems to hide their location. But there are also lesser-known tactics at work. One primary example is how the DPRK and China collaborate to bring North Korean coal and minerals into China. Coal from North Korea, mostly anthracite, makes up approximately nine percent of China’s total coal imports. North Korean coal is known for its quality and low price, and China accounts for more than 50 percent of the world’s total coal demand. This explains China’s need for North Korea’s coal. North Koreans forge deals with Chinese smugglers that enable them to dump coal or minerals, camouflaged as trash, on a small island near the China-DPRK border on the Yalu River. Chinese smugglers then pick them up and take them into China almost every day. The Chinese pay North Korea in yuan or dollars, allowing them to buy supplies cheaply while avoiding taxes. It is important to note the extent to which the Chinese government enables and facilitates money laundering. Under China’s -Measures for the Administration of Border Trade Foreign Exchange Management,- there is no Chinese government oversight on how much cash flows into North Korea as part of border trade as long as Chinese business representatives can prove that transactions were conducted in yuan. This institutional system, in short, facilitates money laundering for both China and North Korea. Case Two: Overseas Workers Another major source of income for North Korea is by sending workers abroad. In doing so, the country is estimated to have earned approximately $1.75 billion from 2017 to 2023. Following United Nations (UN) Resolution 2397, passed in December 2017, countries that employed North Korean workers had to send them back within 24 months (December 2019). As a result, 42 nations, including Mongolia, Kuwait, and Nepal, returned about 23,200 North Korean workers. However, according to the final report of the UN Panel of Experts on North Korea, published in March 2024, more than 100,000 North Korean laborers are still working in approximately 40 countries. According to the Seoul-based Institute For National Security Strategy, wages vary depending on the sector and country, but North Korean information technology (IT) workers in China earn approximately $3,000 to $3,500 a month. More than 70 or 80 percent of their wages, however, are taken by the North Korean authorities. How is this money sent back to North Korea, then? Diplomatic pouches are the most common method. These pouches are sent directly to Pyongyang or Beijing, and can be taken advantage of because they are exempt from inspections under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The second most commonly used method involves using borrowed accounts. This method involves transferring money to North Korea using a third party’s Chinese name. The DPRK also uses currency exchange counters. A North Korean worker sends money through a local exchange counter. The money is then transferred to an exchange center in Beijing. There, another North Korean collects the money and takes it to the embassy. This was a popular method until 2019 but has since become less common because many currency exchange counters impose high transfer fees on transactions involving North Korea. Consequently, their usage has been limited to absolutely necessary occasions. Despite the exorbitant fees, however, North Korea may resort to this tactic again if needed. Case Three: Cyber Theft North Korea made approximately $1.35 billion between 2017 and 2023 by hacking virtual assets around the world. This is an enormous amount for North Korea, whose annual exports amounted to only about $82 million in 2021. Laundering cash through banks or brokers is costly and risks international sanctions. On the other hand, virtual assets are anonymous, easy to transfer, and ideal for money laundering, which is why North Korea now favors hacking cryptocurrency. In 2022, global losses from crypto hacking amounted to $3.8 billion. North Korean hackers were responsible for $1.7 billion of that total. Once it converts stolen crypto into cash, North Korea launders it through mixers or cross-chain bridges. Much of that money is believed to have reached North Korea. The North Korean IT workforce’s skill sets have advanced rapidly after a 2007 agreement with China, under which China provided North Korea with computers, gave training, and shared relevant technology. This bilateral China-DPRK cooperation has played a pivotal role in advancing North Korea’s illicit cyber activities. China recognized the rising utility and importance of digital currencies more than a decade ago and has been pursuing strategies to integrate more as a medium of exchange in international transactions. For example, the United Kingdom (UK) holds the third largest bitcoin reserve after the United States and China. Most of the UK’s bitcoins, however, came from a Chinese individual who was convicted in the UK of laundering a portion of the proceeds she obtained from bitcoin fraud committed between 2017 and 2022. Moreover, as China has tried to ban bitcoin in recent years, it has introduced its own digital yuan. Regardless of specific form, however, this move toward digital currencies is likely a lesson it has passed on to its partners, such as North Korea. Additional Laundering and Remittance Tactics The DPRK also launders money using virtual accounts in regular Chinese banks.[1] These accounts are not subject to the real-name rule; thus, China does not track who sends the money, which is directly transferred to the account user. If North Koreans open virtual accounts under fake or third-party Chinese names, it becomes very difficult for the international community to trace transactions conducted through such accounts. Chinese banks launched the virtual accounts system to simplify online payments and facilitate financial transactions for businesses and customers. However, this system has been abused due to the obvious loopholes. Another tactic by which North Koreans launder and remit money is through underground banks in China, also called shadow finance. The lack of transparency in China’s underground banking system makes it challenging for the global community to trace money transfers between China and North Korea. Shadow finance takes form in two simple ways. First, North Koreans team up with Chinese brokers to use fake Chinese names to set up accounts at underground banks like rural cooperatives. They then receive illegal money in these accounts from in or outside China. North Koreans, pretending to be Chinese, withdraw the cash, saying it is for investment, and hand it over to North Korean officials. They use this method because China’s financial messaging network does not allow money to be transferred directly to North Korea. This means all financial transactions with North Korea must be made in cash. Furthermore, small offices or teams of people acting as North Korean branches of these illegal banks help move money to North Korea. These funds are very difficult for the international community and even China itself to trace. Second, North Koreans living abroad transfer money to bank accounts in China and then inform Chinese brokers of the transfer details. After verifying this information, Chinese brokers bypass the Chinese banking system and hand over their own cash directly to the intended North Korean recipients near the border or inside North Korea. The brokers then withdraw that same amount from the North Koreans’ Chinese accounts. In return for their services, they receive some perks for conducting North Korean-related business. This way of moving money is similar to old-school currency swapping, but without any charges, and because Chinese brokers handle cash, it is almost impossible to trace. Conclusion In March 2024, Russia vetoed a UN Security Council resolution to extend the North Korea UN Panel of Experts’ mandate for another year, shutting down the 15-year-old Panel. The loss of this international, relatively neutral, authoritative investigatory body will make it harder for the international community to track North Korea’s sanctions evasions and other types of illegal activities, especially in gaining the kind of global cooperation needed to conduct in-depth investigations. To fill this gap, the Multilateral Sanctions Monitoring Team (MSMT), consisting of 11 nations, including the United States, South Korea, Japan, France, the UK, and Germany, was launched in October 2024. Without the UN’s official support, however, there are questions about how effective this team can truly be in achieving its goal, or whether it will have the authority that the Panel enjoyed. Under the MSMT’s leadership, monitoring North Korea’s illegal ship-to-ship transfers and financial activities is critical and requires targeted measures. While the US Treasury’s FinCEN (Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) tracks North Korea’s cyber hacking, fully stopping these activities demands global cooperation and direct action from China. On that note, China’s active role is essential to effectively enforce sanctions against North Korea, curb Pyongyang’s illegal activities, and guide it toward a better path. Continued dialogue with China is key to these efforts. If China seeks to position itself as a genuine leader on the global stage, it must take responsibility and act decisively on these issues.

Quick Take: Pyongyang’s Subdued Coverage of South Korea’s Post-Martial Law Situation	How does North Korea feel about South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s enactment of martial law and the fallout, including the National Assembly’s vote to impeach Yoon? The North’s reaction to the ongoing South Korean political turmoil has been subdued. Notably, it remains silent on reports that the former South Korean defense minister sent drones into Pyongyang in October in an attempt to start a limited conflict with North Korea and lay the groundwork for martial law enactment. North Korea seems to be in an escalation prevention mode for now, probably because of its focus on maximizing economic production by the end of the year, and its continued supply of military resources to Russia. The party plenary meeting at the end of this month and the next Supreme People’s Assembly (SPA) session, slated for late January, may lend more insight into Kim Jong Un’s next steps on foreign policy and policy toward Seoul. Subdued Media Coverage Pyongyang’s initial reaction to Yoon’s declaration of martial law eight days after the fact was slower than one would have expected. North Korean media, since May 2023, have regularly reported on anti-Yoon protests in South Korea—even after Kim Jong Un in late 2023 and early 2024 renounced a decades-old policy of peaceful unification and defined South Korea as a -foreign country.-[2] The two-day lag between the National Assembly’s passage of the impeachment bill and North Korea’s reaction also was slightly longer than the one-day interval in December 2016, when the National Assembly voted to impeach then-President Park Geun-hye. As of December 18, North Korea has carried only three news reports—low in the hierarchy of North Korean propaganda vehicles—since its initial reaction to Yoon’s martial law enactment. Such sparse coverage also is inconsistent with North Korean media’s regular reporting since May 2023 on anti-Yoon protests in the South.[3] Worth noting is that North Korea has not reacted to the former South Korean defense minister’s reported attempt to draw North Korea into a limited conflict by sending drones into Pyongyang and justify martial law.[4] The North’s silence on this issue is uncharacteristic. It tends to issue official statements or media commentaries on South Korea over issues that concern North Korea. It was in this vein that it issued a flurry of official statements in October alleging South Korean drones had violated Pyongyang airspace. Preventing Escalation The reasons for North Korea’s low-key handling of the political situation in South Korea are unclear. It may be waiting to see how events unfold, is undecided on what to say, or looking for the right moment to release a stronger response. The definition of South Korea as a separate country under Kim’s new two Koreas policy could be a factor. Yet, it would not fully explain this behavior, as North Korea has diligently reported on Yoon’s political challenges up until his martial law enactment. Keying in on its silence on South Korean media reports about the drone incursions, it appears that North Korea wants to prevent escalation. It has been supplying weapons and troops to Russia. Moreover, the overriding theme in North Korean propaganda these days is the economy. The country needs to maximize economic output before Kim reviews the year’s achievements in his report to the annual year-end party plenary meeting later this month. All in all, North Korea is seeking stability at the moment. Escalation prevention would be consistent with North Korea’s measured response to the drones’ violation of Pyongyang airspace in October. It issued some official statements, Kim convened a meeting of top defense and security officials, and there were some angry reactions from the public. North Korea, however, quickly shifted its focus to the economy instead of escalating tensions, which it easily could have justified. This occurred around the time North Korea reportedly dispatched troops to Russia, which probably explains its restraint. Although North Korea seems uninterested in escalating tensions for now—and during Park’s impeachment between December 2016 and March 2017, it did not engage in any notable military activities that heightened tensions—its calculus could change if the political turmoil in South Korea becomes protracted. Unlike in 2016, North Korea has no desire to improve relations with the United States at the expense of its nuclear programs; it has defined South Korea as a -hostile state- separate from North Korea, and it has a new treaty with Russia. The upcoming party plenary meeting and the SPA session in late January may provide more clues about Kim’s next moves. North Korea announced that it will revise -some provisions- of the constitution at the next SPA session. It made amendments to this legal document in October, but details remain largely unknown. It is possible that the upcoming SPA session may make constitutional revisions with implications for inter-Korean relations.

Yoon’s Political Implosion: Making Pyongyang’s Day	The pantomime that has been South Korean politics for the past fortnight has brought swift smiles to the lips of both Kim Jong Un and Vladimir Putin. For Kim, in particular, this is the perfect gift and validates the strategic choices made in his last New Year’s Address. The South may outgun the North by a factor of ten and more, but the fiasco that was an on-off martial law declaration merely made public that the South’s military leadership is ill-disciplined, insubordinate and confused, and the dithering of Seoul’s governing party was worse. What’s not to like in Pyongyang? The North’s much lauded secret weapon, ‘single minded unity,’ has never looked more powerful in the face of Seoul’s indecision and incompetence. This did not just happen overnight. Recent reports reveal early stages of this plan have been in play for several months as Yoon tried to hide his domestic woes by raising tensions on the Peninsula. This includes the provocative use of the South’s drones to spread propaganda leaflets in Kim Il Sung Square. When that did not elicit a military response, Yoon ordered the South’s military to fire on the sites of the North’s ‘trash’ balloons launches, directions that were apparently refused. The term ‘leaderless resistance’ is normally applied to the tactics of terrorist groups fearful of infiltration by the state. In Seoul, the term is stood on its head with a state structure inchoate and incompetent. Now with the National Assembly, at the second time of asking, voting for impeachment, the South’s decision making goes into limbo for up to 180 days as the Constitutional Court ponders the legitimacy of the vote. All this makes Kim’s day as it confirms his strategic pivot while comprehensively sidelining Seoul in any future talks with Trump. The Backstory After the car-crash in Hanoi in 2019, Kim Jong Un abandoned the family’s forty-year-long venture to normalize relations with Washington. Across four decades—after the fall of the Soviet Union—American presidents proved immune to any deal, but in 2017, Trump seemed different. Gently coaxed by Pyongyang’s foreign affairs establishment, Ri Su Yong in the International Department of the Party and Ri Yong Ho in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kim was convinced a deal was possible that would see cross-recognition under the protective covering of punctuated progress over a decade and more of slow step-by-step initial freezing and incremental backtracking of the North’s nuclear program. But 2017 turned out to be a false dawn. Kim viewed the failure of the 2019 Hanoi Summit as the Republican establishment encircling Trump sabotaging the process and preventing the conclusion of any deal. Concluding Washington’s willing were unable to make meaningful changes, Kim purged the doves within his regime in favor of hawks and began to change the course of the country’s external affairs. Subsequent global events reinforced Kim’s view of the world and shifting power dynamics. The chaotic US retreat from Afghanistan demonstrated the vulnerability of American military might to the wrong warfare, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed spineless decision makers among Ukraine’s partners, and Israel’s devastation of Gaza proved that Washington’s allies could now slip the leash. Mixed Messages for Kim No longer the only game in town, Kim saw Washington’s loss of control and reaction to China’s challenge as the opening encounters in a second Cold War—a lens through which Kim Jong Un now views the world. The crass and chaotic failed coup d’état by President Yoon in Seoul confirms his analysis and strengthens his hand. Yet there are spots on the sun. First, Kim needs to massage and spin the events in Seoul for the readers of Rodong Sinmun. Pyongyang has never been enthusiastic over advertising the world’s color revolutions; wary the North’s own citizens might be infected with similar gaudy ideas. Here and now it is possibly worse. Kim started the year designating the South as the -most hostile state-. It replaced the previous portrayal of the South Korean citizenry as misguided and misled, intimidated under the thrall of Washington and its domestic dupes with a picture of monochrome malevolence. But the fierce resistance to martial law and overwhelming outcry for impeachment over the last two weeks is clearly at odds with Kim’s propaganda created to help sell why unification should be abandoned. As second challenge is the ouster of Assad from Syria. The Assad regime had been a Russian proxy propped up by Moscow and Tehran. Its house of cards collapse suggests a fragility to that support and an inability and/or unwillingness for Moscow to fight a two-front war, even in the long shadow of a threatened Trump-inspired ceasefire in Ukraine. It must strike Kim that were the Peninsula’s mutual provocations to turn to skirmishes and threaten escalation to war, like in 1950, Russian engagement could turn out to be coaching from the sidelines with the heavy lifting of mutual assistance sub-contracted to Beijing, which is likely to limit help to the minimum for survival, far short of the resources for victory. Conclusion Despite domestic disturbances, semi-insurrections and coups in South Korea, North Korea has never seized these opportunities to renew civil war. Nevertheless, Yoon’s failed attempt to consolidate power will give Kim confidence to continue on his chosen path of joining what decades ago Jimmy Carter’s National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski called the nightmare coalition for the US of China, Russia and Iran. The North’s chilly relations with Beijing are likely to become more tepid, while Pyongyang, Moscow and Beijing will all welcome and be grateful for the postponement and cancellations in Seoul’s further integration into NATO, the Quad+ or any kind of East Asian Security framework, and the early prospects of a progressive presidency in the South.
