Trump's Special Envoy Saw a Link Between a Peace Agreement and the Issue of Ukraine's NATO Membership Kurt Volker, the former US Special Envoy for Ukraine under President Donald Trump, believes that a peace agreement between Ukraine and Russia could be a prerequisite for Ukraine's accession to NATO. He stated this in an interview with 'European Pravda.' 'I think that until the war is over, it is very difficult to talk about Ukraine's membership in NATO. Because then NATO would be at war with Russia,' Volker explained. According to him, the question is whether there could be an agreement to end the war that would allow Ukraine to develop as a Western, free, secure, and prosperous country. 'If there is such an agreement, it removes this obstacle to joining NATO,' the former special envoy emphasized. Volker also noted that Ukraine's future lies in the West, in the EU and NATO, as the majority of Ukrainians believe. Earlier, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Ukraine is ready to join NATO even tomorrow, if it is offered to do so. The US special envoy stated that Ukraine will not be able to become a member of NATO in the event of a peace agreement. Zelenskyy previously said that the US does not support accession.	https://unn.ua/en/news/trumps-special-envoy-believes-its-accepted-that-if-there-is-a-peace-agreement-ukraine-cannot-be-a-member-of-nato	2025-03-22T01:16:16-07:00	https://unn.ua/img/2025/03/22/1742631587-3239-large.webp
