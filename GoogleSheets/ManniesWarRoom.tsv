The Shin Bet security agency reveals it recently foiled an attempt by Iran to smuggle large amounts of advanced weapons, including rockets, to terror operatives in the West Bank to be used in attacks on Israeli targets.In a joint operation, the Shin Bet and Israel Defense Forces captured a shipment of advanced weapons that the agency says were destined for terror operatives in the Jenin area. Later, a site where a large number of weapons from Iran had been buried was uncovered, the Shin Bet says.The Shin Bet does not provide further details on where the weapons were hidden or where the shipment was captured.Among the weapons captured were 40 -quality- Claymore-type explosive devices and 33 makeshift Claymores, along with remote detonation systems; six RPG launchers and 24 RPGs; three 107mm rockets; two 60mm mortar launchers and 20 mortars; six M16 assault rifles and one M4 rifle; seven sniper rifles; and 37 handguns.According to the Shin Bet, behind the plot was Iran’s Unit 4000, the Special Operations Division of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps’ Intelligence Organization, headed by Jawad Ghafari, and the special operations unit of the IRGC’s Quds Force in Syria, known as Unit 18840, which is subordinate to the head of Iran’s clandestine Unit 840, Asghar Bakri.The Shin Bet says that it has in recent months identified renewed attempts to smuggle advanced weapons into the West Bank.-The seized weapons are part of an ongoing Iranian campaign to destabilize security in the region, by arming terror cells in Judea and Samaria, whose goal is to carry out attacks against Israeli citizens and IDF forces,- the agency adds.

Overnight before the ceasefire, the Israeli Air Force struck dozens of Hezbollah targets across Lebanon, including a major precision missile site, according to the IDF.Several waves of strikes, targeting some 330 Hezbollah sites, were carried out yesterday and into the night, right up until the ceasefire took effect at 4 a.m.One of the strikes overnight in the Beqaa Valley, close to the Syrian border, targeted an underground Hezbollah precision-guided missile manufacturing and storage site. The IDF says it spent several hours bombing the underground kilometer-long site, along with an adjacent Radwan Force base where it estimates that several dozen Hezbollah operatives were killed.Another strike shortly after midnight hit a border crossing between Syria and Lebanon, which the IDF says was used by Hezbollah to smuggle weapons. Syrian media reported six dead in the strike.Among the 330 Hezbollah sites struck on the day before the ceasefire, 42 were in Beirut, according to the military.The IDF says that another strike yesterday killed the operations chief of Hezbollah's aerial forces, known as Unit 127, which is responsible for drone and cruise missile attacks on Israel.The military, meanwhile, says it is focusing on enforcing the ceasefire agreement, as had been decided by the political echelon.Israeli Air Force planes are still patrolling the skies, and troops are still at positions in southern Lebanon. The IDF has 60 days to withdraw under the deal. During that time, the Lebanese Army will gradually take responsibility for southern Lebanon and an American-led committee that will adjudicate complaints regarding potential ceasefire violations will be established.The military says it is working to prevent people from reaching areas where troops are still positioned in southern Lebanon, and several routes to villages have been blocked.Soldiers have fired warning shots at people trying to approach several southern Lebanon villages. Several suspects were hit by IDF fire in Meiss al-Jabal, according to the military.	https://t.me/manniefabian/49619	2024-11-27T02:10:45-08:00

The Defense Ministry says it has begun -detailed engineering planning- to establish a fence along the entire border with Jordan to prevent infiltrations into the country — an expensive undertaking that has made little progress in the past.The work comes following the directive of new Defense Minister Israel Katz.The ministry says the planning works, which will cost tens of millions of shekels, will include laying an initial section of the fence with surveillance equipment, mapping out potential environmental hazards, and soil surveys.The works are expected to last several months, -and they are intended to advance the readiness of the defense establishment for the establishment of a barrier on the border with Jordan, in accordance with the decisions of the political echelon on the issue,- the ministry adds.There is an aging fence along the 309-kilometer (192-mile) border that Jordan shares with Israel and the West Bank, though military and police officials say it is sufficient to prevent most gun-smuggling attempts.The idea of boosting the fence or building some sort of border wall has been floated repeatedly by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and others for more than a decade, although many see any such major effort as unlikely due to the sheer length of the border and the enormous cost.	https://t.me/manniefabian/49540	2024-11-25T23:29:46-08:00

In what has been an open secret for years, the IDF says it has been operating against Hezbollah's weapons smuggling unit in Syria to prevent Iranian arms from reaching the terror group in Lebanon.A series of strikes during the war have targeted Hezbollah's Unit 4400, which is tasked with delivering weapons from Iran and its proxies to Lebanon. Unit 4400 was established in 2000, and with Iranian support, it built numerous -strategic routes- along the Syria-Lebanon border, the military says. Thousands of trucks and hundreds of planes carrying missiles and other components for Hezbollah have traveled from Iran to Syria, and later to Lebanon in recent years, the IDF says.The strikes against Unit 44000 amid the war have included the assassinations of the head of the unit, Muhammad Ja'far Qassir in Beirut in early October, and his replacement, Ali Hassan Gharib, in Damascus several weeks later, alongside other top commanders.The IDF says that it has been striking Hezbollah's smuggling routes between Syria and Lebanon -not only in the last few months but in a yearslong effort.-One strike in early October destroyed a 3.5-kilometer-long tunnel that crossed between Lebanon and Syria, which the IDF says was used by Hezbollah to smuggle and store Iranian weapons. The major tunnel began construction in 2009 and was completed a decade later, according to the IDF.The IDF says its series of strikes against Unit 4400 have -damaged the ability of the Hezbollah terror organization to strengthen its stockpile of weapons and thus to fire at the citizens of the State of Israel.-	https://t.me/manniefabian/49532	2024-11-25T09:49:46-08:00

Yoav Yarom, has asked to resign following an incident last week during which a civilian researcher was allowed into southern Lebanon, without the proper approvals, and was killed alongside a soldier.Yarom had allowed Israeli researcher Zeev Erlich, 71, to enter the western sector of southern Lebanon to examine an archaeological site -- an ancient fortress.Despite the belief that the area had been cleared, two Hezbollah operatives were hiding at the site and opened fire at the researcher, senior officer, and other soldiers who were accompanying them.Erlich and Sgt. Gur Kehati were killed in the incident. Yarom and a company commander with the Golani Brigade's 13th Battalion were wounded.In a letter to the commander of the Golani Brigade, Yarom says he takes responsibility for the incident despite the fact that an official investigation has not been completed, and asks to resign from the role.IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi has appointed a general in reserves to lead a team of experts investigating the circumstances of the incident and Erlich’s entry into Lebanon. In addition, there is a military investigation into the incident led by IDF Northern Command chief Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin, and a separate criminal probe by Military Police.	https://t.me/manniefabian/49528	2024-11-25T07:41:34-08:00
🎬 The IDF Technological and Logistics Directorate publishes new ...	The IDF Technological and Logistics Directorate publishes new data on its operations amid the ongoing fighting in the Gaza Strip and in Lebanon since the beginning of the war, from the average time to take wounded soldiers to hospitals, to how many tanks have returned to service after being badly damaged.According to the military, the Logistics Corps carries out supply operations every single day to troops operating in Gaza and Lebanon, totaling over 2,000 from the ground, six airdrops, and a handful via the sea. The supply missions bring thousands of tons of equipment, food, ammunition, fuel, and other supplies to troops on the frontlines. In recent weeks, some 300,000 winter-related items were delivered to troops, according to the IDF.The Technology and Maintenance Corps reports that tanks, armored personnel carriers, and other armored vehicles across the military are at 88 percent competency after nearly 14 months of fighting. The military says that 90% of tanks and APCs damaged by anti-tank missile fire or large explosive devices amid the fighting have been repaired and returned to service. On average, armored vehicles that sustained heavy damage take some 20 days for repairs before they are returned to service. Some very heavily damaged armored vehicles undergo a long recovery process.More minor issues with the IDF's armored vehicles are fixed in the battle zone or at forward operating bases or logistics centers, without needing to bring the tanks or APCs out of Gaza or Lebanon for repair. The IDF says that 90% of the minor issues are fixed in the battle zone.The Medical Corps reports that some 5,300 wounded soldiers have been treated amid the ground offensive in the Gaza Strip and another 700 in Lebanon. For comparison, during the entire 2006 Second Lebanon War, 833 soldiers were treated, and in the 2014 Gaza War, 709 soldiers were treated.The case fatality rate (CFR) — the proportion of wounded who end up dying — has also significantly decreased compared to past wars, with the Medical Corps reporting that it stands at a CFR of 6.9% in Gaza and 7.1% in Lebanon. For comparison, the Second Lebanon War saw a CFR of 14.8% and the 2014 Gaza War saw 9.2%.The Medical Corps attributes this lower rate to better and faster treatment for wounded soldiers, including the use of whole blood transfusions on the battlefield for the first time — some 300 soldiers have been given such transfusions so far — and that senior medical officers are stationed with every company, allowing the procedure and other life-saving treatment immediately without needing to wait to reach hospitals.On average, according to the Medical Corps, senior medics are able to reach wounded soldiers within under four minutes during the current fighting, compared to 10-25 minutes on average in the Second Lebanon War.In terms of bringing wounded soldiers to hospitals in Israel, the Medical Corps says that via helicopter it stands at 66 minutes on average from Gaza and 84 minutes from Lebanon, and with ground vehicles, 91 minutes from Gaza and 111 minutes from Lebanon.

Defense Minister Israel Katz announces an end to administrative detention orders for West Bank settlers, a controversial policy of holding suspects without charge.While the practice is primarily deployed against Palestinians, it is also used against some extremist Jewish Israelis.In a statement, Katz says that -in a reality where the Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria is subject to serious Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions are taken against the settlers, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe measure against the people of the settlements.-Katz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar this week and told him that he had decided -to stop the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria, and asked him to put alternative tools in place,- his office says.Administrative detention policies allow the Defense Ministry to hold suspects without charge while administrative restraining orders bar them from visiting certain areas or communicating with certain people. The tool is typically used when authorities have intelligence tying a suspect to a crime, but do not have enough evidence for charges to stand up in a court of law.Katz says that -if there is suspicion of criminal acts, the perpetrators can be prosecuted, and if not, there are other preventive measures that can be taken other than administrative detention orders.--I condemn any phenomenon of violence against Palestinians and taking the law into one's own hands, and I also appeal to the settlement leadership to take a similar public position and express an unequivocal position on the issue,- the minister adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/49419	2024-11-22T00:25:56-08:00

There are significant chances of Israel reaching a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, a senior defense official tells reporters.The official says a United States-backed deal that would see Hezbollah gradually withdraw north of the Litani River and the Lebanese Army retake responsibility for south Lebanon, is in reach.US special envoy Amos Hochstein is in Israel today meeting separately with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz along with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, to discuss the ceasefire negotiations.Hochstein held meetings with the Lebanese side in recent days, and said that -additional progress- had been made.Under the potential ceasefire, the Lebanese Army would be responsible for preventing Hezbollah from re-establishing itself in southern Lebanon.According to the defense official, if Israel sees Hezbollah attempting to rebuild infrastructure in southern Lebanon, it would notify the Lebanese Army via the US to act against the terror group. If no action is taken by the Lebanese Army, Israel reserves the right to act, according to the official. The official says the IDF will also maintain the right to act to thwart any immediate threat, such as identifying Hezbollah operatives preparing to carry out an attack or a weapons shipment destined for the terror group.Lebanese civilians will be able to return to their damaged villages in southern Lebanon under the potential agreement, and Israel does not plan to hold a security zone in southern Lebanon. Instead, Israel says it will act against any Hezbollah presence in southern Lebanon as necessary, either directly or by notifying the Lebanese Army via the US.The UN peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, will likely still have presence in southern Lebanon after a potential ceasefire is signed, though Israel does not see them as an important player in enforcing the removal of Hezbollah.	https://t.me/manniefabian/49405	2024-11-21T06:19:16-08:00

🖼 The vast majority of the Palestinian civilian population that ...	The vast majority of the Palestinian civilian population that had been residing in northern Gaza's Jabalia has evacuated, as the IDF presses on with an offensive against Hamas in the area and other towns north of Gaza City.The IDF says it has managed to move more than 55,000 civilians out of Jabalia after Hamas was allegedly forcing them to stay there to act as a human shield for their activities. Some 60,000 Palestinians were estimated to have been in Jabalia before the latest operation was launched last month.The population has largely moved to Gaza City, with only a few dozen crossing the IDF's Netzarim Corridor and heading to the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in the Strip's south.According to the IDF, it has evidence and testimonies that Hamas shot, beat, and in some cases executed civilians trying to flee the Jabalia area. The IDF says it seeks to clear the town of civilians to enable a cleaner operation against terror operatives, without risking the lives of innocents, while Hamas attempts to hide behind the population. Senior officers deny that the army is carrying out the so-called generals' plan to lay siege to northern Gaza, promoted by a group of senior IDF retirees. Under the plan, north Gaza would become a military zone where everyone is a target, and no supplies would enter the territory. On the ground, dozens of aid trucks are entering northern Gaza each day, via the two Erez crossings, and the civilian population is being safely evacuated and not intentionally targeted, according to the IDF.The military says it has captured 700 members of Hamas and other terror groups who surrendered to forces during the evacuation of civilians in Jabalia. Among those captured are dozens who participated in the October 7 onslaught, including the raid on the Erez Crossing, the IDF says.The detained terror operatives are providing the IDF with useful intelligence, the military says.As of this morning, more than 1,000 terror operatives have also been killed amid the latest fighting in Jabalia, according to the IDF.The IDF's latest estimate puts the total number of people still in Jabalia at several hundred. Several thousand Palestinians also remain in Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun, and other northern Gaza towns, where the military plans to operate against Hamas as part of the ongoing offensive.North Gaza's towns, including Jabalia, are now disconnected from Gaza City amid the ongoing operation, which the IDF says is to prevent Hamas operatives from escaping or alternatively, from bringing in reinforcements from Gaza City, where thousands of terror operatives are thought to be.The ongoing operation is being carried out by the 162nd Division, with the 401st Armored Brigade, and the Givati and Kfir infantry brigades.Amid the operation, the IDF says it has discovered over 200 homes that were booby-trapped with explosives. In two cases, the bombs were not discovered before troops entered the buildings, leading to casualties. The operation marks the fourth push into Jabalia by the IDF since the start of the war a year ago. The military assesses that this operation will finally break Hamas's forces in Jabalia, and it will no longer represent the terror group's -most significant center of gravity- in northern Gaza.Nineteen IDF soldiers and officers have been killed during the Jabalia operation so far, including the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade.	https://t.me/manniefabian/48986	2024-11-05T08:59:50-08:00

The IDF will be sending out another 7,000 draft orders to members...	The IDF will be sending out another 7,000 draft orders to members of the ultra-Orthodox community next week, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has approved, after the first phase of a plan to draft Haredi soldiers was largely unsuccessful.The draft orders are the first stage in the screening and evaluation process that the army carries out for new recruits, ahead of enlistment in the military in the coming year.Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held a meeting today with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and other military officials, where he was presented with the summary of the first phase of the Haredi draft plan, his office says.The IDF had sent out 3,000 draft orders in that stage, although just 230 showed up at induction centers.At the end of the meeting, Gallant approved the IDF's recommendation to send out 7,000 more draft orders to ultra-Orthodox men.Those who ignore multiple calls will be considered deserters and may be arrested. Many ultra-Orthodox Jews believe that military service is incompatible with their way of life, and fear that those who enlist will be secularized. Israelis who do serve, however, say the decades-long arrangement of mass exemptions unfairly burdens them, a sentiment that has strengthened since the October 7 onslaught and the ensuing war, in which more than 780 soldiers have been killed and some 300,000 citizens called up to reserve duty.The military has said that it currently requires some 10,000 new soldiers — mostly combat troops — but can only accommodate the enlistment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox this year, due to their special needs. These are in addition to some 1,800 Haredi soldiers who are already drafted annually.In June, the High Court ruled that there was no longer any legal framework allowing the state to refrain from drafting Haredi yeshiva students into military service, and the attorney general ordered the government to immediately begin the process of conscription for 3,000 such men.	https://t.me/manniefabian/48977	2024-11-04T10:38:23-08:00
