Five reserve soldiers suspected of the sexual abuse of a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman base in southern Israel are expected to be released to house arrest.Military prosecutors are seeking to extend their detention until next Thursday, for the investigation into the high-profile abuse case to continue.The defense says that it has come to an agreement with the prosecution to extend the suspects' remands, while releasing them to full house arrest.The agreement between the protection and defense will be presented to judges at a military court during a remand hearing later today.In all, ten soldiers at the Sde Teiman detention facility were detained over the suspected sexual abuse of a Hamas police officer, who had been arrested in the Gaza Strip. Prosecutors did not seek to hold five of them in custody, following new evidence in the case.According to the IDF, the soldiers were suspected of aggravated sodomy (a charge equivalent to rape), causing bodily harm under aggravated circumstances, abuse under aggravated circumstances and conduct unbecoming of a soldier.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46702	2024-08-13T00:51:26-07:00

Overnight, the IDF demolished the homes of Aysar Barghouti and Khaled al-Kharouf, Palestinians accused of carrying out a deadly shooting attack in the West Bank in January, killing two people.The home of a third Palestinian detained over the attack, Murad Dahadhah, was demolished last month.In the attack on January 7 on Route 465, near the West Bank settlement of Ateret, the terrorists shot dead Amar Mansour, 33, a resident of the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Beit Hanina, and Lara Tannous, 42, a Palestinian woman from Ramallah who worked as a pharmacist at Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center.The three were arrested a day after the attack. Palestinian media report that troops demolished the homes of Barghouti and al-Kharouf in the Ramallah area overnight.Despite the victims being Palestinians, Israeli security authorities say the shooting was carried out with nationalist motives, meaning it is considered a terror attack.As a matter of policy, Israel demolishes the homes of Palestinians accused of carrying out deadly terror attacks.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46701	2024-08-13T00:19:18-07:00
