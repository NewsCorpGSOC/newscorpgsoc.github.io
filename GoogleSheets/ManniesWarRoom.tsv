An IDF investigation into a deadly terror attack carried out by some 100 Israeli settlers in the West Bank village of Jit earlier this month found that troops that arrived first at the scene did not act as expected to stop the assailants.The IDF has also dismissed two members of a nearby settlement's local security force for acting -outside the scope of their authority- amid the incident.According to the military's probe, the IDF received an alert from the Shin Bet in the evening hours of August 15 about a group of Israelis in vehicles heading to carry out a -nationalistic crime- in the Yitzhar area.A large number of troops and Border Police officers were dispatched to the area, in an attempt to prevent an attack from happening, the probe found.At around 8 p.m., a group of 100 masked Israeli settlers entered Jit and set fire to three cars and two buildings, as well as hurled Molotov cocktails and stones.At 8:06 p.m., the commander of the regional brigade declared that an incident had begun, and troops were dispatched to the village. Within six more minutes, the troops arrived at Jit. -The investigation revealed that the first force was unable to fully understand the situation. It tried to disperse the rioters and prevent harm to the Palestinians, but it should have acted with greater determination,- the IDF says.Minutes later, according to the probe, additional troops and Border Police officers arrived at the scene, and they -acted assertively while their risking lives, blocking the rioters and pushing them out of the village, while using riot dispersal means and live fire in the air.-Half an hour after the incident began, all of the Israeli settlers were taken out of the village, the probe found.The IDF says that troops rescued and aided Palestinian families, including women and children, amid the incident. Troops helped Palestinians escape from burning homes and provided them with first aid.The probe also found that Border Police officers stationed in the area prevented additional assailants from joining in the attack.One Palestinian man was killed and another was wounded by gunfire in the incident. The Shin Bet and police have indicated that the shooting was carried out by the settlers.Additionally, the IDF says that several members of a civilian local security team for a nearby settlement, who are not in active reserve duty, arrived at Jit at the start of the incident while in military uniform. The probe found that the security officers -acted outside the scope of authority defined for- the local security team.Two were dismissed from their role, and their weapons were confiscated.No suspects were detained amid the incident, but last week the police and Shin Bet arrested four, including a minor. The three adult suspects were sent to administrative detention amid the investigation. They are suspected of terrorism, police have said.Additional arrests are planned, the IDF says.The head of the IDF Central Command, Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, says that -This is a very serious terror incident by Israelis who deliberately set out to harm the residents of the village of Jit and we failed by not being able to arrive sooner to protect them.--The responsibility is first of all mine as the head of the system and I will do everything to improve it,- Bluth says in remarks published by the IDF. He also hails the troops who later arrived to the village and rescued Palestinians who were trapped inside burning homes. -This event is still in progress and it will not be closed until we have brought the rioters to justice,- Bluth adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47074	2024-08-28T08:26:06-07:00

Rescued hostage Farhan al-Qadi was not discovered by Israeli special forces -by chance- as some reports have described, although there was no pre-planned operation to specifically rescue him.The IDF has been operating in an area of the southern Gaza Strip for several days, with the assumption that hostages could be held in the area. Members of the Navy‚Äôs Shayetet 13 commando unit and Shin Bet security agency began to slowly search a tunnel complex in the area, where they discovered al-Qadi, who was alone after apparently being abandoned by his captors. He was then extracted from the tunnel and brought back to Israel.The fact that the operation was carried out by special forces from the beginning, indicates that the military was looking for hostages in the area.The IDF says it learnt lessons from the last time troops encountered abductees in the Gaza Strip outside of a specific hostage rescue mission, during which soldiers mistakenly shot dead three hostages who escaped their captors.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47053	2024-08-27T09:26:28-07:00

Another possibility, although considered less likely, is that the interceptor missile managed to intercept one of the drones just above the ship, but also wounded the sailors.Footage from the incident shows an Iron Dome interceptor missile exploding adjacent to the ship.

Military prosecutors are requesting a two-week extension on the house arrest of five reservist soldiers who are suspected of abusing a Palestinian detainee at the Sde Teiman detention facility.The IDF says that a Military Police investigation into the high-profile abuse case is due to be finished in the coming days, and at the start of next week, all the investigation materials will be handed over to the defense.In the coming two weeks, the defense may request to hold a hearing on the investigation, before the prosecution files an indictment against the suspects, according to the military.In all, 10 soldiers at the Sde Teiman detention facility were detained over the suspected sexual abuse of a Hamas police officer who had been arrested in the Gaza Strip. Prosecutors did not seek to hold five of them in custody, following new evidence in the case.Prosecutors are now asking to keep the five suspects under house arrest until September 5.According to the IDF, the soldiers are suspected of aggravated sodomy (a charge equivalent to rape), causing bodily harm under aggravated circumstances, abuse under aggravated circumstances and conduct unbecoming of a soldier.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46893	2024-08-22T02:30:37-07:00
