We are at a strategic crossroads and we need to take advantage of the negotiations to bring about the release of the hostages, and through the release of the hostages, to also open up the [possibility] of an agreement [with Hezbollah], in the north and later also to calm the region,- Gallant says.-We are operating militarily and are preparing as if we will not reach an agreement and we are ready at any moment for war in the north... but this is not our preferred way, and we still give a chance to the possibility of an agreement,- he adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46998	2024-08-25T09:10:25-07:00

Another possibility, although considered less likely, is that the interceptor missile managed to intercept one of the drones just above the ship, but also wounded the sailors.Footage from the incident shows an Iron Dome interceptor missile exploding adjacent to the ship. Parts of the interceptor missile were found inside the ship after the incident.The Dvora ship is currently being repaired and will return to service by tomorrow.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46992	2024-08-25T07:21:03-07:00
