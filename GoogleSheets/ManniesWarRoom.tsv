The ballistic missile launched by the Iran-backed Houthis from Yemen at central Israel this morning was hit by an interceptor missile, although it did not manage to completely destroy the target, according to an Israeli Air Force probe.The missile had been identified upon launch from northwestern Yemen early this morning, and the Arrow long-range defense system was activated to intercept it. Several interceptor missiles were launched at the target in attempts to down it.At least one of the Arrow interceptors hit the missile, but did not destroy it completely, the probe finds. Instead, the interceptor caused the Houthi missile to break apart in the air, and the warhead, as well as other pieces, fell to the ground.The missile shrapnel impacted open areas in the Ben Shemen forest, close to Kfar Daniel, sparking a fire. Shrapnel from the interceptors also hit a train station near Modiin, causing slight damage.The IAF has found that the missile, which had a straight trajectory, was not a hypersonic projectile, as the Houthis have claimed.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47416	2024-09-15T09:05:55-07:00

🖼 Ten months after their bodies were recovered, the IDF says tha...	Ten months after their bodies were recovered, the IDF says that its investigation has found that former hostages Sgt. Ron Sherman, Cpl. Nik Beizer, and civilian Elia Toledano, were killed as a result of a -byproduct- from an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip, although the exact cause of death is still unknown.On November 10, 2023, the IDF carried out an airstrike near the location where the bodies were later found, targeting the commander of Hamas’s Northern Gaza Brigade, Ahmed Ghandour, who was hiding in a tunnel in Jabaliya. -The findings of the investigation suggest that the three, with high probability, were killed by a byproduct of an IDF airstrike, during the assassination- of Ghandour, the IDF says.-This is a highly probable estimate given all the data, but it is not possible to determine with certainty the circumstances of their death,- the military says.The IDF says it was able to determine that they were likely indirectly killed by the strike on Ghandour based on the locations where the bodies were found in relation to the site of the airstrike, an investigation of the airstrike, intelligence findings, pathology reports, and findings made by the Abu Kabir Forensic Institute.According to the IDF’s investigation, the three were held in a tunnel complex where Ghandour also operated, though when the strike was carried out, the military had no information on hostages being held in the area.The IDF probe found that at the time, it had information on another location where it thought the hostages were being held, and therefore the tunnel complex was not listed as an area where Israeli abductees could be.Amid the war, the IDF has said it does not strike in areas where it has information of hostages being, but in some cases hostages have been harmed in Israeli strikes due to a lack of intelligence.On December 14, the bodies of Sherman, Beizer, and Toledano were found in the tunnel network in Jabaliya and brought back to Israel for burial.Sherman and Beizer were both kidnapped from an IDF base near the Gaza border on October 7, while Toledano was abducted from the Supernova rave near Kibbutz Re’im, when thousands of Hamas-led terrorists burst across the border into Israel, slaughtering some 1,200 people and seizing 251 hostages, mostly civilians, while committing acts of brutality and sexual assault.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47410	2024-09-15T06:16:02-07:00

Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reveals a document he says was written by the former commander of Hamas’s Khan Younis Brigade, Rafa’a Salameh, and addressed to Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar and his brother Muhammad, in which the commander describes the -difficult situation- the terror group is in.-Please consider the following: We maintain the remaining weapons and equipment, as we have lost 90-95% of our rocket capabilities; and we have lost some 60% of our personal weapons; we have lost at least 65-70% of our anti-tank launchers and rockets, and most importantly that we have lost at least 50% of our fighters between those who are martyred and wounded, and now we are left with 25%. The last 25% of our people have reached a situation where the people do not tolerate them any more, broken on a mental or physical level,- the document says, according to excerpts provided and translated by the Defense Ministry.Gallant says the document shows -a real hardship that affects Hamas and affects the most senior commanders.-He says Salameh, who was killed in an IDF strike in July, -cries out for the help of the Sinwar brothers, but of course they cannot save him.--Why? Because we are continuing the effort that started in October and continues step by step... and reaches all senior Hamas officials. He wrote this to the Sinwar brothers, we will get to them as well,- Gallant says.Yahya Sinwar is the leader of Hamas in Gaza, and was recently appointed as the head of the terror group following the assassination of Ismail Haniyeh.

Two soldiers were killed and several others were wounded after an Israeli Air Force helicopter crashed in the southern Gaza Strip last night, in what the military describes as an accident.According to an initial IAF probe, a UH-60 Black Hawk from the 123rd Squadron had flown to Rafah with a Unit 669 medical team at around 11:30 p.m. to evacuate a seriously wounded combat engineer during fighting in the area.During the final landing stage inside an IDF encampment in Rafah, the helicopter impacted the ground instead of touching down correctly. According to the probe, the helicopter was not hit by enemy fire, and the crash occurred moments before the aircraft was supposed to land, meaning it did not fall from a significant height.The helicopter was still heavily damaged in the crash, and all those aboard it were hurt.In all, two soldiers were killed and another eight were taken to hospitals, including four in serious condition. Among the four seriously wounded is the combat engineer who was injured separately.It is still unclear what led to the crash, although the IAF describes it as an accident. A probe has been launched to determine why the helicopter impacted the ground in the encampment instead of landing correctly.The names of the killed soldiers have not yet been released.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47336	2024-09-11T00:28:29-07:00

The IDF is set to release a video showing the inside of a tunnel in the southern Gaza Strip where six Israeli hostages were murdered by Hamas terrorists and shortly after were found and recovered by Israeli troops.Hostages Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi were believed to have been killed in the tunnel by their captors on August 29, before being discovered by troops around two days later.The tunnel was a small 120-meter-long passageway that connected parts of a large underground network in the Tel Sultan neighborhood, which according to the IDF belonged to Hamas's Rafah Brigade. The tunnel network was one of the largest underground complexes found by the army in Gaza to date.Inside the tunnel, located some 20 meters underground, the IDF found food and equipment that it assessed were used by the Hamas terrorists and the Israeli hostages to survive underground for extended periods, at least several weeks. Among the items were dried food, water, a makeshift toilet, mattresses, and assault rifle magazines.The military says it did not have any concrete or real-time intelligence on the six hostages being held there, but had general indications that Israeli abductees could be in the neighborhood, and therefore had operated carefully above ground and even more so underground. On August 30 the IDF discovered a tunnel shaft, which had been blocked up by Hamas. A day later on August 31, troops managed finally to enter the tunnel, where they discovered a locked blast door. Later in the day, the bodies of the six were found, and by early on September 1, they were extracted and brought to Israel for identification and burial.Also on August 30, the IDF said troops killed two Hamas gunmen who attempted to flee from the tunnel complex area. Their bodies were taken to Israel to run DNA testing to determine if they were the terrorists who killed the six hostages. The IDF believes that the six were killed by at least two terrorists.Two days before the six hostages were murdered, on August 27, the IDF rescued hostage Farhan al-Qadi from a tunnel — part of the same network — located less than 700 meters away. There was no direct passage between the tunnel where al-Qadi was found and the bodies of the six hostages, as Hamas had blocked the route.The video taken by IDF Spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari was shown to the families in recent days, as well as to members of the Israeli cabinet.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47325	2024-09-10T08:00:22-07:00

Returning the displaced residents of the north to their homes is part of Israel's war goals, alongside dismantling Hamas and returning the hostages kidnapped by the terror group on October 7.-These instructions you are waiting for, I gave in the south and saw the forces at work,- Gallant says, referring to Israel's ground offensive in Gaza.

The IDF has launched an internal investigation after documents recovered from the Gaza Strip were recently leaked to foreign press in an attempt to influence public opinion on the hostage negotiations.Over the weekend, a report by German newspaper Bild claimed that a Hamas document found on the computer of leader Yahya Sinwar showed the terror group's tactics to pressure Israel and stall the hostage talks.The document's alleged contents, which claimed that Hamas is seeking to sow division in the Israeli public and that the terror group is not seeking to reach a deal quickly, were nearly identical to points made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in recent interviews and press conferences.The IDF says that the document cited by Bild was found in Gaza some five months ago, and was not written by Sinwar himself, but rather it was a recommendation paper drawn up by a mid-level Hamas officer.-The information in the document joins other identical documents that we had in the past, it did not constitute new information,- the IDF says.The military says that the leak -constitutes a serious offense and will be investigated.-Separately, supposed documents found in Gaza cited by British newspaper the Jewish Chronicle claimed that Sinwar was planning to smuggle himself and other leaders from the terror group, along with some of the remaining Israeli hostages kidnapped on October 7, out of Gaza via the Philadelphi Corridor and thence to Iran.This claim too was also similar to Netanyahu's recent talking points regarding the hostage deal and the premier's insistence on the IDF remaining in the Philadelphi Corridor.Though unlike the document cited by Bild, in the case of the Jewish Chronicle, the IDF is unaware of any such document actually existing.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47268	2024-09-08T08:21:28-07:00

The Hamas terror group hints that it murdered the six hostages whose bodies were recovered by the IDF from a tunnel in southern Gaza's Rafah over the weekend.In a statement, the spokesman for the military wing of Hamas says that following Israel's successful hostage rescue in Nuseirat in June, new protocols were given to terrorists guarding the abductees if Israeli troops near them.-We say to everyone clearly that after the Nuseirat incident, new instructions were issued to the mujahideen assigned to guard the prisoners regarding dealing with them if the occupation army approached their place of detention,- Hudhaifa Kahlout — known by the nom de guerre Abu Obeida — says.Hamas is believed by Israel to have given standing orders to operatives who are holding hostages, to kill the captives if they think Israeli forces are approaching.The six hostages recovered over the weekend -- Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Eden Yerushalmi, Ori Danino, Alex Lobanov, Carmel Gat, and Almog Sarusi -- were killed just days before troops found them, according to an autopsy and the IDF.-Netanyahu's insistence on liberating the prisoners through military pressure instead of concluding a deal will mean that they will return to their families inside coffins and their families will have to choose whether they are dead or alive,- Abu Obeida adds.At the beginning of the war, Abu Obeida threatened to execute Israeli hostages and release footage of the killings.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47176	2024-09-02T11:41:58-07:00

The IDF releases footage of troops neutralizing explosive devices amid an ongoing operation in the northern West Bank, during which the military says forces have so far killed at least 12 Palestinian gunmen.The ongoing operation is focused on dismantling a Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror network in the Tulkarem area, as well as in Jenin and the Far'a camp near Tubas.While the army says it has seen a relative decline in terror coming from the northern West Bank in recent months, it has also seen continued attempts by terror operatives to launch attacks. After a series of smaller operations in the northern West Bank, the IDF decided to launch a more extensive operation, targeting three areas at once -- Jenin, Tulkarem and Far'a -- where terror operatives were seen as operating together.The large-scale operation was also launched in part following an intended suicide bombing in Tel Aviv earlier this month. The attack was largely unsuccessful after the Hamas terrorist was killed when the bomb in his backpack exploded prematurely as he walked down a sidewalk.In the first 24 hours of the operation, the IDF says soldiers killed 12 gunmen and detained more than 10 others. Palestinian media put the total toll at 17.Five of them, including the leader of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad wing in Tulkarem's Nur Shams camp, were killed in an exchange of fire with troops at a mosque in the West Bank city overnight. Another top member of Islamic Jihad was detained.The IDF has carried out several drone strikes amid the operation.

An IDF investigation into a deadly terror attack carried out by some 100 Israeli settlers in the West Bank village of Jit earlier this month found that troops that arrived first at the scene did not act as expected to stop the assailants.The IDF has also dismissed two members of a nearby settlement's local security force for acting -outside the scope of their authority- amid the incident.According to the military's probe, the IDF received an alert from the Shin Bet in the evening hours of August 15 about a group of Israelis in vehicles heading to carry out a -nationalistic crime- in the Yitzhar area.A large number of troops and Border Police officers were dispatched to the area, in an attempt to prevent an attack from happening, the probe found.At around 8 p.m., a group of 100 masked Israeli settlers entered Jit and set fire to three cars and two buildings, as well as hurled Molotov cocktails and stones.At 8:06 p.m., the commander of the regional brigade declared that an incident had begun, and troops were dispatched to the village. Within six more minutes, the troops arrived at Jit. -The investigation revealed that the first force was unable to fully understand the situation. It tried to disperse the rioters and prevent harm to the Palestinians, but it should have acted with greater determination,- the IDF says.Minutes later, according to the probe, additional troops and Border Police officers arrived at the scene, and they -acted assertively while their risking lives, blocking the rioters and pushing them out of the village, while using riot dispersal means and live fire in the air.-Half an hour after the incident began, all of the Israeli settlers were taken out of the village, the probe found.The IDF says that troops rescued and aided Palestinian families, including women and children, amid the incident. Troops helped Palestinians escape from burning homes and provided them with first aid.The probe also found that Border Police officers stationed in the area prevented additional assailants from joining in the attack.One Palestinian man was killed and another was wounded by gunfire in the incident. The Shin Bet and police have indicated that the shooting was carried out by the settlers.Additionally, the IDF says that several members of a civilian local security team for a nearby settlement, who are not in active reserve duty, arrived at Jit at the start of the incident while in military uniform. The probe found that the security officers -acted outside the scope of authority defined for- the local security team.Two were dismissed from their role, and their weapons were confiscated.No suspects were detained amid the incident, but last week the police and Shin Bet arrested four, including a minor. The three adult suspects were sent to administrative detention amid the investigation. They are suspected of terrorism, police have said.Additional arrests are planned, the IDF says.The head of the IDF Central Command, Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, says that -This is a very serious terror incident by Israelis who deliberately set out to harm the residents of the village of Jit and we failed by not being able to arrive sooner to protect them.--The responsibility is first of all mine as the head of the system and I will do everything to improve it,- Bluth says in remarks published by the IDF. He also hails the troops who later arrived to the village and rescued Palestinians who were trapped inside burning homes. -This event is still in progress and it will not be closed until we have brought the rioters to justice,- Bluth adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47074	2024-08-28T08:26:06-07:00

Rescued hostage Farhan al-Qadi was not discovered by Israeli special forces -by chance- as some reports have described, although there was no pre-planned operation to specifically rescue him.The IDF has been operating in an area of the southern Gaza Strip for several days, with the assumption that hostages could be held in the area. Members of the Navy’s Shayetet 13 commando unit and Shin Bet security agency began to slowly search a tunnel complex in the area, where they discovered al-Qadi, who was alone after apparently being abandoned by his captors. He was then extracted from the tunnel and brought back to Israel.The fact that the operation was carried out by special forces from the beginning, indicates that the military was looking for hostages in the area.The IDF says it learnt lessons from the last time troops encountered abductees in the Gaza Strip outside of a specific hostage rescue mission, during which soldiers mistakenly shot dead three hostages who escaped their captors.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47053	2024-08-27T09:26:28-07:00
