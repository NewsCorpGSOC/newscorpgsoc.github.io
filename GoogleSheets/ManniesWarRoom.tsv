In a rare move, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has imposed sanctions on 18 oil tankers that Israel says are used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force to finance the Hezbollah and Hamas terror groups.-As part of the economic campaign led by the defense establishment against the terrorist organizations, among them Quds Force, Hezbollah, and Hamas, the Defense Minister has imposed sanctions on 18 tankers involved in transporting oil belonging to the designated terrorist organization Quds Force, the sale proceeds of which are used to finance and strengthen the terrorist organizations, among them also Hezbollah and Hamas,- the Defense Ministry's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) says in a statement.-The oil originates in the Iranian regime's allocations to Quds Force, which transports the oil in tankers under a legitimate fa√ßade, in an effort to circumvent international sanctions in the context of terror financing, using methods that constitute a violation of maritime safety and environmental laws, in order to sell the oil to a wide range of countries,- the statement says.NBCTF says the sanctions -expose a key financing axis of the Quds Force terrorist organization and its proxies- and are -another layer in the efforts of the Israeli defense establishment to broaden the damage and disruption to the terror financing axes of Iran and Quds force, as part of the broad campaign against the terrorist organizations, among them also Hezbollah and Hamas.-It is unclear how much of an effect Israel's sanctions will have on Iran's alleged scheme.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46759	2024-08-15T06:28:14-07:00

Herzi Halevi says the military will know how to operate against Hamas even if it is required to leave the area under a hostage deal with the terror group.-Hamas should know that every day it holds our hostages, it will be more bitter for it than the previous day. We will act [against Hamas] even harder until we manage to return the hostages, and after that we will not allow Hamas to even raise its head,- he says.Halevi says that holding the Philadelphi Route is -an important thing, because it deals with [Hamas's] force build-up,- as the terror group has used the border to smuggle in weapons via Egypt.-We are preparing options for whatever the political echelon decides. If it decides that we're staying in Philadelphi, we'll know how to stay there and stay strong. If it decides that we must monitor [the area] and carry out raids whenever we have an indication, we will know how to do it,- he adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46742	2024-08-14T09:18:33-07:00
