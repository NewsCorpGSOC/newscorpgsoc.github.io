Herzi Halevi says the military will know how to operate against Hamas even if it is required to leave the area under a hostage deal with the terror group.-Hamas should know that every day it holds our hostages, it will be more bitter for it than the previous day. We will act [against Hamas] even harder until we manage to return the hostages, and after that we will not allow Hamas to even raise its head,- he says.Halevi says that holding the Philadelphi Route is -an important thing, because it deals with [Hamas's] force build-up,- as the terror group has used the border to smuggle in weapons via Egypt.-We are preparing options for whatever the political echelon decides. If it decides that we're staying in Philadelphi, we'll know how to stay there and stay strong. If it decides that we must monitor [the area] and carry out raids whenever we have an indication, we will know how to do it,- he adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46742	2024-08-14T09:18:33-07:00
