Defense Minister Israel Katz announces an end to administrative detention orders for West Bank settlers, a controversial policy of holding suspects without charge.While the practice is primarily deployed against Palestinians, it is also used against some extremist Jewish Israelis.In a statement, Katz says that -in a reality where the Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria is subject to serious Palestinian terror threats and unjustified international sanctions are taken against the settlers, it is not appropriate for the State of Israel to take such a severe measure against the people of the settlements.-Katz met with Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar this week and told him that he had decided -to stop the use of administrative detention orders against Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria, and asked him to put alternative tools in place,- his office says.Administrative detention policies allow the Defense Ministry to hold suspects without charge while administrative restraining orders bar them from visiting certain areas or communicating with certain people. The tool is typically used when authorities have intelligence tying a suspect to a crime, but do not have enough evidence for charges to stand up in a court of law.Katz says that -if there is suspicion of criminal acts, the perpetrators can be prosecuted, and if not, there are other preventive measures that can be taken other than administrative detention orders.--I condemn any phenomenon of violence against Palestinians and taking the law into one's own hands, and I also appeal to the settlement leadership to take a similar public position and express an unequivocal position on the issue,- the minister adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/49419	2024-11-22T00:25:56-08:00

There are significant chances of Israel reaching a ceasefire agreement in Lebanon, a senior defense official tells reporters.The official says a United States-backed deal that would see Hezbollah gradually withdraw north of the Litani River and the Lebanese Army retake responsibility for south Lebanon, is in reach.US special envoy Amos Hochstein is in Israel today meeting separately with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz along with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, to discuss the ceasefire negotiations.Hochstein held meetings with the Lebanese side in recent days, and said that -additional progress- had been made.Under the potential ceasefire, the Lebanese Army would be responsible for preventing Hezbollah from re-establishing itself in southern Lebanon.According to the defense official, if Israel sees Hezbollah attempting to rebuild infrastructure in southern Lebanon, it would notify the Lebanese Army via the US to act against the terror group. If no action is taken by the Lebanese Army, Israel reserves the right to act, according to the official. The official says the IDF will also maintain the right to act to thwart any immediate threat, such as identifying Hezbollah operatives preparing to carry out an attack or a weapons shipment destined for the terror group.Lebanese civilians will be able to return to their damaged villages in southern Lebanon under the potential agreement, and Israel does not plan to hold a security zone in southern Lebanon. Instead, Israel says it will act against any Hezbollah presence in southern Lebanon as necessary, either directly or by notifying the Lebanese Army via the US.The UN peacekeeping force, UNIFIL, will likely still have presence in southern Lebanon after a potential ceasefire is signed, though Israel does not see them as an important player in enforcing the removal of Hezbollah.	https://t.me/manniefabian/49405	2024-11-21T06:19:16-08:00

The IDF says some of the Hamas operatives were killed by the ground forces and others in airstrikes.According to the IDF, two of the Hamas operatives killed in the operation participated in the October 7 onslaught.

🖼 The vast majority of the Palestinian civilian population that ...	The vast majority of the Palestinian civilian population that had been residing in northern Gaza's Jabalia has evacuated, as the IDF presses on with an offensive against Hamas in the area and other towns north of Gaza City.The IDF says it has managed to move more than 55,000 civilians out of Jabalia after Hamas was allegedly forcing them to stay there to act as a human shield for their activities. Some 60,000 Palestinians were estimated to have been in Jabalia before the latest operation was launched last month.The population has largely moved to Gaza City, with only a few dozen crossing the IDF's Netzarim Corridor and heading to the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in the Strip's south.According to the IDF, it has evidence and testimonies that Hamas shot, beat, and in some cases executed civilians trying to flee the Jabalia area. The IDF says it seeks to clear the town of civilians to enable a cleaner operation against terror operatives, without risking the lives of innocents, while Hamas attempts to hide behind the population. Senior officers deny that the army is carrying out the so-called generals' plan to lay siege to northern Gaza, promoted by a group of senior IDF retirees. Under the plan, north Gaza would become a military zone where everyone is a target, and no supplies would enter the territory. On the ground, dozens of aid trucks are entering northern Gaza each day, via the two Erez crossings, and the civilian population is being safely evacuated and not intentionally targeted, according to the IDF.The military says it has captured 700 members of Hamas and other terror groups who surrendered to forces during the evacuation of civilians in Jabalia. Among those captured are dozens who participated in the October 7 onslaught, including the raid on the Erez Crossing, the IDF says.The detained terror operatives are providing the IDF with useful intelligence, the military says.As of this morning, more than 1,000 terror operatives have also been killed amid the latest fighting in Jabalia, according to the IDF.The IDF's latest estimate puts the total number of people still in Jabalia at several hundred. Several thousand Palestinians also remain in Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun, and other northern Gaza towns, where the military plans to operate against Hamas as part of the ongoing offensive.North Gaza's towns, including Jabalia, are now disconnected from Gaza City amid the ongoing operation, which the IDF says is to prevent Hamas operatives from escaping or alternatively, from bringing in reinforcements from Gaza City, where thousands of terror operatives are thought to be.The ongoing operation is being carried out by the 162nd Division, with the 401st Armored Brigade, and the Givati and Kfir infantry brigades.Amid the operation, the IDF says it has discovered over 200 homes that were booby-trapped with explosives. In two cases, the bombs were not discovered before troops entered the buildings, leading to casualties. The operation marks the fourth push into Jabalia by the IDF since the start of the war a year ago. The military assesses that this operation will finally break Hamas's forces in Jabalia, and it will no longer represent the terror group's -most significant center of gravity- in northern Gaza.Nineteen IDF soldiers and officers have been killed during the Jabalia operation so far, including the commander of the 401st Armored Brigade.	https://t.me/manniefabian/48986	2024-11-05T08:59:50-08:00

The IDF will be sending out another 7,000 draft orders to members...	The IDF will be sending out another 7,000 draft orders to members of the ultra-Orthodox community next week, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has approved, after the first phase of a plan to draft Haredi soldiers was largely unsuccessful.The draft orders are the first stage in the screening and evaluation process that the army carries out for new recruits, ahead of enlistment in the military in the coming year.Defense Minister Yoav Gallant held a meeting today with IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi and other military officials, where he was presented with the summary of the first phase of the Haredi draft plan, his office says.The IDF had sent out 3,000 draft orders in that stage, although just 230 showed up at induction centers.At the end of the meeting, Gallant approved the IDF's recommendation to send out 7,000 more draft orders to ultra-Orthodox men.Those who ignore multiple calls will be considered deserters and may be arrested. Many ultra-Orthodox Jews believe that military service is incompatible with their way of life, and fear that those who enlist will be secularized. Israelis who do serve, however, say the decades-long arrangement of mass exemptions unfairly burdens them, a sentiment that has strengthened since the October 7 onslaught and the ensuing war, in which more than 780 soldiers have been killed and some 300,000 citizens called up to reserve duty.The military has said that it currently requires some 10,000 new soldiers — mostly combat troops — but can only accommodate the enlistment of an additional 3,000 ultra-Orthodox this year, due to their special needs. These are in addition to some 1,800 Haredi soldiers who are already drafted annually.In June, the High Court ruled that there was no longer any legal framework allowing the state to refrain from drafting Haredi yeshiva students into military service, and the attorney general ordered the government to immediately begin the process of conscription for 3,000 such men.	https://t.me/manniefabian/48977	2024-11-04T10:38:23-08:00
