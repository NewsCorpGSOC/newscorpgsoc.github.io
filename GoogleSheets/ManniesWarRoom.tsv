Defense Minister Yoav Gallant says Israel's -center of gravity- is gradually moving away from the Gaza Strip to the northern front, as the country readies for a major escalation with Lebanon's Hezbollah.-Our center of gravity is moving from south to north, we are in a gradual change, we have more tasks in the south, we have hostages, we need to bring them, we are negotiating on this and I believe we will succeed in reaching results, this is a very important thing,- Gallant says during a visit to the 36th Division in northern Israel.-We want to return the [displaced] residents to the north, we want to return them safely. If it is possible to do this in an agreement, we will do it in an agreement,- he says, warning that Israel will otherwise act.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46861	2024-08-20T07:54:40-07:00

The recovery of the bodies of six Israeli hostages from the southern Gaza Strip overnight was the fastest such operation carried out by the military so far amid the war, which IDF sources said indicated the army's ability to quickly establish control of areas it previously withdrew from.On Sunday, the IDF's 98th Division expanded its operation in Khan Younis and by early Monday, it had achieved -operational control- over one of the neighborhoods where the bodies of the hostages were believed to be held.The IDF had relatively precise intelligence on the tunnel where the bodies of the hostages were held, although not the exact location. According to the military, within less than 24 hours, combat engineers located a 10-meter deep tunnel shaft that led to a tunnel system in the area, with one team spotting various indications of where the bodies were being held.Overnight between Monday and Tuesday, the bodies were found and extracted from the Strip, making it the fastest operation to recover hostages' bodies so far amid the war. Previous operations to recover the bodies of hostages have taken several days, in comparison.Hamas had attempted to hide the remains of the hostages, placing them in an underground passage which was hidden behind a false wall inside the tunnel system.Combat engineers of the elite Yahalom unit and members of the Shin Bet security agency managed to break through the false wall, blast doors, and other blockages inside the tunnel, where in addition to the bodies they also located weapons, explosive devices, and other equipment belonging to Hamas terrorists, according to the military.The IDF says the recovery mission was carried out following fighting in the area, during which troops scanned buildings and killed several gunmen.Some of the terrorists that had been guarding the tunnel had fled, while other apparent guards were killed fighting troops in the surrounding area, according to military sources. The troops found weapons on several dead terror operatives within a few hundred meters of the tunnel where the bodies were held, close to some of the shafts that led to the underground passages. Military sources said those gunmen were likely guarding the area of the tunnel.The bodies of the apparent guards were also taken to Israel along with the remains of the hostages for identification, as the IDF wanted to be certain that no hostages were left behind.

The Israel Defense Forces confirms that it has recovered the bodies of six Israeli hostages during an overnight operation in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip.The hostages are Alex Dancyg, 75, Yagev Buchshtav, 35, Chaim Peri, 79, Yoram Metzger, 80, Nadav Popplewell, 51, and Avraham Munder, 78.Dancyg and Buchshtav had been confirmed dead by the IDF in late July, while Peri, Metzger, and Popplewell were declared dead by the army in early June. The five were believed to have been killed in Khan Younis in early 2024, although the causes of death were not known.Munder had not been previously declared dead by the IDF, although the army had some information that led it to have concerns for his well-being.With the bodies recovered, the IDF says it will continue to investigate the causes of death, including the possibility that the hostages were killed by Israeli fire.The IDF says it had accurate intelligence that allowed troops with the 98th Division and members of the Shin Bet security agency to reach a tunnel in Khan Younis and recover the bodies, amid a new offensive in the city in the southern Gaza Strip.Munder, Dancyg, Peri, and Metzger were all abducted by Hamas from Kibbutz Nir Oz on October 7, while Buchshtav and Popplewell were taken hostage from Kibbutz Nirim.It is now believed that 105 of the 251 hostages abducted by Hamas on October 7 remain in Gaza, including the bodies of 34 confirmed dead by the IDF.Hamas released 105 civilians during a weeklong truce in late November, and four hostages were released before that. Seven hostages have been rescued by troops alive, and the bodies of 30 hostages have also been recovered, including three mistakenly killed by the military as they tried to escape their captors.Hamas is also holding two Israeli civilians who entered the Strip in 2014 and 2015, as well as the bodies of two IDF soldiers who were killed in 2014.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46854	2024-08-20T00:02:07-07:00

üñº An Israeli officer was killed and several others were wounded ...	An Israeli officer was killed and several others were wounded by a failed Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip this morning, the military announces.The slain soldier is named as Lt. Shahar Ben Nun, 21, of the Paratroopers Brigade‚Äôs reconnaissance unit, from Petah Tikva.In addition to the killed soldier, another three were seriously wounded and three others are in good condition.According to an initial IDF probe, at around 6:30 a.m. Israeli Air Force F-15 fighter jets were striking several targets in the Khan Younis area. One of the missiles, due to a technical issue, did not correctly glide to the intended target, and instead struck a multi-story building where the paratroopers were stationed.The building was some 300 meters away from the intended target, the probe found.The missile struck one of the apartments in the upper floors of the building. The soldiers in an adjacent apartment were hurt after part of the building collapsed on them.The IAF says that the incident is an outlier, and has not seen such a malfunction before. Tens of thousands of munitions have been fired from fighter jets amid the war in Gaza, with no comparable malfunctions, according to the military.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46844	2024-08-19T09:47:18-07:00
