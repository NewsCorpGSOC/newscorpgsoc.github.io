The IDF issues a new evacuation order for Palestinians in north Khan Younis and east Deir al-Balah, and has further reduced the boundaries of the Israeli-designated humanitarian zone.Several neighborhoods in north Khan Younis will no longer be considered part of the humanitarian zone, as the IDF says it is planning to operate there against Hamas activity.-Due to many acts of terrorism, the exploitation of the humanitarian zone for terror activity and the firing of rockets at the State of Israel from the neighborhoods in north Khan Younis, remaining in this area has become dangerous,- the IDF says.The military says that it is adjusting the humanitarian zone based on -precise intelligence indicating that Hamas has placed terror infrastructure in the area that was defined as a humanitarian area.-According to the IDF, the early warning is aimed at mitigating harm to civilians.-The IDF is about to operate forcefully against the terror organizations, and therefore calls on the remaining population left in the northern neighborhoods of Khan Younis, as well as eastern Deir al-Balah, to temporarily evacuate to the adjusted humanitarian zone,- the military says.Deir al-Balah is one of the few areas in Gaza where the IDF has not intensively operated in with ground forces.The IDF's calls to civilians are being communicated via leaflets dropped by aircraft, SMS messages, phone calls and media broadcasts.A military source says hospitals in the area do not need to evacuate, and that the IDF has communicated this to Palestinian health officials and officials in the international community.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46769	2024-08-16T00:14:18-07:00

In a rare move, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has imposed sanctions on 18 oil tankers that Israel says are used by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' Quds Force to finance the Hezbollah and Hamas terror groups.-As part of the economic campaign led by the defense establishment against the terrorist organizations, among them Quds Force, Hezbollah, and Hamas, the Defense Minister has imposed sanctions on 18 tankers involved in transporting oil belonging to the designated terrorist organization Quds Force, the sale proceeds of which are used to finance and strengthen the terrorist organizations, among them also Hezbollah and Hamas,- the Defense Ministry's National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing (NBCTF) says in a statement.-The oil originates in the Iranian regime's allocations to Quds Force, which transports the oil in tankers under a legitimate façade, in an effort to circumvent international sanctions in the context of terror financing, using methods that constitute a violation of maritime safety and environmental laws, in order to sell the oil to a wide range of countries,- the statement says.NBCTF says the sanctions -expose a key financing axis of the Quds Force terrorist organization and its proxies- and are -another layer in the efforts of the Israeli defense establishment to broaden the damage and disruption to the terror financing axes of Iran and Quds force, as part of the broad campaign against the terrorist organizations, among them also Hezbollah and Hamas.-It is unclear how much of an effect Israel's sanctions will have on Iran's alleged scheme.	https://t.me/manniefabian/46759	2024-08-15T06:28:14-07:00
