The IDF releases footage of troops neutralizing explosive devices amid an ongoing operation in the northern West Bank, during which the military says forces have so far killed at least 12 Palestinian gunmen.The ongoing operation is focused on dismantling a Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terror network in the Tulkarem area, as well as in Jenin and the Far'a camp near Tubas.While the army says it has seen a relative decline in terror coming from the northern West Bank in recent months, it has also seen continued attempts by terror operatives to launch attacks. After a series of smaller operations in the northern West Bank, the IDF decided to launch a more extensive operation, targeting three areas at once -- Jenin, Tulkarem and Far'a -- where terror operatives were seen as operating together.The large-scale operation was also launched in part following an intended suicide bombing in Tel Aviv earlier this month. The attack was largely unsuccessful after the Hamas terrorist was killed when the bomb in his backpack exploded prematurely as he walked down a sidewalk.In the first 24 hours of the operation, the IDF says soldiers killed 12 gunmen and detained more than 10 others. Palestinian media put the total toll at 17.Five of them, including the leader of a Palestinian Islamic Jihad wing in Tulkarem's Nur Shams camp, were killed in an exchange of fire with troops at a mosque in the West Bank city overnight. Another top member of Islamic Jihad was detained.The IDF has carried out several drone strikes amid the operation.

An IDF investigation into a deadly terror attack carried out by some 100 Israeli settlers in the West Bank village of Jit earlier this month found that troops that arrived first at the scene did not act as expected to stop the assailants.The IDF has also dismissed two members of a nearby settlement's local security force for acting -outside the scope of their authority- amid the incident.According to the military's probe, the IDF received an alert from the Shin Bet in the evening hours of August 15 about a group of Israelis in vehicles heading to carry out a -nationalistic crime- in the Yitzhar area.A large number of troops and Border Police officers were dispatched to the area, in an attempt to prevent an attack from happening, the probe found.At around 8 p.m., a group of 100 masked Israeli settlers entered Jit and set fire to three cars and two buildings, as well as hurled Molotov cocktails and stones.At 8:06 p.m., the commander of the regional brigade declared that an incident had begun, and troops were dispatched to the village. Within six more minutes, the troops arrived at Jit. -The investigation revealed that the first force was unable to fully understand the situation. It tried to disperse the rioters and prevent harm to the Palestinians, but it should have acted with greater determination,- the IDF says.Minutes later, according to the probe, additional troops and Border Police officers arrived at the scene, and they -acted assertively while their risking lives, blocking the rioters and pushing them out of the village, while using riot dispersal means and live fire in the air.-Half an hour after the incident began, all of the Israeli settlers were taken out of the village, the probe found.The IDF says that troops rescued and aided Palestinian families, including women and children, amid the incident. Troops helped Palestinians escape from burning homes and provided them with first aid.The probe also found that Border Police officers stationed in the area prevented additional assailants from joining in the attack.One Palestinian man was killed and another was wounded by gunfire in the incident. The Shin Bet and police have indicated that the shooting was carried out by the settlers.Additionally, the IDF says that several members of a civilian local security team for a nearby settlement, who are not in active reserve duty, arrived at Jit at the start of the incident while in military uniform. The probe found that the security officers -acted outside the scope of authority defined for- the local security team.Two were dismissed from their role, and their weapons were confiscated.No suspects were detained amid the incident, but last week the police and Shin Bet arrested four, including a minor. The three adult suspects were sent to administrative detention amid the investigation. They are suspected of terrorism, police have said.Additional arrests are planned, the IDF says.The head of the IDF Central Command, Maj. Gen. Avi Bluth, says that -This is a very serious terror incident by Israelis who deliberately set out to harm the residents of the village of Jit and we failed by not being able to arrive sooner to protect them.--The responsibility is first of all mine as the head of the system and I will do everything to improve it,- Bluth says in remarks published by the IDF. He also hails the troops who later arrived to the village and rescued Palestinians who were trapped inside burning homes. -This event is still in progress and it will not be closed until we have brought the rioters to justice,- Bluth adds.	https://t.me/manniefabian/47074	2024-08-28T08:26:06-07:00
