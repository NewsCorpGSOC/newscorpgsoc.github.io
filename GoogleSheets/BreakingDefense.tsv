BAE betting on AI to train imagery analysts	The Space Force sees digitization as fundamental to all of its operations. (Getty images) I/ITSEC — At this year’s I/ITSEC show, it was hard to miss that everyone seemingly wants in on the artificial intelligence craze. It’s easy to see why: simulation, after all, is ultimately about managing data, with machine learning or AI at the heart of those efforts. So it’s no surprise that companies are touting what they can do in the artificial intelligence space. One such firm is BAE Systems, which has zeroed in on the use of AI for image processing as a growth market. 'With the advent of so many unmanned airborne combat system concepts there are people who will declare ‘the last fighter pilot has already been born,’' Benjamin Kennedy, an account manager for BAE’s electronic systems division, said on the show floor. 'In the same vein of future requirements, we look at the functionality of our system for processing imagery we like to say that the last imagery analyst has been born.' High-resolution imagery, whether it is from commercial-based satellite systems or from airborne platforms &#8211; both manned and unmanned &#8211; can be processed at a speed far beyond that of that conducted by the individual imagery analyst using BAE’s SOCET GXP geospatial intelligence software, according to Kennedy. With this software users and operators can rapidly identify, analyze, and extract information on specific locations or installations to a level that supports action-oriented decision-making. Kennedy claimed that the package has been a successful property for BAE, and been provided to over 65 countries. There are several aspects to its functionality that make it attractive to numerous clients. One is that the program can run in a server-based environment or on a desktop. All the system requires is adequate graphics processing hardware. Secondly, the SOCET package is also not limited to imagery processing solutions. It has 'a myriad of functions, which include a learning process of how to convert imagery data to intelligence data and then form that processing imagery into simulator data,' per the company. And thirdly, the entire system can be operated on unclassified hardware as the software itself is also unclassified. 'This has supported situations where an allied or friendly was able to input commercial imagery and/or their own self-generated or collected data and use the SOCET software to analyze it in real time, said Kennedy. 'In this way we have been able assist our friends and allies' in certain theatres of operation. Data provided by a customer can be put through a long list of analytical process and moreover the type of formats of imagery that can be processed is not limited. The SOCET GXP program supports literally 'thousands of different sensors. The customer also does not have to purchase any minimum number of licenses or copies of the software – customers can have as few as two copies or thousands or any number in between.' 'The way to think about SOCET package is to look at it as the main weapon of an imagery analyst. It is to that analyst what the Smith and Wesson M-4 carbine is to a Marine infantryman,' explained Kennedy who is himself a former Marine. 'SOCET is that analyst’s version of an M-4.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/bae-betting-on-ai-to-train-imagery-analysts/	2024-12-06T07:35:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_map_ship_movements_GettyImages-875327078-scaled.jpg
Army’s new compact electronic warfare kit goes on everything from backpacks to balloons	A soldier tests out the Army's new TLS-Manpack electronic warfare kit. (US Army photo) FORT BELVOIR, Va. — The first two combat brigades to get the Army’s long-awaited backpack-portable electronic warfare kit are already experimenting with new tactics, officers and NCOs told reporters here on Tuesday. Formally known as the TLS-BCT (Terrestrial Layer System — Brigade Combat Team) Manpack, the system fills a longtime gap in the Army's digital arsenal: It gives frontline troops on foot the ability to detect enemy radio transmissions, pinpoint their sources for precision strike and, in some configurations, jam the signal. Such electronic warfare capabilities are more critical than ever on battlefields dominated by radio-controlled drones. 'I think that some of the soldiers were surprised by how they were able to use it at JRTC [the Joint Readiness Training Center] to identify enemy drones and things like that,' said Lt. Col. John Cross, the Army’s product manager for the system. 'It kind of has opened the minds of the commanders as to what's possible.' 'One of the units was able to actually take one of these systems [and] put it up on an aerostat' — that is, a tethered balloon — to expand its field of view beyond what they could scan from ground level, Cross continued. 'That's not something that we necessarily told them to do, that's something that they came up with. &#8230; We take that feedback and then we share it across the Army.' That approach embodies the Army’s new emphasis on what it calls 'transformation in contact': issuing new kit to combat units early on, often while it’s still in development, and incorporating real soldiers’ feedback on how it works in field conditions, or doesn’t, so improvements can be made. 'We're using this user feedback to inform our tactics, techniques and procedures … to understand how we need to drive new software development &#8230; [and] to drive our new requirements' for future systems, Cross said. Based on such soldier feedback, the TLS-Manpack program is already streamlining how it distributes software updates. Rapid updates are important for any modern weapons system, but especially so for electronic warfare: Combat experience in Ukraine has shown that a new technique can emerge, be employed to devastating effect against enemy drones or other radio-dependent systems, and then be countered, all within a matter of weeks. 'The evolving nature of the threat … is going to require agility and flexibility we haven’t seen,' said Brig. Gen. Ed Barker, the Army’s program executive officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO-IEW&amp;S). 'Whatever kit we’re providing to [units] now, it can’t be the same in two or three years. &#8230; We have to constantly evolve, based on all this feedback.' RELATED: Drones, jammers and big balloons: In Morocco, Army’s Multi-Domain Task Force tests EW tech But traditionally, the Army has distributed software updates for sensitive equipment by periodically sending compact discs full of new code to unit headquarters, with soldiers or contractors then bringing in each item to update it. The TLS-Manpack program started with that 'older model [of] let’s ship a CD,' Cross said, but 'we moved away from that.' Soldiers can now download software updates from an online portal, using the military’s secure but unclassified NIPR network, he said, then load the updates onto removable media to take back to their units. The service is even looking at the possibility of distributing updates 'over the air,' via wireless networks, the way commercial companies like Apple and Tesla do, although the military needs greater security for its software. 'We're moving toward the Tesla model,' Cross said. 'We're not there yet.' Meanwhile, as the program continues to evolve, production is kicking into higher gear. The first set of six TLS-Manpack systems went to a brigade of 10th Mountain Division in August, followed by a second set to a brigade of the 101st Airborne by the end of October. 'Now,' Cross said, 'we are on pace to field one brigade a month in FY [fiscal year] 25 and two brigades a month in FY26.' A soldier tests out the Army's new TLS-Manpack electronic warfare kit, showing the backpack configuration. (US Army photo) After years of experiments with different electronic-warfare systems and small-scale, ad hoc deployments abroad, the Army launched a formal competition in early 2023 and picked CACI Mastodon to build a prototype TLS Manpack with a $1.5 million award last September, followed by a $99.99 million award this July to begin production. 'In just under 18 months, we were able to buy a commercial off-the-shelf solution developed by CACI Mastodon and begin to field that,' Cross said, using streamlined processes such as Middle Tier Acquisition and Other Transaction Authority. The TLS-Manpack was designed, as its name implies, to be operated by a single soldier wearing it like a backpack. But the system is flexible and configurable enough to be used in other ways, explained assistant product manager Capt. Austin Knighton. Soldiers can strip it down to just the basic sensors — able to detect enemy transmissions but not to actively jam them — and get a handheld configuration weighing less than five pounds. They can also add additional sensors, extra batteries and electronic attack capabilities, with the maxed-out configuration weighing over 30 pounds — best suited for use at a static observation post or on a vehicle (or, apparently, in some cases, from a balloon). In a typical configuration, one Army sergeant told reporters, TLS-Manpack can operate for 72 hours without going back to base for more batteries, while being 'easily half the weight' of the portable systems the service has tried out in the past. A single system can operate on its own, but it can also share data over Army tactical networks. That lets multiple Manpacks work together to triangulate the precise coordinates of an enemy transmitter; future upgrades should let it share data and even take temporary control of other Army EW systems as a well. The Manpack's data can also flow back over the network to Army command posts, populating digital map displays — such as the widely-used Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) — with real-time intelligence on hostile, neutral, and friendly signals. 'It integrates very well with the TAK family of software, [so] this is very easy for the commander to understand,' instead of the data only being intelligence to EW specialists, the sergeant said. 'We’re getting a lot of capability out of this.' Manpack, in turn, is just one piece of a much larger renaissance in US Army electronic warfare. The Terrestrial Layer System, which combines EW and signals intelligence capabilities, is also being developed in much larger, vehicle-mounted versions: TLS-BCT for Brigade Combat Teams and the even more powerful TLS-EAB for divisions, corps, and other 'echelons above brigade.' Meanwhile, the much-delayed airborne Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) system is set to enter service as a pod for Grey Eagle drones in 2026. Electronic warfare 'requires a layered approach,' said Brig Gen. Barker. 'There’s not just a single silver bullet to solve the problem.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/armys-new-compact-electronic-warfare-kit-goes-on-everything-from-backpacks-to-balloons/	2024-12-06T04:58:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Army-TLS-Manpack-8771417.jpg
‘Campaign mindset’: Pentagon unveils new, formal strategy to defend against rising unmanned threats	A senior Observer Coach/Trainer fires a Dronebuster Electronic Warfare System at the Counter Unmanned Aircraft System Training in the Rotational Unit Bivouac Area on January 30, 2020. (U.S. Army photo by PFC Gower Liu, 11th ACR Public Affairs) WASHINGTON — Citing the growing threat of unmanned systems in the air, on land and at sea, the Pentagon today unveiled a new, whole-of-department strategy to shore up counter-drone defenses in the near term and to more thoroughly design future forces to fend off autonomous threats. 'These threats are changing how wars are fought,' the Pentagon said in the strategy's announcement. 'By producing a singular Strategy for Countering Unmanned Systems, the Secretary and the Department are orienting around a common understanding of the challenge and a shared approach to addressing it.' The strategy is classified, but its broad strokes were outlined in an unclassified fact sheet provided by the Pentagon today. Calling for a 'campaign mindset,' the document sets out five pillars, or 'strategic ways,' that the DoD intends to tackle the unmanned threat across different domains at home and abroad. According to the fact sheet, those are: Pointing to conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as an attack on an American installation in Jordan that killed three American servicemembers in January, the DoD recognizes an 'increasingly urgent and seemingly enduring threat that unmanned systems are posing to our people, to our facilities and to our assets overseas,' a senior defense official told reporters in a briefing today ahead of the strategy’s release. 'The real sort of emphasis of the strategy is to say, as we're taking on the effects of unmanned systems, we need to think about this temporally,' the official said, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the near term, the official said the strategy will focus on boosting counter-drone capabilities with 'a particular emphasis on detection,' including by ensuring installations have the active and passive defenses they need. Looking ahead, the strategy intends to 'mak[e] sure that we're developing and designing our future force to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience to threats,' the official said. As other Pentagon officials explained at a recent set of counter-UAS tests dubbed Falcon Peak, convened in the wake of hundreds of drone incursions over DoD installations on US soil, the drone threat can look very different in the homeland — not just because systems in question tend to be small, hobbyist drones, but also because policy constraints can limit commanders’ ability to respond. RELATED: ‘It’s not a war zone’: Pentagon ponders policy shifts to protect homeland bases from drones The new strategy is 'really trying to make sure that we are making a conscious effort to mitigate the threat in the homeland today in the unique ways in which it manifests in the homeland,' a second DoD official said during the briefing. Going forward, a formal part of the strategy will also ensure commanders and personnel are properly trained and equipped for the homeland defense task, including by educating them on authorities and improving interagency coordination, the official said. According to the first official, the ongoing initiatives like the Replicator 2 program are 'part and parcel with this effort.' Noting that the appropriate type of counter-drone capabilities depends on the operational environment, a third official who spoke with reporters today said that scaling up newer solutions like directed energy 'is probably closer to the mid- to long-term' to give officials more confidence in the systems’ performance and then integrate them into a layered defensive approach. RELATED: Pentagon homes in on counter-drone tech in Replicator 2 initiative With the reins of the Pentagon set to switch hands with the incoming Trump administration, yet another official said that 'any successor to [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin will undoubtedly have to deal with this challenge, and I think what we're seeing now is really just the beginning.' The strategy, therefore, is meant to 'lay a foundation for the Department to be able to get after this threat in a way that will be successful and get ahead of the evolution that we're seeing.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/campaign-mindset-pentagon-unveils-new-formal-strategy-to-defend-against-rising-unmanned-threats/	2024-12-05T13:45:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/counter-drone-scaled-e1733433091935.jpg
Saab unveils new counter-drone trainer, taking lessons from Ukraine	Sweden's Saab displays a new anti-drone training module at I/ITSEC 2024. (Reuben F. Johnson / Breaking Defense) I/ITSEC 2024 — Swedish defense firm Saab is stepping further in the realm of counter-drone capabilities with a new c-UAS training system, unveiled here at I/ITSEC in Orlando. The new trainer is designed to connect to Saab’s existing EXCON live tactical training system and involves putting a multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES)-type sensor array on a UAV so that it can simulate attacking and being attacked during training. 'Designed to replicate aerial threats from opposing forces, the Saab UAV trainer, utilising an ‘off-the-shelf’ UAV platform, can be engaged and defeated whilst capturing troop activity on video and is able to drop ‘virtual munitions’ on soldiers on the ground,' the company said in a press release this week. What is accomplished for very little expense is a system 'that can train soldiers in techniques of shooting down UAVs,' Saab spokesperson Magnus Palmer told Breaking Defense. 'This anti-drone module is an add-on to the base training system. We accomplish it by putting this laser sensor and targeting package on to a commercial UAV. This is now become a very critical functionality for training infantrymen — thanks to what has been happening in Ukraine.' There, Palmer is referencing the expansive use of small drones both by Ukrainian and Russian forces — a fast-moving evolution of tactics that has caused no small amount of alarm for international militaries who are now racing to find ways to counter the relatively cheap, flying robotic scouts and munitions. The US military, for instance, has held several exercises for industry to demonstrate ways to take out the aerial threats. Saab’s system appears to be designed to train soldiers to directly engage threats, what can be a tricky endeavor for frontline soldiers going against high-speed systems, as CNN reported. Electronic warfare has emerged as a potent option, at least for the time being. In recent Russian drone attacks, dozens of Iranian-designed Shahed and other attack drones used by Russia reportedly have been jammed or spoofed so that they turn around and either return to base or head off course for the neighboring nation of Belarus. (Jamming refers to severing the drones connection to its pilot, whereas spoofing involves feeding the drone incorrect location data so it goes off course.) 'In some situations where there is a live operator controlling the drone, we have been able to not only cause the Russian drone to return to base or veer off course into Belarus, but to crash into the site where the operator who launched it is located,' one company representative told Breaking Defense, speaking on the condition of anonymity. RELATED: NATO eyes solar-powered high altitude platforms to counter GPS jamming That, too, is a cat-and-mouse game as Russian forces have learned to dodge electronic warfare attacks by using different frequencies, and then Ukrainian forces have adapted to those changes to target the drones once again. The same process takes place in reverse for Russian forces. But it’s possible electronic warfare systems will grow so sophisticated that it will be impossible for drones to be flown remotely. 'If this trend continues, Putin’s troops will be unable to depend on these UAVs to terrorise the Ukrainian front lines,' said the director of one of Ukraine’s leading night vision and infantry weapons firms. 'The great terror that Ukraine troops at the front have been suffering under could be coming to an end before too long.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/saab-unveils-new-counter-drone-trainer-taking-lessons-from-ukraine/	2024-12-05T13:11:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_saab_cuas_trainer_REUBEN-scaled-e1733432252553.jpeg
NATO eyes solar-powered high altitude platforms to counter GPS jamming	The Zephyr high-altitude drone (Airbus) 'These are big, high-altitude planes that can stay for weeks in the air based on solar energy, and they can capture the GPS signal and send it down to earth with much more power that is more difficult to jam,' Brig. Gen. Sam Raeves, who serves as the assistant chief of staff of J6 Cyberspace at NATO, said in an interview on the sidelines of the NATO Edge conference here. Extremely high-altitude platforms (HAPS), which can come in the form of balloons in addition to light-weight drones like the spindly Airbus-made Zephyr, are not yet in widespread use by NATO, Raeves said. But their potential for them to serve as GPS relays comes as officials have grown increasingly concerned about electronic warfare, a now-ubiquitous feature of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. When and if NATO does actually start implementing these types of HAPS, it could help improve the situational awareness issues that arise with GPS jamming, Raeves said. 'So this is what we try to do, to have combined situation awareness fusion,' he said. 'This is really something that can solve it.' In a separate interview, Artem Martynenko, the deputy head of the Center for Innovations and Defense Technologies at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, bemoaned the constant need to stay ahead of Russian forces in the EW realm. Raeves acknowledged what he called the current 'cat and mouse game' in Europe. He said although NATO is not at war with Russia, the alliance still experiences jamming from the Kremlin. In May NATO publicly accused Russia of 'cyber and electronic interference,' among other acts of 'hybrid activity' — though it didn't appear to do much to slow Moscow down. RELATED: As Baltics see spike in GPS jamming, NATO must respond 'Of course, then we know where they are, but we can do nothing, because we are not at war with Russia,' Raeves said. 'So we cannot take them out. That's the big issue here. We can only geolocate them.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-eyes-solar-powered-high-altitude-platforms-to-counter-gps-jamming/	2024-12-05T12:20:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/ZephyrPRImage-e1634045291437.jpg
West drawing near to ‘third nuclear age,’ says head of UK armed forces	The UK plans on replacing Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) with a new fleet of Dreadnought-class vessels (UK MoD) BELFAST —The Western world is closing in on a new nuclear age, the third of its kind, because of malign activities carried out by Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, the head of the British Armed Forces has said. 'We are at the dawn of a third nuclear age … defined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before,' said UK Chief of the Defence Staff Adm. Tony Radakin, during a Wednesday speech in London hosted by the British Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank. 'From Russia, we have seen wild threats of tactical nuclear use, large scale nuclear exercises and simulated attacks against NATO countries, all designed to coerce us from taking the action required to maintain stability.' He said that China’s nuclear build up offers a 'two-peer challenge' to the US. Further afield, Radakin labelled Iran’s failure to engage with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a 'concern.' He also accused North Korea of 'erratic behavior' and said such action, in conjunction with its ballistic missile program, 'presents a regional and increasingly a global threat.' Radakin strongly defended the UK’s nuclear deterrent amid criticism over high costs and claimed it alone 'has more impact on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin than anything else.' For that reason, 'successive British governments are investing substantial sums of money to renew both our submarines and warhead and to recapitalize our nuclear enterprise after decades of underinvestment,' added Radakin, 'and this is even though the real benefits won't be realized for another decade, at least.' A wise general once told me that the role of senior leaders at points of tension is to reassure the nation &amp; stiffen our resolve Global power is shifting &amp; a third nuclear age is upon us. My RUSI Lecture explores how Britain stays safe in dangerous timeshttps://t.co/Ylgo2xVzAS &mdash; Chief of the Defence Staff 🇬🇧 (@AdmTonyRadakin_) December 5, 2024 The UK’s Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD) is overseen by Royal Navy Vanguard-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) fitted with Trident 2 D5 missiles. The aging vessels are set to be replaced by four BAE Systems Dreadnought-class types from the early 2030s onward, with each capable of carrying up to 12 Trident munitions and four Spearfish medium-range torpedoes. Overall, the Dreadnought program has an estimated through life price tag of £31 billion ($40 billion), excluding a £10 billion contingency fund. Parliamentary figures [PDF] also indicate that by March 2023, £15 billion had been spent on the 'concept, assessment, and early delivery phases' of the effort. In a November report on UK nuclear modernization, the Federation of American Scientists said that Dreadnought delays 'could threaten the [Royal] Navy’s ability to maintain their Continuous At-Sea Deterrent (CASD) as it would put additional stress on the Vanguard fleet that has already been pushed past its service life.' It also noted that the UK holds an estimated stockpile of 225 nuclear warheads, which is forecast to increase long term, 'based on shifting posture to counter Russia, modernization, and alliance efforts.' Radakin also said there is only a 'remote' chance that Russia attacks the UK — a projection that is also true for NATO as a whole — while Moscow understands that a retaliatory response would be overwhelming, 'whether conventional or nuclear.' Radakin also urged the MoD to consider a two tier equipment and acquisition approach, distinguished by opposing 'fail safe' and 'safe to fail' systems. Fail safe systems would see major projects delivered in much the same way as they are currently, but safe to fail systems would prioritize an 'investor' style whereby, as an example, nine out of 10 projects might end up failing but the remaining one would offer a 'step change' in capability.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/west-drawing-near-to-third-nuclear-age-says-head-of-uk-armed-forces/	2024-12-05T11:17:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/45159434.jpg.iCeS4I3rMWATAA.bg5Be7PyCV-e1733414373997.jpg
NGAD’s fate in Trump’s hands as Air Force punts decision to next administration	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — The US Air Force today announced that the incoming Trump administration will officially decide the fate of a planned sixth-generation stealth fighter, which has been on pause as officials reevaluate the platform’s design and requirements. 'The Secretary of the Air Force will defer the Next Generation Air Dominance way ahead decision to the next administration, while the Department of the Air Force continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program,' Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement today. Stefanek added that the Air Force 'is extending the current Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction contracts for the Next Generation Air Dominance program to further mature designs/systems while ensuring the industry teams remain intact.' To reflect the impact of delays with the program, the Air Force has also requested that bidding vendors 'update their proposals,' Stefanek said, noting that they are a 'schedule/milestone update only.' Observers expected such an announcement after weeks of non-committal statements from Air Force officials all the way up the Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has said a decision on NGAD would need to be made in time for the fiscal 2026 budget. That budget will now be crafted by Trump-appointed officials following the November election. The Air Force in 2023 set a target to award the NGAD contract to a winning vendor this year, though that plan hit a rough patch this summer after officials announced a pause in the plane’s development process to ensure they have the right design, as well as to attempt to bring its cost down. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are believed to be in a dogfight for rights to build the stealth fighter after aerospace prime Northrop Grumman publicly exited the competition last year, though Northrop has recently entertained the possibility of reentering the fray if the jet’s requirements change.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ngads-fate-in-trumps-hands-as-air-force-punts-decision-to-next-administration/	2024-12-05T10:28:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
‘Too early’ to rule out China-Russia cooperation in Baltic seabed cable incident, says Pentagon official	The Chinese ship, the bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 is anchored and being monitored by a Danish naval patrol vessel (unseen) in the sea of Kattegat, near the City og Granaa in Jutland, Denmark, on November 20, 2024. (Photo by MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A Pentagon official said she's unsure whether the recent damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea was the result of an intentional act and part of a broader Russian-Chinese plot, but the circumstances are suspicious enough to raise questions. 'I think that even a rational person, though, would say ‘Why is a Chinese vessel doing this and operating in this area?’ Some of our partners I've heard say this potentially leads back to Moscow,' Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for arctic and global resilience, said during an event with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'It's still too early to say, obviously, investigations are ongoing, but these are the kinds of dual use of one another's assets that I think we need to just be mindful of.' The incident in question took place in mid-November, when the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3 reportedly dropped its anchor and dragged it across a stretch of the Baltic seabed, in the process damaging undersea cables near Sweden and Denmark. While US and European officials have expressed confidence the ship is responsible for the damage, what is less clear is whether the act was deliberate. Soon after the incident, the Swedish government declined to directly assign blame but said that 'situations like these must be assessed with the growing threat posed by Russia in our neighbourhood as a backdrop. This includes an increased number of hybrid activities in Europe.' China has rejected accusations of sabotage. 'I would like to reiterate China's consistent support working with all countries to maintain the security of international submarine cables and other infrastructure in accordance with international law,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters last month, Reuters reported. Russia has also denied involvement. Since the incident occurred, Danish navy ships have been monitoring the Yi Peng 3, while Sweden and other European countries have sought the crew’s cooperation. Because the ship is in international waters, authorities are unable to force it to come into port. The incident is one in a series of events in recent years featuring European officials discovering damage to seabed cables running between their countries — sometimes the causes are known and other times they have been a mystery. RELATED: UK Naval Chief On Threats To Undersea Infrastructure: &#8216;We Don't Fully Understand' Solutions Regardless, the Pentagon has taken notice and made defense of underwater infrastructure a priority area for the trilateral security pact AUKUS. Equally, American officials and Ferguson in particular, have warned about Russia and China’s increasing cooperation. Just this year, Ferguson spearheaded a new arctic strategy for the Defense Department. 'Increasingly, the PRC and Russia are collaborating in the Arctic across multiple instruments of national power,' according to the document. 'Russia’s isolation as a result of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has made it increasingly reliant on the PRC for financing energy export infrastructure in the Arctic. Over 80 percent of Russia’s natural gas production and nearly 20 percent of its petroleum production comes from the Arctic, and Russia is increasingly turning to the PRC to fund this extraction and purchase these resources.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/too-early-to-rule-out-china-russia-cooperation-in-baltic-seabed-cable-incident-says-pentagon-official/	2024-12-05T09:42:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_yi_peng_3_GettyImages-2185111873-scaled-e1733418510214.jpg
Anduril, OpenAI enter ‘strategic partnership’ to use AI against drones	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019.(US Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — Defense startup Anduril is teaming up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in a 'strategic partnership' that Anduril says will 'develop and responsibly deploy advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for national security missions' — particularly in countering drones. 'By bringing together OpenAI’s advanced models with Anduril’s high-performance defense systems and Lattice software platform, the partnership aims to improve the nation’s defense systems that protect U.S. and allied military personnel from attacks by unmanned drones and other aerial devices,' Anduril said in a press release Wednesday. 'The Anduril and OpenAI strategic partnership will focus on improving the nation’s counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) and their ability to detect, assess and respond to potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time.' The collaboration comes as the Pentagon is racing to find ways to defend its troops and facilities, both abroad and at home, from the threat of drones of all sizes, a threat that's come to the fore rapidly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, especially. RELATED: Hundreds of drone incursions reported at military installations over past few years, NORTHCOM says Breaking Defense recently observed a military exercise in the Colorado mountains during which different companies demonstrated their own counter-drone solutions for the homeland, from cyberattacks to nets. In July, the Pentagon conducted a similar experiment, this time attempting to defend against drone swarms. 'No one capability, whether kinetic or non-kinetic, in itself could really just beat this kind of [attack] profile,' Col. Michael Parent, chief of acquisitions &amp; resources at the Army-led Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft System Office, said at the time. 'What we saw was they really do need a full system of systems approach, a layered approach.' Officials and experts have held up AI as a potential key aid in defeating drone swarms, allowing much faster identification of several threats that would otherwise overwhelm current systems and their human operators. In October, defense industry giant Northrop Grumman announced it was adding AI to an Army command system to better defend against the drone threat. However, the Pentagon is also grappling with the policy and ethical considerations of integrating AI into its operations, especially any missions involving kinetic fires. In other applications, like chat programs, the DoD has shown it's especially wary of potential mistakes current popular AI systems can make. Anduril appeared to acknowledge that concern, and in its release Wednesday said the two firms' 'shared commitment to AI safety and ethics is a cornerstone of this new strategic partnership.' The collaboration, Anduril said, will be 'subject to robust oversight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/anduril-openai-enter-strategic-partnership-to-use-ai-against-drones/	2024-12-05T08:53:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1733415596741.jpg
And then there were 3: NRO extends contracts for radar imagery to Capella, ICEYE, Umbra	Umbra SAR satellite image of Cannes, France (Umbra) WASHINGTON — The National Reconnaissance Office has granted new two-year contracts to three providers of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery: Capella Space, ICEYE US and Umbra, an NRO spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Wednesday. 'NRO's Commercial Systems Program Office provided a two-year period of performance extension under NRO's Strategic Commercial Enhancements Broad Agency Announcement (SCE BAA) which were initially awarded on Jan. 20, 2022. The period of performance extension for SCE BAA Stage III &#8211; Commercial Radar Capabilities is from July 2024 through July 2026,' the spokesperson elaborated. There were five SAR-sat firms in the original set of study contracts — the three Stage III winners, plus the US arm of European aerospace behemoth Airbus and Florida start-up PredaSAR. Airbus in October announced it had plans to cut up to 2,500 staff due to losses primarily in its Space Systems business. Reuters reported Wednesday that the firm announced 2,043 job reductions, more than half of which came from the Space Systems business. PredaSAR's parent company, Terran Orbital, in October 2022 abandoned plans for its SAR satellite constellation, and NRO dropped PredaSAR from its roster when the contract lapsed in September 2023. After a year of struggling with debt, Terran Orbital was acquired by Lockheed Martin on Oct. 30. The new Stage III contracts are expected by industry officials to be the last of the short term, relatively small dollar awards under the SCC BAA — with senior NRO officials pushing to create a longer term program of record in the fiscal 2026 budget. NRO's budget is classified, but it is an open secret that the agency has been slated only about $10 million a year for about 15 study contracts with providers of SAR, radio frequency geolocation and hyperspectral satellite imagery. 'From our perspective, it's another sign that the Commercial [Systems Program Office] is committed to supporting SAR, and that they're serious about it,' Joe Morrison, Umbra's vice president and general manager for remote sensing, told Breaking Defense on Tuesday. 'And despite the fact that, to date, they have not yet been able to stand up a program of record, they are very concertedly, explicitly working to transition the study. In the meantime, they're creating these additional phases that are substantive and very meaningful for the industry,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/and-then-there-were-3-nro-extends-contracts-for-radar-imagery-to-capella-iceye-umbra/	2024-12-05T07:18:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Umbra-SAR-sat-photo-e1685046168368.jpeg
Israel, Argentina to expand defense cooperation	Javier Milei (L), President of Argentina shakes hand with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R) in West Jerusalem on February 07, 2024. (Photo by GPO, Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Argentinian Minister of Defense Luis Petri traveled more than 12,000 miles earlier this week to ink an accord with his Israeli counterpart pledging the countries to a 'multi-year' effort to strengthen defense ties. The agreement, while short on details, said the effort would involve a focus on joint projects 'in cyber defense, unmanned aerial vehicles, border protection, satellite communications, and future government-to-government (G2G) contracts in light arms, light munitions, radios, and related equipment,' according to a Israeli Ministry of Defense statement on Monday. It would also establish a 'joint program for strategic workshops and seminars across various fields of mutual interest.' Israel’s Director General of the Ministry of Defense Eyal Zamir, who has sought to step down from his post recently, met with Petri during the visit. The two discussed 'strategic issues, including Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East and Latin America. Both emphasized the importance of continued collaboration and fostering stability in their regions,' the Ministry said. Argentina has grown closer to Israel under President Javier Milei. He was elected in 2023 and visited Israel in May 2024, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two months later, in solidarity with Jerusalem, Argentina declared Hamas a terrorist organization. The Israeli government described his visit at the time as marking a 'new milestone' in friendship between the countries. Israel’s Ministry of Defense characterized the recent visit by Petri as 'a testament to Argentina's unwavering support for Israel in the current war, strengthening the deep and strategic partnership between the nations.' Argentina would be an important partner in South America because Israel has faced struggles in several countries in that region. Colombia, for instance, broke ties with Israel in May 2024 due to the Gaza war. Bolivia has done the same, and Venezuela has been a harsh critic of Israel for years. A number of Israeli defense companies have made deals in Argentina in recent years. IAI subsidiary Elta’s Drone Guard system was used to protect the G20 meetings in Argentina in 2018. Rafael’s Cyber Dome also won a contract in the country. A report in June said Argentina was considering Rafael’s Spike LR2 anti-tank missile system. In addition, Elbit Systems has upgraded Argentina aircraft in the past. Other reports suggest Argentina has contracted with or expressed interest in other Israeli systems, although the tendency of Israeli companies to not identify their customers makes it difficult to quantify and confirm. Israeli companies may see the new strategic initiatives and Argentina’s interest in key technologies such as UAVs as a reason to focus on the market. For instance, in 2021 Bird Aerosystems, which makes missile protection systems and surveillance solutions for aircraft, opened an office in Argentina as part of its expansion in Latin America. During the meetings in Israel, Petri also brought a message from President Milei 'reaffirming Argentina's steadfast support for Israel's right to self-defense. He emphasized that Israel's current struggle represents not only a national fight but also the free world's collective battle against terrorism and civilization's stand against barbarism.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israel-argentina-to-expand-defense-cooperation/	2024-12-05T05:29:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241204_milei_netanyahu_shake_GettyImages-1984952448-e1733327850764.jpg
Ahead of defense gathering, poll finds majority agree on US as global leader, but then it’s complicated	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III delivers the keynote address during the 2021 Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Dec. 4, 2021. (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) REAGAN NATIONAL DEFENSE FORUM — As president-elect Donald Trump prepares to reclaim the oval office, a new poll found that while most Americans generally agree the US has a key leadership role to play on a global stage, they can be bitterly divided along political lines over exactly what that means when it comes to global hotspots like Ukraine and Israel. Each year the Ronald Reagan Institute releases its annual defense and national security poll before high-level officials and key lawmakers descend on Simi Valley, Calif. for a weekend forum. Pollsters this year conducted the survey just after Trump won the presidential election, and sought to shed a bit of light on Americans’ view of the security and defense landscape. According to this year’s bipartisan survey of more than 2,500 people, 57 percent of Americans believe the US should be more engaged leading international events — a 15 percent jump over 2023 findings. 'The strong preference for US leadership resonates across voters for both 2024 presidential candidates: six in 10 Trump voters (61 percent) and nearly as many [Kamala] Harris voters (59 percent) say the United States should be more engaged and take the lead,' it later added. Despite the widespread backing, however, divisive partisanship was apparent on what that should entail with responses swinging on issues like the wars in Ukraine or support for Israel. Opinions about the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, for example, proved more fraught than a year ago. Pollsters reported that 59 percent of participants now support peace negotiations, even if Kyiv was required to cede land to Moscow. And when it comes to providing military aid to Kyiv, there was a slight drop in support from 59 percent last year down to 55 percent this year — with 74 percent of Harris voters backing the deliveries compared with just 42 percent of Trump voters. At the same time, though, 78 percent of participants reported fears that the war could expand into NATO countries. Meanwhile in the Middle East, another stark partisan divide emerged over whether Israel should continue military operations inside Gaza or pursue a ceasefire. In total, 45 percent of respondents said they believe Israel has the right to continue military action there until the threat posed by Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran is removed — 64 percent of Trump voters and only 30 percent of Harris voters. In a similar vein, another 45 percent of participants backed a ceasefire with 63 percent of Harris voters in favor versus only 28 percent of Trump voters. Continued military aid to Israel was a less divisive topic, with 54 percent of Americans favoring continued military aid for Israel that left Trump voters coming in at 67 percent and Harris voters at the 46 percent mark. 'A wide range of issues drive Americans’ perception of China as our greatest adversary, with particular concern about its military ambitions,' the Reagan Institute said in a press release. 'When asked to choose their top concern, 28 percent identify China’s military buildup — an eight-point increase from last year.' When it comes to trust in the US military, respondents were more favorable in their assessment this year, with a five-point hike to 51 percent of Americans reporting a 'great deal of trust and confidence in the military.' 'Little partisan difference exists here, with 56 percent of Trump voters and 50 percent of Harris voters expressing high confidence in the military,' the Reagan Institute explained. 'There has also been a six-point increase since last year in those under 30 years old who express willingness to serve in the military.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ahead-of-defense-gathering-poll-finds-majority-agree-on-us-as-global-leader-but-then-its-complicated/	2024-12-04T21:01:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/6964966-scaled-e1641177794262.jpg

(Photo by Lance Cpl. Juan Diaz / Marine Forces Reserve) NATO EDGE 2024 — At a time when leaders from NATO countries and their allies are striving to share more data more securely, the Pentagon and the Canadian Armed Forces announced that they achieved federated identity, credential and access management (ICAM) connection between their armed forces in a joint pilot program. It's a relatively small step, but Ross Ermel, the defense chief digital officer for the Canadian Armed Forces said this week that when he and his team 'took this to the warfighting use case — I'll just keep it general for now — and they realized what they could do now that they could log on and share, eyes were open. It was a light bulb moment.' RELATED: As adversaries attack, Pentagon's zero trust office shifts focus to protecting &#8216;operational technology' With this federated, or in other terms shared connection, users in the US and Canada were able to securely access the other country’s data on an existing platform that they share, Pentagon acting chief information officer Leslie Beavers said today during a panel discussion. (Beavers did not specify the specific platform used in the pilot.) 'Identity management enables those two, those clouds, people within those clouds, organizations, equipment within those clouds, to trust each other and work together,' Beavers said. Adding that 'it is key to unlocking the modern capability that we all crave within our Department of Defenses and our alliances.' Beavers said that when she was in the US Air Force she often couldn’t connect to the systems she needed to, and those experiences inspired her to bolster interoperability not only within the DoD but also with foreign allies. 'I couldn't understand why as an Air Force member, when I traveled around to a number of different locations ... nothing would work, and it drove me nuts. So that is why I'm extremely passionate about taking on these foundational challenges and getting them solved, and solving these problems is through cooperation,' she said. Such cooperation, Beavers said, was made possible through her work with Ermel. 'If we can't talk and we can't trust each other, nation to nation, entity to entity, we truly don't have that interoperability that we seek in the future,' he said, adding that such ICAM interoperability is 'absolutely vital.' Now that the US and Canada have achieved federated ICAM connection with each other, Beavers said the next step is to expand this capability to all of NATO countries and other allies. 'We're starting really small [with the] US and Canada. We're writing the recipe, the playbook, the technology piece, the policy piece. We're going to then try and scale it to 32 [nations] and then to take it beyond to other allies and partners, but we need everybody's help,' she said. 'I just would ask everyone to focus a little bit on the mundane, and let's get this problem solved, and that will unleash the power of NATO.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/a-light-bulb-moment-us-canada-achieve-vital-federated-icam-connection-through-joint-pilot/	2024-12-04T13:24:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241204_canadian_us_computers_8377708-scaled-e1733347402569.jpg
Boeing fighter chief, Steve Nordlund, retiring	Storm clouds gather over Boeing's St. Louis headquarters. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Steve Nordlund, who has led Boeing Defense’s fighter jet business for the last two years, is retiring, Breaking Defense has learned. Nordlund, whose official title is vice president and general manager of Air Dominance, will be replaced by Dan Gillian, currently the vice president of Mobility, Surveillance &amp; Bombers. Gillian, in turn, will be replaced by Jamie Burgess, Boeing Defense’s current vice president for program management. A Boeing spokesperson confirmed the moves in response to an inquiry from Breaking Defense but declined further comment. Before taking over the air dominance unit, Nordlund spent a year running the company’s Phantom Works unit; that combined experience lined up with Boeing’s attempt to win the US Air Force’s Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) effort, which is now facing budgetary headwinds from the service. Overall, he spent 15 years at Boeing, having come over when the aerospace giant purchased drone firm Insitu. His exit comes amidst the backdrop of uncertainty at Boeing. New CEO Kelly Ortberg announced in October plans to lay off roughly 10 percent of the company as he seeks to get the aerospace giant back on track, and the company's defense sector remains without a full-time leader since Ted Colbert was ousted in September. On the whole, the defense unit has logged $3.2 billion in charges on the year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/boeing-fighter-chief-steve-nordlund-retiring/	2024-12-04T13:11:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-HQ-e1719847032260.jpg

(Photo by Sgt. Derrick Irions / U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Europe and Africa) NATO EDGE 2024 — The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) has released its first technology strategy, aimed at bolstering innovation so the alliance can reach the digital capabilities it needs to conduct full scale multi-domain operations by 2030. The strategy introduces the NATO Digital Foundry, a project that will provide opportunities for NCIA, industry, not-for-profit organizations and other NATO stakeholders to collaborate on new technologies. The idea is to get products from the prototyping stage into the hands of warfighters faster all while being secure and interoperable, Calderon said. 'It's about creating a secure, open platform for industry or academia or national centers,' Calderon said. 'Then you can bring your products or prototypes or DIANA [Defense Innovation for the North Atlantic] startups ideas, and then we will offer those innovators [the products] to the rest of NATO. We can offer you connections to our air command-and-control labs, ballistic missile defense labs, our crypto labs, our network reference facilities and all those, whether physical or virtual.' The strategy focuses on six technology themes which include: 'Even though we selected six technology teams, the power is about interconnecting different technologies, because when you bring them together, then you have that force multiplier that brings innovatio,' Calderon said. 'It took months of discussion to confirm that those are the ones that will bring the most value, because we have thousands of technologies to choose from.' The data exploitation focus aims to 'leverage data as a strategic resource to contribute to cognitive and decision superiority and enable [multi-domain operations],' the strategy reads. This theme heavily focuses on exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning for improved data management so the alliance and its warfighters can make better, quicker data-informed decisions. The focal point of the strategy’s cloud computing theme is cloud adoption. The strategy explains that NATO needs to move its data to a cloud environment because as 'capabilities become increasingly software-based and software-defined, the cloud’s role as an open, secure and scalable platform driving modern innovation and collaboration approaches has become essential.' Cloud adoption also includes the federation of clouds, which means the ability for different cloud providers and systems to work together. RELATED: Pentagon plans secure cloud pilot to defend small businesses from hackers The strategy explains that the next generation networks focus area is designed to provide communication services that are 'resilient' in 'high throughput and low latency' environments. This includes implementing safeguards when using 5G networks and putting 'severe pressure on the radio frequency spectrum, particularly the one for primary military use, at every World Radio Conference cycle,' according to the strategy. The space technologies focus area expands on NATO’s 'need to guarantee' access to data, products and services (DPS) and to 'assure' the defense capabilities that will limit adversarial use of space enabled and space-based systems against NATO. That means harnessing SATCOM, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); positioning, navigation and timing and other technologies. NATO also wants to establish responsive launch capabilities that will allow new satellites to be launched on a 'ready-to-go' basis so the alliance can have quicker access to DPS. RELATED: 24 hours to launch: Space Force, DIU kick off new &#8216;Tactically Responsive Space' mission For cybersecurity, the strategy outlines two aims. The first is the introduction and implementation of modern cyber architectures in all member nations. It highlights the need for zero trust principles and 'secure integration' when using information and operation technologies. The second aim is focused on supporting cyberspace operations both offensively and defensively. For example, the use of ISR, counter AI technologies and 'cyberspace targeting.' In the realm of AI, the strategy aims to establish a 'cyber immune system' which will not only defend against cyber threats but also autonomously 'self-repair and adapt in case of breaches.' Lastly, the strategy highlights NATO’s role in quantum technologies. This was the 'more controversial' theme when building the strategy, Calderon said, because some involved in the process 'don't believe quantum will ever be reality.' Still, NATO plans to invest in quantum sensors to maintain the alliance’s 'technological edge.' Furthermore, the strategy warns of the potential dangers of quantum computers and calls for developing quantum key distributors and quantum number generators that can protect against quantum computer’s ability to break cryptography that protects the alliance’s machines.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-agency-unveils-first-of-its-kind-tech-strategy-for-multi-domain-operations/	2024-12-04T11:48:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241204_NATO_computer-1541984-scaled-e1733334412102.jpg
Rapid pace of modern conflict requires modern pace of training: Officers	Ukrainians train with handheld drones. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) I/ITSEC 2024 — One of the key advantages the US believes it has over its peer competitors is the sophistication and depth of the training that its members must pass through before they depart for their given missions. That belief has only been reinforced after more than two and a half years of the war in Ukraine, where reports emerged of Russian recruits having as few as two weeks of training before being sent to the front and suffering horrendously high casualty rates. Speaking with the different firms and organizations present at this year’s Interservice/Industry Training Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC), it is clear the training and simulation community is trying to take lessons from real-world conflicts in order to keep training as relevant as possible for the modern warfighter. New and rapidly-evolving elements on the battlefield of today are not so much turning training and simulation requirements upside down as they are adding new modules to the training syllabus, according to speakers at this year’s conference. During the opening ceremonies here today, Vice CNO Adm. James W. Kirby and Lt. Gen. Benjamin T. Watson, the head of the USMC Training and Education Command, highlighted how critical the training function has become in a time when weapon systems are becoming increasingly complex and expensive. Describing one ground vehicle as 'an F-35 on wheels,' Watson pointed out that this kind of hardware is too expensive to procure and operate to be putting endless op-tempo 'hours on these platforms just to build proficiency.' That means a 'steeply increasing need for simulation' in order to keep costs down and vehicle lifespans up. The two officers noted that everyone’s favorite buzzword, 'artificial intelligence,' also has an important function in the training and simulation space, where it could enhance the effectiveness of the warfighter through 'predictive analysis.' In a panel following the industry keynote address, Watson elaborated on this point by sketching the terrain likely to be confronted by many US military commanders in any coming conflict, noting 'You cannot train units and personnel once the fighting begins without leaving gaps in then-operational forces.' 'If you believe you are going to have insufficient time to be prepared, insufficient force capacity when the conflict begins and that we are going to be tested,' then having the most realistic, high-end training possible is vital, Watson said. 'If you do not have your assets in a position to be relevant when the conflict arises then you will not get to a point where you will be prepared within a relevant timeline.' He also emphasized that any future combat scenario will involve being under near-constant surveillance, something the US military needs to be adapting to and training on now. The comments from the two officers were largely in line with what exhibitors were discussing, or showing off, on the conference floor. I/ITSEC, which originally began as largely a US Navy and other military services event, has since evolved into a conference that pulls in all the service branches, US federal agencies, major defense contractors, healthcare firms, transportation specialists and cyber warriors. 'It is one of those few defense industry events where you see snake-eaters, wrench-turners and computer nerds in the same room — and talking with one another in a common language about common problems,' said one of the participants on the floor. Although not a major focus of the officer’s opening comments, a tour of the show floor reveals a clear acknowledgement of the overwhelming presence of drones of all shapes, sizes and mission profiles on the modern battlefield. But training and simulation for drone warfare is expanding well beyond the need to create capable and competent drone pilots. More than one contractor was displaying a product line that enables the warfighter to now hit back against the wave of these low-altitude battlefield drones. At one end of the scale are simple training systems that teach an infantryman the easiest and most effective ways to shoot down a UAV, while the other end of the scale features a new electronic warfare simulation of how to take out large numbers of Russian drones. In one of the more recent large-scale Russian drone attacks, Ukrainian EW systems managed to take out more than 50 suicide, one-way drones and 'disoriented' several others that returned to base when their guidance packages were scrambled, meaning that kind of large-scale EW effort is going to be important for the US and its allies to keep concurrent on.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rapid-pace-of-modern-conflict-requires-modern-pace-of-training-officers/	2024-12-04T10:33:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/230526_ukraine_quadcopter_GettyImages-1468749342-scaled-e1693994223641.jpg
Shipbuilder HII to acquire facilities from South Carolina company for sub construction	An aerial view of W International's facilities in South Carolina. Navy shipbuilder HII plans to purchase 'substantially all' assets from the company. (Photo courtesy of HII.) WASHINGTON — Navy shipbuilder HII today announced its plans to acquire 'substantially all of the assets' of South Carolina-based metal fabricator W International and use the new location to begin submarine module construction beginning next year. HII said the deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 pending regulatory approvals though did not disclose any information about the costs. The facilities are in Charleston, SC, roughly 400 miles south of HII's Newport News Shipbuilding, which manufactures US Navy aircraft carriers and works with General Dynamics Electric Boat to produce Virginia and Columbia-class submarines. 'HII is committed to increasing build rates for our Navy customer, and this investment in capacity alongside the Navy will help us do that,' HII President and CEO Chris Kastner said in a statement. 'It lets us efficiently add trained talent and state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to the urgent job of building ships, making it a unique opportunity to accelerate throughput at Newport News Shipbuilding in support of the Navy and AUKUS.' The deal includes 480,000 square feet of manufacturing space on a 45-acre site as well as access to a barge and rail lines to transport completed modules back to either Newport News or General Dynamics Electric Boat. HII said it plans to offer employment to 'substantially all' of W International’s current employees. 'Submarines will be the first priority. That’s where we're starting,' Jennifer Boykin, Newport News Shipbuilding’s outgoing president, told reporters today. 'But we do see the opportunity to — because of the size of the of the facility — also include aircraft carrier unit builds.' The acquisition comes amid the backdrop of numerous efforts by the Navy and industry to bolster the submarine industrial base. The service has spent the past year working with Texas-based non-profit BlueForge Alliance to recruit more shipyard workers with an initial goal of adding 100,000 workers over the next decade. Speaking at a Tuesday event hosted by the Center for Maritime Security, Navy officials told attendees they had recently upped that goal closer to 140,000 workers. The service also recently inked a deal with a private investment firm and shipbuilder Austal USA to purchase and develop a piece of land in Mobile, Ala, for submarine module construction. Austal itself has recently become a more active player in the submarine industrial base, getting work from General Dynamics Electric Boat and making facility expansions to support those efforts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/shipbuilder-hii-to-acquire-facilities-from-south-carolina-company-for-sub-construction/	2024-12-04T10:26:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Goose-Creek-SC-Aerial-4-scaled.jpg
To counter China and support national security, Congress must empower NIST	The US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) building is seen October 9, 2012 in Boulder, Colorado. (Photo by Dana Romanoff/Getty Images) America’s future competitiveness will be driven by our ability to capture the economic and national security benefits of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. Within government, these efforts are underpinned by the research and standards development done at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency with a remarkable track record of success supporting American innovation. Given this success, it’s no surprise that China is seeking to manipulate international standards organizations to its own benefit. In fact, global standards leadership is a stated aim of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi’s Jinping’s China Standards 2035 plan, specifically to lessen American influence. In contrast, NIST is being underprioritized. The agency has crumbling buildings and leaking ceilings. The rapid growth of industry salaries for emerging technology jobs means that NIST finds it increasingly hard to compete with the private sector for top talent. Federal agency limitations further currently constrain NIST from bringing the results of its research into commercial practice to benefit the US economy. And during an era of rapid progress in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, the agency is limited in its ability to respond due to the slow pace of new funding and hiring. NIST’s legacy is at risk, and we are not equipping the agency to meet this challenge. But if it is willing to grasp it, the outgoing Congress has an opportunity to reverse these trends and poke a thumb in China’s eye. A solution lies with the bipartisan Expanding Partnerships for Innovation and Competitiveness Act (EPIC) Act, endorsed by more than forty American companies, universities, and think tanks, as well as by heads of NIST that have served under Presidents Trump, Obama, and Bush. EPIC would equip NIST with a non-profit foundation, enabling it to harness philanthropic investment to complement its mission. While NIST will always answer to Congress and operate within its authorized mission, a foundation can help connect this important work to the private sector where the market can accelerate the best ideas forward. For NIST, a foundation could help further basic R&amp;D and support innovation in critical technologies like AI, while countering China’s manipulation of international standards for new technologies. As we enter a world where US leadership in emerging technologies is inextricably linked to national security, Congress should support NIST’s important work by prioritizing the full passage of EPIC as part of this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As an agency, NIST is not the sexiest of items to be argued about in the NDAA. It doesn’t blow things up, nor does it fly at hypersonic speeds. To understand its importance, one needs to understand how NIST actually works. NIST’s role among federal agencies is unique. It is not a regulator, and it doesn’t focus on a particular set of applied scientific or technical domains. Rather, its focus is at a higher level: advancing the leading edge of measurement science — and using that science to help push the boundaries of research and create standards for technologies, opening new domains of innovation. Why are measurements and standards useful for pushing the frontier of innovation? Once it’s possible to measure something, it then becomes possible to test it and make it better. Technical standards provide American industries with a common language to facilitate trade and enable scientists and engineers to work on common goals that cut across technical disciplines. NIST’s mission is thus tightly linked with American innovation and technological competitiveness — making sure everyone is on the same page allows the full force of American industrial might to be brought on a particular problem. In pursuit of its mission, NIST has punched far above its weight: Agency scientists have been awarded 15 percent of the Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded to Americans since 2000, with two further prizes directly enabled by measurement work done at NIST. These achievements have come despite NIST receiving less than half a percent of federal R&amp;D funding. Cutting edge defense technologies stand to benefit going forward. In biotechnology, NIST has developed reference molecules that labs across the United States use to develop new tools. In quantum computing, NIST has run a successful program to identify new encryption algorithms that are resistant to powerful quantum computers. In AI, NIST developed the 'MNIST' database, which has been one of the most important benchmarks used to help develop neural networks, the technology behind today’s most powerful AI models. However, NIST faces challenges in its future capacity to deliver on its mission: the recent rapid pace of progress in emerging technologies has made it hard for the agency to flexibly scale its projects in response. Many agencies have in the past found a similar mismatch between their basic structure as a federal body and the rapidly changing science and innovation landscape they are expected to respond to, and there exists a proven solution for addressing them. Congress has long used 'agency foundations' as a solution, complementing agencies’ missions by enabling the deployment of philanthropic investment. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health runs fellowships to attract top scientists to the agency. The Center for Disease Control’s foundation hosts an emergency response fund, which raised nearly $600 million in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to distribute 8.5 million pieces of PPE and hire more than 3,000 surge health workers. The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research supports the Department of Agriculture by hosting ambitious prize competitions, and innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives. These and other agency foundations have been an efficient mechanism for amplifying their agency’s work, averaging a return of $67 for every $1 in federal contributions. And compared to more ad hoc solutions like the use of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act to allow an agency to employ technical experts funded by external organizations, an agency foundation provides a more transparent and well-governed alternative. One key area where a non-profit foundation could be especially useful for NIST’s work is in international standards. American businesses do better when they have a voice in international standard-setting. Today, the Chinese government is manipulating the global standards-setting processes by paying its experts to participate, and incentivizing them to all vote in the same direction. Because the US approach is industry-led by design, NIST cannot directly support US experts to counter China’s efforts. A NIST foundation could fill this gap by supporting US experts (especially from small and medium-sized enterprises) to participate in international standard-setting, ensuring a level playing field for American enterprises. Congress should act now to give NIST the necessary tools it needs to deliver on its core mission — promoting US leadership in technical standards, and accelerating the development and adoption of critical emerging technologies, in a voluntary process involving both large and small firms. To do this, NIST should be equipped with its own Foundation, a proven, effective tool that other federal R&amp;D agencies already enjoy. Walter G.

Trump taps Driscoll as Army secretary, Navarro as trade advisor	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Trevor Raney/Digital Media Division) 'As a former soldier, investor, and political advisor, Dan brings a powerful combination of experiences to serve as a disruptor and change agent,' Trump announced on Truth Social. According to the statement, Driscoll is a graduate of Yale Law School and former Army soldier. Trump praised Driscoll’s work in the private equity arena and said he will be a 'fearless and relentless fighter for America’s soldiers and the America First agenda.' The Pentagon's video repository features an interview with a young officer, Daniel Driscoll, whose deployment to Iraq matches that noted in Trump's description. If confirmed by the Senate to be the 26th Army secretary, Driscoll will take over a service in the throes of modernizing its weapon portfolio, ramping up the defense industrial base and grappling with recruiting. In Navarro, Trump is bringing in a loyalist who served roughly four months in jail for refusing to comply with a Congressional subpoena investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021 — something Trump, in his announcement today, described as Navarro being 'treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it.' In his new role, Navarro, 75, will be asked to 'help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas,' per the announcement. During the first Trump administration, Navarro was a key voice pushing the theme of 'economic security is national security,' which manifested in advocating for greater defense exports. He also helped shepherd through a review of the defense industrial base to identify weak points in the supply chain. The announcements come amidst reporting that the nomination of Pete Hegseth to be Defense Secretary has hit some rocks, with Florida governor Ron DeSantis reportedly emerging as a backup should Hegseth fail to find support in the senate.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/trump-taps-driscoll-as-army-secretary-navarro-as-trade-advisor/	2024-12-04T08:54:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
Amid high north race, Coast Guard to seek green light soon to start building first new icebreaker	The Coast Guard Ice Breaker Polar Sea works the ice channel near McMurdo, Antarctica. (USCG photo by Rob Rothway) WASHINGTON — The US Coast Guard plans to seek approval from the Department of Homeland Security later this month to begin production of the lead ship in the Polar Security Cutter program, a major milestone for the first American icebreaker to be produced in decades. Adm. Kevin Lunday, the Coast Guard’s vice commandant, told attendees at a Tuesday event hosted by the Center for Maritime Security the service is seeing a 'significant increase in design maturity.' 'Bollinger [Shipyards] is learning quickly how to rebuild the knowledge base that disappeared since we hadn’t built an icebreaker in so long — but we are making progress and we are moving forward,' he said, referring to the program’s prime contractor. The Polar Security Cutter is one of the Coast Guard’s top acquisition programs, and will see the design and construction of three new heavy icebreakers. The program has seen its share of challenges since inception — including one recent independent government watchdog warning the costs will skyrocket over Coast Guard projections — but the service’s current schedule projected the lead ship’s production would begin in 2024. Icebreakers are a unique class of ship, and lead vessels are almost always more expensive than originally projected due to unexpected challenges during construction. Making PSC a particularly challenging build is the fact that, unlike submarines and destroyers, the United States hasn't produced a new heavy icebreaker in decades, resulting in atrophy of the subset of the industrial base that once specialized in their construction. At one point this past summer, the two American icebreakers that are still operational were both stuck in maintenance at a time the Coast Guard would have preferred to have a ship patrolling in the High North. RELATED: ICE Pact: Why The US Had To Recruit Help In Race With Russia, China For Arctic Icebreakers In the meantime, the service has successfully acquired a commercially available icebreaker, Aiviq, which Lunday said has already been repainted and branded with US Coast Guard markings. He expects that ship to be 'operational here shortly.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/amid-high-north-race-coast-guard-to-seek-green-light-soon-to-start-building-first-new-icebreaker/	2024-12-04T08:37:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/1071546-e1733326815916.jpg
South Korean crisis likely to have military, geopolitical reverberations: Analysts	Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4 2024, after South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol on December 3 declared martial law, accusing the opposition of being 'anti-state forces' and saying he was acting to protect the country from 'threats' posed by the North. (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — South Korea appears to have survived a brief, stunning attempt by its president to impose martial law, but the aftermath may lead to lasting damage in its relations with allies and partners, including the US, analysts told Breaking Defense. President Yoon Suk Yeol had based his foreign policy around being tougher on North Korea, a tighter embrace of the United States and, perhaps most controversially inside South Korea, pushing for closer defense relations with Japan, including by restarting a major intelligence sharing agreement with Tokyo. His fall — which seems inevitable 24 hours after his martial law declaration, with his defense minister offering to resign over the plan and an impeachment process underway — will have 'profound' effects on those foreign policy goals, according to Chun In-bum, a former deputy commander of South Korea’s First Army. 'The entire ordeal lasted only six hours, yet its implications are profound. It was bizarre, embarrassing, and politically damaging for the Yoon administration. The short-lived declaration of martial law raises significant questions about the president’s judgment, the advice he received, and the decision-making process within the government,' Chun wrote in an email to Breaking Defense, adding that the 'political fallout will be severe and long-lasting.' The extent of that fallout, predicted Euan Graham, will be global. 'If Yoon's impeached and the progressives regain power then I think the outlook for bilateral relations with Japan and the US trilateral will darken,' Graham, a regional expert with IISS, told Breaking Defense. However, don't expect immediate changes. 'Yoon is unlikely to resign but there is already enormous public outcry and bilateral political support for his impeachment. The National Assembly already has impeachment bills moving, and they will likely pass quickly,' said Jenny Town, an expert on the Korean peninsula at Washington's Stimson Center. 'Yoon will be removed from duty and Prime Minister Han [Duck-soo] will assume interim presidential duties.' Under South Korean law, Parliament may impeach the president. If it does and it is upheld by a Constitutional Court then a successor must be elected within 60 days. Yoon would serve in the interim for at least part of that time. 'It should be noted that Lee Jae-myung, the most prominent of the opposition leaders, is currently ineligible to run for president due to his own legal problems,' Town wrote in an email to Breaking Defense, raising questions about who will run to replace Yoon. 'The incident leaves lingering doubts about the future of the nation's political climate and the ability of its leadership to navigate complex challenges. It will serve as a sobering case study in the delicate balance of power, the risks of executive overreach, and the resilience required to uphold democratic principles,' Chun wrote. Once Yoon is forced out, there may be a retrenchment against tighter relations with Japan, analysts said. Yoon's desire to tighten bonds with Tokyo, while championed in Washington by national security officials who always view Japan and South Korea as natural allies, has never been popular domestically, where the wounds from World War II remain raw for the public. Notably, the impeachment resolution introduced in the National Assembly specifically calls out Yoon's approach to Japan as part of the reason he should be forced out, including accusations he 'adhered to a peculiar Japan-centric foreign policy,' per a translation. Chun was blunt, saying that if Yoon goes and the more liberal opposition wins, 'Japan-Korea relations will go down the drain.' One area where a new president may reverse gains made with Japan is on the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), an intelligence-sharing system originally set up in 2016, paused in 2019, and then restarted by Yoon and his Japanese counterpart, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, in 2023. Both Chun and Leonid Petrov, a Korean expert at the Australian National University in Canberra, said that freezing participation in GSOMIA would be an easy anti-Japanese move for the next government to make, with Petrov adding that Yoon's actions might raise serious concerns among the Japanese about the stability of South Korea's leadership.

(Kiyoshi Ota &#8211; Pool/Getty Images) As for the bedrock relationship for South Korea, that with the United States, Town said much will ride on who South Korea elects as their next leader — who will regardless likely start on a back foot with President-elect Donald Trump. 'This reminds me a bit of 2017 in the sense that no matter who the next president of South Korea is, they will be late to the game with Trump. South Korean leadership was in flux the first time Trump took office, meaning others had the advantage of making a strong first impression,' Town wrote. 'While there was some speculation that Trump and Yoon would get along well, the opportunity to get in early and make a strong first impression is gone.' How much all of that will change will depend a great deal on how Trump, who appears skeptical of alliances in general, actually approaches the one with South Korea and the one with Japan, Town said. That may drive South Korea to move 'back toward greater strategic ambiguity in balancing its relations between the US and China.' 'If Trump takes aim at [South] Korea for more host nation support payments, then obviously that spells trouble,' Graham noted. 'The Korean president is not the only variable' in the Washington-Seoul relationship. Will all this uncertainty lead to saber-rattling or more dangerous moves by North Korea? Town doesn't think so. 'If [former President] Park Guen-hye's impeachment [in 2016] is any indication of how Pyongyang may be assessing the situation, they are unlikely to do anything overtly provocative toward South Korea in the coming weeks or months to disrupt the process. They will likely get in a few rhetorical jabs at Yoon on his way out, but otherwise see how the situation plays out,' Town said. She added that Pyongyang is deeply engaged in helping Russia in Ukraine, and 'those efforts will not be put on hold because of what's happening in the South.' Petrov is also skeptical North Korea will look to make a move, even though, he said, Pyongyang will likely interpret the South Korean military's unwillingness to use force against civilians during the six-hour crisis as a sign of weakness. Instead, Petrov said, expect North Korea to use the political and military disorder shown in the last two days for propaganda purposes and let it speak for itself. For its part the US has been quick to stress that peace and order is maintained. 'The United States has watched closely developments over the last 24 hours in the Republic of Korea,' said Antony Blinken, US Secretary of State in a statement on Tuesday. 'We welcome President Yoon’s statement that he would rescind the order declaring emergency martial law in accordance with the ROK Constitution, after the National Assembly’s unanimous vote to reject the declaration. We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law. We reaffirm our support for the people of Korea and the U.S.-ROK alliance based on shared principles of democracy and the rule of law.'

‘Huge implications’ as top Chinese military leader under investigation, joins 3rd defense minister	Chinese President Xi Jinping is applauded as he waves to senior members of the government upon arrival at the opening of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party at the Great Hall of People on October 16, 2022 in Beijing. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) SYDNEY — A public announcement that one of the most important figures in the Chinese military is under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline' — the latest in a string of moves against senior defense leadership — has 'huge implications' for Beijing, analysts told Breaking Defense. Last week, while much of the US defense establishment was enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday, Chinese state television announced Miao Hua, director of the Political Work Department at the Central Military Commission, had been suspended. The announcement marked a departure from Beijing's actions against two previous defense ministers, all of whom vanished from public view before it became clear they were being investigated for corruption. It's also a departure, according to expert Dean Cheng, because Miao can be considered more senior than the defense ministers. Miao Hua, a member of Central Military Commission (CMC) and director of CMC&#39;s Political Work Department, is suspended from his post due to suspected serious violations of discipline, CCTV reported. https://t.co/CTwFrTC8UZ pic.twitter.com/x77SY4OGlJ &mdash; Global Times (@globaltimesnews) November 28, 2024 'This would DIRECTLY concern the top CCP leadership, as the PLA is a party-army, the armed wing of the CCP. If there are problems in the PWD, the implication is that the PLA may not be seen as 100% reliable,' he said, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly given speeches about the importance of the military being subordinate to the will of the CCP civilian leadership. Exactly how this will all play out is unclear, Cheng and another analyst agreed. 'It's clear that the corruption investigations of the PLARF [People's Liberation Army Rocket Force] were not a one-off, but have led to a larger and more systematic investigation across the PLA,' Meia Nouwens, a China defense expert at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'I suspect two things matter here: Xi getting on top of corruption in service branches that are of vital importance to any PLA priority mission, and, secondly, personal connections between those investigated,' she said. But overall, it's the extraordinary prospect of three Chinese defense ministers being investigated for corruption, and now someone senior to the defense ministers being suspended. A day before the announcement about Miao, The Financial Times reported that China's current defense minister, Adm. Dong Jun, was also under investigation. (A spokesperson for the Chinese military reportedly called that allegation 'just shadow-chasing' without further explanation.) Prior to Dong, former Defense Minister Li Shangfu's removal from office was announced on Oct. 24 last year. He had not been seen in public since late August. The last Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang, vanished from sight for weeks and was formally removed in July that year. Before Li’s official departure, there were clear signs of turmoil in the Chinese military, with several top leaders of the Rocket Force having been ousted. 'Having three Defense Ministers investigated, and two publicly accused of corruption, does not give a sense of stability within the PLA. The reports of Miao Hua (on the CMC) also being investigated makes this more serious as his position makes him more senior,' Nouwens opined. 'It also raises questions' about contacts between foreign militaries and the PLA as they usually occur through defense ministers. Though Nouwens suggested Xi is genuinely attempting to root out corruption, Cheng said that the Chinese Communist Party has used 'corruption' charges liberally as a tool against those who have displeased the leadership — for whatever reason. 'This goes to the fundamental reality that Chinese officers (and officials more broadly) may be removed on charges of corruption, but that does not mean that they are, in fact, corrupt. &#8216;Anti-corruption' is a catch-all phrase that is convenient (given Xi's ongoing anti-corruption efforts), but is not necessarily the REAL reason for an officer or official being removed,' Cheng said. Opposition to Xi's policies can 'be a trigger for removal,' Cheng added. 'The PLA has been undergoing major changes throughout the Xi era. In 2015, the PLA underwent massive reforms, including a restructuring of the services and the CMC itself. So, Miao and Dong Jun's investigation should be examined in light of the removal of a number of PLA Rocket Force leaders including Wei Fenghe, and the removal of Li Shangfu (previous defense minister).' Though hard information is scant, Cheng hypothesizes that the removals may be reflective of attempts by the leaders 'to make changes to PLA doctrine and strategy that run counter to Xi's thoughts and preferences. Gaining more resources, but not necessarily gaining more missions and tasks (e.g., more theater command slots) might lead to resentment at the senior level, leading in turn to purging by Xi.' He added, 'The PLA is probably overdue for a new set of doctrine. Unlike the US military, the Chinese take doctrine VERY seriously, and changes in doctrine leads to changes in acquisitions and even changes in organization.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/huge-implications-as-top-chinese-military-leader-under-investigation-joins-3rd-defense-minister/	2024-12-04T05:32:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/xi_20th_congress-scaled-e1671476420682.jpg
NATO CIO: Alliance-wide classified cloud system is in the works	Solider monitors air and ground position location information (PLI) on the Windows Tactical Assault Kit (WINTAK) and Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) to get a common operating picture that enhances situational awareness and data sharing. (US Army photo by Justine Ruggio/Released) NATO EDGE 2024 — In an effort to move toward data centricity, NATO is in the process of creating a classified cloud system in which member nations can share secret information, NATO's chief information officer told Breaking Defense. 'It puts data together that right now is in different repositories,' Manfred Boudreaux-Dehmer said in an interview. 'The very fact of collocating the data in the same instance, or within the same environment or infrastructure, is very, very helpful. Moving into a common cloud environment also forces you to think about data differently and to prepare it for the move, which in itself will be conducive to analyzing the data later.' He said that the ultimate goal is to get all 32 member nations on the classified cloud, but the timeline of this depends on how quickly each country is capable of moving its data. 'It's not an easy process, because you've got subject matter experts coming in from nations, and there's a lot of concerns and technical considerations that the team has to work through. So it's moving fast, but I don't have a definite timeline,' he said. Currently, there is a group of about five to 10 nations who volunteered to draft an implementation directive which will serve as a framework for how the alliance can handle secret data in a cloud environment, Boudreaux-Dehmer said. He added that he did not know all of the countries on the drafting team, but confirmed that the United States and the United Kingdom are part of the group and that all the countries are 'experienced in the cloud journey.' After the drafted directive is completed, all 32 nations must agree on it before it is approved and nations can start working toward accreditation and pilot processes. Once one country is accredited, it makes it easier for other countries to follow suit, Stephen Lewis, who serves as the acting chief of the cloud portfolio at the NATO Communications and Information Agency, told Breaking Defense. However, 'this doesn't mean it's an easy bar for all of NATO' to be accredited, he said. Chief of Staff of the Allied Command Transformation at NATO Simon Asquith shared the CIO’s sentiment of needing a classified cloud during a panel discussion, saying that data centricity is vital in bolstering NATO’s technological innovation. 'Number one, focus on digital transformation and move to a classified cloud,' Asquith said when listing his priorities for digital innovation. 'Without that, we won't be able to [conduct] multi-domain operations. So we need a good digital backbone. We need a classified cloud as quickly as possible so we can integrate machine learning tools and deliver information at a speed of relevance and allow commands to make decisions. If we can't do that, I think we will fail.' Boudreaux-Dehmer explained that following suspicious Russian cyber activity right before the Kremlin invaded Ukraine, Ukraine moved its sensitive data out of data centers and into the cloud. He said this served as an 'inspiration' for NATO to move to move data to the cloud and eventually build a classified cloud system. 'Situations cannot be compared between NATO and the Ukraine, but it has been very, very inspirational whenever I had conversations with people in the Ukraine who were involved in the cloud migration. It's inspirational moving faster and giving it a good push for us, the cloud really is a prerequisite for a lot of things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-cio-alliance-wide-classified-cloud-system-is-in-the-works/	2024-12-03T13:32:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240405_DVIDS_atak_monitors_6369124-scaled-e1712349705569.jpg
Advances in radar are key to countering the modern drone warfare and missile threat	Raytheon recently entered into an agreement with NATO to provide Patriot PAC-2 GEM-T (Guidance Enhanced Missile) interceptors, and NATO can now collectively manage the distribution of the missiles. (Raytheon photo) The evolution of air and missile defense threats – including challenges posed by threats ranging from drone swarms to ballistic and hypersonic missiles – necessitates development of advanced radar and sensing systems that will allow air defense systems like Patriot to remain lethal for years ahead. Breaking Defense discussed this challenge with Tom Laliberty, president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems at Raytheon, an RTX business, and how they can be addressed with radar advancements like the U.S. Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), internationally through the GhostEye MR radar for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) developed jointly by Raytheon and Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace (KDA), and in the counter-UAS role with the KuRFS radar and Coyote kinetic and non-kinetic effectors for the Army’s integrated counter-UAS solution called LIDS (Low, slow, small UAS Integrated Defeat System). Breaking Defense: How have the threat scenarios evolved this decade given what we’ve seen in Europe and other AORs? Tom Laliberty is president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems at Raytheon, an RTX business. Tom Laliberty: What we're seeing today is massive raid sizes with hundreds of missiles launched by the adversary and arriving from every direction. The adversary is trying to overwhelm air defense systems with a huge number of threats that must be dealt with simultaneously. The strategy is that if you’re busy dealing with all these low-cost threats, then the high-value ones – the ballistic missile, the high-speed cruise missile – will find its target. For us, this means we have to build 360-degree systems that are robust enough to handle that complexity with sensors having the capability to manage that massive data set, ensuring that we're prosecuting threats in a way that prioritizes those that could potentially cause the highest level of damage. Tell us about Raytheon’s legacy in air defense systems that includes Patriot and NASAMS. In air and missile defense, Patriot is probably the most well-known system. It’s now the system chosen by 19 countries, the latest being Ukraine. What’s advantageous about Patriot is that with those 19 customers, the community of users can essentially coordinate with the Army to share threat information, which enables us to continuously upgrade the system and make sure it's operating at the highest level of maturity and at the cutting edge of dealing with any threat. NASAMS is now the chosen medium-range air defense system for 13 countries. That's a great system in terms of integrating capabilities from Raytheon’s Sentinel radar, to command and control from Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace, and missiles from the Air Force and Navy portfolios, which are also produced by Raytheon – AIM-9X, AMRAAM, and AMRAAM-ER. NASAMS’ capability will be improved with the new GhostEye MR radar that is now undergoing integration testing. NASAMS with GhostEye MR and its family of effectors can deal with different classes of threats in the most cost-effective way. For counter-UAS, we have the KuRFS radar and Coyote interceptor, providing the warfighter highly tuned radar capabilities paired with a cost-effective Coyote Block 2 effector to deal with low-cost threats. We also have a non-kinetic effector called Coyote Block 3 non-kinetic. Essentially, it flies out and performs a non-kinetic effect to disable a UAS, and then moves on to disable the next. We’ve done some recent testing, and it shows a strong capability against threatening drone swarms. Staying with Patriot and NASAMS, you probably didn’t imagine pre-Ukraine that they would play such an important role in air and missile defense? The two systems have been incredibly successful. While I can't give you the actual number, there have been hundreds of successful intercepts, which has saved countless lives. The Ukrainian air defenders I’ve talked to say that NASAMS and Patriot are really the backbone of their air defense architecture. There’s such amazing capability between the two systems. How is Patriot evolving to meet these threats, including eventual integration with LTAMDS? LTAMDS provides 360-degree coverage, whereas the Patriot is a sectored radar. LTAMDS provides about two and a half times the range and altitude than you have today for Patriot. We've produced six urgent material release prototypes for the Army that are going through a wide range of testing. The most recent being just a month ago, which was a flight test against a sophisticated ballistic missile surrogate. That's put us on a steady path to Milestone C, which is set to happen in the first quarter of next year. The LTAMDS Army radar from Raytheon provides 360-degree coverage and about two and a half times the range and altitude than today's Patriot. (Raytheon photo) Describe the missions that LTAMDS and GhostEye MR support, and how they’re able to address evolving threats. LTAMDS operates in the lower tier of air defense, which consists of a wide range of threats, both manned and unmanned aircraft, along with cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles – the most threatening of the emerging threats. GhostEye MR is a derivative of LTAMDS where we've scaled the LTAMDS radar down for NASAMS to address a wide range of air-breathing threats like cruise missiles, helicopters, aircraft, and UAS. Both the LTAMDS and GhostEye variants share common features like AESA (active electronic scanned array) technology, digital beam-forming technology, and substrate technology called GaN (Galium Nitride). When you bring all these technological innovations together, you have radars with a robust radio frequency that operates at a very wide bandwidth, which can be optimized for the integrated air and missile defense mission. Dealing with the high volume of threat objects in the air today, and being able to manage and guide the interceptors that you're launching, is what the GhostEye and LTAMDS technology has brought to the table. It has created a transformational capability for the warfighter. What’s the commonality/modularity between your Army radars like LTAMDS and the Navy’s SPY-6 radar? The GaN, AESA, and digital beam-forming capabilities that I mentioned are all from a common set of technologies that Raytheon has developed for our radars. In addition, we now have a common software product line to build software in one common source code base that’s usable on all these radars. This translates into faster fielding and more efficient support. Let’s move to counter-UAS and the combat-proven systems you have in that space, including both kinetic and non-kinetic solutions, especially for the LIDS program. As part of the LIDS program, we provide the sensor, which is the KuRFS radar. It’s a Ku-band, highly sensitive and precise radar that’s useful for a UAS mission because it can distinguish non-threatening objects like birds from small UAS. The Army discussed the program recently and said there have been about 170 successful engagements – primarily with the Coyote Block 2 kinetic interceptor, which is a low-cost missile that intercepts UAS Groups 1 through 3. The Block 3 effector has the ability to use a non-kinetic effector to go after multiple UAS. It then returns to the station, is recharged, and sent back up to continue the mission. It's essentially a reusable effector, which delivers the advantage of increased magazine depth. Then there’s our high-energy laser weapon system, HELWS, which has been integrated on Stryker vehicles as part of the U.S. Army’s DE M-SHORAD (Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense) program. Four units were deployed to CENTCOM for operational testing. The technology has performed well, and one of the things we continue to work with the Army on is the appropriate way to maintain those systems so that they can effectively operate in austere environments. Raytheon is competing for the next-generation short-range interceptor (NGSRI) to replace the Stinger missile, which Raytheon produces as the long-time prime for Stinger. Tell us about the program and what Raytheon brings to the table. The Army is looking for a next-generation MANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) to address evolving threats. I can't say too much about the program because it’s competitive, but we believe our offering will provide the Army with a transformational short-range air defense capability. We’ve been producing Stinger for decades, back to the Korean War, and with great success. This is going to be a revolutionary change in capability for a manageable, modular system that will serve the Army and Marine Corps well for decades to come. Integrated air and missile defense and C-UAS solutions are in high demand across the globe, and Patriot and NASAMS, as we’ve discussed, have a large international customer base. What’s your outlook on the international market for IAMD? Yes, there’s a widespread use of Patriot and NASAMS –19 countries for Patriot and 13 for NASAMS – and dozens that use Stinger. We service a wide range of customers for their air defense needs. Given all the conflicts going on around the world, there’s a tremendous demand for these capabilities, and one of the advantages of using a system like Patriot is that it provides the ability for coalition forces to interoperate far more easily and even go beyond interoperation. It gets them to the point of being interchangeable – where you can take one country's missiles and use them in the same air defense system, as well as sharing spare parts, soldiers, and specifics on tactics and ops for how to operate with the systems. For example, at the end of 2023, we entered into an agreement with NATO to provide Patriot PAC-2 GEM-T (Guidance Enhanced Missile) interceptors. NATO can now collectively manage the distribution of the missiles as they come off the production line, and multiple partners can essentially aggregate their demand and leverage economies of scale. With the investment from NATO, we can partner with additional suppliers in Europe and stand up a test and final assembly facility for these PAC-2 missiles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/advances-in-radar-are-key-to-countering-the-modern-drone-warfare-and-missile-threat/	2024-12-03T12:18:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Raytheon-In-Focus-lead.jpg
IAI targets US, Russian-built jets with upgraded Ehud ACMI pods	Israel Aerospace Industries' Ehud Next Generation pod on display at I/ITSEC. (Breaking Defense/Reuben Johnson) I/ITSEC 2024 — Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) used this year’s Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) to show off its newest Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod, as the company targets both Western and Russian-designed aircraft for potential markets. At present, 17 air forces are operating one or more versions of the company’s Ehud-series autonomous ACMI pods, which allow air forces to conduct air-to-air combat engagements without actually firing a missile. The ACMI pod, shaped like a missile, is loaded onto a jet, and pilots are able to engage in as-close-as-possible-to-real-world combat without the weapons being launched. The first Ehud ACMI pod was originally introduced over a decade ago, designed to go on a Raytheon infrared homing air-to-air AIM-9L Sidewinder. The company also worked with non-Russian users of the Sukhoi Su-30 and Mikoyan-29, in order to develop a version that works on any aircraft that is capable of firing the Russian-designed Vympel R-73 (AA-11), which was the mainstay infrared-homing air-to-air weapon for Russian aircraft for years. The newest version the company is showing off at I/ITSEC is the Ehud Next Generation pod, which is designed to work with fifth-generation Western jets. In essence, that gives IAI a chance to market at the three biggest military aviation user bases: older Western jets like the F-16, older Russian jets like the MiG-29, and modern Western fighters like the F-35. While ACMI pods have been around for years, IAI’s design gives extra oomph for the training customer, according to Ari Maman, head of business development for the company’s MLM modeling and simulation group and a former F-16 pilot with the Israeli Air Force. He called out three specific capabilities the company talks about when marketing their tech. 'The first is that the use of the Ehud pods creates real-time high-fidelity datalink training networks between groups of instrumented aircraft in an engagement of multiple platforms,' he said. 'Once you make a simulated launch [using the pod] it takes into account what the other targets are doing. 'Secondly, once the exercise is complete there is the ability to carry out a complete and comprehensive debriefing of the entire engagement and all other factors that are programmed into the simulation,' he continued. 'This can be done from a ground station that has recorded all of the simulated firings conducted by the pod or downloaded from the pod itself.' Like all modern weapon systems, the data is the driver, Maman emphasized: 'All of these recordings can then be used to build out a database with each successive exercise pairing up all of the elements that would be involved in an airland battle. The data can then be used to conduct an evaluation of large-scale exercises using database and incorporating all air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-based air defense firings into an integrated air data picture.' The third function that the Ehud pods are capable of is being a safety feature in those situations where there are multiple aircraft engaged in an exercise. The Ehud design 'has a unique ability to prevent midair collisions. The computerized system on board will send a signal to a pilot if it projects the aircraft flying into an unsafe situation by sending a signal to the pilot. 'There are other features that enhance safety outside of the training range. The system has an option where the pilot can be wearing a small tablet in place of the normal pilot’s clipboard attached to his thigh that gives the complete air date picture of all the aircraft participating in the exercise. This gives the pilot who is operating as the &#8216;Red' or opposing force the location of all the aircraft in his flight as well as all of those in the ‘Blue’ force.' But perhaps what makes the Ehud most unique goes back to that willingness to design a system that can work with both Western and Russian aircraft. It is not a simple task to be able to design the different connectors that the two types of aircraft utilize, have the correct programming and algorithms in order to design one model to work with a US or European MMC and another with the Russian on-board electronic infrastructure. 'IAI are the only company who has been both invited by different governments to develop these different pods in order cover all types of fighters. It is the company’s long-running strength of being able to work with both ‘worlds,’' Maman said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/iai-targets-us-russian-built-jets-with-upgraded-ehud-acmi-pods/	2024-12-03T11:17:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/IAI-ehud-Reuben-Johnson-IITSEC-scaled-e1733252568654.jpeg
Franco-German land systems firm KNDS appoints new CEO	The KNDS Enhanced Main Battle Tank (EMBT) technology demonstrator fitted with the new EMBT-ADT 140 uncrewed turret, on display at Eurosatory (Andrew White/Breaking Defense) BELFAST — The Franco-German land systems manufacturer KNDS has appointed Jean-Paul Alary as its new CEO, succeeding Frank Haun, who will step down from post later this month. Alary, who has worked in the defense industry since 1991, will formally take charge of the firm on April 1, 2025, according to a KNDS company statement. He is due to depart as France's Safran Aircraft Engines CEO at the end of December. 'With Jean-Paul Alary, KNDS could win an outstanding expert in technology and management,' said Philippe Petitcolin, KNDS Chair of the Board of Directors. 'He will further drive KNDS's innovational power and economic growth. We are pleased to welcome him to the KNDS leadership team.' Alary said, 'The defense industry is facing challenging yet opportunity-rich times. I look forward to actively shaping these developments as the CEO of KNDS. As a leading company in European land defense, KNDS plays a central role in security policy considerations and efforts.' Formed in 2015, KNDS is a joint venture between France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMV), two of Europe's largest land system manufacturers. The company makes the Leopard 2 main battle tank, Puma infantry fighting vehicle and PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer, among other vehicles. In 2023, it recorded turnover of €3.3 billion ($3.5 billion) and an order backlog of approximately €16 billion, according to company figures. Philippe Balducchi, Group Chief Financial Officer of KNDS, will take on CEO responsibilities on top of his current remit between Haun stepping down and Alary's succession commencing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/franco-german-land-systems-firm-knds-appoints-new-ceo/	2024-12-03T10:43:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/KNDS-e1718788745738.png
Army eyeing new PrSM Inc. 5 weapon to fire from autonomous launchers beyond 1000 km	The Army's PrSM weapon is seen during a test launch. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — The US Army is developing a fifth Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) that it could potentially launch from an autonomous launcher to hit targets beyond 1,000 km, according to two service leaders. At an Association of the US Army event today, the commanding general for the service’s Fires Center of Excellence Maj. Gen. Winston Brook showed a slide with a PrSM Increment 5 weapon listed as a future capability. The director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team, Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, separately explained that work on a fifth increment is in fact underway but is currently relegated to the science and technology arena. The idea, he explained, is to design a missile that can be fired from an autonomous vehicle. 'If you're familiar with an [M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System] MLRS pod, it's about 13-feet long,' the one-star general told the audience. 'If you have something without a cab, that's autonomous, you might be able to employ something longer than that.' 'We're in the science and technology phase of something that we'll maybe, eventually call Increment 5,' Crooks added. 'You might be able to employ something that's actually longer … and you might be able to achieve ranges that, right now, don't seem realistic.' While there are science and technology funds to examine this potential new weapon, Crooks said there is not yet a timeline to compete and formally develop it. Over the past several years, the Army has been developing four other PrSM rounds, broadly designed to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and be launched from both the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and the M270A2 MLRS. The service is currently in the process of fielding initial Increment 1 rounds from Lockheed Martin billed as a way to strike targets at least 500 km away. Future versions of the weapon also include an Increment 2 with a multimode seeker, known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and a PrSM Inc 3 which would seek to add in enhanced lethality payloads. The Army has also tapped a Lockheed Martin team and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team to work on competing PrSM Inc 4 designs that can fly more than 1,000 km, possibly double the range of the current version.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-eyeing-new-prsm-inc-5-weapon-to-fire-from-autonomous-launchers-beyond-1000-km/	2024-12-03T09:36:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/PrSM-2-scaled.jpg
Half of Navy’s amphibious fleet in ‘poor condition,’ some ships out for years, GAO warns	A joint light tactical vehicle attached to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is transferred from dock landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) to Landing Craft Utility 1661 during vehicle and equipment loading operations in the Arabian Gulf, July 16, 2021. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by 1st Lt. Mark Andries) 'Amphibious warfare ships are critical for Marine Corps missions, but the Navy has struggled to ensure they are available for operations and training,' reads a new report from the Government Accountability Report, published today. The Navy is required by law to maintain a fleet of at least 31 amphibious vessels; it currently counts 32. But the report found that as of March this year, nine of the Navy's 10 dock landing ships were in 'poor material condition,' as were five of the seven amphibious assault ships and two of the 13 amphibious transport docks. The Navy's two amphibious assault ships were both in 'satisfactory material condition.' GAO's rating of the Navy's 32 amphibious vessels as of March 2024. (GAO) The report notes several factors that contributed to the problem, including 'challenges with spare parts.' But a summary of the report also noted that in order to 'save money, the Navy proposed early retirement for some ships and cancelled critical maintenance on them. But the Navy is still relying on these ships — which haven't been well-maintained — while it waits for new ones to be built. As a result, it will be hard to continue meeting the 31-ship requirement.' Amphib readiness has been a topic of much discussion, as service leaders and lawmakers have scuffled over just how many of the ships the Marine Corps really needs, and how relevant they are to modern combat operations. OP ED: To cool the war over amphibs, the Navy and Marines need a clearer justification By this summer the Navy and Marine Corps leadership had 'locked shields' in defense of the fleet, and in July the heads of both organizations announced they had jointly signed off on new guidelines that were meant to 'ensure consistency and uniformity in Navy and Marine Corps amphibious force planning, assessment, and operational mission execution.' (The GAO report also pinged the services for disagreeing with each other 'on the number of ships that should be available at any given time to conduct operations and training.') As for the GAO report, in the end the oversight body makes four recommendations, three of which dealt with still better defining readiness terminology as well as establishing clear timelines and performance goals related to assessing and improving readiness. The Navy concurred with all of those. RELATED: Short on amphibs for Turkey and Sudan, the Marines grapple with crisis response ethos The Navy partially concurred with the GAO recommendation that the Navy update its amphibious ship depot maintenance policy 'to clarify that, absent operational needs, the Navy should not cancel depot maintenance for amphibious ships proposed for divestment that have yet to reach the end of their expected service life.' In that case, the Navy said it's currently 'prohibited by law' from modifying vessels destined for the boneyard, and waivers to do so have a narrow timeline. 'However, the statute permits normal Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&amp;E) work within the five-year window prior to a ship being removed from service. The Navy will schedule this work, including depot-level repair as necessary, to maintain the ship in operational condition.' It also noted the Navy Secretary may grant waivers for that statute in the 'national security interests' of the US.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/half-of-navys-amphibious-fleet-in-poor-condition-some-ships-out-for-years-gao-warns/	2024-12-03T09:11:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/6755223-scaled-e1679336812778.jpg
‘It’s not a war zone’: Pentagon ponders policy shifts to protect homeland bases from drones	Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command hosted distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak on Fort Carson, Colorado, Oct. 30, 2024. (U.S. Department of Defense photo by Josh Armstrong) FORT CARSON, Colo. — When industry representatives gathered with military officials in the Colorado mountains to test different counter-drone tactics, another enemy lurked in the background, threatening to hamstring efforts to take on the increasing threat of small drones: red tape. In some ways, officials said during the Falcon Peak event, the focus needs to be on figuring out the complex rules and regulations governing domestic airspace, which largely limit options military commanders have to respond to small unmanned aircraft systems, or sUAS. 'The threat, and the need to counter these threats, is growing faster than the policies and procedures that [are] in place can keep up with,' US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) chief Gen. Gregory Guillot told reporters during a visit to the exercises last month. Working in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NORTHCOM used Falcon Peak as an opportunity to get smart not only on the nets, streamers and cyberattacks meant to defeat sUAS, but on the regulatory side as well. Guillot, for instance, envisions his command acting as a homeland 'synchronizer' to coordinate interagency efforts and distribute defensive capabilities to installations. 'One of the key things about Falcon Peak is it offers not just the opportunity to look at the technology that's being tested, but also at our processes,' a senior DoD official who attended the demo said in a roundtable with reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 'A lot of the tasks we have in the homeland, it's a very sophisticated environment in that it's complicated from a regulatory perspective. It's a very civilianized environment. It's not a war zone,' they added. The DoD already has authority to conduct anti-drone missions on US soil, but the law 'restricts our ability to use counter-UAS to certain types of covered rules and missions, covered assets' like nuclear or special operations, the official explained. The statute also requires coordination with the Department of Transportation, mainly through the FAA. To help address the sUAS problem, the official said the Pentagon has pushed a legislative proposal that would help clarify what facilities are covered under the federal statute that allows DoD to enforce perimeter security. The Pentagon is also seeking changes that would improve interagency counter-UAS coordination, they added. The official stressed that if needed, the US government writ large has authorities to defend military bases domestically. But the challenge is in ensuring 'authorities knit together at the seams so that the whole homeland is protected.' Any policy changes likely would not be a one-off either, as the official noted drones themselves will change along with the technologies necessary to defeat them. New tech would then need to be coordinated with other domestic agencies to ensure any impacts are fully understood. 'As our counter-UAS abilities grow and change, we have a responsibility to make not just the FAA, but any civilian agency that we think could be adversely affected by the system that we're fielding aware [of it] and talk to them about how this could affect them,' the official said. Heeding domestic protections, traditional tools like guns and missiles were shunned at Falcon Peak in favor of low- and non-kinetic options, such as nets and signal interference. Those tactics appeared to successfully demonstrate a non-intrusive, low-collateral way to bring down an sUAS, but the senior defense official noted that even with seemingly non-threatening techniques like net capture, some kind of wider coordination would be required before it could be approved beyond ad hoc cases. 'And so there is a process, I think, that we need to continue to refine that will determine how we get those approvals and whether that approval can be a blanket approval,' the official said. Other options like jamming radio frequency links and denying navigation systems required extremely tight coordination with the FAA, as any spillover interference that affected civilian navigation systems could spell danger. 'That is probably one of the biggest hurdles that we have in the counter-UAS space,' Jason Mayes, counter-small unmanned aerial systems deputy test director for NORTHCOM told reporters regarding tools like signal interference. 'It is a very, very difficult capability to get permission to utilize.' NORTHCOM planners had a total of 90 days to plan and execute the Falcon Peak event, Mayes said, requiring a compressed process with the FAA to get the right approvals for the technology. The bureaucracy moved more quickly once the need to use signal interference tech was established as a one-off, 'but I think in real time, we would probably be able to do it very quickly,' Mayes said, pointing to Guillot’s envisioned role of NORTHCOM serving as a domestic synchronizer. 'There’s some areas where we’ve got one policy saying one [thing] and another policy saying another. And the parts where they cross over get a little blurry, you know, and just confusing,' Mayes. 'So I think we need to solidify all of that.' Working with the FAA could one day yield the possibility of approving 'kinetic-type' weapons, said another official, though such an agreement might not be reached in the near-term. 'The FAA and other authorities are looking at this capability and understanding the safety mechanisms that we're implementing into these systems. For example, directed energy: We're implementing things into the directed energy system where it has significant safety avoidance,' Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, commander of the Army’s Space and Missile Defense command and former director of the Pentagon office tasked with countering small drones, told reporters. 'We can mitigate a lot of the challenges of using kinetic-type of capabilities. So I think, over time, working closely as an enterprise … [and trying] to find out what are the best ways from a reduced risk mitigation, can we get there with some of these kinetic effectors, and what are the right kinetic effectors we actually want to employ,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/its-not-a-war-zone-pentagon-ponders-policy-shifts-to-protect-homeland-bases-from-drones/	2024-12-03T04:31:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Guillot-falcon-peak-scaled-e1733170045719.jpg
Global defense revenues grew in 2023 amid Ukraine, Middle East conflicts: SIPRI report	The 'separate' Russian pavilion at IDEX 2023 is actually situated on the NAVDEX grounds. (Lee Ferran / Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The world’s largest 100 defense contractors amassed $632 billion in combined revenue in 2023, a real-term annual growth of more than 4 percent that comes as conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to propel weapons demand, according to a new Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report released today. The latest figures show that revenues have 'bounced back after a dip in 2022,' as companies push to increase production capacity to meet a demand signal that shows no sign of subsiding in the near term, the report stated. 'There was a marked rise in arms revenues in 2023, and this is likely to continue in 2024,' said Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher with SIPRI’s military expenditure program. 'The arms revenues of the Top 100 arms producers still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales.' While US-based companies made up 41 companies in the top 100 — and half the total revenue recorded — Russian defense firms boasted the largest increase in revenues in 2023 by percentage, growing by 40 percent compared to 2022. The report attributed that gain to an intensified campaign by Russia’s Rostec defense conglomerate and United Shipbuilding Corporation to surge production capability for key weapon systems like missiles, aircraft and drones needed to replace equipment lost fighting against Ukraine. According to the report, 'this expansion was facilitated by several strategic adjustments, including increased state orders backed by a larger military budget, new administrative structures to manage production and ensure implementation of orders, and multi-shift working conditions at many arms manufacturing facilities.' Overall, US defense companies saw revenue go up 2.5 percent in 2023. But despite a growth in orders, the two largest contractors, Lockheed Martin and RTX, recorded a slight drop in real-term revenue due to continued supply chain constraints for specialized components and subsystems like solid rocket motors, which has caused headwinds for the companies’ plans to expand production on key aerospace and missile defense programs. RTX saw defense revenues fall by about 1.3 percent to $40.7 billion in 2023, while Lockheed’s revenues dipped by 1.6 percent to $60.8 billion, according to SIPRI. Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman, which SIPRI counts as the third largest defense contractor, registered a 5.8 percent increase to revenue on the back of increased sales of ammunition in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as more than 9 percent growth in its space unit. RELATED: Lockheed on &#8216;campaign-like' hunt for new solid rocket motor supplier While Russian defense contractors recorded a surge to their bottom lines, Chinese companies saw their year-over-year revenue growth stagnate, with a 0.7 percent increase that was its lowest rate since 2019, the report said. The slowdown of Chinese industrial growth was met by a huge increase of defense revenues by Japanese and South Korean companies, as two of the largest US allies in the region strive to increase the capacity and technological know-how of their respective defense industries. South Korea saw an increase of 39 percent to $11 billion in 2023, with Hanwha, the country’s largest defense contractor, recording an increase of 53 percent in defense revenue after finalizing the acquisition of the shipbuilder DSME and increasing exports of armored vehicles and artillery due to contracts with Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Japanese defense contractor revenues expanded by 35 percent to $10 billion in 2023, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries leading the way with a 24 percent increase and Kawasaki Heavy Industries netting 16 percent growth on defense. RELATED: Japan looks to revamp defense industry after years of downsizing After Russia, the Middle East was the region with the largest levels of revenue growth that year, with six Israeli and Turkish companies in the top 100 increasing a combined 18 percent to reach $19.6 billion. Notably, Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael netted increases of 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile Turkish Aerospace Industries reported 45 percent revenue growth, the largest for a Turkish company. Among the 27 European defense companies on the list, revenue was largely flat in 2023. The biggest gains were boasted by JSC Ukrainian Defense Industry, the Ukrainian conglomerate formerly known as Ukroboronprom, which saw arms revenues increase by 69 percent to $2.2 billion as it increased production of weapons needed for Ukraine’s military. The four German defense companies included in the top 100 recorded a 7.5 percent increase in revenue, while all seven UK-based defense companies also recorded revenue growth. However, SIPRI reported that combined revenues of five French companies went down by 8.5 percent, led by a 41 percent defense revenue decrease by Dassault Aviation Group as sales of its Rafale fighter decreased. Italy, which had Leonardo and Fincantieri in the top 100, saw defense revenue fall 10 percent between the two companies due to a decrease in aircraft sales by Leonardo and the conclusion of an export deal between Qatar and Fincantieri.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/global-defense-revenues-grew-in-2023-amid-ukraine-middle-east-conflicts-sipri-report/	2024-12-02T13:21:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/230223_IDEX_russia_pavilion_Ferran.png
Japan OKs potential sale of Mogami frigate to Australia, in first of its kind move	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches the fourth Mogami-class frigate, Mikuma. (Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force) SYDNEY — Japan has taken an important step forward in its burgeoning efforts to sell a major weapon system to another country, with its National Security Council formally approving the sale of Mogami-class warships to Australia for its General Purpose Frigate program. The Foreign Ministry released a statement Nov. 28 detailing the decision, noting how important is Japan's relationship with Australia. Japan has never sold a modern major weapon system to another country. 'As stated in the National Defense Strategy, Australia will establish a close cooperation relationship second only to Japan-US defense cooperation as a &#8216;special strategic partner' in the Indo-Pacific region,' the statement says. 'Based on such a policy, the joint development and production of this case will contribute to a significant improvement in interoperability and compatibility with Australia, as well as strengthening the shipbuilding and maintenance infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region and improving the capacity of our ships in the future, and is of great significance to the country's security.' The Mogami, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), is currently in service in the Maritime Self Defense Force. For the $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) competition, MHI is up against ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (KTMS), builder of Australia's current Anzac-class frigates, who is offering the Meko A-200, an upgraded version of the 30-year-old Anzacs. Michael Shoebridge, founder of Strategic Analysis Australia, told Breaking Defense in an email that should Australia decide to buy the Mogami-class instead of a German ship, 'It would fundamentally increase [Japan and Australia's] militaries' ability to operate together and strengthen the defense industrial bases of both nations.' 'Japan has an excellent chance of success in this program, particularly if the broader technological partnership it will enable is understood clearly at government level in both nations,' wrote Shoebridge, well-known as an acquisition expert here. The Germans do not have any formal defense ties with Canberra, while Japan has been strengthening its military ties to Australia through moves such as the Reciprocal Access Arrangement and new troop rotations announced just last month. 'The Australian navy's ageing ANZAC frigates are a German design, but that construction project is decades old, so any incumbency benefits have shrunk,' Shoebridge said. 'German companies are well-practiced at overseas defense sales, however, so if Australia runs the selection like a normal commercial activity, then Japan will be disadvantaged. It's important [Canberra] see this as a joint government and industry program.' Should Japan win the final selection, expected to occur by the middle of next year, 'it would catapult Japan into an AUKUS Pillar Two-like partnership on advanced military technology with Australia and open doors to broader cooperation in this Pillar Two area, where Japan has obvious strengths,' Shoebridge said. 'The fact that the Japanese Government and MHI are offering to build Mogami class frigates for and with Australia is a remarkable statement about the strategic and technological partnership they see as possible between our two countries, particularly after the setback from the submarine decision a decade ago. Australia should understand Japan's serious and positive purpose in making this offer at this time.' One interesting tidbit in the announcement is that Japan will, as America does, retain veto power over the transfer of the weapon to a third party — another sign it is serious about becoming more of a defense export player on the global market.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/japan-oks-potential-sale-of-mogami-frigate-to-australia-in-first-of-its-kind-move/	2024-12-02T12:13:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
EXCLUSIVE: 2 key senators urge Navy to change course on large USV program	The USV Mariner, a US Navy research and development vessel, is docked at the United States Naval Academy where it will be christened on Aug. 23, 2022. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The top two senators overseeing the Pentagon are urging the Navy’s leadership to rethink its plans for the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) over concerns the vessel’s size and complexity will rival that of a manned frigate, according to a letter obtained by Breaking Defense. The senators also say the Navy should work with lawmakers to 'repurpose LUSV funds' to support certain activities for the Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel program. The LUSV is one of the Navy’s exquisite, unmanned surface vehicle programs focused on anti-surface warfare and strike warfare missions. Its requirements include being able to employ up to 32 Mk-41 Vertical Launch Cells, which is evidently driving up anxiety on Capitol Hill. 'This requirement drives the LUSV size and complexity, potentially rivaling a frigate’s displacement at 4,000 tons,' according to a Nov. 14 letter signed by Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I. and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who also lead the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'Under current plans, the LUSV will be late to need and incur excessive concurrency, but the Navy will also have a shortfall in Mk-41 compatible missiles even to outfit all LUSVs.' By contrast, the MUSV, which is envisioned to carry a variety of unique payloads, is envisioned to be under 500 tons displacement and no longer than 200 feet in length. The LUSV has been a high-profile research and development program for the Navy since 2019 when it unveiled a bevy of new efforts around unmanned maritime technologies. But between congressional skepticism and other budget priorities, the vessel's original schedule to become a program of record was delayed from 2025 to 2027 — and the senators' letter says even the 2027 timeline may be in danger given the other challenges facing the program. The letter is addressed to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti and Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro. 'We still believe in the need for the high-low mix of vessels in the Navy’s fleet design and commend Admiral Franchetti’s focus on robotic vessels in NAVPLAN 2024,' the letter states. 'Part of the low-end of the mix is the set of autonomous and attritable capabilities being accelerated to meet INDOPACOM needs. These massed effects, however, do not solve the range of needs desired by the combatant commanders.' Reed and Wicker urge the Navy to 'repurpose' LUSV’s funding to support 'MUSV, procuring additional vessels in FY 2025 and FY 2026 to host already procured payloads, and creating a path to achieve a program of record in FY 2027 for the MUSV.' The letter is the latest bump in the road for the US Navy’s efforts to develop what it calls a future hybrid fleet, featuring both manned and unmanned warships. Programmatically, lawmakers have been skeptical of LUSV since its inception and have pressed Navy officials to explain with clarity how unmanned vessels fit into the service’s broader concepts of operation. MUSV, as evidenced in Reed and Wicker’s letter, has received a slightly better audience on Capitol Hill following successful operations in the Indo-Pacific using vessels often referred to as the 'Ghost Fleet.' 'The Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel should fill important gaps with mature technologies, validated mission needs, and producibility to deliver on expedited timelines' the senators wrote. 'In all, more than 267,000 total miles have been steamed with 70 percent in autonomous mode, proving out reliability of the hull, mechanical and electrical equipment as well as demonstrating the ability to carry several mission payloads.' Long-term changes the Navy makes to either program will likely not be seen by the public until next year when it is expected to unveil its FY26 budget request.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/exclusive-top-2-senators-urge-navy-to-change-course-on-large-usv-program/	2024-12-02T11:28:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Mariner-Side-View-scaled-e1661283313758.jpg
Why adding the Osprey to the Atlantic Naval Air Force matters	A CMV-22B Osprey, assigned to the 'Mighty Bison' of Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron (VRM) 40, approaches the flight deck of the world's largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), Sept. 19, 2024. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Maxwell Orlosky) This is the latest in a series of regular columns by Robbin Laird, where he will tackle current defense issues through the lens of more than 45 years of defense expertise in both the US and abroad. The goal of these columns: to look back at how questions and perspectives of the past should inform decisions being made today. Last month, I had the chance to visit Norfolk Naval Station to meet with Rear Adm. Doug 'V8' Verissimo and discuss with him how the first squadron of CMV-22Bs stationed at Norfolk plays into the evolution of Atlantic fleet, which now includes the Ford carrier. Both the CMV-22B and the USS Gerald R. Ford bring new capabilities to naval operations in the Atlantic region, which means a new challenge for Verissimo’s Naval Air Force Atlantic, the aviation Type Commander for the United States Naval aviation units operating primarily in the Atlantic under United States Fleet Forces Command. AIRLANT is responsible for the material readiness, administration, training, and inspection of units/squadrons under their command, and for providing operationally ready air squadrons and aircraft carriers to the fleet. At the time of our discussion, six CMV-22Bs had arrived; the expectation, dependent on final funding, is for 12-15 Ospreys for the squadron to be stationed as part of AIRLANT. One top-level takeaway is how the CMV-22B provides significant help with the challenge of contested logistics — a challenge that is only going to get worse with the Navy focused on distributed operations. Being able to hop from carrier to carrier will be key for the Navy under this concept. Take weapons transport, for example. The admiral underscored that 'the future will likely bring smaller, more agile weapons to complement the heavier more difficult weapons to transport like TLAMs.' He then argued that this shift to a different weapons stockpile would augment the utility of the CMV-22B supporting weapons re-supply in a contested combat environment. But Verissimo also noted that the CMV-22B is also going to be a vital capability for his command in an area that is logistics-related: a medical emergency. He put it this way: 'If I have a medical emergency, I'm not trapping and catapulting the human body that's already injured. I can softly land and softly take off so I can take care of my people in a medical emergency.' There are specific benefits when the CMV-22B is combined with the Ford. The island on the Ford has been moved towards the end of the deck, freeing up space to which an Osprey can move when it lands for offloading of weapons or supplies, so it doesn’t block the EMALS catapults — meaning a resupply can happen even as combat aircraft are being deployed. And there is a fuel capability in that area which can refuel the Osprey for its departure from the deck as well. Throughout much of our discussion, the admiral emphasized the evolution of the carrier for the new strategic situation and the flexibility it brings to the fight. The assets assigned to the Ford carrier will change as future payloads and platforms emerge. Verissimo also underscored the unique features of the Ford design, notably the significant enhanced power generation capabilities which enable the ability to use future payloads, weapons and platforms which leverage that enhanced electrical power generation capacity. He argued: 'The carrier and the carrier strike group are one of the only integrated forces which brings the core seven joint warfighting functions to the fight wherever it is operating. And with the Ford class, and its ability to generate electric power, it enhances those capabilities as well.' Prior to my meeting with the admiral, I met with Commander Mason Fox and his team. Fox is the Commander of Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron (VRM) 40, the 'Mighty Bison,' and I learned a quite interesting aspect of the challenge of standing up the first operational CMV-22B squadron on the East Coast. As they were getting ready to go from North Island (San Diego) to Norfolk on Dec. 6, 2023 with their first Ospreys, the DoD grounded the Osprey fleet DoD wide. Obviously, this was a shock but one which the squadron and its support community found a way to respond. According to Fox, the squadron had received their flight simulators so the pilots could train in the absence of flying real airplanes while waiting for the grounding to be lifted. And he indicated that the maintainers worked with prime manufacturer Bell in Fort Worth on training the maintainers. This meant that when the grounding was lifted in March 2024, the squadron was ready to re-commence their stand-up effort and the first squadron planes arrived the next month. 'We want to integrate as tightly as we can with the carriers and the air wings on the East Coast so that they fully understand our capabilities,' Fox added. They work with the Commander Air Group or CAG when onboard the carrier. What they have been focused on since the squadron has been activated is working with the carrier community on the logistics operations for East Coast based carriers, the Truman and the Ford. They worked with the Truman in June 2024 and the Ford in September 2024. They are planning to next continue their training with the Bush in the future. Fox concluded: 'Our version of the Osprey has a little bit more gas that we can carry, and we have a primary mission that is different than the Marine Corps and Air Force Ospreys. But I think that if we’re looking at a joint fight, we’re looking at the 450 plus Ospreys that are part of the program record. They will all be contributing to distributed maritime ops, because that’s the fight we are in.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/why-adding-the-osprey-to-the-atlantic-naval-air-force-matters/	2024-12-02T08:32:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8655887-scaled-e1732543950283.jpg
Rheinmetall closes Loc Performance acquisition, as it eyes US-market expansion	A conceptual design of Rheinmetall's Lynx XM30 for the US Army competition. (Rheinmetall artwork) WASHINGTON — Rheinmetall has officially acquired Michigan-based Loc Performance for just under $1 billion, a move company leaders say is central to plans for US footprint expansion. 'The purpose of the acquisition is to strengthen Rheinmetall's position in the US market, and we do that in many ways,' Matthew Warnick, American Rheinmetall Vehicles managing director, told Breaking Defense ahead of the closing. 'First and foremost, we pick up almost two million square feet of manufacturing space, but more importantly than that, is the… approximately 1,000 employees that we get to add to our bench that are used to manufacturing components and parts, all the way up to combat vehicles,' he added. With the $950 million purchase of Loc now closed, Rheinmetall plans to keep those 1,000 employees on staff and add additional jobs. Loc’s Chief Executive Officer Jason Atkinson noted that prior to the close, Loc already had about $3.6 billion worth of backlog work, including vehicle drivelines, suspensions, track systems, rubber products, armor products and fabricated structures. At the same time, the German-based Rheinmetall has sought to carve out a larger share of the US market is vying to win Army competitions like the coveted Bradley replacement program dubbed the XM30, the Common Tactical Truck, the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) Increment II and a revamped self-propelled howitzer initiative. For 2025, Warnick projects the new pairing will bring in close to $850 million in revenue and, depending on where things stand with new wins, that figure could hit 'north of' $1 billion by 2027. '[That target] is a mix of the existing backlog that we now create the opportunity for export coming out of Loc facilities, given the robust international footprint of Rheinmetall… and being able to provide material content into those programs, be it in the United Kingdom, be it in Australia, be it in Germany, but also winning new contracts as we go forward,' he added. Depending on just how much growth there is within the US market, Warnick said, will determine if the company can move ahead with plans to enlarge its production footprint and, potentially, build out a military vehicle center of excellence inside the United States.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rheinmetall-closes-loc-performance-acquisition-as-it-eyes-us-market-expansion/	2024-12-02T04:54:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/SHOT21a_v17Mud-scaled-e1684523151385.jpg
How BAE plans to keep its Eurofighter Typhoon UK final assembly line alive for GCAP	A UK Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon conducts a NATO air policing mission (UK MoD) BELFAST — When the emir of Qatar visits the UK this week, his trip will be watched closely in the city of Preston, located some 250 miles northwest of London. That’s because Preston is home to the Warton facility of BAE Systems, where final assembly of the Eurofighter Typhoon occurs. And the hope is that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani might use his trip to announce a new order of the fourth-generation jets, a Gulf lifeline that could help save the line from cooling for good. The Wharton facility is scheduled to produce two final Typhoon airframes by the end of 2025, the last from a previous order from Qatar for 24 jets. But after that, the future of the UK-made Typhoon is unclear. A spokesperson for BAE Systems was adamant that the British defense giant has no plans to shutter the Wharton facility, saying ''There is absolutely no suggestion of this' and pointing to potential international orders. Analysts and BAE executives say Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are all viable options for future orders. But those 'what ifs' appear to be little comfort to Steve McGuinness, a key union figure who kicked off something of a firestorm in England with a letter to lawmakers imploring the British government to invest in the Warton line — not just for the Typhoon program's own future, but for the future of British advanced fighter production. 'We have serious concerns that without a domestic order for Typhoon there will be no GCAP [Global Combat Air Programme] due to the loss of the skills necessary to build and fly aircraft,' wrote McGuinness, an aerospace and defense executive council member at the Unite trade union. BAE can keep at least some work at the line going with research and development efforts for future projects, and may redeploy staff currently working at the Warton plant across other parts of the Typhoon business and separate air combat projects run by the company. But in the end, the best way to keep the Typhoon line up and running, and its workforce employed in the lead up to GCAP, is to sell more Typhoons. And the jet is flying against significant headwinds. 'The world is moving to new generations,' said JJ Gertler, senior analyst at the Teal Group. 'The market for Typhoon in recent years has been for countries acquiring them more for diplomatic purposes than performance criteria.' Following the letter from McGuiness, the Spectator publication, a British conservative leaning publication, ran a piece entitled 'The sad death of the Eurofighter Typhoon.' It turned the letter into headline news. 'I think if you were the leadership of BAE Systems you probably wouldn't have looked favorably on that report coming out from the Unions,' Gary Waterfall, a former UK Royal Air Force air vice-marshal, told Breaking Defense. 'It's a bit prejudging,' on production prospects. 'There remains great interest in Typhoon and we are currently pursuing a number of orders in the Middle East and Europe, in addition to further orders from our European Eurofighter partners – as well publicised in recent press reporting,' the BAE response adds. 'Further orders will extend production beyond the latter part of this decade.' Options for further sales are limited, according to analysts, as the world is largely turning towards more advanced systems than the '4.5 generation' Typhoon. 'A higher degree of stealth has become the cost of entry into almost any fighter market, and you see systems like F-35 supplanting high-end fighters in many cases,' said Gertler. 'For some of the missions remaining to Typhoon, like air policing, less complicated and expensive systems can do the same job at a lower acquisition and operating cost.' The Typhoon is produced by four partner European nations: the UK (BAE), Germany (Airbus), Italy (Leonardo) and Spain (Airbus). Each has its own final assembly line, which puts the last touches on planes destined for their own militaries or for international customers. Whichever manufacturer is the lead campaigner for an export sale is generally awarded final assembly rights; The UK is the lead Eurofighter export nation for campaigns related to Qatar, Turkey, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The failure of the UK to commit to a new order of 24 Eurofighter Typhoons is chief among issues raised by McGuiness, alongside reports that London will replace older Eurofighter Typhoon Tranche 1 jets (due to be phased out in 2025) with additional orders of the Lockheed Martin F-35. London last procured the Typhoon in 2009, as part of a joint contract for 112 aircraft, alongside the Eurofighter partner nations. Under the Defence Command Paper of 2021, London cited a need to dispose of of aircraft with 'limited utility in the digital and future operating environment' [PDF] as motivation for axing the Tranche 1 jets. The letter from McGuiness warned against such the F-35 acquisition decision, defining it as 'a hammer blow to the British aircraft industry and potentially could end the design, manufacture and assembly of fast jets in this country, seriously damaging our sovereign capability.' A Royal Saudi Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon arrives at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, England, ahead of Exercise Cobra Warrior (UK Royal Air Force) Despite a lack of domestic interest in more Typhoons and the F-35’s clean sweep of global competitions against Eurofighter in recent years, analysts said that BAE is not wrong in having reason for optimism, thanks to potential sales to the Middle East. Turkey has said it wants to acquire 40 Eurofighters. Recently Germany, which had been against the deal, offered a 'positive response,' to reaching an agreement, according to Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler. In January, Germany also lifted a block on selling to the Saudis, opening the way for a long-delayed second tranche aircraft order (adding to 72 in operation) to take shape. A firm agreement has still to be reached, but could be on the agenda when UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits the country next month as part of a Middle East trip that will also include travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 'The Turkey campaign is quite active, and the highest priority,' said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy firm. 'There’s a good chance it comes through. The same is true for the second Saudi tranche. But Britain is lucky in that its [Typhoon] production line is the most likely to survive the end of the decade,' of all four partner nation final assemblies. Similarly, it is 'not inconceivable' that across the partner nations, Typhoon production could stretch 'out to the early to mid' 2030s 'given some of the export campaigns that are ongoing,' added Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. Additionally, the UK has also invested £2.4 billion ($3 billion) in a capability development package for Typhoon, under which BAE has been contracted to deliver an advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar &#8211; European Common Radar System (ECRS) Mk 2. 'These upgrades are also designed to support technology and skills development in readiness for Tempest/GCAP, the next generation combat aircraft,' added the BAE Systems spokesperson. 'Under current plans, Typhoon will remain in service with the RAF until at least 2040 and we are committed to ensuring that this vital capability remains at the cutting-edge of UK and NATO combat air power until its retirement,' said a UK MoD spokesperson. 'Multi decade programmes like the one made at Warton exemplify the UK’s enduring commitment to supporting global defence and security and underpin development of deeper strategic international alliances for the UK,' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, a UK aerospace and defense trade body, wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. 'Our supply chains are resilient, but they are also suffering at the hands of a mixed signal from UK government.' A Global Combat Air Programme(GCAP) core vehicle concept on display at DSEI, London (Breaking Defense) The other reason for optimism at Warton is the importance of GCAP, not just for BAE but for the United Kingdom as a geopolitical calling card. The next-gen program is tied up with Italy and Japan, and, should its Franco-German-Spanish FCAS/SCAF rival fall behind, it could emerge as the non-F-35 jet of choice for the Western world. Because of GCAP’s importance, there will likely be some production that goes on at Warton even if the Eurofighter falls off. 'When it comes to a bridge between generations, design work is generally more important than production work. This is why the issue of Eurofighter upgrades is [of] equal or greater importance than the survival of the production line,' Aboulafia said. 'Will there have to be some kind of bridge to GCAP? That looks likely. But particularly with the current defense austerity posture in the UK, that bridge does not look very much like a Eurofighter,' Gertler added. Barrie suggested that Typhoon experimentation with Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP’s), UK terminology for Collaborative Combat Aircraft, could be developed near term. 'There's obviously ambition to bring ACPs in, in advance of GCAP by quite some time, arguably, by about a decade, really. So you can say there's going to have to be some tech and R&amp;D around integrating … ACP capabilities with Typhoon,' he said. The RAF is on course to receive a first 'operationally useful' ACP 'before the end of the financial year,' said Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, RAF Chief of the Air Staff, earlier this month. The UK has not said which ACP it has selected specifically, but it will be a Tier 1 or disposable type. London also expects to operate a 'suite' of ACPs by 2030, according to its ACP strategy. 'The sooner you can develop that capability and produce it, the better,' in terms of generating combat mass, Barrie said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/how-bae-plans-to-keep-its-eurofighter-typhoon-uk-final-assembly-line-alive-for-gcap/	2024-12-02T01:29:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Eurofighter-Typhoon-e1732642769504.jpg
Swedish Gripen jets don’t ‘make sense’ for Ukraine yet, Dutch defense chief says	Three Swedish Armed Forces Gripens participated in a long range, long duration Bomber Task Force mission over Sweden, May 20, 2020. (Courtesy photo by the Swedish Armed Forces) ATLANTA — While Sweden stands ready to send its Gripen fighters to Ukraine, the head of a key ally's military said that move 'doesn't make sense for me,' at least not yet. 'In the long term, yes, [but] I think we have to avoid [giving] too many systems to Ukraine, because they have a shortage of pilots,' Chief of Defence of the Netherlands Gen. Onno Eichelsheim told Breaking Defense. 'So you have to avoid that you have more systems than pilots. Somewhere in the balance, you have to look at what capabilities are needed at this moment.' In July the Netherlands, Denmark and the US announced they were in the process of donating F-16s from Dutch and Danish stocks to Ukraine. The US has flatly rejected calls to give current American systems, but agreed to allow other nations to provide their US-made jets. Eichelsheim said it's better to 'focus' on the capabilities the Ukrainians currently have. 'So get them ready on these aircrafts, and provide them with the weapons, the money, the logistics, the parts that are available around the world to get these aircraft up and running continuously.' The Dutch official's comments clarify remarks from Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson, who said last week that Stockholm was ready and willing to donate Gripens to Ukraine but had been advised not to. 'The donation of the Gripens is not in the hands of ourselves,' Jonson said, suggesting at the time that other actors in the international coalition dedicated to Ukraine's air force, predominantly Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States, wanted to make sure Ukraine is settled with the F-16 before introducing other complex technologies into the ecosystem. 'They have advised us to wait to donate the Gripen until it goes further with the F-16 as well,' Jonson said. Deliveries of the fourth-generation aircraft, dating back to July, represent a major potential uplift in capability for Ukraine, which has been largely relying on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion, though officials and experts have said it won’t be a silver bullet. Eichelsheim said Kyiv's armed forces have been 'successful in using the aircraft, and they are actually quite successful in maintaining them at this moment.' 'But we also see that they use a lot of spare parts, so we have to work on the spare parts element together with the nations to provide them with the right amount to keep the aircrafts up and running,' he said. Earlier this month Reuters reported the White House had lifted a de facto ban on American contractors working in Ukraine in a move that could give a boost to the complex maintenance of the F-16. In the meantime, Eichelsheim said Ukrainian pilots 'do quite well' with the F-16, 'perhaps even better than we anticipated. 'They learn very fast how to operate the aircraft and how to operate the new weapon systems that they are getting on the aircraft,' he added. 'So, and that's all I can say, actually, about it.' Tim Martin contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/swedish-fighters-dont-make-sense-for-ukraine-yet-dutch-defense-chief-says/	2024-11-27T11:31:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241127_DVIDS_gripens_fly_6216613-e1732712867452.jpg
US drone maker Shield AI moves into Indian defense market, joint venture with JSW Group	A civilian contractor embarked with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, lands a V-BAT drone aboard the USS Green Bay in the Philippine Sea, Feb. 2, 2023. (U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Andrew King) SYDNEY — The Indian defense market, not known for its historic openness to foreign investment, has gotten an injection of very fresh US defense technology from the AI and drone company, Shield AI. The pan-industrial Indian company, JSW Group, has formed a joint venture with the US firm and JSW plans to invest roughly $90 million in the next two years to build a plant, secure the intellectual property and train workers. The goal is to build V-BAT, Shield's vertical takeoff and landing drone, in India, as well as provide its support and maintenance. A press release from Shield AI notes that JSW's 'investment will enable JSW to establish a local supply chain and create an advanced facility in India for manufacturing, assembling and testing V-BAT aircraft.' The US Marines own and operate V-BAT. This deal appears to be in keeping with a larger Indian effort known as Atmanirbharta designed to encourage foreign companies to work in India, instead of the foreign companies designing, building and assembling weapons to be exported to India. That effort includes an investment fund to attract disrupters and smaller companies, the webpage of which has a link to the drone deal. 'Once reliant on foreign suppliers, India now places a high priority on self-reliant manufacturing to meet its security needs, reinforcing its vision to strengthen national resilience and reduce dependency on external sources,' an Oct. 24 press release by the Indian Ministry of Defense about Atmanirbharta notes. It says that India used to rely on foreign countries for much of its weapons, with '65-70% of defense equipment being imported. However, this landscape has dramatically shifted, with around 65% of defense equipment now manufactured within India.' It points out that '21% of this production comes from the private sector, bolstering India's journey toward self-reliance.' Shield's release claims that this deal will 'allow India to function as a global production hub for the San Diego-based firm 'to handle both domestic and international sales and maintenance. It also will, the companies say, 'reduce reliance on external sources and ensure consistent delivery to India’s Armed Forces.' This 'marks a significant step in boosting India’s defense capabilities by bringing in world-class UAS technology to the country,' the release claims. 'JSW recognizes the same thing Shield AI does: that Group 3 UAS drones like the V-BAT can accomplish the same missions as many helicopters and larger Group 5 UAS drones for a fraction of the price,' Brandon Tseng, Shield AI’s co-founder and a former Navy SEAL, said in the release. 'As the market shifts from expensive, exquisite aircraft to swarms of lower-cost, AI-piloted UAS drones, this collaboration builds upon Shield AI’s significant U.S. investments, enhances global distribution, and supports continued expansion of U.S. operations.' Shield AI's managing director for India, Sarjan Shah, said the deal with JSW Group 'has been crafted over a multi-year period to transform the depth, scale and scope of India’s indigenous capabilities in the field of military unmanned systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-drone-maker-shield-ai-moves-into-indian-defense-market-joint-venture-with-jsw-group/	2024-11-27T10:31:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/V-bat-scaled-e1697122824715.jpg
New tech, including drones carrying blood, help injured Israeli soldiers survive	A Thor drone used to drop a small box that contains blood packets that can be used in the field by the IDF. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) JERUSALEM — The Israel Defense Forces estimate they have saved 380 lives of soldiers in the last 14 months of war due to new technology and procedures used to evacuate casualties to hospitals and to treat them on the field, including using drones to ferry blood for infusion into combat zones. At a tour of the IDF's Medical Corps and Technological and Logistics Directorate on Monday, an IDF official showed data that reveals the military has managed to reduce by half the number of soldiers who die from their injuries. In the 2006 Lebanon war, the IDF found that this rate was 14.1 percent. That number dropped to 9.2 percent during the 2014 war, and now is 6.9 percent for the Gaza front and 7.1 percent for the Lebanon fronts. 'The average time for a soldier to receive medical treatment in the field is between zero to four minutes, over 90 percent of soldiers injured from close-quarters combat received treatment in the field, approximately 1,600 injured soldiers were evacuated via helicopters,' the IDF said in a written statement. The short time to receive treatment is due to the presence of what the IDF calls Advanced Life Support providers, meaning medics deployed at the company level, and having more combat soldiers trained as medics. If the wounds are serious enough, the injured are placed in armored personnel carriers or Humvees and evacuated, either to a helicopter landing zone where Israel’s unit 669 takes them to civilian hospitals, or they continue in vehicles. The evacuation process can take slightly more than an hour when moving wounded from Gaza, to up to 111 minutes from Lebanon, due to the topography. The IDF also has increased the number of patients who receive whole blood and plasma that is constituted from freeze-dried plasma. Both of these have replaced the use of crystalloids, which had been used to treat blood loss in the field. Freeze-dried plasma does not require cooling, whereas whole blood does; the IDF has found a way to bring both to the front via small coolers for blood packets. The IDF has also recently used Thor drones, large quadcopters, to drop blood encased in a cooled box. The payload can be dropped from around 450 feet to troops in the field. The payload, around the size of a shoe box, lands via a small parachute rather than a cushion because blood should not be disturbed too much when being transported, an IDF official explained. A Humvee outfitted by the IDF as an example of how wounded can be transported from the field in specially-outfitted vehicles with stretchers and medics on board, for faster evacuation. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) The use of coolers deployed to the front with combat soldiers to carry blood has not only helped treat patients but also solved the problem of supplying the soldiers with these necessities during long periods in the field. During some of the fighting, IDF units have been in combat for days or weeks, and the coolers can provide several days of cooling for the blood. The blood is warmed via a small device, and the freeze-dried plasma can be reconstituted using water, a process that takes several minutes. The deployment of new tourniquets and homostatic bandages, used to control bleeding in an area like the groin where one can’t tie off an arm or leg, have been found to be effective. All of this helps treat soldiers in what is usually called the 'golden hour' in trauma care as patients are moved toward a hospital. However, the deployment of more medics at the front and movement of paramedics and physicians into the field has also resulted in more harm to these trained personnel. The IDF said 58 of their medical personnel have been killed. That's about 7 percent of the 804 IDF service members killed in the fighting since Hamas launched its devastating Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza is reported to exceed 44,000 and more than 3,000 in Lebanon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/new-tech-including-drones-carrying-blood-help-injured-israeli-soldiers-survive/	2024-11-27T07:39:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_IDF_medical_drone_handout-e1732644659771.png

(Photo by Adam J. Dewey/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump announced late Tuesday night that he has selected John Phelan, a prominent financier and campaign donor, to become Secretary of the Navy. 'John will be a tremendous force for our Naval Servicemembers, and a steadfast leader in advancing my America First vision. He will put the business of the U.S. Navy above all else,' Trump wrote in a post on TruthSocial, the social media platform he started. Phelan is the co-founder and chairman of Rugger Management, a private investment firm based in Palm Beach, Fla. The Hill reported he is also a donor to the Trump campaign and GOP-aligned efforts.

Aussie navigation firm, MBDA team and test AUKUS’ new tech-sharing muscles	Demonstration of MBDA's NILEQ sensors and how they read terrain like a fingerprint scanner. (MBDA) SYDNEY — A collaborative effort between a small Australian navigation firm and European defense giant MBDA is among the first to test the new tripartite arms export control system from the start of a program, and initial reports are positive, according to the CEO of the Australian firm. Before the changes to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) policies and the arms export regimes of Britain and Australia, 'it would take six months to get a license approved to just share information,' Sydney-based Advanced Navigation CEO Chris Shaw said in an interview today with Breaking Defense. But since a revamping of the rules in August, at least the timeline for information sharing has been trimmed down to days or weeks, he said. 'Yeah, there's still controls that have to be taken to account, which is fine, but it's a lot more simple now for something like this,' Shaw said. The memorandum of understanding between the two companies limits the work to between the United Kingdom and Australia, the release says, so has yet to test US rules. The Australian defense minister, Richard Marles, has hailed the arms export reforms as a 'generational' change, and Australian officials have generally been eager to comply with American requirements as they amend Australia’s arms export system. The ITAR system, of course, is infamous for its often slow and complex processes, overseen by the US State Department’s Political-Military Bureau. Pillar II of the US-UK-Australia venture known as AUKUS — whose primary focus in Pillar I is helping Australia buy and build nuclear-powered attack submarines — is a more diffuse effort which covers the rapid development, testing and deployment of new technologies in the realms of autonomy, hypersonics, cyber, artificial intelligence, electronic warfare and underwater systems. Shaw said his company and MBDA have been in talks with Pillar II contact points in each government since the beginning of this effort, and the press release mentions Pillar II without offering specifics. The collaboration, announced Nov. 20, is meant to produce and test a system that can work on a medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone that uses a newly developed sensor set to provide jam-proof navigation, as well as autonomy. MBDA developed the NILEQ sensors, which function in ways similar to fingerprint scanners, reading the terrain over which they fly. The system includes a detailed database of the Earth's surface. The sensors note changes between the database and what it senses, allowing rapid change detection and providing information that could be used for targeting. 'MBDA are convinced it has lots of different applications, so then they've decided to partner with us to explore taking that core tech and us integrating it with our navigation technology, and then trying to build an end solution for use on drones,' Shaw said in the interview. 'That's not something they do, because typically they build end products, right?' RELATED: When facing electronic warfare in Ukraine, small drones' quantity is quality The Australian general manager for MBDA, Tom Tizard, said in the press release that their new technology 'seeks to address the enormous demand for resilient absolute positioning information that will complement the existing navigation systems of airborne platforms.' Russia has made the risks of GPS all too clear, causing advanced weapons that depend entirely on GPS to lose much of their potency when jammed. Tizard praised Advanced Navigation as 'an ideal Australian partner to help accelerate the technology towards market entry. Navigation technologies that are not simply accurate and precise, but also provide the ‘resilience’ against interference, is what propels this partnership.' If it all works as designed, Advanced Navigation said in a press release that it believes the system 'will enable airborne systems to navigate unlimited distances over land without relying on GPS, and is passive and resistant to interference.' The venture is moving along at a clip, with the new systems' first test flight possibly happening before the end of the year, Advanced Navigation's CEO said. The MBDA agreement comes after the company signed in early September what could be a landmark agreement with South Korea's Hanwha to supply an already-developed precision guidance systems to Hanwha worldwide. It could, Shaw said the day of the signing, lead to as much as a 400 percent increase in business for the Australian firm.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aussie-navigation-firm-mbda-team-and-test-aukus-new-tech-sharing-muscles/	2024-11-27T02:07:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-2-e1732632837127.jpeg
Commerce announces more semiconductor funding for military aircraft, commercial satellites	US President Joe Biden holds a semiconductor during his remarks before signing an Executive Order on the economy in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 24, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In an effort to bolster domestic manufacturing of chips for national security and the space industry, the Department of Commerce announced it is awarding BAE Systems Inc. and Rocket Lab a CHIPS Incentive Award worth up to a combined $59.4 million. The funding comes from the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act. BAE Systems Inc., the US subsidiary of British company BAE Systems, will receive $35.5 million in direct funding to build chips used for military jets and commercial satellites, according to a press release from the Department of Commerce. Rocket Lab, the parent company of space power provider SolAero Technologies Corp., will receive up to $23.9 million for space-grade solar cells — space devices used to convert light to electricity which help operate missile awareness systems and 'world-leading science missions,' per the Monday release. The award announcements come after BAE Systems Inc. received a preliminary agreement for the funding in December 2023 and Rocket Lab received a preliminary agreement this past June. 'From satellites in space to defense systems on the ground, our most advanced defense and commercial technology rely on mature-node and compound semiconductors to operate,' Laurie Locascio, under secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, said in the release. 'By finalizing these awards, we are strengthening America’s domestic semiconductor supply chain resilience and broadening our manufacturing capabilities.' The money awarded to BAE Systems Inc. is specifically going to BAE Systems Electronics, a unit within the company responsible for producing commercial and defense electronics for flight and engine control, electronic warfare, surveillance, geospatial intelligence and power and energy management. It will support the company’s microelectronics center in New Hampshire, which was founded by the Department of Defense last year. With this funding, the company will increase its production capacity fourfold for Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit chips which are used to operate military aircraft and commercial satellite systems, per the Department of Commerce. 'The investment will also cut the company’s modernization timeline in half, bolstering the facility’s ability to serve mission-critical defense programs,' the release added. Rocket Lab will use its funding to 'create a more robust and resilient supply' of space-grade solar cells. It is one of two companies in the US that specializes in producing these types of semiconductors. 'The Department’s investment will support the modernization and expansion of Rocket Lab’s facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which will increase the company's compound semiconductor production by 50% within the next three years — helping to meet the growing national security and commercial demand for these solar cells in the United States,' the release said. Intel Corporation, another chip building company, was also awarded $7.87 billion from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday. This is less than the $8.5 billion outlined in the preliminary agreement, which was announced in March. 'The award will directly support Intel’s expected U.S. investment of nearly $90 billion by the end of the decade, which is part of the company’s overall $100+ billion expansion plan,' Tuesday’s release said. These recent awards from the Department of Commerce appear to be a last-ditch effort to finalize investments under the Biden administration's CHIPS Act before president-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump has recently criticized the program over the last several weeks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/commerce-announces-more-semiconductor-funding-for-military-aircraft-commercial-satellites/	2024-11-26T13:21:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/211029_biden_semiconductor_GettyImages-1303925325-scaled-e1635522770760.jpg
Netanyahu announces move toward ceasefire in Lebanon, along with stark warning	Smoke billows above Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike on November 26, 2024, amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. (Photo by FADEL ITANI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Just hours after Israel launched a barrage of strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he will bring a 'ceasefire outline' for approval by his cabinet, paving the way for a major, if tenuous development after two months of heavy fighting. A Lebanese official reportedly said that Hezbollah, Israel's Iran-backed enemy in Lebanon, has agreed to such a proposal. 'The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon. We have an understanding with the United States,' Netanyahu said, according to a live Sky News translation of his address. 'We are maintaining our full liberty to take military operations if Hezbollah tries to attack us, it arms itself, rebuild infrastructure next to the borders — we will attack them. If they launch missiles, if they dig tunnels, we will attack.' The prime minister did not offer details about the ceasefire proposal, but previous reporting said discussions included a 60-day cessation of hostilities. Israeli troops would withdraw from South Lebanon, and Hezbollah troops would withdraw north of the Litani River, according to the Times of Israel. Additionally, the deal reportedly calls for implementation of 1701 United Nations Security Council Resolution, the deployment of Lebanese Armed Forces on the southern border alongside United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, UNIFIL. A US-led international committee is purportedly would monitor the execution of the ceasefire. At the Pentagon today, spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder also did not reveal the specifics of the deal, but said that as 'far as the ceasefire goes, we're, of course, strongly supportive of a ceasefire. 'We're consulting closely with our interagency partners in terms of what potential contributions the DOD can make,' he said. 'I don't have anything to announce from here, but we'll certainly keep you updated.' The announcement comes 57 days after the Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon and 415 days after Hezbollah joined what it called the 'Gaza support' front on Oct. 8, 2023, dragging Lebanon into the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The ceasefire does not apply to Gaza. Lebanese retired armed forces Gen. Wehbe Katicha said the monitoring by the US-led group would likely include land, sea and air borders in part to prevent arms transfers to Hezbollah. Maroun Hitti, also a retired brigadier general from the Lebanese Armed Forces, told Breaking Defense ahead of the announcement that he viewed the acceptance of a ceasefire as a defeat for Hezbollah. 'Hezbollah would have given up linking Lebanese front to Gaza support and the strategy of &#8216;unity of the fronts' would have disintegrated and been crushed forever,' he said. More broadly Ali Bakir, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, said a ceasefire could prompt existential questions about Hezbollah, especially after its leadership has been systematically devastated by Israeli operations. 'The key question is: What is the purpose of Hezbollah's arsenal if it can neither fight Israel nor protect Hezbollah, its leaders, the Shiite community, and Lebanon, as the party has claimed for over a decade?' Bakir asked.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/netanyahu-announces-move-toward-ceasefire-in-lebanon-along-with-stark-warning/	2024-11-26T11:00:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_israel_strike_beirut_GettyImages-2186324612-scaled-e1732647429461.jpg
Commerce taps Slingshot to create space tracking user website	Slingshot Aerospace operates a network of telescopes for keeping tabs on objects in low Earth orbit. (Slingshot) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department has awarded Slingshot Aerospace a $13.3 million contract to build a web portal to access to its nascent space tracking database — slotting into place the last piece of the puzzle that will allow the Pentagon to wean commercial and foreign satellite operators from the military's increasingly threat-oriented system for monitoring the heavens. The Colorado-based startup will develop the so-called 'presentation layer' user interface for Commerce's Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS), based on its 'Slingshot Beacon' space traffic management software, according to a company press release today. Slingshot's work, which includes a year-long development phase and four one-year options, will be supported by COMSPOC and T and T Consulting Services, the release added. 'Deploying the TraCSS user interface is the next major step in operationalizing U.S. civil space traffic coordination,' said Audrey Schaffer, Slingshot vice president of strategy and policy. TraCSS is being developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Space Commerce (OSC), which was directed to take over traffic coordination responsibilities from the Defense Department following the issuance of Space Policy Directive 3 (SPD-3) in 2018. The TraCSS.gov website is expected to be online and begin the transition of all commercial users from the US Space Command's Space-track.org in late 2025. Slingshot has been working with OSC almost from the get-go, as the office sought to build up expertise in using open-source data from commercial and non-military telescopes and radars for space situational awareness, including the ability to calculate the likelihood of potential on-orbit collisions and warn operators in advance. For example, the company was among several chosen for OSC's Consolidated Pathfinder project to gather data about objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) launched in January via contracts managed via NASA’s Global Data Marketplace. Likewise it was involved in an earlier data-gathering effort back in December 2022 was conducted jointly by OSC and the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/commerce-taps-slingshot-to-create-space-tracking-user-website/	2024-11-26T10:15:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Slingshot-Global-Sensor-Network-–-Varda-Sensor-Day.png
France takes aim at unmanned systems, taking lessons from Paris Olympics	French soldiers from the Operation Sentinelle present a high frequency jammer NEROD RF rifle during a press visit in Paris on July 17, 2024. (Photo by ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty Images) PARIS — 'Attacks using swarms of armed, unmanned air systems is no longer just science fiction.' That was the warning from Emmanuel Chiva, director of France’s defense procurement agency, at one of the nation’s largest defense expositions, Euronaval, hosted in Paris in October. Since Chiva’s remarks Ukraine says it has suffered a wave of drone attacks from Russia, and Israel is bracing for a potential third barrage of drones and missiles fired by Iran. Meanwhile sea-based unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have struck both commercial and naval ships in the Red Sea, and Kyiv has managed to strike significant blows against Russia’s Black Sea fleet using the same kind of nascent technology. As such, defense against unmanned aerial and maritime systems was a key focus of this year’s Euronaval, where officials discussed what Paris was doing about the threat and industry players offered up their defensive systems as potential solutions. 'So, we need to stay in the race and find an answer to these threats, and use the lessons learned in the Red and Black seas,' Chiva’s deputy, General Thierry Carlier, said during the show. RELATED: Nets, jamming and &#8216;cyber scalpels': Pentagon weighs homeland counter-drone tech in mountain exercises In France’s 2024-30 Military Program Law, €5 billion ($5.3 billion) has been earmarked for ground-to-air defense, which includes counter-UAS equipment. In 2024, because of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, the anti-drone mission just during the competition weeks was expected to 'amount to 20,000 hours of surveillance, 10 times more than for the 2023 Rugby World Cup,' General Stéphane Mille, commander of the Air and Space Force, said in an interview prior to the event. According to a National Assembly report, 355 unauthorized drones were detected during the Games — largely flown by amateurs unaware of legislation — and 81 arrests were made. As the threat has grown, so has the investment of firms worldwide, including in France, to counter them. That requires the complex process of spotting the threat, classifying it and then passing that information along — in near-real time — to other systems that can do something about it. Erik Van Kimmenaede, Thales marketing director for surface radar, told journalists during a pre-Euronaval briefing that 'all this needs to be automated to act fast.' There’s also the question of cost-per-kill. There’s little point in using a million-dollar missile to take out a drone that cost just a few hundred dollars. Thales has developed the E-Trap to neutralize these Class 1 (micro, mini or small) drones, which had its first public outing at the Euronaval show although it was discreetly deployed during the Olympic Games, according to the company. Developed with the support of France’s procurement arm, DGA, Thales says E-Trap is a 360° high-power microwave antenna that emits a very brief but very powerful electromagnetic pulse meant to destroy the electronic components necessary to make a drone function. It is effective against a single UAV/USV or a swarm of them, the company says. Elsewhere, Safran Electronics &amp; Defense has teamed with the French company Hologarde to develop its Skyjacker counter-drone solution. That one was also used to protect the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The system, which the companies say is effective at ranges up to six miles spoofs the drone, altering its trajectory by replacing the satellite navigation signals it uses to guide it towards its target with different ones. According to Thales, 'Skyjacker can efficiently defeat isolated drones and drone swarms in land and naval environments.' Chiva told a National Assembly defense committee on Oct. 23 that 'at least three' of France’s FREMM frigates will be equipped with the Skyjacker system. He also mentioned that 'at sea (…) we can project a great quantity of metal into the air to neutralize these threats, notably when confronted by swarms. An anti-drone task force was set up in the light of events in the Red Sea. It studied, for example, the use of the 76mm munitions from the (Oto-Melara) 76mm gun to neutralize drone threats.' At Euronaval, MC2 technologies, a smaller business that specializes in micro and nanotechnologies, was also showing some of its counter-UAS systems, including the Nerod, a jammer gun designed to disrupt and neutralize communications between micro and/or mini—drones and their controllers. The company says 80 of these guns have already been delivered to French armed forces and police, and some 500 others have gone 'numerous clients abroad in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East,' including Luxembourg, Côte d’Ivoire and Japan. The Air and Space Force said one of their snipers used the Nerod from a Fennec helicopter in June during the 80th D-Day celebrations in Normandy to take out a drone that was flying too close to the official convoy, which included French President Emmanuel Macron. MC2 Technolgoies has also delivered its Neptune and Majes counter-drone systems (which work by jamming) to the French Navy which put them to good effect last week to neutralize a UAV, according to the company’s LinkedIn page.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/france-takes-aim-at-unmanned-systems-taking-lessons-from-paris-olympics/	2024-11-26T09:11:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_jammer_gun_france_GettyImages-2161802691-scaled-e1732640927853.jpg
Embraer targets prime status in US defense market	Embraer showed off its C-390 Millennium carrier during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow. Embraer signed a contract with the Netherlands and Austria for a combined order of the C-390 during the show. (Tim Martin/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Brazilian aerospace firm Embraer has been present in the American defense market for over a decade, with its commercial arm operating in the states even longer. But the company is now seeking to expand its US reach by chasing the coveted status of being a major prime contractor for the Pentagon — and to do so, 'all avenues' are at the firm’s disposal, including merger and acquisitions activity, executives recently told Breaking Defense. The core of Embraer's plans for penetrating the US market, according to Embraer Defense CEO Bosco da Costa Jr, are its two flagship products: the A-29 Super Tucano prop plane, and especially the firm's C-390 tactical airlifter. 'The main interest of Embraer Defense &amp; Security is to expand its presence here in the US using this platform,' da Costa said of the C-390, known as the 'Millennium,' in an October interview. The C-390 has enjoyed a string of recent successes on the international circuit, sometimes besting competitors like Lockheed Martin’s C-130, as da Costa noted that Embraer recently 'defined a strategy to turn Embraer Defense &amp; Security into an international player.' On the US side, da Costa emphasized that the Millennium is already compliant with Buy American Act requirements, pointing to customers like the Air Force or Marine Corps that the company would pitch the aircraft to. Embraer could even put forward the C-390 for any Pentagon buyers as a prime supplier. And it may have to, now that a partnership with L3Harris has fallen through for an 'agile tanker' aimed at the US Air Force, whose own air refueling plans are somewhat in flux. According to Embraer Defense &amp; Security Chief Commercial Officer Frederico Lemos, the company believes there could be 'space' for the C-390 in the Air Force’s tentative plans for a limited tranche of procurement, known as the KC-135 Tanker Recapitalization program. Additionally, Lemos said Embraer is looking ahead to a future tanker known as the Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS) and is responding to requests for information put out by the Air Force on the topic. The Millennium 'can play a very important role to address the requirements and the speed that we understand is needed to address the challenges in the Pacific,' Lemos said. And to potentially sweeten the deal, Embraer is evaluating whether to open a final assembly line in the US for the C-390 like it operates for the A-29, da Costa said. (In partnership with Sierra Nevada Corporation, Embraer manufactures its A-29 Super Tucano in Jacksonville, Fla., for Foreign Military Sales cases, but a dearth of sales have forced the company to stare down a potential production gap.) The C-390 is also by no means the only way the company hopes to grow its US footprint, with da Costa raising the prospect of new partnerships and mergers and acquisitions that could benefit the Millennium, as well as the entire company. 'We are evaluating all the avenues in order to allow us to be here as a strategic player for the US government,' he said. 'I think what we are looking [at are] possibilities that will add value to our business, that will add new capabilities, new systems, new technologies.' Making moves in the US market isn’t limited to Embraer’s defense business either. Instead, da Costa framed it as an all-hands-on deck strategy. 'This strategy to become a supplier of the US government is not a project that I have created inside of my business unit only. It is a &#8216;One Embraer' approach,' he said. 'This is not a simple project inside of the defense business unit. It is a very high-level project inside of Embraer and is a strategic project for us in the coming years.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/embraer-targets-prime-status-in-us-defense-market/	2024-11-26T06:53:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
Israel to buy new Corvettes, ‘hundreds’ of JLTVs	Driving through off-road obstacles showcases the Joint Light Tactical Vehicles’ capabilities to maneuver over uneven surfaces at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, Aug. 17, 2022. (Spc. Brittney Joy/US Army) JERSUALEM — The Israeli Ministry of Defense has approved a major new procurement deal to acquire five new corvettes for the Israeli navy and 'hundreds' of new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles for the ground forces. Israel has not specified how much each deal is worth, but in a statement described the two packages as a 'multi-billion Shekel' expenditure. The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 has led to the fast-tracking of a number of procurement deals, but this most recent announcement is the first to come from the Nagel Committee, a commission stood up in August. Chaired by Prof. Jacob Nagel, the commission was established by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the goal of 'formulating recommendations on the force building needs and the security budget in the coming decade.' The Israel Military Procurement Ministerial Committee approved the two acquisitions. They will now be submitted to the Knesset’s Joint Committee for the Defense Budget; however, the government did not give a timeline for when the Knesset submission and subsequent vote will happen The new 'next generation' advanced missile ships will be built by Israel Shipyards, and dubbed the Reshef-class, named after one of the older Sa’ar 4 class ships that have since been retired. The new Reshef-class frigates will replace the Sa’ar 4.5-class missile boats which Israel has used since the 1980s. These eight ships, which were launched between 1981 to 2003, are set to be decommissioned. Plans for the new Reshef class ships go back several years. Naval News reported in July 2023 that the ships will include a main gun at the bow, as well as the new C-Dome air defense system, which is the naval version of Iron Dome. The Israeli navy has undergone a major expansion in the last decade, with four new Sa’ar 6 naval ships that began to be commissioned in 2022, as well as new submarines. The Israeli navy currently has four active Sa’ar 6 ships, which first saw action in the recent war against Hamas in Gaza. It also has three Sa’ar 5 corvettes as well as eight of the Sa’ar 4.5. Meanwhile, the IDF held a naming ceremony for its sixth submarine in Germany on Nov. 12. The Israeli navy was also bolstered by two new landing craft that began arriving in 2023. The overall cost of the five ships was not revealed. However, the Sa’ar 6 cost more than $400 million each. Israel Shipyards built the original Reshef class Sa’ar 4 back in the 1960s. The company describes itself as the 'first in the Western world to design and build a fast-attack missile boat. … At that time, it was a new concept to use relatively small, fast missile-equipped craft to meet threats in the naval arena.' The Shipyards currently offer a 72 meter and 80 meter version of the Sa’ar series of ships, which they call Sa’ar -72 and Sa’ar-80 respectively. A report in 2022 said the Sa’ar 80 would be the export version of the new Reshef class; the firm that year said that 'The S80 will be the flagship of the Israel Shipyards for the next decades and she will serve the Israeli Navy and many other navies around the world.' In addition to the ships, Israel is procuring hundreds of new JLTVs. Oshkosh is the current procurer on the JLTV, but AM General in 2023 won the right to produce the US Army's next-generation of vehicles. Which company's version Israeli would receive could depend on when an order is officially placed. 'These armored combat mobility vehicles will be supplied to the IDF's maneuvering forces in the coming years,' the Defense Ministry noted in a post on social media. The vehicles, which first entered service in the US in 2019, will bolster Israel’s ground forces by giving new options in place of aging Humvees, which have been used widely in the 2024 war. In December 2023 Oshkosh Defense said it would fulfill two Israeli orders for a total of seventy-five of the 4X4 JLTVs. In 2020 Rafael Advanced Defense Systems showcased its Spike LR on a JLTV in Slovenia and Elbit has equipped weapon stations on JLTVs for Montenegro. The CH-53K which Israel is also acquiring can lift JLTVs, a point Lockheed Martin highlighted in a 2018 Hebrew statement about the heavy lifter.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-to-buy-new-corvettes-hundreds-of-jltvs/	2024-11-25T13:30:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/7376919-scaled-e1663702547702.jpg
Navy asking Congress for $5.7B in emergency submarine funding	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (US Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — The Office of Management and Budget today delivered a request to Congress for approximately $5.7 billion in emergency funding to account for unexpected 'shortfalls' in the Navy's Virginia-class fast attack submarine program, according to a senior Navy official. The emergency funding request was accompanied by a separate 'anomaly' that would permit the service to continue funding the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program in the event lawmakers pass a continuing resolution prior to when government funding is set to expire on Dec. 20. (Anomaly is the term the Defense Department uses when it seeks permission from Congress to spend money outside the traditional constraints of a continuing resolution.) 'Our Virginia-class fast attack submarine program is not where it needs to be right now. The program and the shipyards are not producing submarines at the rate that our national security strategy and the national defense strategy require,' the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. The Navy's stated goal for its submarine programs is the so-called '2+1' cadence, which refers to two Virginia-class subs and one Columbia-class submarine built per year. The service's historical record for Virginia-class submarines is closer to 1.2 to 1.3 boats per year. The official said roughly $2 billion would go towards addressing funding 'shortfalls' for the two fiscal 2024 Virginia-class submarines and $1.5 billion would go towards a similar anticipated shortfall for the one Virginia-class boat in the FY-25 budget. The rest of the funding would be split between submarine prime contractors General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII's Newport News Shipbuilding for increased wages and 'other productivity enhancements,' the official said. Both General Dynamics and HII in their most recent earnings calls have expressed concerns about the state of the post-COVID supply chain as well as the financial pain it has put on them. While speaking to reporters, the senior Navy official said the service has had numerous conversations with those companies and sees the emergency funding as a way to address the issues raised during those talks. RELATED: GD chief says Navy's 1 sub buy won't impact company short term, but out years less certain 'The phasing of these investments is focused on improving shipbuilder capability, capacity and efficiency and thereby reducing submarine construction delays and hope and ultimately controlling costs of future submarines,' the official said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-asking-congress-for-5-7b-in-emergency-submarine-funding/	2024-11-25T12:00:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8630521-e1732050099734.jpg
‘Everybody’s going to have to figure this out’: Army, Air Force debate base defense amid new threats	A U.S. Army MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system is fired for a coastal air defense event during Balikatan 23 at the Naval Education, Training and Doctrine Command, Philippines (Photo: US Marine Corps) WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump’s new defense secretary takes the reins of the Pentagon next year, they may quickly be faced with an internal debate to settle: whether the Army should continue with its traditional role of providing defenses for air bases, or whether the Air Force steps up to the task on its own. At the core of the issue is not only the capabilities brought to the fight by each service, but how they will be funded. The Army has traditionally been charged with defending air bases, which is part of the reason why systems like Patriot and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) reside under the service's control. But tepid investment during the Global War on Terror years, alongside the proliferation of missile threats from China and Russia, has led Air Force officials to begin openly grumbling that they feel the Army can't, or won't, make air base defense a priority — and that a change may be due. Recent comments from Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall seemed to bring the issue to a head, after he reportedly suggested his service could take over the air base defense mission from the Army in its entirety. Of course, if that happens, Air Force advocates would likely want to see more dollars distributed to the service, whether they come out of the Army's coffers or elsewhere. Asked about the ongoing discussion on Nov. 20, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said he recently met with his Air Force counterpart, Gen. David Allvin, to help chart a way forward. But George made it clear that in his mind, protection responsibilities have to fall on the entire joint force going forward. 'I do believe that every formation that’s out there — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines — you're going to have to protect yourself against long-range fires. You're going to have to protect yourself against drones. Everybody's going to have to figure this out,' he said at the National Security Innovation Forum event in Washington. George's comments seem to fall in line with a growing consensus that having one service responsible for base defense writ large isn't going to work in a modern era filled with a variety of threats. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says George's point that every service will need to have some internal base defense capability is 'reflecting reality' that 'all services are gonna have to get into air defense at some kind for the new threat environment,' not just for missiles but for drones as well. 'People keep saying, &#8216;Why isn’t the Army defending our air bases?' And the answer is, there is nowhere near enough missile defense capacity for everything we need to defend. That is true of air bases, and true of lots of other kinds of bases, it's true in Ukraine, in Israel — it's not just the Air Force assets that need tons more help, it's everything,' Karako said. He pointed out that the Marines are going out and trying to buy their own Iron Dome-like system to counter rockets and small drones, and that while there is a benefit in having a specialist branch of the Army that just does air defense, there will never be enough people in that unit to cover all the needs. 'Does the Air Force have a point that there is utility in specialization? Sure. But we are where we are, we got where we are today as a joint force and we’re gonna have to deal with it as a joint force,' Karako said. Services are also trying to shift tactics as the threat from adversaries like China grows, with the Air Force adopting a new, dispersed method of operations known as agile combat employment (ACE). The ACE concept is a necessary, but not sufficient, approach for protecting troops and assets; even with the concept, Air Force officials have become worried that air bases in the Indo-Pacific are still vulnerable against Beijing’s burgeoning missile arsenal and other budding weapons. Higher-end systems like Patriot or Aegis cruisers are placed where joint task force commanders think critical defensive capabilities are needed, and air bases have generally been protected as a result, Lt. Gen. David Harris, deputy chief of staff of Air Force futures, said in an interview with Breaking Defense at the Pentagon. 'But there could be a point in time in the future where the critical asset list or the defended asset list, there's other things in the region that might be more important than our air bases,' Harris continued. 'So this is where things are split.' Harris noted it's critical for disparate systems fielded by the services to connect into a common architecture, using an example where data can be passed from an Army theater defense system to a local air base. Echoing comments from other officials, Harris also said installations might need to operate their own systems to defend themselves from threats like small to mid-size drones, or 'maybe' even cruise missiles. Depending on the environment — with Harris using the example of struggles to combat small drones flying over bases on US soil — that could range from more limited defenses to a 'full package' that could take out threats spanning drones to ballistic missiles. 'So there's an aspect of this base defense that I think as an Air Force that we need to be thinking about next. Because if we're starting to march our way forward, part of our survivability as we go into a higher threat intensity, that's going to start to matter more,' Harris said. George, for his part, said he’d like to see more dollars put toward the base defense mission and for development efforts to move more quickly. 'I think we need to spend more [and move] faster on these problems and have the flexibility to get out there and innovate,' he said. 'So I think everybody's going to have to figure this out, and we're going to figure this out with the Air Force.'

Saudi Arabia reveals strides in local defense production as it races towards ambitious 2030 goal	A Royal Saudi Air Force pilot poses in front of an aircraft during the Athens Flying Show in Tanagra, Greece, on September 14, 2024. (Photo by Giorgos Arapekos/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently revealed significant strides in its quest to localize defense production, reaching nearly 20 percent localization by the end of 2023. That's up from just 4 percent in 2018 as the Kingdom pursues its ambitious goal of 50 percent by 2030. Saudia Arabia's General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI) 'issued many policies and legislation that regulate and stimulate the sector and enhance the competitiveness of the local product, which raised the localization rate from 4 percent in 2018 to 19.35 percent at the end of last year of military spending,' GAMI head Ahmad Abdulaziz Al-Ohali said Thursday during a dialogue session at the Local Content Forum. Al-Ohali added that the number of authorized and licensed facilities in the military industries sector has increased from five facilities in 2019 to 296 facilities by the third quarter of 2024. 'The Authority [GAMI] worked to sign more than 53 industrial cooperation programs worth approximately 35 billion riyals [$9.32 billion] with local and international companies, including approximately 13 billion riyals [$3.46 billion] purchase orders for local companies,' he said. Saudi Arabia, historically one of the largest defense importers worldwide, is concentrating heavily on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 to localize 50 percent of defense production. And though the year-to-year rise doesn't appear to be steep enough for Saudi Arabia to reach that high mark in time, another key figure in Saudi Arabia's defense industry previously told Breaking Defense that the policies, investments, joint ventures and production lines the Kingdom has established should cause an exponential growth curve in the years ahead. 'We are extremely confident that by 2030 we will achieve the target of 50 percent localization in defense spending,' the then-CEO of Saudi Arabian Military Industries Walid Abdukhaled said in June 2023. A few months later, in February 2024, Al-Ohali echoed the sentiment, telling Breaking Defense he was 'really confident' Riyadh would hit its goal or go beyond it. In October of last year, GAMI launched an 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' section on its official website, with the goal of pointing international firms to areas of opportunity. The authority identified 'more than 70 opportunities in the supply chain,' Al-Ohali said then, worth up to $64 billion over the next decade. 'We contributed to supporting local manufacturers through several initiatives, such as: applying the zero added tax on locally manufactured military goods, and most importantly, framework agreements,' Al-Ohali said. The governor highlighted that GAMI has launched a unified platform for military industries, 'which represents a unified structure for all services provided to beneficiaries, and we were keen to automate all services and use the latest means of technology, data science and artificial intelligence.' On Wednesday, a joint venture between Saudi and Spanish defense firms, SAMINavantia, launched a Saudi-designed combat management system, the first such product developed by the company in the Kingdom and which the company said was 'part of SAMINavantia's contribution to localizing over 50 [percent] of military spending by 2030[.]'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/saudi-arabia-reveals-strides-in-local-defense-production-as-it-races-towards-ambitious-2030-goal/	2024-11-25T06:40:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241122_saudi_fighter_GettyImages-2171209221-scaled-e1732298993557.jpg
Norway asks US about maritime drone options as it ponders new, long-range capability	The HNoMS Roald Amundsen (F 311) sails in a fjord as part of Cold Response 16, March 1, 2016 at Namsos, Norway. (Official Marine Corps Photo by Gunnery Sgt. Bryson K. Jones/Released) BELFAST — Norway has embarked on studies to examine how it would introduce a new, long-range, aerial maritime surveillance drone into its forces in the high north and has asked the US for information about suitable American options, the Ministry of Defence said in a new statement. 'Norway is considering several types of drones, and it is too early to comment further on the type, number, or specific requirements for the acquisition beyond what is outlined in the adopted long-term plan,' Anne Marie Aanerud, state secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Defence, told Breaking Defense Thursday. 'As part of the ongoing studies we have requested additional information on relevant drones from the U.S. authorities,' she said. 'The response will be incorporated into the ongoing work on the drone acquisition.' Aanerud noted that a timeline for contract signing has has still to be decided, as military officials continue to work up a strategy to implement recommendations for the long-term defense plan. That defense plan, published in April, revealed Oslo's intention to procure the maritime surveillance drones, and Aanerud told Breaking Defense the ministry envisions platforms that are able to 'monitor large areas for extended periods of time, complementing the tools we already have.' The future drones are set to be based out of Andøya Air Station, northern Norway, 300 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle and previously home to Royal Norwegian Air Force P-3 Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA). Olso decided to reverse a decision to close the base in the aftermath of the Ukraine war and amid a renewed focus on bolstering defense capabilities to counter Russian aggression. Though Aanerud declined to say if any specific platforms are under consideration, and several international firms make drones that could fit the bill, the fact that US authorities had been contacted suggests that American systems are in the running. Northrop Grumman delivers the fourth MQ-4C Triton for long-range, persistent, maritime surveillance to the U.S. Navy for Initial Operational Capability. Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman. An executive at Northrop Grumman, for one, said the company's MQ-4C Triton, a pricey high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) system, was among them. The US Navy operates the Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) mainly to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and as a complement to Boeing P-8A MPA operations. Norway operates five of the P-8 crewed platforms. Doug Shaffer, vice president of autonomous intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting programs at Northrop Grumman, told Breaking Defense his firm has had 'extensive' written exchanges as well as face-to-face meetings with Norwegian officials about the aerospace giant's offerings. 'We've had all our engineers there, answering hundreds of questions,' he said, adding that an aircraft selection decision could come in the 'next few months.' Northrop says the Triton, which can fly above 50,000 feet, can cover some 4 million nautical miles with its sensor array in a 24-hour sortie — roughly equivalent to the size of China. But it is expensive. In July, Inside Defense reported that each newest version of Triton has an estimated price tag of $618 million though that figure was a result of a per-unit price jump in the US Navy program after the total acquisition was slashed. Shaffer argued the capabilities of a single airframe are worth the price tag over the drone's entire lifecycle. 'The largest cost is the operational sustainment over decades, and to do the same mission as a HALE platform, it takes three to five times more MALES,' he claimed, referring to medium-altitude, long-endurance drones. 'That calculus is what Norway is evaluating.' If that is a calculus Norway is doing, on the other end of the equation could be the much less expensive American-made MQ-9B SeaGuardian, a MALE variant of the MQ-9 Reaper produced by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) that can fly at 40,000 feet. The flyaway unit cost of a MQ-9B sits at approximately $38 million, excluding through life and sustainment costs, according to figures from Shephard Media, a British trade publication. GA-ASI has positioned the drone for sale up north, saying in company literature that 'with MQ-9B, the Nordic and Northern European allies now have a surveillance platform to choose that can perform all their key missions with low acquisition and operating costs.' A GA-ASI MQ-9B SeaGuardian demonstrates its maritime capabilities during European Maritime Demos (GA-ASI) C. Mark Brinkley, a spokesperson for GA-ASI, declined to comment on whether the SeaGuardian is in the race for Norway's next UAV, but did suggest it would be an effective high north asset. 'MQ-9B’s advanced sensors, data processing power, worldwide proliferated low-Earth orbit (pLEO) satellite communications link, and impressive endurance make Arctic awareness possible from anywhere in the world,' he said. 'Over the Arctic, MQ-9B can detect air, ground, surface, and subsurface targets of interest, including surveillance balloons, maritime vessels, and submarines, and then feed real-time intelligence to military and civil authorities around the world.' Brinkley also said that future upgrades of the aircraft, including detect and avoid technology integrated with Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) capability, Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) and air-to-air radar, 'will add to the ease of operating in the Arctic.' Specific to maritime missions the MQ-9B can also be equipped with a 360-degree maritime radar, fitted with an Automated Identification System (AIS), an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capability, featuring a sonobuoy monitoring and control system capable of dispensing up to 40 sonobuoys, noted Brinkley. A spokesperson for the US State Department, which plays a key role in negotiating foreign military sales, told Breaking Defense that the US has a 'close defense trade partnership with Norway that includes co-production of advanced systems like the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS. However, we have no comment on our specific cooperation in the long-range maritime UAV space and would refer you to the Government of Norway.' Generally speaking, Oslo has consistently stressed that multinational collaboration with allies will be a core element of the maritime surveillance drone acquisition, particularly in areas such as development, operations and training. In June, it committed to closer bilateral defense cooperation with Scandinavian counterpart Denmark, through a letter of intent, covering drones and air defense, among other items. Similarly, Copenhagen has committed to the acquisition of long-range drones to monitor the Arctic and North Atlantic. Additional funding for the effort was secured in January, as part of an initial cross party agreement, that falls under a new, national defense settlement, according to a Danish Ministry of Defence statement. But at a local level, the Norwegian drone effort has been hotly debated in recent months with critics, including senior defense officials, publicly warning against the procurement of large, long-range surveillance types at all. Writing in a Norwegian Armed Forces magazine, Rolf Folland, former Chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force and currently the Norwegian military representative to NATO, questioned the survivability of the US platforms, specifically citing shootdown incidents of both aircraft. Large drones 'with their low speed and large radar cross-section &#8230; can become relatively easy targets for an adversary that has modern anti-aircraft systems, and they are vulnerable to electronic countermeasures that can disrupt their communication and navigation systems,' stated Folland. Instead of Norway opting for such large, expensive platforms, he recommended looking into alternative ideas, specifically procurement of a stealth-designed drone or ordering additional satellites. 'Monitoring and situation overview from space can potentially be significantly better than from a drone,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/norway-asks-us-about-maritime-drone-options-as-it-ponders-new-long-range-capability/	2024-11-25T04:30:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_norway_fjords_2435876-scaled-e1732225784515.jpg
Russia ‘likely’ to transfer submarine tech to China, N. Korea: INDOPACOM Chief	This pool photograph distributed by Russian state-owned agency Sputnik shows Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shaking hands during a meeting in Beijing on October 18, 2023. (Sergei Guneyev/AFP via Getty Images) HALIFAX, CANADA — The growing ties between China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been the source of Western leaders' ire for several years, but seem to be reaching a new, critical level, where transfer of the highest level of military technologies between the countries, including key Russian submarine tech, may become routine. The head of US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, told an audience today that in exchange for North Korean troops and artillery, Moscow 'will likely' provide Pyongyang with missile and submarine technology. And in exchange for China helping to rebuild 'Russia’s war machine,' Paparo anticipates that Moscow will also be sharing submarine technology with Beijing, a move that has the 'potential of closing American undersea dominance to the PRC.' 'Where one is resource poor, the others fulfill those resources. Where one has operational needs, the others are fulfilling those needs,' Paparo told the audience at this weekend’s annual Halifax International Security Forum. That concerning relationship between those four governments was a major theme throughout the Canadian event, with widespread agreement that the Ukraine war has now breached the geopolitical walls between the European and Indo-Pacific theaters for good. 'Those who might believe that you can just isolate the [Russian-Ukraine] conflict or accommodate somehow with Russia, I believe that's wrong,' Germany's Minister of State Tobias Lindner told reporters today. 'If you're interested in security in the Indo-Pacific and all those issues you need to have a tough stance on Russia too.' RELATED: INDOPACOM’s Paparo acknowledges stockpile shortages may impact his readiness North Korea’s decision to send upwards of 10,000 military personnel and additional weapons to fight alongside Russia forces in Ukraine makes the case stronger, with Dutch Adm. Rob Bauer — chair of the NATO Military Committee — arguing here that it gives the DPRK a potential seat at the negotiation table in ceasefire negotiations, a new complicating factor in the 1,000 day war. 'Not only [do you] have to talk to Russia now, but you also have to deal with North Korea,' Bauer told an audience on Friday. 'The North Koreans get technology and weapons systems and ammunition from the Russians as well… This is connecting the world in a way that we didn't think was possible and it is connected to China.' While China is not directly sending Russia weapons, Bauer argued that its transfer of key components, like semiconductors and machine tools, is keeping Russia in the fight. 'Without China, Russia would not be able to continue the war,' Bauer added. (Iran has been sending Russia weapons too, including missiles and attack drones.) While Officials in Canada this weekend didn’t have a clear answer on just what to do about the growing ties between the four countries that they view as an existential threat, some advice and words of caution were offered up. 'The idea of driving wedges between these two,' Shearer said, 'is fanciful.' In order to help disrupt the growing strategic partnerships, Shearer said the Western-aligned nations must 'adjust our mindsets, shift our policies and boost our defense spending and become, frankly, more assertive.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/russia-likely-to-transfer-submarine-tech-to-china-n-korea-indopacom-chief/	2024-11-23T14:58:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/GettyImages-1730511257-scaled-e1714416144291.jpg
How the DoD and partners are sharing information without compromising security	The annual Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) conference, which took place late October in Omaha, Nebraska, called out a specific theme for this year’s event: 'Integrated Deterrence through IT Superiority.' What that means in practice was a lot of discussion about how the DoD, Intelligence Agencies, Five Eyes partners and industry all need to figure out a way to break down stovepipes and share information, without compromising security. It’s a tricky line to walk, something reflected in the stories Breaking Defense reporter Carley Welch brought back from the conference.

Canada, Australia jointly pledge $474M to research hypersonic missile defense tech	Bill Blair, Minister of Defense of Canada, speaks to the press after his arrival at NATO headquarters on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Omar Havana/Getty Images) HALIFAX, CANADA — Australia and Canada have inked a new agreement to jointly work on technology to counter the ever-growing threat of missiles, especially hypersonic weapons, Canada’s Minister of National Defence Bill Blair announced today. 'I'm very pleased to announce that Canada and Australia have today signed an agreement to work together on researching emerging missile threats,' Blair told an audience during the kickoff of the Halifax International Security Forum. 'We're going to focus on countering hypersonic weapon systems and under this new agreement… [we will be] very closely tied in all of our efforts collectively together.' In total, the duo plan to spend up to $474 million over the next five years developing a 'range of solutions,' he added. While Blair didn’t drill down into the specific capabilities on the development table, a subsequent press release noted that the Defence Research and Development Canada and the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group will work together researching the emerging missile threats, to develop detection, monitoring, targeting and counter-measure technologies. Defense and political leaders from around the globe are gathered in Nova Scotia this weekend for the annual Halifax International Security Forum, Canada's premiere defense event. Among the main themes: Discussing the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East, along with potential changes to NATO as president-elect Donald Trump prepares for his return to the White House. During Trump’s first turn in office, he publicly bashed NATO countries not meeting the 2 percent GDP defense spending goal — a mark Canada does not currently hit. RELATED: America needs to keep pushing Canada on defense spending Blair used his opening speech today to praise Canada’s close relationship with its neighbor to the south and vowed to eventually meet that threshold. 'We have always depended upon that relationship [with the US] with an unparalleled alliance, especially illustrated through NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command], which is our binational military command that keeps a vigilant eye on North American airspace,' Blair said. 'NORAD defends our countries against threats in the air domain, that's why we are working in partnership with the United States to invest quite significantly in order modernization, we're making a generational investment,' he later added. Taking the stage just after Blair, two US Senators — James Risch, R-Idaho and Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire — called on Canada to get to that 2 percent spending target as quickly as possible.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/canada-australia-jointly-pledge-474m-to-research-hypersonic-missile-defense-tech/	2024-11-22T13:01:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/GettyImages-2157414961-scaled-e1719856571160.jpg
‘Plug and Play’: Army’s Project Linchpin prepares to unveil open-source architecture for AI	Army Reserve Soldiers with the 75th U.S. Army Reserve Innovation Command’s Army Applications Group and Support Group Artificial Intelligence and Data Team participate in Code-A-Thon 24, Aug. 1, 2024, at Fort Liberty, North Carolina. (Photo by Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Chlosta / 75th US Army Reserve Innovation Command) WASHINGTON — The Army’s artificial intelligence accelerator, Project Linchpin, is working with open source software firm Red Hat to unveil an initial version of its AI development architecture as early as next week, product lead Bharat Patel said. The architecture, in essence, is a set of common technical standards — Application Programming Interfaces (API), data labeling protocols, and so on — to ensure that AIs built for the Army by different vendors are all compatible. 'We are defining some of these APIs and some of these architectures with Red Hat now, [with] an open source project being dropped end of November,' Patel told the Red Hat Government Symposium here on Tuesday. 'This is going to be one of our first attempts at a public-private partnership.' By creating a level playing field for competition among innovative companies of different sizes, this 'open architecture' should allow the Army to use whichever algorithms it likes best into its suite of AI software, fully confident the different products will work together, Patel and other officials explained in public comments and interviews with Breaking Defense. 'This space moves so fast that we can't build a strategy that relies on one company or two,' Patel told the conference. 'We actually need to work on the standards that allow us to create more of a competitive architecture that people just kind of plug and play. &#8230; We want to really get after some of the non-traditional small businesses.' The problem with tapping into this rapidly expanding and evolving ecosystem of innovators is that, frankly, it’s kind of chaotic. 'It’s like the Wild, Wild West when it comes to AI right now,' Patel told Breaking Defense. 'Project Linchpin’s main focus is to be able to standardize a lot of how we deliver AI.' That chaos isn’t just in the private sector: There are plenty of ad hoc, incompatible AI efforts within the military itself. 'One of the trends we’ve seen across the Army is data is in pretty tough shape,' said Col. Chris Anderson, the Army’s product manager for Intelligence Systems &amp; Analytics, who works closely with Patel. 'It’s spread out all over the place, [and] it’s not labeled.' Such disorganized data (the polite term is 'unstructured') is difficult to do even basic analysis on, let alone train an AI algorithm. RELATED: ‘Fight tonight’ vs ‘Getting it right’: CDAO’s Martell wants to build AI to last Even when data is labeled, Anderson told Breaking Defense, the labeling may be inconsistent, idiosyncratic, or otherwise unintelligence to any human or machine beside the original users. For example, early on in Project Linchpin, 'one of the pilots that we did was in response to a real-world need in CENTCOM,' he recounted. 'A unit approached us and said, &#8216;We really need to find this specific target.' And they had a tranche of data that they had labeled, [but] that the labeled data was not very good.' Project Linchpin and a contractor spent a lot of time and effort relabeling the unit’s data so they could train an AI model to analyze it. But when they provided the trained-up model to the unit, it didn’t work properly on their computers, Anderson said, because model had been trained on machines using one type of chip (GPUs, common in the AI world) but the unit's devices used a different kind (CPUs). To bring order to this chaos of incompatible systems, 'we want to partner with industry to help define these standards,' Patel emphasized. 'We don’t want to be the government and be like, ‘Here’re our standards, you must comply.’' So step one was figuring out a common ground that different companies and the Army procurement system could all live with. 'We’ve been working really closely with ASA(ALT) [the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology] on what are the standards we are going to implement within the pipeline and how does that feed into Army-level policy,' Anderson said. 'The [Linchpin] team, they’ve done 500 one-on-one sessions with industry partners — multiple hours [apiece] — and evaluated, I think, 300 responses from industry, and the majority of those were either small businesses or non-traditionals.' 'Really early on we learned, there’s no turnkey solution, there’s no one size fits all,' Anderson said. 'It’s changing every day. &#8230; We’ve got to be able to bring in third-party applications and services quickly, we’ve got to be able to offboard them quickly when something better comes along.' At Linchpin, 'they don’t want a closed ecosystem, they don’t want black box closed-source contributors,' said Michael Zizza, who handle the Army account at Red Hat. 'They need &#8230; interoperability.' Red Hat was well suited to help develop such an architecture, Zizza told Breaking Defense, because as a vendor of open-source software, 'the code is free,' and what you’re paying Red Hat for is tech support. It’s an experienced intermediary between the chaotic creativity of the software development world and the order required by large corporations and government agencies. Project Linchpin originally contracted with both Red Hat and consulting firm Booz Allen to 'flesh out' the guiding principles behind the architecture, Patel told Breaking Defense. (In software development jargon, the final version of those principles is Traceability, Observability, Orchestration, Replaceability and automated Consumption, TOORC). From there, Patel said, Linchpin worked through the Army Research laboratory to set up a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Red Hat, which the firm announced last month. 'We’re kind of in the early stages now,' Zizza said, 'but we’re looking at specific things like architecture diagrams [and] an open API specification.'

Sweden to fund Ukrainian domestic production of long-range missiles, drones	Rustem Umerov, (C-L) Minister of Defense of Ukraine, greets Pål Jonson (C-R), Minister of Defense of Sweden before the start of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting at the NATO Headquarters on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Omar Havana/Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — The Swedish government today announced it will provide 'substantial funding' for the mass production of long-range missiles and drones inside Ukraine, a major step as Stockholm seeks to bolster Kyiv’s defensive efforts. Dollars and timelines were not revealed during the announcement, made today by Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson as he hosted his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. But the move shows that Stockholm is dedicated to supporting Ukraine for the long-haul. 'This will be produced in Ukraine by the Ukrainian defense industry. It will be financed by Sweden. President [Vladimir] Zelenskyy has stated that there is an especially high demand for funding long-range weapons and long-range drones,' Jonson said at a press briefing Friday at Karlsberg Palace in Solna. 'Ukraine is Sweden's number one security priority,' Jonson stated. He later underlined that Ukraine has 'the full right' in accordance with international law to defend itself 'inside and outside' of its territory. As of Oct. 4, Sweden has donated military assistance worth approximately 48.4 billion Swedish krona ($4.37 billion), per a government fact sheet. Stockholm has previously pledged a commitment of 25 billion Swedish krona ($2.28 billion USD) for 2025 and the same amount for 2026, numbers the government here has said could go up if needed. 'We're glad that we can further develop both your capability to produce long-range missiles and also long-range strike approach,' Jonson said, addressing Umerov. RELATED: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing &#8216;window' to prepare for Russia According to Jonson, the two ministers on Thursday met representatives from the Swedish Defense Research Agency (FOI) and Sweden's procurement agency (FMV). And 'later today [Friday] we're going to be having discussions with several representatives of the Swedish Defense Industry.' A government spokesperson declined to give details on what kind of long-range missiles will be considered for this effort. Decisions will be made in consultation with Ukraine, as they have several different projects they are working on. The spokesperson also declined to further comment on which companies the ministers were meeting with. Saab, Sweden’s defense champion, gave no further clue. 'At this point it is too soon to speculate and we refer further questions about how Sweden might support Ukraine’s long range missile capability to the Swedish Government. Generally speaking, we are always ready for discussions with Sweden and our other customers on how we can support their needs with our knowledge and expertise,' Saab spokesperson Mattias Rådström wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. Sweden has previously donated an Erieye platform, Saab’s Airborne Early Warning and Control System to Ukraine. Ukrainian pilots also have been trained on Saab’s Gripen fighters, and while the government says it is ready to begin giving Ukraine those jets, Jonson indicated that they have not done so at the behest of other allies. 'The donation of the Gripens is not in the hands of ourselves,' Jonson said, with other actors in the Air Force Coalition, predominantly Denmark, Netherlands and the United States, wanting to make sure Ukraine is settled with the F-16 before introducing other complex technologies into the ecosystem. 'They have advised us to wait to donate the Gripen until it goes further with the F-16 as well,' Jonson said. 'So now our focus has been on delivering the Erieye platform, which is the command and control platform that [works with] the F-16.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/sweden-to-fund-ukrainian-domestic-production-of-long-range-missiles-drones/	2024-11-22T11:13:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/pal-jonson-umerov-scaled-e1732302009113.jpg
For air superiority, USAF must pursue effective, rather than ‘affordable,’ mass	An F-22 Raptor takes off for a training mission at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii.

Alexander Martinez/Released) Constrained for funds and facing rapidly improving potential adversaries, the US Air Force (USAF) is grappling with how to ensure control of the air in the 2030s. One proposal — leaning heavily on standoff forces to provide 'affordable' mass without traditional air superiority — has a problem: even with long-range kill chains, exquisite smart weapons, and low-cost swarms, no one has specifically described how such novel ideas would lead to victory. As the USAF considers difficult standoff versus stand-in decisions and what future control of the air might entail, the debate must return to a critical focus: how to produce effective mass. Arguments over whether air superiority is necessary overlook a critical point: In a hypothetical defense against an invading adversary, the USAF might win with standoff-centric theories of victory, if they solve the effective mass calculus. However, with air superiority, the odds of victory increase drastically. The terms 'stand-in' and 'standoff' forces are popular among USAF planners but do not exist in USAF or Department of Defense doctrine. Generally speaking — although there is some important nuance for stealth capabilities — stand-in forces achieve effective mass and strike within contested areas via organic firing methods; for example, F-15E Strike Eagles employing weapons on self-generated coordinates. Standoff forces employ long-range weapons from aircraft outside notional enemy engagement zones; for instance, a bomber launching a Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile reliant on more complicated kill chains. 'Effective mass' embraces Col. John Boyd’s dictum to operate 'at a faster tempo or rhythm' than its adversaries. Traditionally, effective mass in the USAF translates to air superiority, which theorists generally define as the air control necessary for freedom of maneuver in support of striking varying target sets. In the modern era, fighting for air superiority is fundamental to historical examples of victory: success is most likely when leaders prepare their forces for complex challenges in the name of soundly defeating an adversary. The connection between stand-in forces and effective mass is meaningful because, traditionally, the former enables the latter. Stand-in forces with air superiority provide control of the air, support to ground elements, and short kill chains against mobile and deceptive adversaries. If the USAF is to succeed in a major conflict, it must not mistake affordable mass for effective mass. Of course, affordable mass is good to have. But, a standoff-centric approach has five significant issues. First, a standoff-centric approach might play into adversary capabilities and potential plans, as an opponent must only dodge or defeat a finite number of cruise missiles and drones. A 'hellscape' might be an adversary-specific hedge, but how long could such efforts delay a dedicated air, ground, and sea invasion supported by a rolling barrage? It is easy to imagine that standoff weapons provide mass, but the bar for delivering effective mass against mobile targets within protected airspace is quite high. Without a viable stand-in partner, standoff tactics comply with adversary strategies to push US forces farther from the battlefield, forcing the Air Force to reconsider its approach to air superiority and the fundamentals of basing. We do not discount the difficulties of penetrating modern anti-access, area-denial systems or claim that standoff, drone, or denial-based efforts might not be effective in specific contexts. However, given the inherent difficulties of interwar decisions, have planners explored how many options an aggressing adversary would have against pulsed operations employing standoff-centric tactics? Second, if the USAF depends on standoff-centric tactics and abandons air superiority, it is taking an ambitious leap away from historical lessons learned. Drones and other novel capabilities add to the complexity of modern warfare, but they are not a replacement for the capabilities enjoyed by a stand-in force ensuring even limited control of the air over a battlefield. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven unmanned platforms are an intriguing option, but they have no history of battlefield success and are likely unavailable near-term. The USAF has attempted to start the transition to more unmanned platforms before, but seeking to define affordable mass in terms of lower risk is an inherent admission that stand-in benefits are still necessary. If the technology is not immediately available, the USAF cannot afford to gamble its entire future on it. Third, creating an effective deterrent, always a tenuous concept at best, is much more difficult when you’re relying primarily on stand-off systems. The uneven effects of standoff munitions in Israel and Ukraine underscore the reality that such tactics are enabling and not decisive. Additionally, the United States rarely, if ever, fights the war it expects under predictable circumstances. It is certainly possible that, for example, a war with China might break out under the assumptions inherent in making it the 'pacing threat,' but it is equally likely that a situation requiring immediate stand-in forces — whether it be a deeply buried strategic target or something akin to the defense of Israel — will arise. Fourth, a standoff-centered force reduces the political means available to leaders attempting to manage escalation. Designing a force capable of winning with the least risk is laudable, but significant wars rarely finish within the realm of their original ends, if those means were ever straightforward in the first place. The longer a conflict endures, the more likely the Air Force will run short of standoff weapons or face demands for results only stand-in forces can provide. Compromising on funding the latter in the short-term might have devastating consequences and reduce national leader decision space should they demand higher risks in exchange for better results, i.e., striking at the heart of the enemy. Finally, a force designed primarily to prevent losses will be brittle and unthreatening to anti-access and area-denial defenses, as stand-in effects are a critical part of attrition when fighting adversaries capable of producing overwhelming mass on their home turf. The key to countering such advantages is not outproducing adversaries — the US industrial base will not allow it in an interwar period — but lies in procuring survivable and lethal stand-in assets capable of effectively fighting attritional conflicts from vigorously defended positions. Such investments would make a traditional theory of victory viable: effective mass with increasing levels of control of the air via a combination of risk-acceptable stand-in and standoff forces prevents an adversary’s fait accompli and attrits enemy advantages in mass over time. This is how the USAF could realistically attack adversary advantages and prove via Lanchester-type calculations a viable theory of victory. The obvious counter to an appeal for stand-in capabilities and air superiority is that pursuing traditional theories of victory is impossible, given modern peer capabilities. We are not arguing that success will be easy, even with advanced stealth capabilities and the most exquisite space and cyber programs. However, cultural shifts and a nuanced acquisition plan would allow the Air Force to embrace tactical creativity and determine what would be necessary to transition from pulsed operations to persistent efforts in a long campaign or press towards preventing a fait accompli at all reasonable costs, should political circumstances demand so. A balanced force that prioritizes effective mass over affordable mass and always pursues some version of control of the air via stand-in capabilities is key. Lt. Col.

Boeing inks contracts worth more than $4B for KC-46s, P-8s	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon this week awarded Boeing a pair of separate contracts for 15 KC-46A Pegasus tankers and seven P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, deals that are collectively worth more than $4 billion. Although both contracts had been expected under existing plans, getting the deals signed is good news for Boeing, whose defense arm logged $2 billion in losses for its last fiscal quarter and which is facing company-wide layoffs. The P-8A deal is valued at $1.67 billion and includes non-recurring engineering work for foreign military sales made to Canada and Germany. It will bring the number of P-8As on contract up to 207, 135 of which are for the US Navy. Australia, India, the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Germany and Canada all fly the maritime surveillance aircraft, which has played an integral part in experimentation done at the behest of the AUKUS trilateral security pact. 'This $1.67 billion undefinitized contract for seven additional P-8A Poseidons not only reinforces the U.S. Navy’s commitment to maintaining a robust maritime presence but also highlights Boeing's dedication to delivering safe, reliable platforms that enhance the Navy’s operational capabilities, readiness and effectiveness,' Tory Peterson, vice president and P-8 program manager at Boeing. 'We look forward to delivering these additional P-8A maritime patrol aircraft to ensure the continued safety and security of our nation and allies.' The KC-46A deal is valued at $2.38 billion and includes 15 additional planes for the US Air Force. The new deal brings the number of planes on contract up to 168, according to a Boeing statement. The company to date has delivered 89 KC-46As to the US Air Force as well as four to Japan. RELATED: Boeing Machinists Vote To End Strike, Putting KC-46, P-8 Programs Back On Track The State Department previously cleared Japan to purchase up to nine KC-46 tankers for its air force in a deal valued at a $4.1 billion. If the Japanese proceed with that deal, it would more than double its current fleet, which is currently set to eventually reach six planes. Israel is also under contract on the tanker, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns over the last decade.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/boeing-inks-contracts-worth-more-than-4b-for-kc-46s-p-8s/	2024-11-22T09:09:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
After watching Ukraine, Central Asian nations ‘turning away’ from Russia for arms: US officials	The Kazakhstan National Defense University welcomed then-Lt. Gen. Michael Garrett, the commander of US Army Central, as its guest speaker Dec. 13, 2016, in the capital city of Astana. (US Army photo by Sgt. Brandon Hubbard) WASHINGTON — The war in Ukraine has prompted 'introspection' among Central Asian nations about buying military equipment mostly from Russia, and pushed them to look farther from home for arms — from Beijing all the way to Washington, according to State Department officials. 'I would argue that's not countries turning towards China; it's countries turning away from Russia,' Ambassador Donald Lu, assistant secretary at the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, said on a panel at the Center for New American Security last week. 'And they're not just looking at China, they're looking at Iran, they're looking at Europe, they're looking at the United States. They're having to go further afield because military equipment is just not available in the way that it was before the Ukraine war.' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense this week that before the Kremlin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Central Asian nations — Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — already had been 'diversifying away from Russia.' But the process has been hurried along not only by the strain the war has put on the pipeline for Russian equipment and parts, but by the view of Russia's experience on the battlefield. 'The second factor that has caused sort of a reexamination is all the five Central Asian nations have observed the performance of Russian equipment in Ukraine and have raised questions about how that equipment would perform in a regional conflict, should they have that requirement,' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official declined to comment on the broader political implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the region, but an analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute in May said Central Asian nations, as fellow former members of the Soviet Union, were spooked by Russia's move. 'For Russia, the invasion deeply damaged its reputation and self-appointed role as the sole security manager for the region,' reads the analysis, written by Robert Hamilton, head of research at the FPRI's Eurasia Program. 'Given what the Central Asian governments, especially Kazakhstan, have seen in Ukraine regional states, they view Moscow’s motives with deep suspicion and have lost considerable faith in its military capabilities.' Central Asia is not a large defense market. The combined military expenditure for Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan in 2023 was approximately $1.84 billion, according to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, by far the lowest expenditure by region that SIPRI tracked. (Figures for Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were not available.) For comparison, the next closet regional expenditure, from Central America and the Caribbean, was approximately $14.7 billion. But the nations sit at a key geostrategic crossroads, with Russia immediately to the north, China to the east and Iran and Afghanistan to the south. Since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the region has become an even more important player in the realm of counterterrorism, according to the State Department official. 'So it is one part of the world where you do get a lot of these strategic competitors kind of working in a similar place,' the official said. The FPRI analysis notes that China has been a prime beneficiary of Central Asia's slow pull away from Russia, and Beijing has offered attractive economic packages as well as arms deals to draw them closer. But it also notes that Turkey has a presence in defense sales as well, especially when it comes to drone sales, according to SIPRI data. As Breaking Defense has reported, Ankara has been aggressively expanding its military export portfolio in recent years. Turkey 'frankly, [has] a share that is sizeable and growing,' the official added. The State Department official didn't expound on Lu's reference to Iran, and the SIPRI database makes scant mention of public Iranian exports to the region. But Breaking Defense has reported that global interest in Tehran's indigenous, relatively cheap unmanned aerial vehicles, used in mass in Ukraine by Russia, has only grown since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict. In 2022, Iran publicly inaugurated a drone manufacturing facility in Tajikistan. As for the US, the State Department official said Washington has seen a 'very high level' of interest in American-made defense products, platforms and services, but 'there's a couple of limiting factors there.' 'As you can imagine, expense is one of those,' the official said. 'Our defense articles and services are fairly advanced, right?' And, therefore, tend to be expensive. Relatedly, there are 'tech release' issues, as the US is cautious when it comes to handing over high-tech equipment, presumably especially to nations that have such historically close ties to Russia and China. Coming information-sharing agreements, the official said, could help with that particular obstacle. 'So we do see that we need to balance sometimes US protection of our tech against where we're going to be able to release those things. The Central Asians, though, are again very interested in our particular products; it's really just a matter of making a good match,' the official said. As such, the official said it's unlikely that big ticket items, like fighter jets, will be part of any deals any time soon. (One of the only announcements about major US Foreign Military Sales to the region on the website for the Defense Cooperation Security Agency, for instance, was a 2020 notice that the US had approved a potential $128 million deal with Kazakhstan for airborne ISR systems.) The official said what the US has seen, instead, are very precise requests, 'the sort of smaller capabilities that tend to fill niches they have.' 'So it will be things like, &#8216;I need a UAV with a 20-kilometer range, with some amount of loiter time that can do X, Y and Z,' the official said. 'Or I need an over-the-horizon radar, which will pick up the following kind of targets. 'I say that as an example that they're fairly sophisticated, or at least clear-eyed, about what they're looking for from us,' the official said. Another 'great place to start,' the official said, is small arms and ammunition — a lower-profile but ubiquitous military need that Central Asian nations have expressed interest in having the US fill. 'And we find that pretty significant because &#8230; these countries have been firing Russian caliber ammunition forever and ever,' the official said. 'But they look at the US small arms inventory and think, &#8216;I want to get to that; I want to get over to that capability.'' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense that Central Asian nations have also expressed interest in boutique equipment used by American special operations forces — sometimes after witnessing the equipment in action during joint training exercises. 'But yea we certainly see working ourselves up the ladder to bigger systems, to more capable systems,' the first official said. 'This is one of the way that we connect with countries around the world,' that official said. 'It's perhaps magnified in Central Asia because of the competition that's happening in the region.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-watching-ukraine-central-asian-nations-turning-away-from-russia-for-arms-us-officials/	2024-11-22T08:20:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_kazakhstan_armored_vehicle_3077375-scaled-e1732128967704.jpg
