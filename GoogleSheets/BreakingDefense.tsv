Army halted weapon development and pushed tech to soldiers faster: 2024 in review	An antenna farm is set up away from soldiers inside the command post. (Breaking Defense/ Ashley Roque) WASHINGTON — In what has turned out as Army Secretary Christine Wormuth's fourth and final year as the service’s top civilian leader and Gen. Randy George’s first full year as chief of staff, the duo shed high-profile modernization programs, revamped others and pushed tech down to soldiers at a faster clip. Wormuth, slated to wave goodbye to her post as the 25th secretary of the Army in January 2025, largely spent her tenure keeping the service’s high-profile modernization portfolio intact. This year, though, the axe fell on several initiatives starting with the early February aviation shakeup that ended development on the next generation Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), kept General Electric’s Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) in the development phase longer, and shelved legacy Shadow and Raven unmanned aerial systems. 'We are learning from the battlefield — especially Ukraine — that aerial reconnaissance has fundamentally changed,' Army Chief Gen. Randy George said in a press release at the time. 'Sensors and weapons mounted on a variety of unmanned systems and in space are more ubiquitous, further reaching and more inexpensive than ever before.' In turn, the service is planning to spend dollars freed up by those decisions to ink a multi-year procurement deal with Lockheed-Sikorsky for the UH-60M Blackhawk line, give Boeing the greenlight to formally begin production on the CH-47F Block II Chinook, buy new drones and more. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The axe officially dropped on another big-ticket development effort just a few weeks later when the Army unfurled its fiscal 2025 budget request: It was halting development on its Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) platform. The goal was to use the modified artillery platform to launch 155-mm rounds out to 70km, an increase from the current max range of up to 30km. But after spending several years integrating and testing out the addition of a 30-foot, 58-caliber gun tube to BAE Systems’ Paladin M109A7 self-propelled howitzer, it was not working out as planned. However, the requirement for such a weapon remains and the service subsequently announced it has selected five companies — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems — to demo their existing platforms on a roadshow of sorts. In early December, the director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team, Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, said those early evaluations should be completed by month's end. And, he added, so far so good, with early findings indicating that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation,' which means the service may decide not to delve into another lengthy development phase. 'We're very pleased with what we're seeing so far, and even some on the autonomy side,' the one-star general told an audience Dec. 3. Eyeing soldiers' kit, the service also spent part of the year preparing industry for a possible shake up to its portfolio of night vision devices including the mixed-reality goggles dubbed the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, for example, were tasked with running Microsoft’s most advanced mixed-reality system, IVAS version 1.2, through the ringer alongside dedicated night vision systems like the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENGV-B) and another system dubbed PVS-14. 'They’re going to provide the best feedback in terms of, here’s what the ENGV-B can provide versus a PVS-14 versus the capability inside of IVAS,' an Army official told Breaking Defense. The goal is for those Rangers to provide a 'more mature look' at how they use night vision while also answering questions about the ideal IVAS form factor, battery needs and more. Those answers are expected to help Army leaders decide the best pair up specific night vision devices with units and define IVAS Next requirements for an upcoming competition. George announced plans to expand his keystone inactive beyond infantry under a 2.0 push. The plan, he said, expands the bottom-up approach to two divisions, two Armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and reserve and guard formations. The service started with the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, 2nd Light Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division and 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Next year, it will be expanded beyond infantry under a 2.0 push and will include two divisions, two Armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and reserve and guard formations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-halted-weapon-development-and-pushed-tech-to-soldiers-faster-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T11:34:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/antenna-farm-scaled-e1724767823161.jpg
Space Force gets loud and proud about warfighting role: 2024 in review	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman addressed the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 6, 2024. (Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — Over the past year, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has issued a series of internal 'Commander's Notes' that have sought to create the culture and operational concepts for the newest military service, with a firm focus on the Space Force's warfighting role. It's clear that as 2024 comes to a close and the Space Force celebrates its fifth birthday, what one observer called 'chest-thumping rhetoric' clearly has entered into the public domain — a change that defined how the service went about its public and private posturing over the last year. Saltzman spent most of this year charging up the forces to think of themselves not as support specialists, but as frontline capabilities — or, as he told Guardians assembled at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 10, 'You are warfighters, whether you carry a gun or not.' [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 'In accordance with the law and at the direction of the president, you are trained and expected to carry out offensive and defensive actions against military forces of other countries, or support other military elements that do. When you're in a combat squadron, you're the first line of defense for conflict in space and your actions directly impact lives on the ground, in and out of harm's way.' In conjunction with this culture setting, top brass from Saltzman on down have become ever-more open about the service's plans and classified offensive capabilities to take out Chinese and Russian satellites on orbit in any future conflict — whether the mission be to defend American military and commercial satellites or to attack enemy birds being used to target US terrestrial forces. Saltzman told the Spacepower conference that 'space control' in now the Space Force's top priority because adversaries 'will absolutely try to disrupt, degrade and destroy US capabilities. This is unacceptable. In short, what we have, we will fight to keep.' Further, he stressed that China in particular 'can and will use their space capability to hold the joint and combined force at risk,' thus making it imperative that the Space Force be trained and equipped 'to make sure that doesn't happen.' Space Force Gen. Stephen Whiting, who commands US Space Command, told reporters on Dec. 11 that 'space fires is our number one Integrated Priority List gap.' The Integrated Priorities List is an annual compendium of requirements put together by each combatant command to inform the military services of their operational needs to be included in budget an acquisition plans. Whiting explained 'fires are defined in joint doctrine as the ability to affect or influence targets, and those could be targets in any domain that support the space mission. &#8230; If we are trying to achieve space superiority, there are targets that need to be influenced — in the cyber realm, in the terrestrial realm, [and] in space.' Lt. Gen. Douglas Schiess, who commands the Space Force's component for providing trained operators to SPACECOM called Space Forces-Space, told reporters on Dec. 11 that his first priority is 'to protect the joint warfighter from space-enabled attack, and secondly, to defend our assets and our allies' assets from attack from someone else.' To do this, he added, operators need 'effectors that can negate' adversary space capabilities. The loud new messaging moves away from the Pentagon's traditional silence on space warfighting plans — with the traditional focus on support services to the joint force such as communications and positioning, navigation and timing. Speaking to reporters after his Spacepower presentation, Saltzman said that in the past the Defense Department kept information about 'offensive and defensive' space capabilities 'close to the vest' — asserting that some of the rationale was 'just kind of hand-wringing' rather than a need to 'protect' anything. 'We have to conduct counter space operations to deny an adversary the ability to target our forces,' he said, and that requires 'offensive and defensive capabilities. &#8230; I have no problem saying that we are gonna be ready to contest the space domain,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-gets-loud-and-proud-about-warfighting-role-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T09:58:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/RS_20241210_0067-151-scaled-e1734122255777.jpg
A year of next-gen fighter doubts for the Air Force: 2024 in review	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — After years of development, the Air Force broke cover on its futuristic stealth fighter in May 2023 to announce that a winner would be picked to build the platform in 2024, teeing up the highly anticipated next generation of airpower. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The trouble started this summer, when whispers about NGAD’s fate first started swirling around Washington. Budget constraints bearing down on the Air Force — thanks to high-profile headaches like cost overruns with the nuclear-tipped Sentinel ballistic missile and pricey new programs like the B-21 Raider — began to exact their toll as the service built out its fiscal 2026 budget. In June, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin appeared to suggest NGAD was in hot water, equivocating when asked whether the service could commit to the program. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall subsequently confirmed the stealth fighter program was on pause, and bowing to the obvious, the service announced this month that the 'way ahead' for the program would officially be decided by the Trump administration. The service’s own capabilities have also rapidly evolved, featuring tech like space-based ISR and comms, drone wingmen dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) and a budding 'kill web' that threads together disparate sensors, weapons and shooters to neutralize a threat. Any NGAD fighter is 'going to need to work with CCAs. It’s going to need to work in an architecture which includes space-based support and other off-board support and an architecture that uses our most advanced weapons,' Kendall said in July. 'So we’ve got an opportunity here to really just be careful and make sure we’re on the right path before we make the final commitment.' The NGAD challenge also lies in unforgiving geography. Should American troops clash with the PLA, particularly over the Taiwan Strait, Chinese forces would enjoy a significant homefield advantage. Beijing’s burgeoning missile arsenal further threatens to lay waste to critical American installations in the region, which includes aircraft that could be caught in the crossfire while parked on the ground — creating a rift between the Air Force and Army on air base defense. 'The infrastructure that’s required to support an F-22 class aircraft, if you will, leads to some vulnerabilities. Runway length, for example,' Kendall previously told Breaking Defense. The same is true for engine-makers GE Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney, who are separately competing to build the NGAD fighter’s powerplant. After the Air Force passed on re-engining the F-35, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion effort, the program name for the NGAD engine, appears to be the only avenue left to carry revolutionary, 'adaptive' powerplant technologies forward. Ironically, the Air Force’s NGAD pause could very well prompt the Navy to go first on a different next-gen fighter. While the Air Force wrestles with its sixth-gen design, a Navy official previously told Aviation Week the sea-based service remains confident in its plans, and is still on track to award an engineering and manufacturing development contract by the end of fiscal 2025 for its own future airframe. Though all this, Kendall has maintained he's confident an NGAD fighter, in some form, will be built. And to that end, internal Air Force analysis now supports the development of a manned, next-gen platform, Breaking Defense previously reported. But a new administration will take over in January, where 'Department of Government Efficiency' co-leads Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have both called into question current fighter procurement efforts. What the Trump administration will do is unclear, though if history is any guide, manned fighter jets may be here to stay for at least one more generation. Like the flying car, the death of the manned fighter has been predicted for decades, but neither have come to pass.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/a-year-of-next-gen-fighter-doubts-for-the-air-force-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T07:58:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
Tensions between Navy and industry in the spotlight: 2024 in review	Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, crosses the walkway of guided-missile destroyer USS Preble (DDG 88) following a tour of the ship, Feb. 16. Preble is an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer homeported in San Diego. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Olivia Rucker) WASHINGTON — In 2024, the US Navy’s frustrations with its industrial base were on public display. Whether those frustrations were justified depends on who you ask. I've been watching the US Navy and industry interact with one another since 2017. My view is limited to what happens in open forums, granted, but nonetheless, it represents the same view the rest of the public has. What one quickly realizes as one follows admirals and secretaries around from conference to conference is that the visible relationship between industry and military is typically sterilized. There's a lot of talk about partnerships and camaraderie, patriotism and love for America, an ingrained sense of service to country. I bring all that up to juxtapose it with what we saw this year. Acquisition executive Nickolas Guertin published a one-page document outlining the severe delays of each major shipbuilding program and highlighting their associated prime contractors. Uniformed commanders publicly voiced their frustrations about industry's production cadence for munitions. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] And Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro on multiple occasions tore into industry for what he said were excessive stock buy backs and industry's failure to re-invest in their own facilities. He chastised American shipbuilders for, in his view, failing to rise to the occasion in the way South Korean and Japanese industries have done in their own quests to compete with China. In one notable speech, Del Toro mentioned the possibility of personnel misconduct on industry’s part and previewed an office that will go after those individuals. To be clear, I do not think there is anything wrong with the Navy expecting its contractors to act ethically and follow the law. But I do find it odd that Del Toro — the service's civilian leader handpicked by the president — would raise that subject voluntarily to a friendly audience in a Navy-centric city like San Diego. When I asked Del Toro about his posture towards industry during this year's Sea Air Space Exposition, he told me the broader message he was trying to send was one about industry respecting the investment taxpayers have been making into the industrial base. 'It takes a team effort and the American taxpayers are making enormous investments in the industrial base,' he said at the time. 'I need industry to make the proper capital investments themselves. And if you take a look at the major primes in this country, for example, that work in the defense industry, about a third of them are putting enormous buybacks into their own stocks. That prevents basically the utilization of those monies to be able to recapitalize those industries to try to get us to a better place. So that's what I'm saying. Everybody's got to do their part, and we expect industry to do their part as well.' I should note that in the latter half of the year the secretary noticeably toned down his criticisms of industry in public forums. Nevertheless, when I've asked executives about Del Toro's prodding, they usually respond with shrugs. No one wants to get into a public shouting match with their customer and, at the end of the day, it's not Del Toro sitting on the other side of the table when contracts are negotiated, written and signed. The backdrop to all of this has been a US Navy under as much pressure as its ever been in modern history. The October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in American destroyers seeing more action than they have in years. That in turn has led to increased pressure both on munitions production and the maintenance requirements for the fleet. The service has infamously struggled with the ship maintenance required to upkeep a blue water navy even in peacetime — rotating carrier strike groups to the Middle East to aid Israel only added to that pressure. While Del Toro will ultimately leave office by Jan. 20, the munitions shortages, the ship maintenance backlogs and the increasingly higher operational tempo the Navy has had to adjust to will likely all follow the service well into 2025 — and perhaps beyond.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/tensions-between-navy-and-industry-in-the-spotlight-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T06:02:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/8244067-scaled-e1712070593740.jpg
We fed every 2024 Pentagon briefing into ChatGPT. Here’s what it thought.	WASHINGTON -Tech. Sgt. Bryan Scharman, Non-commissioned Officer In Charge of Cyber Support of the 151st Communications Flight in the Utah National Guard, works on setting up communications between supported agencies during the 58th Presidential Inauguration. (National Guard photo by Tech. Jonathan Young, JTF-DC) MOBILE, Ala. — If 2023 was the year that OpenAI's ChatGPT exploded onto the public scene, 2024 was the year the US military and Intelligence Community began carefully wading into the potential of generative AI. Officials have said that kind of tech could be used for everything from streamlining acquisition to sifting through a mountain of open source data for relatively low-level intelligence analysis. And while the Pentagon has grown to trust generative AI enough to build a new 'cell' around it's use, many officials are still cautious because the cutting edge technology is not without its risks, especially its propensity to 'hallucinate' false information. Echoing many other officials this year, Jimmy Hall, chief information officer in the State Department's intelligence wing, said last week, 'We want to be able to use a gen AI,' but the office is 'just not ready.' 'As we step our way through, we don't want to be so quick to the trigger that we put our situation where civil liberties or privacy or something else is violated,' Hall said in a webinar put on by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. 'So we're really behind the scenes testing a few items, mechanisms, systems, tools, before we're ready to roll that out. But we do want to take advantage of emerging technology.' So while generative AIs may not be fully ready for prime time in many ways, the fact that the US security establishment is eagerly pursuing use cases makes it worthy of some of our own experimentation. As such, below is an end-of-year interview with ChatGPT, which has been armed with a document compiled by Breaking Defense containing every Pentagon transcript posted on Defense.gov since Jan. 1, 2024 up to the middle of last week. This interview was conducted with the less robust, free version of ChatGPT, GPT-4o mini, and the application has been directed to keep its answers shorter than usual. The following transcript has been slightly edited and additional context has been added in Editor's Notes. Breaking Defense: What was the biggest development in the world of defense in 2024? ChatGPT: The biggest development in defense in 2024 was the launch and execution of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational coalition effort involving over 22 nations to secure vital shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden from escalating Houthi attacks, supported by Iran. This operation demonstrated a significant shift towards proactive, collective international defense strategies, leveraging advanced technologies and persistent presence to ensure maritime security and economic stability. [Editor's Note: This is a bit of a curious answer. While Prosperity Guardian and its parallel European counterpart Operation Aspides are certainly potent international security collaborations, 2024 saw several arguably more significant developments in the Middle East region alone, from the killing of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah to the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.] Ensign Hunter Riportella relays information from the bridge aboard the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Mason (DDG 87) during a vertical replenishment with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) while the ships operate in support of Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) in the Red Sea, Jan. 8, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Chris Krucke) How did US policy change toward Ukraine in 2024, if at all? In 2024, U.S. policy toward Ukraine remained consistent in its commitment to supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression, with continued delivery of advanced weapons systems and training for Ukrainian pilots, including on F-16 fighter jets. However, the policy faced challenges due to depleted replenishment funds for military aid, underscoring the need for congressional approval of supplemental funding to sustain assistance levels. [Editor's Note: Yup, pretty much, even if the US and Europe have apparently run out of Ukrainian pilots to train on the F-16. What Congress will do with regard to Ukraine aid under the incoming Trump administration is another question entirely.] What are the Pentagon's top concerns as it relates to the future of Syria? The Pentagon's top concerns regarding the future of Syria include the persistent threat posed by Iranian-backed proxies, such as Harakat al-Nujaba, which continue to target U.S. forces in the region, and the destabilizing influence of actors like Iran and other extremist groups. Ensuring the safety of U.S. forces and maintaining the fight against ISIS to prevent its resurgence remain critical priorities, while managing broader regional dynamics and avoiding escalation with Iran. [Editor's Note: Here, ChatGPT's answer is consistent with fears officials have publicly expressed, though the particular mention of Harakat al-Nujaba is a bit unusual. The Pentagon announced it had killed a leader of that group back in January 2024, but has made little mention of it since in official transcripts, and media reporting does not appear to have identified the group as a specific concern currently.] Fighters walk in the Syrian presidential palace in Damascus' Mount Qasyoun on December 8, 2024, after Islamist-led rebels declared that they have taken the Syrian capital in a lightning offensive, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria. (Photo by OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP via Getty Images) In 2024, what were the Pentagon's top priorities in the Indo-Pacific region? The Pentagon's top priorities in the Indo-Pacific region in 2024 included ensuring regional security and stability through extended deterrence and collaboration with allies, particularly in the face of threats from China and North Korea. Efforts focused on mitigating risks of conflict over Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula while maintaining strong defense partnerships to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific. [Editor's Note: That does about sum it up, especially the focus on international partnerships in the region, which has been a top priority for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.] What was the Defense Department's biggest mistake in 2024? The Defense Department's biggest mistake in 2024 was the delayed notification and lack of transparency regarding Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hospitalization and the temporary transfer of certain operational authorities. This lapse highlighted weaknesses in communication protocols, prompting internal reviews to improve procedures and ensure timely dissemination of critical information to senior officials and the public. [Editor's Note: There's a necessary reminder here that ChatGPT is answering based on Pentagon transcripts, and the fervor around Austin's secret January hospitalization required several days of cleanup from the Pentagon public affairs office — hence the emphasis from the generative AI. Arguably the DoD made bigger, or at least more impactful mistakes in 2024, whether it was related to troubled weapons programs or broader defense policy, but officials tend to be more circumspect about those kinds of calls.]	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/we-fed-every-2024-pentagon-briefing-into-chatgpt-heres-what-it-thought/	2024-12-26T12:38:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241220_DVIDS_computer_DC_3148118-scaled-e1734712089434.jpg
Everything comes down to Ukraine: 5 stories from Europe in 2024	South Koreans watch a television broadcast reporting the North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin (Getty Images) BELFAST — The war in Ukraine surpassed the 1,000 day mark earlier this year and continues on with slow Russian advances amid growing uncertainty in Europe that a new US administration under Donald Trump could end desperately needed military aid to Kyiv or result in a peace deal of greater, long-term strategic value to Moscow. Of all that happened during the conflict in the last 12 months, the deployment of North Korean troops to the Russian border territory of Kursk stands out from the pack. The move itself was officially confirmed by Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General in October, after he held a North Atlantic Council meeting with South Korea’s National Intelligence Service and its Ministry of National Defense. It will be of no surprise to readers then that events from, or linked to, the war dominate our picks for the top European stories from 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘Growing desperation’? NATO chief confirms North Korean troops deployed to help Russia in Kursk Rutte defined the deployment as a 'significant escalation' of DPRK’s continued involvement in Russia’s 'illegal war' against Ukraine, while labelling it as a further 'breach' of UN Security Council resolutions. Soon after, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, echoed NATO's appraisal, as she shared that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been sent to 'train in eastern Russia [and] will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks.' 2. Sweden officially joins NATO as 32nd alliance member Forced to wait longer than Nordic counterpart Finland, Sweden finally joined NATO in March. Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg took to social media to mark the occasion. 'It’s official – #Sweden is now the 32nd member of #NATO, taking its rightful place at our table,' he shared. 'Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer, and the whole Alliance more secure.' The addition of Sweden notably increases alliance capabilities across the High North and Baltic Sea, while serving as a counterweight to Russian threats in the two strategically pivotal regions. Stockholm boasts formidable air, land and sea prowess shaped by multirole Gripen fighter jets and Gotland-class diesel-electric attack submarines. 3. Why Germany’s Scholz won’t follow Biden on long-range strikes for Ukraine After months of resistance, the US ended its opposition to Ukraine firing Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia for the first time in November. The UK soon followed suit, overturning a hold on Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles. France, which refers to the weapon as SCALP, has also supplied a number of units to Kyiv. Similar to the lift on long range strikes by the US and UK, French President Emmanuel Macron said, 'there’s no red line on this.' Germany, on the other hand, stood out from the crowd, refusing to change course. Analysts that spoke with Breaking Defense about the matter said that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was potentially holding out on the supply of Taurus long-range precision missiles in a bid to protect his political career and argued that he has limited clout over Russia. 4. French defense minister attacks industry over production rates, threatens requisitioning In March, France’s Minister for the armed forces Sébastien Lecornu aired concerns around national weapons productions rates by threatening industry with the requisitioning of 'personnel, stocks or production tools' if things don't improve. And he didn't stop there. Prime manufacturers were not the only group in Lecornu's line of fire. Subcontractors could also be forced to prioritize defense customers over civilian clients if they didn't rise to the challenge, he explained. In light of demand spiking to boost weapon supplies to Ukraine, KNDS told Breaking Defense that production of 155mm artillery shells had doubled, reaching an annual rate of 60,000 units in 2024, with a target of reaching 120,000 in 2025. 5. KNDS debuts Enhanced Main Battle Tank technology demonstrator On the equipment front, European defense firm KNDS unveiled a new Enhanced Main Battle Tank (EMBT) technology demonstrator at Eurosatory in France. The vehicle offers a glimpse into the manufacturer's thinking for the Franco-German Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program, which effectively amounts to development of the continent's next generation main battle tank. As freelance writer Andrew White wrote of the EMBT, it includes an upgraded Leopard chassis with shortened engine to increase space inside the vehicle’s compartment; a new uncrewed turret, fitted with a 140mm Ascalon gun, ARX30 30mm x 113mm remote controlled weapon station; and the French Ministry of Defense’s Prometheus active protection system.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/everything-comes-down-to-ukraine-5-stories-from-europe-in-2024/	2024-12-26T10:14:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221222_putin_kim_GettyImages-1139189964-scaled-e1671728927858.jpg
The terror of war, a helo crash mystery and the business of defense: 5 Middle East stories from 2024	Smoke billows above Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike on November 26, 2024, amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. (Photo by FADEL ITANI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — This year it was nearly impossible to choose just five stories from our coverage of the Middle East in 2024, a year of brutal wars, seismic shifts in power and, for now, at least some hope for broader peace. It was a year in which stories about new technology, joint ventures and defense contracts were overshadowed by invasions and missile barrages, but that didn't mean the business of defense was stagnant, as the Saudi World Defense Show and Qatar's DIMDEX proved. So, after much consideration, here are the top five stories for 2024 from my list: [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. What life looks like in Lebanon after 1 year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel It's the task of a journalist to report impartially, including when a conflict comes to your own country. Still, that doesn't mean it's impossible to tell human stories, including in this report about what life was like on Lebanon's southern border during Israel's invasion. Most residents left the area, but some stayed, and a few told Breaking Defense what it looked and felt like to be in their homes while barrages of missiles and bombs were exchanged between Israel, Hezbollah and even Iran above their heads. The 'bombardment sounds never seem to pause. The nights are the worst,' one southerner told Breaking Defense. But life elsewhere in Lebanon, including here in Beirut, did not feel safe before November's ceasefire. 'Are we going to die tonight?' my children asked me every night while they rush into my room, awakened from their sleep, not by calls to get ready for school but from bombs. It was easy to see the black and white smoke plumes from these attacks rising above the city. 2. What a Turkish drone in the Raisi crash crisis reveals about Iran’s UAV capabilities Who would have believed that the Iranian president's helicopter would crash in fog, and that it would be a Turkish UAV to be deployed to find the crash site? That's apparently what happened in May, even if Iranian officials later denied the drone had succeeded in its mission. Either way, experts said the use of the drone and its onboard sensors revealed perhaps more than Tehran would've liked about Iran's indigenous drone capabilities — as popular as they may be. Can Kasapoglu, a Turkish defense expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said at the time he wasn’t buying Tehran’s claim. 'Iran was dwarfed by the Turkish information superiority [and] overshadowed by NATO standards,' he said. 3. Past the deadline, Western defense firms still navigating Saudi Arabia’s localization mandates Raising its domestic defense ambitions, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called on all firms to set their regional headquarters in the Kingdom by January 2024. But at the Saudi World Defense show in February this year, Breaking Defense asked executives whether they have abided by this mandate. Already past the deadline, Western firms said they were still navigating their path and ways to accommodate the mandate. They were doubly caught between a rock and a hard place, since many are already established in the United Arab Emirates, which is making a parallel localization push. Some firms got creative, while others tried to work their way around the issue and resorted to more generous interpretations of the rules. 'I don’t know if we read the [regional headquarters] request that specifically but we are working with the government to make sure that we support whatever the request turns out to be in the right way and, again, I think our interpretation may be a little bit different than you described,' Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security President and CEO Ted Colbert (who has since left the company) told Breaking Defense then. 4. Iran shows off naval guns, missiles and UAV named ‘Gaza’ at Qatari defense show As rare as it is for Iran to show it arms in a defense show abroad, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps made a surprise appearance with their armament in Qatar at Dimdex. Breaking Defense was able to speak with Iranian officials and get a close view of the systems exhibited. From a drone dubbed 'Gaza' to naval guns, radars and missile defense systems, the Iranians had an array of systems to show the world. All of the systems at the stand were developed and produced by Iran and, one official said, are open for export to any country 'except Israel and [the] US.' 5. Russian bases and Hezbollah weapons: Key questions follow fall of Syrian regime At the tail end of 2024, more than half a century of the Assad family rule in Syria came to an end. Rebels took over one city after another, reaching Damscus apparently after Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad fled to Russia. But below the surface, key questions festered about the future of Russian military bases in Syria as well as Hezbollah arms transfer routes from Iran.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-terror-of-war-a-helo-crash-mystery-and-the-business-of-defense-5-middle-east-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-26T08:23:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_israel_strike_beirut_GettyImages-2186324612-scaled-e1732647429461.jpg
Government watchdog greenlights Army’s new spy plane contract, denies L3Harris’s protest	A Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft. (Bombardier via US Army) WASHINGTON — The Army is cleared to proceed building out its new spy plane with the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), after the government watchdog agency denied L3Harris’s contract protest. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued its decision on December 23, noting that the protest is covered by a 'protective order,' and a report on the rationale behind the denial will be publicly released once it's redacted. L3Harris did not immediately respond to questions today about the new GAO decision, but the forthcoming report should shed additional light on the company's complaint into how the service awarded the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) deal. Neither the Army nor SNC immediately responded to questions from Breaking Defense about the program and if the stop work order has now been lifted. In August, the service selected SNC to convert Bombardier’s Global 6500 business jets into an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform under its HADES program. An industry team up featuring L3Harris, Leidos and MAG Aerospace had also bid on the program to replace the legacy fleet of RC-12 Guardrail turboprop aircraft. By October, L3Harris filed a protest with the GAO. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army’s debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation,' an L3Harris spokesperson said in a statement at the time. 'Our goal remains to ensure that mission operators receive the lowest risk and most capable solution available for an increasingly complex security environment.' The Army halted HADES integration work while GAO sorted through the protest, but in November it officially accepted the first business jet slated for integration during a ceremony in Wichita, Kansas. 'Once we're in a position to begin integrating the aircraft, that will be the next step … the integration of the equipment in the back,' Andrew Evans, the director of the Army’s ISR Task Force, told reporters at the time. 'The airplane itself is what we describe as the workhorse to HADES, it's what enables HADES to get in position, to collect … to have the endurance necessary to provide meaningful station time,' he added. 'But the magic of a HADES is what will happen in the back of that aircraft.' That magic includes moving target indication, high-end signals intelligence and other capabilities, possibly including launched effects. The service is also gleaning feedback from 'bridging' aerial ISR assets designed, in part, to inform HADES requirements. Those efforts included: Evans and Lt. Gen. Anthony Hale, the Army’s deputy chief of staff for intelligence, said the goal is to create commonality across those aircraft and port back lessons into the HADES design. 'Every day the enemy is working in the electromagnetic spectrum, they're utilizing EW [electronic warfare] capabilities, they're utilizing unmanned aerial system capabilities that we haven't seen before, and then they're increasing the use of new weapon systems,' the three-star general said. 'Whether it's [in] Ukraine or whether it's somewhere in Africa, our adversary is using these places as battlefields and testing areas to develop and continue to emerge technology and so … getting after what we see in one theater is going to come to another theater,' Hale later added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/government-watchdog-gives-army-greenlight-for-new-spy-plane-contract-denies-l3harriss-protest/	2024-12-26T06:51:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240103_bombardier_hades_army-e1704312802342.jpg
From Japan’s build-up to stumbles in the Lucky Country: 5 Pacific stories for 2024	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches fourth of Mogami-class frigates, Mikuma. Credit Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force SYDNEY — One of the biggest stories of the year in the Indo-Pacific was Japan casting aside the cloak of pacifism and moving to boost defense spending and actually export a major weapons system. While some of the policy planks had been laid down over the least decade, this was the year Japan really began taking concrete steps to make these a reality. The importance of the development is reflected below in this selection of five stories from Asia in 2024, plus an eyebrow-raising shakeup in the Chinese military, as well as a couple reports that look at some important moves Australia made as well. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Japanese MoD makes first appearance at foreign airshow, seeking arms exports When Breaking Defense saw the Ministry of Defense booth at the Singapore Air Show in February, the first reaction was shock : a Japanese government booth trying to sell weapons. True, it was relatively small and the companies were too, for the most part. But there were Japanese officials, some in uniform, actively courting the international press, companies ands representative of foreign governments. And they spoke with Breaking Defense and encouraged the coma[pnies to speak with media. 2. &#8216;Huge implications' as top Chinese military leader under investigation, joins 3rd defense minister While Japan was trying to do one of the things China most fears — become a serious, power-projecting regional power — China's top leadership appeared to go a bit bonkers. A senior member of the body that rules the Peoples Liberation Army, the Central Millitary Commission, was 'suspended' and the third defense minister vanished from view. In any other large military, such actions would set off global alarm bills. More than a month after the CMC member and the the most recent defense minister vanished, there is still only informed speculation as to why this is happening, but analysts agree on one thing: all does not appear well in the Chinese military. 3. Australia, Japan ink first R&amp;D trial on underwater tech Two of the US allies most closely watched by China got much closer this year. Adding to the US Marines who operate from northern Australia for six months each year, 6,600 of its service members can train each year for nine weeks, Japan will now send its marines each year to Northern Australia. In addition to the new rotational force at the beginning of the year, Australia and Japan agreed to start working together on some of the most advanced and highly classified military equipment for 'strategic capabilities in robotic and autonomous systems for undersea warfare.' 4. &#8216;Alarming' but &#8216;not surprising': Australia reportedly left with 1 operational sub amid repairs, upgrades This year cracks in the Royal Australian Navy submersible fleet started to appear, even as the country pushed to bolster both fleets in the longer term. The Collins-class fleet was virtually crippled as the government admitted it could only deploy one of the country's six ageing subs. The government declared that a second boat could put to sea if necessary and claimed the fleet was meeting its operational requirements. But the news raised basic questions about whether Australia could close the capability gap between Collins and the arrival of the first boats in the AUKUS fleet. 5. Aussie Navy to double surface fleet with $7B plan, but future funding uncertain Knowing its aging fleet of ANZAC-class destroyers and other surface assets was growing increasingly thin as a deterrent, Australia decided on a $11.1 billion AUD ($7.2 billion US) plan to double its surface fleet. A key part of that is the General Purpose Frigate program, which has been whittled down to a competition between ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems' MEKO A-200 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Mogami frigate. The MEKO-200 is an upgraded version of the ANZAC class ships. The Mogami would be Japan's first sale of a major weapon system to a foreign country.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-japans-build-up-to-stumbles-in-the-lucky-country-5-pacific-stories-for-2024/	2024-12-26T06:03:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
Space Force celebrates 5th anniversary at growing Spacepower Conference	Dec. 20, 2024 marks the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Space Force. And with America’s youngest military service hitting kindergarten age, class was in session at this year’s Spacepower Conference. The show, the second ever put on by the Space Force Association, has grown considerably since its first outing, gathering a host of senior military officials, including Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and head of US Space Command Gen. Stephen Whiting. Of course, no gathering of the space community would be complete without Breaking Defense’s own Theresa Hitchens, who went down to Orlando to cover the event. In this eBook, you’ll find a collection of Theresa’s stories, including updates on the Space Force and SPACECOM, the new tech they’re bringing to bear, as well as the myriad of challenges they face on the ground and among the stars.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-celebrates-5th-anniversary-at-growing-spacepower-conference/	2024-12-24T13:23:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Spacepower-Conference-2024-Featured-Image.png
Killer Apps: 5 stories highlight quiet progress on military AI and CJADC2	Members of the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam operate cyber systems using a Enhanced communications flyaway kit during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3 and Architect Demonstration Evaluation 5 at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July, 12, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Amy Picard) WASHINGTON — This year saw major progress in the Pentagon’s years-long push to harness artificial intelligence — not for drones or 'killer robots,' but for software tools that help staff officers bring some order to the chaos of modern conflict. From the intelligence analysis algorithms of Project Maven, the seven-year-old granddaddy of military AI tools, to the data-sharing systems collectively known as CJADC2, 2024 has seen significant expansion in both capabilities and the number of people using them for real-world operations. These unglamorous utilities matter, because the ultimate weapon is often not a weapon at all. Prussia united Germany in the 1800s in large part thanks to the superior organizational skills of its General Staff. The Nazi Panzers in 1940 didn’t outgun or outnumber their French opponents, but they had radios to coordinate mobile operations, while the French relied on landlines and signal flags. The Pentagon itself, today a byword for bureaucracy, was built in 16 months to house the massive administrative apparatus essential to running a global war. Victory, in short, doesn't go to the side with the shiniest toys, but to the organization that manages the digital grunt work most efficiently. Here's how the Pentagon applied AI to military command and control in 2024: [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. First version of all-service battle network is ‘real and ready now’: Hicks In the 21at century paper files, voice calls, and human staff are no longer enough to stay on top of fast-moving events on land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. The need to share data, intelligence, and orders rapidly across those five 'domains' drove the Department to Defense to try to develop an AI-powered system of Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control. While 'CJADC2' is still a nascent capability with many well-informed skeptics, the last 12 months saw the first pieces of it move from experiments to real-world operations. In February, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks publicly announced an initial version of CJADC2 — the 'Minimum Viable Capability,' a spin on the software industry term of 'Minimum Viable Product.' (The MVC had actually been certified as ready in December 2023, after months of urgent work, but it wasn’t announced for another three months). This version was focused on sharing information among the military’s 11 four-star operational headquarters, the Combatant Commands — but the military immediately began expanding it. 2. ‘Who should shoot who?’: INDOPACOM getting ‘combat representative’ JFN this year One of the most sought-after CJADC2 capabilities is, in essence, fire control. The US military has a large and growing arsenal of long-range weapons, from Air Force stealth bombers to Navy guided-missile subs and destroyers to new Army truck-mounted missile launchers. Traditional processes for figuring out which target is best attacked with which weapon, like the daily Air Tasking Order (ATO), require big staffs and lots of time, making it difficult to adjust to new intelligence or enemy maneuvers. And the more drones, satellites, and other sensors are feeding data in the front end of the process, the more overwhelmed the human middlemen become. So much of the CJADC2 work this year has focused on something called the Joint Fires Network. JFN doesn’t take human fingers off the trigger, but it automates the process of suggesting 'who should shoot who' for the human commanders to sign off on (or amend) and for human troops to execute. While not yet operational, a prototype of JFN impressed officials during June’s Valiant Shield wargames in the Pacific and a 'Version 1.0' is expected to enter service by early 2025. 3. Decentralizing battle data: CDAO, Anduril open tactical ‘mesh’ to third-party developers The CJADC2 Minimum Viable Capability and Joint Fires Network looked at warfare from the top down, but the American military, at its best, is infamously bottom-up and inventive. Besides, big HQs are big targets, vulnerable not only to direct attack but to signal jamming or network hacks that cut off their communications. So the CJADC2 effort includes a tactical dimension. For frontline units to share data directly, rather than wait for updates to come down from higher headquarters, their digital systems have to understand each other. That turns out to be technically complex, especially as the military deploys more and more sensors built by more and more contractors. So, after several years of quiet experimentation, this month the Pentagon publicly announced a $100 million, three-year contract with Anduril for large-scale deployment of the company’s Lattice Mesh. The critical ingredient: a set of translation algorithms that lets a unit with Lattice make sense of sensor feeds from over a hundred different systems, without having to wait for a central hub to do the data processing. 4. Open DAGIR: DoD plans July industry day, experiments for new CJADC2 command apps A recurring theme in the evolution of CJADC2 is that it is not one thing, but rather dozens of different applications for different purposes, all (in theory) compatible and knit together. Such a 'federated' approach to building military technology, however, is at odds with traditional Pentagon procurement practices, which tend to create mega-projects run by a single prime contractor. Historically, tech built by different vendors tends to use incompatible standards and protocols that make it difficult or impossible to share data. Conversely, any individual system may suffer 'vendor lock,' where only the original contractor has the intellectual property required to make it work, locking out potential competitors. The Pentagon, naturally, would prefer CJADC2 work more like Lego, with any piece able to connect to each other and everything easy to replace or rearrange as needed. To make this work, in May the Pentagon’s Chief Digital and AI Office, the lead agency on CJADC2 and a host of other high-tech projects, rolled out a new way of designing both software systems and the contracts to build them, starting with the Maven intelligence-analysis AI. Known as Open DAGIR, the acquisition construct decouples different elements of a project so they can be built by different contractors and yet still work smoothly together. 5. Empowered edge versus the centralization trap: Who will wield AI better, the US or China? The ultimate test of any military technology is how well it works in combat, a lethally unforgiving environment. And while artificial intelligence can replace human brainpower for an increasing number of functions, war remains a profoundly human undertaking, where human beings still make the big decisions and do the dying. So how well technology performs depends, in large part, on how humans choose to use it. For the US, there is cause for cautious optimism here. American military culture, like the civilian society from which it recruits, historically favors initiative and improvisation — in ways its authoritarian adversaries generally don’t. And while Industrial Age machinery lent itself to efficiencies of scale and central planning, Information Age networks have great potential to empower the individual on the ground. The challenge for CJADC2 is to unleash that potential.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/killer-apps-5-stories-highlight-quiet-progress-on-military-ai-and-cjadc2/	2024-12-24T10:04:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240716_gide_finger_computer_6733216-e1721160785247.jpg
From a ‘lightbulb’ moment to a ‘sense of urgency’: 5 cyber and network stories from 2024	Sgt. James Hyman, Expeditionary Cyber-Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) operator, 11th Cyber Battalion, gathers information from sensors to develop cyber effects. (Photo by Steven Stover/780th Military Intelligence Brigade) WASHINGTON — Over the past year, the Pentagon has made clear that addressing adversarial cyber threats are at the forefront of the department’s priorities, especially against China. As a result, the services have made adjustments to their information technology practices and network structures to become more resilient against the enemy, but not without the occasional bumps in the road. But Pentagon officials noted that they cannot do this alone. In order to be better prepared in a fight against China, the US needs to partner with allies like those in the NATO alliance and with industry partners. From increased capabilities through partnerships to the potential resurrection of a once-contested Pentagon office, here are the top five stories on the cyber and networks beat in 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘A light bulb moment’: US, Canada achieve ‘vital’ federated ICAM connection through joint pilot During the NATO Edge conference at the beginning of December, Canadian and US officials announced that the Pentagon and the Canadian Armed Forces have achieved federated identity, credential and access management (ICAM) connection between their armed forces in a joint pilot program. ICAM, which has been adopted in recent years throughout the US Department of Defense, is a system that ensures users are who they say they are and determines what they have access to when logging on to information systems. With this shared connection, users in the US and Canada were able to securely access the other country’s data on an existing platform that they share. Now that the US and Canada have achieved federated ICAM connection with each other, Pentagon acting Chief Information Officer Leslie Beavers said the next step is to expand this capability to all of NATO countries and other allies. 2. ‘Sense of urgency’: Army’s NETCOM says it will transform IT and cyber ops by the end of next year During the annual AUSA conference in October, Gen. Jacqueline McPhail, the commanding general of the Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, or NETCOM, said that the service is planning to transform from solely a network provider to an information technology and cybersecurity provider by the end of next year. This move is part of the service’s Command and Control (C2) Fix initiative — a current project focused on improving and simplifying the existing C2 network infrastructure. McPhail said the move will allow her office to become more of an operational force spending less time on fixing IT and cyber issues and more time focused on progressing and protecting the DoD’s Information Network, or DODIN. She added that this transformation will happen at the 'global level,' but the process will be theater-aligned. 3. Army’s new virtual desktop meant real-world problems for some Guard, Reserve users On June 1, the Army rolled out a new mandate requiring a virtual desktop for all soldiers to access Microsoft Office 365 platforms. The Army said the move would increase cybersecurity at a time when America’s enemies are looking for digital vulnerabilities. Though it was meant to keep foreign hackers out of the Army 365 suite, some legitimate National Guard or Army Reserve users said a clumsy rollout with inadequate warning meant that they, too, were locked out of their official accounts. The fluke 'exposed a potential gap in the seem that, should there be a crisis situation, would have been a real challenge,' Katherine Kuzminski, deputy director of studies and program director of military, veterans and society at the Center for New American Security, told Breaking Defense over the summer. 4. Defense Innovation Board calls to resurrect AT&amp;L office, but with new name In July, the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Board called for a major restructure of the Department of Defense’s acquisition house. The board recommended that it was time to resurrect the old Undersecretary for Acquisition and Logistics (AT&amp;L) office by recombining the offices of the undersecretaries for Acquisition &amp; Sustainment and Research and Engineering. However, the new office wouldn't inherit its old name and instead has the working name of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for International Integration and Cooperation. The call to recombine the offices comes after Congress split the AT&amp;L office into the offices of A&amp;S and R&amp;E in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017, after years of questioning from leaders about whether having such an immense, joint office was logical in fulfilling modern technological needs. (Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, the last person to hold the title of undersecretary of AT&amp;L, fiercely advocated for not splitting up the office.) 5. System update: Army general takes over from Skinner as director of DISA, JFHQ-DoDIN At the beginning of October, Air Force Gen. Robert Skinner passed his responsibilities as director of DISA and Joint Force Headquarters-Department of Defense Information Networks (JFHQ-DoDIN) to Army Gen. Paul Stanton. 'I leave this agency and command with a deep sense of humility, optimism, confidence and, most importantly, honor,' Skinner said during a passing of the flags ceremony. Skinner retired after a 40-year military career in which he started as an administrative supervisor for the Office of the Secretary of the Navy. He later worked his way up to an Air Force general and in 2015 became the chief of staff at DISA and deputy commander of the JFHQ-DoDIN. In 2021 he took over the post of director of DISA and JFHQ-DoDIN.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-a-lightbulb-moment-to-a-sense-of-urgency-5-cyber-and-network-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-24T08:42:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/7719557-scaled-e1724434615567.jpg
Israel signs $583 million deal to sell Barak air defense to Slovakia	The launch of a Barack-8 interceptor. (IAI) JERUSALEM — Slovakia has agreed to pay €560 million ($583 million) for the Israeli-made Barak MX air defense system, in a deal the Israeli Ministry of Defense hailed as the largest ever between the two nations. The sale is the latest acquisition by a European government of Israeli air defenses, following agreements for Germany to buy the Arrow and Finland to buy David's Sling. 'Defense exports are key to our security and economic strength,' Israel’s Director General of the Ministry of Defense Eyal Zamir said in an announcement Monday. The Barak MX was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which with the US also developed the Arrow. The ministry described the deal as 'marking a significant milestone in defense cooperation' between Israel and Slovakia. 'This landmark deal, orchestrated by the International Defense Cooperation Directorate of the Israel Ministry of Defense (SIBAT), will further strengthen the bond between the two nations and enhance Slovakia's defense capabilities,' the ministry added. Slovakia has already acquired a number of Israeli systems in the last decade. In 2020 it selected the Spike LR2 anti-tank guided missile, which is made by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Bratislava also acquired radars from IAI subsidiary ELTA in 2021. RELATED: Israel retires Patriot as native air defenses step up According to the Israeli military, the Barak MX Integrated Air Defense System can protect against a number of threats, including ballistic missiles. 'The system is known for its flexible capability to counter threats from various sources, including fighter jets, helicopters, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles,' the ministry noted. It also added that the system has different types of interceptors for different ranges, out to 150 kilometers. The interceptors have 'active radar seeker, dual-pulse engine, and powerful warhead, the system delivers unparalleled interception performance against a wide range of threats,' the ministry said. Zamir said that the sale is part of a wider increase in Israeli defense exports that have taken place despite Israel's involvement in combat operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — at least until the Lebanese conflict cooled with a ceasefire recently. In addition to logistical issues, the conflict in Gaza especially presented a geopolitical challenge to the Israeli defense industry, typified by France's refusal to allow Israeli companies attend high-profile defense shows in the country due to its conduct in Gaza. RELATED: Iran says it shot down Israel's attack. Here's what air defense systems it might've used. However, Zamir said Israeli defense technologies have proven themselves on the battlefield. 'We're seeing increased interest from more countries in the exceptional performance of the IDF [Israel Defense Force] and Israeli combat systems, both defensive and offensive,' he said, adding that exports 'enable us to keep developing the next generations of the world's most advanced combat systems.' The head of SIBAT, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Yair Kulas, also praised the Slovakia deal for integrating 'Israeli defense industry systems in European countries at NATO standards.' Boaz Levy, the CEO of IAI, said that the agreement 'underscores the system's advanced technology, proven performance, and IAI's commitment to delivering the world’s best air defense solutions in accordance with the requirements of Slovakia’s Ministry of Defence.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israel-signs-583-million-deal-to-sell-barak-air-defense-to-slovakia/	2024-12-24T07:39:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221019_barak_8_launch_IAI-scaled-e1666189021894.jpg
From Boeing’s struggles to inflation relief funds: 5 industry stories from 2024	A full-sized model of General Atomics's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (top) and Anduril's (bottom) on display at AFA 2024 on Sept. 20, 2024. (Breaking Defense photos) WASHINGTON — Whew, what a year, huh? We picked sides during a Kendrick Lamar and Drake beef, partied during a brat summer (if you don’t know what that means, ask your daughter), and sat on our couches for the Olympics. And it goes without saying, but I’m sure everyone reading Breaking Defense continued to have their eyes glued on the continued wars in Gaza and Ukraine and is closely watching the fallout of the attempted South Korean coup and the fall of Assad in Syria. But everything that happened in 2024 — at least in the United States — seemed to fall in the shadow of the election, which saw President Joe Biden withdraw and Vice President Kamala Harris generate momentum as the Democratic nominee, but ultimately lose overwhelmingly to former President Donald Trump. In much smaller news, this year also brought me back to Breaking Defense, this time in the guise of its Congress and industry reporter. I’m so ecstatic to be back covering the fast-moving world of defense technology and the people who build it, fund it and use it. I hope that’s reflected in this list of some of my favorite industry stories I wrote during this year. Rather than following my annual tradition of assigning thematically similar Taylor Swift songs to stories as I did in 2021 and 2022, I’m going to provide the defense players involved in the story a corresponding album recommendation. You know, for fun. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘I don’t see it’: Before their CCA drones even take to the air, Anduril and General Atomics trade shots As Azealia Banks once famously said, 'the girls are fighting!' When defense companies battle over a contract, they typically don’t say much (at least publicly) about the competition. This story about the potshots between General Atomics and Anduril is the exception that proves the rule. The most interesting thing about this discourse is how potentially unnecessary it is. The Air Force will choose which Collaborative Combat Aircraft variants to put into production in 2026, but leaders have said they could dole out production contracts to both Anduril and General Atomics and choose not to eliminate either company. I may be reading too much into this, but I view the clash between Anduril and General Atomics as similar to the hostility between two literary foils. Both companies are mid-tier, privately-owned and boast a more maverick sensibility than the highly corporatized defense primes. But if Anduril epitomizes the rise of the Silicon Valley-backed defense tech firm — AI and software focused, with glossy advertisements and an irreverent founder — General Atomics feels more a part of the atomic age, a historically quiet company whose culture has been shaped by engineers and physicists running experiments out in the desert. Album recommendation: 'Brat' by Charli XCX, but also maybe the fantastic soundtrack to 'Challengers' by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor. 2. As Air Force deliberates sixth-generation fighter plans, much is at stake for Boeing Has any defense contractor had a more difficult year than Boeing? (That question is rhetorical, because the answer is obviously no.) 2024 kicked off with a major accident involving its 737 MAX 9 jetliner. The company made major shifts in leadership, with Kelly Ortberg coming onboard to replace Dave Calhoun as chief executive, while also announcing plans to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, a former Boeing spin-off in dire financial straits. Boeing’s defense arm didn’t fare much better. New headwinds associated with fighter production and continued difficulties on fixed-price development programs generated billions in cost overruns. Boeing defense CEO Ted Colbert departed the company in September amid those problems, and has yet to be permanently replaced. This story isn’t about those immediate challenges, but teased out what could be an even bigger problem for Boeing: If the Air Force cancels its sixth-generation fighter, known as Next Generation Air Dominance, what kind of future will Boeing have in advanced combat aircraft development? Album recommendation: Let’s all scream into the void along with 'You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To' by Knocked Loose. 3. From Kabul to keel laying: Afghan immigrants find new careers at US shipyards Man, I loved writing this story. The idea germinated from a throwaway comment made by Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine at a hearing, when he mentioned that Afghan refugees were being trained in Navy-sanctioned programs to enter the shipbuilding industry. I needed to know more. Who was joining these programs, and how successful were they? While these efforts are fairly new — meaning only a handful of Afghan immigrants have completed them and found work in shipbuilding — I was struck by the resilience and determination of the Afghans I interviewed. When Rafiullah Noori told me that his job at Philly Shipyard gave him a shot at a lucrative career he thought he had lost after leaving Afghanistan, all I could think is, 'This is as close to the American Dream as you can find in 2024.' Album recommendation: I’m not a shipbuilding expert but 'American Motor Sports' by Bilmuri would be great music to listen to while fabricating Navy vessels. Also 'Cowboy Carter' by Beyonce, a fantastic reminder of the richness and adaptability of American country music. 4. Six months after fatal V-22 crash, an Air Force Osprey squadron in Japan prepares to fly again. A trip to Tokyo to explore how Japan is revitalizing its industrial base led to an excursion at Yokota Air Base, home to the Air Force squadron that had recently suffered a fatal V-22 accident that resulted in the death of eight airmen. I was honored to have the first opportunity to talk to leaders and members of the 21st Special Operations Squadron about how they were coping with the tragedy and getting ready to fly the Osprey again. Members of the 21st SOS expressed excitement about returning to flight when I spoke to them, and the squadron restarted V-22 operations weeks after this story was published. However the Osprey’s safety record has continued to be a controversial topic, and on Dec. 9, the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy temporarily suspended V-22 flight operations. Album recommendation: 'Flight B741' by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard — an album about surviving life’s hardships and the power of friendship, all set to a bunch of flying metaphors — seems like the right pick. 5. How the Pentagon quietly spent $1 billion of inflation relief money In this story, air warfare reporter Michael Marrow and I dove deep to answer what we initially thought would be an easy question: When Congress appropriated a special $1 billion fund dedicated to inflation relief for defense contractors, where did the money go? More difficult than obtaining the list of 68 programs that obtained relief funds was getting a clearer picture of which companies benefitted from the funding, and why. A small number of big-name weapons programs —including the Constellation-class frigate, F-15EX fighter jet and John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler — clearly gobbled up the majority of the money, but what remains opaque, even to Pentagon leaders like comptroller Mike McCord, is how much funding trickled down to small suppliers desperately in need of cash. Album recommendation: 'Songs of a Lost World' by The Cure Honorable mention: NAVSEA is in its ‘survey era,’ writes top civilian in email loaded with Taylor Swift lyrics My other editors were off work, so I bullied Breaking Defense Assistant Editor Alyssa Schonhaut into letting me write this story. Album recommendation: 'The Tortured Poet’s Department: The Anthology,' by Taylor Swift, obviously.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-boeings-struggles-to-inflation-relief-funds-5-industry-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-24T06:11:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240926_cca_anduril_ga_BDPHOTOS.png
Italy inks deal to buy up to 24 more Typhoons, Leonardo says	Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon (Airbus) WASHINGTON — Italian defense firm Leonardo today announced the Italian government will buy up to an additional 24 Eurofighter Typhoons, meant to replace the air force's Tranche 1 Eurofighters. French aerospace giant Airbus, the UK's BAE Systems, and Leonardo are partners in building the aircraft, under the auspices of the four-nation Eurofighter Typhoon consortium. Consortium members are Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Leonardo said the consortium, along with the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency had struck the deal with Rome. The new jets will be equipped with 'advanced avionics, enhanced weapon systems capable of operating Brimstone III and Meteor, new sensors and improved connectivity,' Leonardo's announcement said. Brimstone III is air-launched ground attack missile; Meteor is an active radar guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. 'The order will enhance the Italian Air Force’s combat air capabilities and provide security for Italy, Europe and the NATO Alliance,' Simon Ellard, general manager of the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency, said in the Leonardo announcement. The contract with Rome follows hard on the heels of a deal with Spain for 25 Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation fighter jets under the country's Halcon II program. 'During this past seven days we have seen two of the four Eurofighter Core Nations sign new contract orders, with a clear desire to modernise their Air Forces and confirming the crucial role they attribute to our aircraft,' Giancarlo Mezzanatto, Eurofighter chief executive, said. Turkey also is hoping to get an approval to buy some 40 Typhoons, if Berlin can be persuaded by its partners to go along with the deal.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/italy-inks-deal-to-buy-up-to-24-more-typhoons-leonardo-says/	2024-12-23T12:55:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/pm_38_677_677584-e8nd1ey288-scaled-e1734715882530.jpg
Peeking behind the veil: 5 revelatory space stories from 2024	The Orion Nebula. (Photo Credits: NASA, ESA, M. Robberto [STScI/ESA], and the Hubble Space Telescope Orion Treasury Project Team) Nonetheless, 2024 saw evidence that a shift toward more openness is coming whether those deep in the 'black world' are ready or not — driven in large part by the realities of a space environment now dominated by commercial interests rather than government operators. Below find five stories (plus a bonus one) that provide a peak behind the secrecy veil or are revelatory in some way. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Hide and seek: Despite sharper eyes on the heavens, sneaky sats can still find shadows With technological advances, including artificial intelligence, and a boom in commercial companies keeping metaphorical eyes on the heavens, it is increasingly hard for governments to hide their satellites or obscure their purpose. Of course, those wishing to do just that — including US adversaries — meanwhile have been working to improve their stealth techniques. The fun part has been watching that cat-and-mouse game play out more and more openly in the public domain over the past couple of years. 2. Is Russia’s Cosmos 2553 satellite a test for a future orbital nuclear weapon? Independent space watchers with personal telescopes long have been tracking and sharing information among themselves (and with interested researchers and reporters) about intriguing space objects such as unacknowledged spy satellites and potentially dangerous space junk. Indeed, some of the most accurate and timely news about Russian and Chinese space activities have come not from the US Space Force, but from independents and, increasingly, commercial firms showing off their space tracking chops. There still has been no official word that Russia's Cosmos 2553 is the satellite that prompted a nukes-in-space scare in Washington, but if the shoe fits &#8230; . 3. GMTI emerges as new front in Space Force-NGA turf battle, and NGA director pushes back at criticisms of agency, touts ‘wetware,’ tradecraft As yours truly has documented over the past several years, the Space Force and the nation's primary spy satellite operator, the National Reconnaissance Office, have slowly been working out their relationship woes and are now settled into a (mostly) working partnership for acquiring satellite imagery about targets on Earth and in space. But like in any classic love triangle, the NRO-Space Force rapprochement has left the IC's other key space organization, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), out in the cold — and, somewhat extraordinarily, was not shy about making its grievances public. This duo of exclusives blew open the doors on the fight between the Space Force and the NGA, over primacy in managing how intelligence intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites are tasked and deciding who gets what resulting analytical products. While Breaking Defense has learned that a bilateral 'governance' accord has been drafted, under some duress from the White House, and is being reviewed up the chain of command, the ending of the saga is not yet clear. This reporter, for one, will be looking for clues when the fiscal 2026 budget drops — whenever that finally is. 4. Space Force boots RTX from MEO missile warning/tracking program Under the watchful eye of Air Force Space Acquisition Executive Frank Calvelli, who early in his tenure vowed to kick ass and take names on failing programs, the Space Force's Space Systems Command (SSC) recently has been a bit more willing to admit to programmatic woes and contractor shortfalls. Still, it was a small surprise to see SSC so readily confirm in June that it terminated RTX's contract for development of the service’s new missile warning/tracking constellation in medium Earth orbit (MEO) due to cost and schedule overruns, as well as technical issues. The company, which in March announced it was backing out as a space prime, also is the lead contractor on one of the Space Force's most expensive and long-standing problem children, the ground system for command and control of modern GPS satellites, the Next-Generation Operational Control System (OCX). SSC head Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant on Nov. 21 told reporters that one contractor has been put on the Space Force's Contractor Watch List (the first documented use of that 2018 congressionally granted power) but refused to name the firm. 5. DoD ‘completely rewrites’ classification policy for secret space programs The Defense Department's Space Policy office in January announced that it has completed its year-long policy review of how space programs traditionally have used, and many say abused, the tightly restricted Special Access Program (SAP) classification — moving to both downgrade the classification level of a number of programs and put in place rules to curtail future SAP designations. Sadly for us ink-stained scribes, nothing was actually declassified. Indeed, even the new policy itself remains firmly classified.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/peeking-behind-the-veil-5-revelatory-space-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T12:43:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-4.10.21 PM-e1733755176521.png
Advancing military training with VR and simulators	If someone was going off the full name of the annual I/ITSEC meeting — the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference — they probably wouldn’t realize what the show floor looks like: basically, a giant arcade. No, there’s no Street Fighter machines scattered about, but the show is loaded with virtual reality, shooting simulators, and digital training exercises, all of which have a distinct video game aesthetic. But underneath the shiny, loud toys is a very real, important role in moving military training forward. After all, as Lt. Gen. Benjamin T. Watson, the head of the USMC Training and Education Command, put it, the Pentagon faces a 'steeply increasing need for simulation.' And unsurprisingly, the industry is happy to provide. In this eBook you’ll get a taste of what the show floor at I/ITSEC 2024, hosted in Orlando, Florida, looked like. Companies were out in droves, showing off their most advanced training and simulation offerings, and while these pieces won’t capture the cacophony of the floor itself, they do give you a sense of where industry is looking to invest its training and simulation dollars.

From a runaway ICBM pricetag to AI dogfighting: 5 air warfare stories from 2024	US Air Force artist's rendering of the Sentinel in flight. (Credit: US Air Force) WASHINGTON — For the US Air Force, 2024 was supposed to mark the beginning of the next generation. That was true in many cases: The service made significant headway for its drone wingmen program and in a related effort demonstrated that an AI-piloted jet can make for a formidable adversary, as well as certifying the F-35A to carry a nuclear weapon. But other efforts experienced setbacks. From the Air Force’s ballooning costs for a new, nuclear-tipped ICBM to a pause for its Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, questions now hang over some of the service’s leading priorities. In semi-particular order, here are the top five air warfare stories of 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘No alternatives’: Pentagon doubles down as new Sentinel ICBM’s cost jumps to $141 billion Air Force leaders had long warned the Sentinel ICBM would run into trouble, but even after an early preview of rising costs, many in Washington were caught flat-footed by a startling new price tag estimated to be 81 percent higher than originally forecast. Sentinel is now consuming the Air Force’s budget, much to the dismay of service leaders eager to fund other priorities. Despite its exploding costs, officials determined through a congressionally-mandated review that there are 'no alternatives' for the new ICBM, casting aside other options like road-mobile ICBMs or an extension of the Minuteman III fleet. And what drove the new estimate? Bad assumptions and 'unknown unknowns,' Air Force officials explained. It’s been decades since the Pentagon has undertaken a similar project, leading to unwelcome discoveries — the bulk of them concentrated in the construction element of the project. Multiply that problem over hundreds of silos, thousands of miles of cabling and countless easements, and the bill quickly runs up. 2. F-35A officially certified to carry nuclear bomb Reporters sweat the details of their stories, but being drawn into the global nuclear balance of power can be particularly daunting. And that’s what happened when Breaking Defense reported the F-35A was certified to carry the B61-12 thermonuclear gravity bomb — news apparently noticed by the Kremlin, as it was quickly picked up by Russian state media. The certification meant that the F-35 became the first stealth fighter in the world approved to carry a nuke. Alongside the US, fellow NATO nations and F-35 operators Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands — and Germany once Berlin’s jets are delivered — can now complement the traditional nuclear triad of submarines, ballistic missiles and bombers with fast-moving, forward-deployed stealth fighters. All as nuclear tensions ratchet higher over the war in Ukraine. Looking to you, proponents of deterrence theory. 3. V-22 Ospreys barred from full mission capability until ‘mid-2025’: NAVAIR boss After a long string of incidents, a crash of the V-22 Osprey in November 2023 prompted officials to significantly scale back operations with the troubled tiltrotor, later admitting that the aircraft won’t resume its full mission profile until mid-2025. The incident ignited anger among lawmakers, leading some to threaten canceling the program altogether if another aircraft crashed. Recent reporting has also shed light on the aircraft’s troubles, such as an internal report showing that warnings of a mechanical issue that caused the November 2023 crash were known for at least a decade. Other reporting has revealed a recent concerning rise in severe incidents and that underlying manufacturing issues carry wider implications for military and civilian aircraft. The aircraft’s woes continue: On Dec. 9, officials confirmed that the Osprey’s operations would once again be paused following a recent in-flight incident. 4. In a ‘world first,’ DARPA project demonstrates AI dogfighting in real jet Few announcements this year had a bigger impact on the future of warfare than when DARPA, the Air Force and industry vendors revealed that an F-16 tricked out to serve as an autonomy testbed can not only fly itself, but also dogfight. Officials declined to disclose specifics results from those trials like a win/loss ratio, but after Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall took a ride himself in the special F-16, he described the AI as putting on roughly an even match against a seasoned pilot. Many officials think human pilots will stick around for the foreseeable future, their abilities augmented by manned-unmanned teaming arrangements. And, Kendall has emphasized, any highly autonomous weapon systems will only be flown under tight human control. As more experiments like the DARPA project proceed and autonomous capabilities only get better, time will tell whether the future is closer than it seems. 5. Air Force picks Anduril, General Atomics for next round of CCA work The Air Force made significant strides this year for its effort to field drone wingmen, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft. After Breaking Defense first reported the five industry vendors in play for the CCA program’s first round of procurement, the Air Force winnowed that group to two, leaving startup Anduril and legacy dronemaker General Atomics still standing. Heralding a revolution in airpower, officials hope CCA can offset numerical advantages enjoyed by China as the Air Force’s own fighter inventory shrinks. One day, these drones might even take the place of manned fighters — and if incoming Department of Government Efficiency co-lead Elon Musk has his way, that day could come sooner rather than later.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-a-runaway-icbm-pricetag-to-ai-dogfighting-5-air-warfare-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T10:58:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220405_USAF_sentinel_gfx.png
Trump names picks for top Pentagon posts, with financier as No. 2	U.S. Army Reserve soldiers receive an overview of Washington D.C. as part of the 4th Annual Day with the Army Reserve May 25, 2016. The event was led by the Private Public Partnership office. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has made his picks for a handful of top jobs at the Defense Department, including several who served in national security jobs during his first term of office and a billionaire financier for the number two spot. Trump announced the choices late Sunday, saying the team would 'work in conjunction with our GREAT Secretary of Defense Nominee, Pete Hegseth!' — signaling the Trump team is standing by Hegseth, the Fox News host despite allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied. For Hegseth's would-be deputy, Trump nominated Stephen Feinberg, billionaire investor and co-founder of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Feinberg's firm, which is active in the defense space, owns Stratolaunch Systems, which provides hypersonic vehicles for testing including to DoD. He also has been a major funder to political organizations backing Trump. Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch CEO, told reporters on Dec. 5 that Feinberg would 'be a phenomenal choice,' even though Stratolaunch would then face 'heavy, heavy conflict of interest rules and precedents put in place such that we will be treated no differently than any other company.' During Trump's first term in office, Feinberg headed the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives private citizens access to classified information so they can assess how the Intelligence Community goes about its normally cloistered business. Dan Coats, Trump's Director of National Intelligence, told lawmakers in February 2017 that he knew Feinberg 'personally' and considered him a 'patriot.' Elbridge Colby, a well-known Washington voice on national security affairs with a long government career, was nominated as DoD undersecretary for policy. Colby, the grandson of Nixon-era CIA Director William Colby, held the position of DoD deputy assistant secretary for strategy and force development from 2017 to 2018. As an analyst at the Center for a New American Security and the Center for Naval Analyses known for his 'realist' views, Colby was active on issues surrounding space security — arguing for the US military to build up the capacity to fight a 'limited' space war with China and Russia. Michael Duffey, who served in several roles including at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the first Trump administration, was nominated as undersecretary for acquisitions and sustainment. A former head of the Wisconsin Republican Party, Duffey was reportedly a key figure in Trump's first impeachment saga as an administration official involved in the freezing of aid to Ukraine. Emil Michael, a former Uber executive, was tapped to be undersecretary for research and engineering. Michael led the ride-share company's expansion into Russia and China, negotiating co-investment deals worth billions, according to accounts he's provided publicly. Michael was linked to controversies while at Uber, including a suggestion in 2014 that the company dig up dirt on reporters critical of the firm, according to a Buzzfeed report. (Michael apologized at the time.) Also in 2014 Michael was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to the Pentagon's Defense Business Board. According to his website, he also is an investor in or advisor to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Joe Kasper, who served at DoD and the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, was nominated as chief of staff to the secretary of defense. Kasper began his career as an aide to then-Rep. Duncan Hunter, R.-Calif., and left the job in 2017, months after Hunter came under investigation for misusing campaign funds from 2010 to 2016. Kasper was not accused of wrongdoing in that case. (Hunter pleaded guilty in 2019 but was later pardoned by Trump.) Kasper currently serves as managing director at consulting firm Ervin Graves. Finally, Keith Bass, a retired Navy commander, was nominated as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Bass since June 2023 has been medical center director of the West Texas VA Health Care System for the Veterans Integrated Service Network, having previously worked as a senior vice president for business development at GlobalMed, a Vienna, Va.-based provider of telemedicine including for DoD and the Veterans Administration. While not a physician, he also served as the director of the CIA Office of Medical Services.

To win, US must eliminate gap between the supply chain and the kill chain	Contractor employees at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant prepare 155 mm artillery rounds to be filled as a part of the load, assemble and pack operation. (Photo by JMC) In early October, when Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, two US Navy destroyers were strategically in place in the Mediterranean Sea. The USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired off a dozen interceptors to aid in Israel’s defense. Those interceptors, which proved their life-saving abilities, cost up to $30 million a copy. Each one takes years to build. In an era of on-demand everything, a reasonable American might think that the expenditure of this costly, munition, immediately kicked off replenishment at the Alabama factory where it’s made. One might reasonably assume that a sophisticated tracking, production, and resupply system keeps our servicemembers armed and our military at a heightened state of readiness. The reasonable American, conditioned to these expectations by the suggestive powers of 'smart' homes, cars, grocery shopping apps, and more, would be completely wrong. Today, no such system is in place and it often takes years to replenish weapons used on the battlefield. The American factory is separated from the fight. This gap must be closed, the need is urgent, and the technology to fix this is available. Historically, this type of system wasn't actually needed. For most of human history, armies lived off the land. They acquired food and supplies from local populations. Armies stashed supplies at magazines, transported equipment like artillery, and acquired goods and services from sutlers and camp followers. Likewise, navies operating far from home ports relied on local supplies of fresh water, food, and naval stores. Pre-industrial forces, therefore, lacked the logistical umbilical cord that stretches back to home territory. Logistics was a local affair conducted by forces in the field, rather than supplied by a dedicated corps. This created freedom of maneuver at the cost of the ability to sustain large forces in the field over time. The second industrial revolution changed all of this. It freed up labor and created the means to outfit huge forces with materiel. Railroads and steamships could quickly and reliably transport these armies, along with their increasingly sophisticated equipment and supplies over great distances. Telegraphs allowed for rapid communication of orders and logistical requests. Armies and navies still acquired some supplies locally, but on balance, sustainment now came over supply lines. This change propelled the emergence of a standing military staff to manage the complexity of industrial logistics. Militaries created large supply corps and dedicated infrastructure to keep forces and equipment sustained in the field. As military operations became larger and more far-flung, these processes and organizations expanded in size and complexity to keep pace. Over time, this specialization increasingly divorced rear-area support functions from frontline combat forces. Which is why today, the supply chain and the kill chain are separate, distinct functions in the American military. There have been some modest technology advancements to help connect logisticians to warfighters, but nothing has bridged the gap between supply and demand. Rather, we remain largely stuck in a 20th century model in which combat forces rely on a distant and labor-intensive process to provide them with materiel, ranging from bombs to blood, when and where it is needed. The separated military functions of supply and demand systems have created bloat in civilian and military bureaucracy and a disconnect between what the warfighter needs and America is producing that does not exist in the commercial sector. The sad reality is that because the Pentagon does not typically invest in technology for the 'staff functions' of DoD, the on-demand technology in the hands of an American consumer right now is more powerful than that in the hands of an American logistics officer. The good news is that changing this requires exactly zero new authorities from Congress, acquisition reforms, changes to the FAR, or new blue star commissions. The military can solve this today by leveraging the same software and AI that the commercial sector has relied upon for decades. Today, units manually calculate supply consumption and communicate it to the next echelon. Resupply is then aggregated across units and fed into plans, at which point they are locked in for that planning cycle. As a result of this slow, sequential process, forward-deployed units often depend on establishing surpluses of supply in theater—surpluses that we now know are difficult to maintain, and that are vulnerable to disruption in a contested environment. The supply chains and manufacturers that ultimately power these operations have rationally organized around this intermittent cadence. Now imagine a process that runs more like the always-on systems Americans have come to expect in every other industry. In the case of Navy missiles fired in the Mediterranean, the weapons used in the kill chain are Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) surface-to-air missiles, built by Raytheon and fired using a Vertical Launcher System (VLS). That VLS would be equipped with software to measure SM-2 expenditures, allowing accurate inventory and consumption to be readily visible across echelons. These same command and control (C2) systems would provide proactive recommendations on replenishment actions for the supply chain, transforming unreliable stockpiling into data-backed predictive logistics. This can and should be replicated across a variety of weapons systems and other critical equipment. The harder piece will be fully restoring the size and strength of the American industrial base to meet the production and manufacturing demands that today’s challenging global environment requires. There are signs that a resurgence is underway, but a full transformation of American production cannot take place without a clear and sustained demand signal from the Pentagon. Making the changes described here actually helps this big challenge. Sending industry a much earlier demand signal and reducing delays in getting industry gears turning is the goal. Furthermore, everything purchased under DoD’s Operations &amp; Maintenance account—repairs, fuel, medical supplies, and more—enjoys significantly more flexibility in terms of DoD’s flexibility and discretion to buy when needed. You simply have to look at the attendance at this month’s Reagan National Defense Forum to see that American companies, old and new, are rising up to meet the needs of the warfighters. It is incumbent on military leaders to put in place the efficient, direct, real-time connectivity between what those companies supply and what our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians need for today’s fight, and tomorrow’s.

From drone red tape to an aviation shake up: 5 Army stories from 2024	An RCV light at desert testing. (Original image by Savannah Baldwin/ US Army; Code image by Markus Spiske via Pexels; Graphic by Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — US Army leaders spent the year teasing changes both big and small. After kicking off 2024 with an aviation upheaval and revamping artillery plans, they foreshadowed additional changes to acquisition programs and policy alike. Here are my five top Army stories from the past 12 months, ranging from red tape hamstringing soldiers from using smaller drones to Army leaders butting up with tech challenges developing a fleet of future robotic combat vehicles. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 2. US Army takes on most effective counter-drone system yet: Red tape Every time a US Army soldier loses or breaks a drone — regardless of its size or price tag — they are saddled with reporting paperwork, a mandatory investigation and possibly a loss of pay. That red tape has left soldiers hesitant to fly smaller drones and the service officials looking to reclassify ones tipping the scales below 55 pounds as expendable. 3. Army looks to limit early Robotic Combat Vehicle missions to keep soldiers out of harm's way Army plans to team up soldiers with machines kicked into high gear this year with part of that push centered around the revamped Robotic Combat Vehicle program. But questions about the service’s autonomy approach coupled with the state of technology, mean it is relying on a radio 'tether' that can break if soldiers in control vehicles are too far behind the robots, obstacles get in the way or an adversary is jamming the signals. As a result, too many troops are needed to control those ground robots and they are in the line of fire. 4. Army open to replacing Microsoft as prime under &#8216;IVAS Next,' industry sources say The Army and Microsoft are still teamed up on the futuristic mixed-reality goggles dubbed the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). However, change is afoot after multiple years of starts and fits with the heads-up display. Several tech companies, for example, spent 2024 preparing to jump into the IVAS Next competition after receiving briefings from the service about a decision to recompete the prime contractor position. 5. Inside the US Army's race to apply Ukraine lessons to future Abrams, Bradley replacement Loitering munitions and cheap one-way drones inside Ukraine have left a string of combat vehicles from both sides of the conflict destroyed in battle. The US Army leaders are using the conflict as a crash course in how their own tactics and technology could end up on the wrong side of a war, while also rushing to incorporate lessons into the development of tracked combat vehicles like the Abrams tank and Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-drone-red-tape-to-an-aviation-shake-up-5-army-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T07:30:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240719_RCV_desert_gfx.png
The Navy’s never-ending quest for 355 ships: 5 Navy stories from 2024	The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group transits the Pacific Ocean Jan. 25, 2020. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jason Isaacs) WASHINGTON — In 2024, the US Navy didn’t have enough ships or subs it wanted in its fleet. And it showed. A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers as well as top Navy leadership have bemoaned the fleet’s size for years now. Despite federal law stating the service must maintain more than 355 ships, the fleet’s actual size currently fluctuates between the high 280s and low 290s. But what distinguished 2024 were the numerous fronts on which the Navy, and other parts of the federal government, has pushed to stop the bleeding before 2027 — the year the US believes China wants to have the ability to invade Taiwan, should leader Xi Jingping call them to do so. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti herself has seemingly coined the phrase 'more players on the field' since the start of her tenure. It's a motto that encompasses several aspects of the Navy's capabilities and arsenal, the overall number of warships being one of them. From calling out industry to making a big bet on venture capital, these are five stories from 2024 where the Pentagon’s anxiety about ship counts was showing. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Navy lays out major shipbuilding delays, in rare public accounting Not too long after the president’s budget request was published in March, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro released a brief but damning document outlining massive delays on nearly every premiere shipbuilding program in the service’s repertoire. The news that those programs were behind wasn’t inherently surprising; Pentagon observers use a combination of public statements and budget justification documents to keep tabs on the general status of all new ships and submarines. But this story makes it to the top of this list because of how unusual it was for a senior Defense Department official such as Del Toro to so outwardly and publicly proclaim some of the country’s most important national security programs are lagging behind. And as has been a pattern for Del Toro, to which the next story on this list will allude, he also made sure to call out prime contractors for each program on that list of delays. 2. How SECNAV’s claims about S. Korean, Japanese shipbuilders do and do not line up In the first half of 2024, Del Toro on multiple occasions let industry know that, as he saw it, they had their share of the blame to carry for the Navy’s problems, particularly when it came to ship construction and maintenance. At major expositions that are otherwise meant as opportunities for industry to get face time with senior military leaders, Del Toro laid into unnamed C-suite executives for excessive 'stock buybacks' and failing to re-invest in their facilities for the benefit of the Navy. That leads into this story, which explored Del Toro’s proposal for Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders to invest in American shipyards. These Asian companies, Del Toro argued, are technologically ahead of their American counterparts and their work output reaps the benefits. It was a premise with which some American officials took exception. (At least one major Asian company, the Hanwha Group, has taken Del Toro up on his offer and started making inroads with the American industrial base since then.)

ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers This next story also featured the US reaching out to allies for a helping hand in shipbuilding. The ICE Pact came out of this summer’s NATO summit and was one of the last big foreign policy initiatives by the Biden administration. While icebreakers are technically the purview of the US Coast Guard with regards to shipbuilding, the operations of the US Navy — and the wider joint force — are dependent upon the United States and allies being able to access existing and emerging sea lanes in the High North. This was clearly on the minds of Biden administration officials when it enlisted the assistance of Canada and Finland, both of whom are proficient at icebreaker shipbuilding and Arctic navigation, to join forces with the American defense industrial base for the benefit of all three nations’ fleets. The story linked above dives deep into the circumstances surrounding the ICE Pact including why the US needed help from its northern allies and where Russia and China stand in their own push in the Arctic. 4. Navy takes ‘really big swing with private investment to boost sub industrial base The advent of the AUKUS trilateral security pact in 2021 has put a massive spotlight on the submarine industrial base and its challenges. This story is a highlight for the year because of the unusual nature of the deal in play. The Navy teamed up with a private investment fund to purchase and develop a plot of land in Mobile, Ala., aimed at prioritizing 'maritime infrastructure investments and sustainment activities with the goal of developing an additional 75 [percent] of the site to support submarine production, workforce training, and industrial capacity.' The business arrangement is a novel one for the Navy and speaks to the service’s willingness to use outside the box thinking if it means bolstering the submarine industrial base. That thinking is why it makes this list. (Some readers might notice this story was written by Breaking Defense’s managing editor Lee Ferran, who insists on calling it 'eloquent prose.' I'll leave that to the reader to decide. [Editor's Note: Eloquent or elegant, either fits.]) Sailors stand watch aboard the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun (DDG 103) while it transits the Turkish Straits. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Scott Barnes/Released) 5. US Navy to extend service lives of 12 destroyers This last story is short, but to the point. The service announced it would extend the lives of a dozen Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, which will add an anticipated 48 years of operational life to a fleet of ships regularly dubbed the workhorse of the US Navy. During the first Trump administration, Navy officials went on record to say that extending the service lives of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, combined with producing additional ships beyond previously planned amounts, was the surest way to reach 355 ships. The fleet's composition would not be optimal but, they argued, having too many destroyers was the best place to be imbalanced. Given this announcement, that thinking is clearly still resident in the US Navy’s leadership.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-navys-never-ending-quest-for-355-ships-5-navy-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T06:01:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220420_dvids_roosevelt_strike_group_6046018-scaled-e1650476195702.jpg
Pentagon awards Lockheed $11.8 billion undefinitized F-35 production contract	Airmen assigned to the 34th Fighter Squadron and Fighter Generation Squadron perform pre-flight checks on F-35A Lightning IIs during an agile combat employment exercise at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, March 28, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman Keagan Lee) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has awarded Lockheed Martin a roughly $11.8 billion contract to continue production of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as the two parties inch toward finalizing an agreement for the stealth fighter. In a contract announcement posted tonight, the Pentagon said the award covers 145 copies of the tri-variant fighter between the US Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy as well as foreign customers. The contract is undefinitized, meaning dollar values and quantities could change as negotiations continue, and only covers production lot 18 of the stealth fighter. Lockheed referred questions to the Pentagon. Russ Goemaere, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office, told Breaking Defense that the Pentagon aims to finalize the lot 18 contract in the spring. Additionally, Goemaere said officials expect to similarly issue an undefinitized contract for lot 19 production when the fiscal 2025 budget is approved — which may not occur until March at the earliest, following a last-minute, stopgap measure lawmakers passed today. After originally aiming to reach an agreement last year for production lots 18 and 19, the Pentagon and Lockheed have remained at an impasse amid inflation and other challenges. The parties reached a 'handshake' deal for the two lots in November — though the announcement did not share quantities or prices — and a Lockheed official later said the program may first move forward with an undefinitized contract as talks continued. Getting a contract award was critical, Lockheed officials have previously said, to provide a cash injection for the program that the company resorted to partially funding out of pocket to ensure production could continue smoothly. The F-35 has also been a target of top Trump ally Elon Musk in recent weeks, who is set to co-lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) commission that could recommend cuts to government spending. Musk has called officials 'idiots' for continuing to build the jet, while DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy recently advocated for shifting funds away from manned fighters and into other platforms like drones — raising questions of the Joint Strike Fighter’s fate under the new administration. Yet the jet still has defenders. Outgoing Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has long been critical of the F-35 program’s many problems, hit back at Musk’s comments Thursday, arguing that the US should continue to buy and upgrade the stealth fighter.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagon-awards-lockheed-11-8-billion-undefinitized-f-35-production-contract/	2024-12-20T17:54:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240728_f35s_fog_USAF-scaled-e1722204407178.jpg
Top defense insights from 2024	In my intro to last year’s collection of opinion and analysis pieces, I started with this line: 'In many ways, 2023 was a year of chaos.' Rather than writing this, I really could have just cut and pasted that intro and changed some dates, because 2024 wasn’t any calmer. The wars in Ukraine and Israel expanded, major Pentagon programs found themselves fighting for their lives and a presidential election dominated America’s attention. All of which is to say, the defense community had a lot of thoughts in 2024, which is why Breaking Defense published over 85 opinion and analysis pieces this year. Below, we’ve collected a small handful of those that we think really stood out, whether because they came from newsmakers, because of their topicality, or because of the way they drove the conversation. Of course, we could only select a limited number of the pieces we ran for this eBook, which means a lot of great stuff got left on the cutting room floor. For this collection, we largely avoided the many excellent news-of-the-moment pieces (such as how Congress should approach the budget) that are less relevant months later, even though those pieces helped define the discussion at the time. Also not fully represented here is our 'NATO’s Northern Edge' collection, published around the alliance’s 75th Anniversary in Washington and featuring pieces from top officials from Norway, Finland, Canada and the United Kingdom.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/top-defense-insights-from-2024/	2024-12-20T15:35:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Defense-Influences-Featured-Image-2024-V2.png
Air Force reopens F-16 ejection seat deal, setting up contest between Collins, Martin-Baker	Three F-16s from the 93rd Fighter Squadron prepare for takeoff at Homestead Air Reserve Base on Aug. 3, 2022, during the Golden Gecko Airmen Readiness Exercise 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Lionel Castellano) WASHINGTON — The Air Force is formally recompeting a deal with Collins Aerospace to provide modernized ejection seats for the service’s F-16 fleet, and could do the same for the F-22 and B-1 based on the results, the service announced tonight. Work already underway to integrate Collins’s ACES 5 ejection seat on the Air Force’s F-15 fleet will continue, according to the service’s press release. But officials will now compete a deal to reseat the F-16, and 'decisions following the competition could extend to other platforms, including the F-22 and B-1,' the release said. A new request for proposals will be issued, the Air Force said. As Breaking Defense covered last month, the decision puts up for grabs the safety of upwards of thousands of Air Force pilots, hundreds of millions of dollars and a chance for sole competitor Martin-Baker to steal away at least some business from RTX subsidiary Collins. 'With 713 lives saved, ACES is the safest ejection seat available. We look forward to working with the US Air Force to qualify and install the latest generation of our ejection seats, the ACES 5, on the F-16 fleet,' Collins said in a statement. Martin-Baker, whose US18E seat is on contract for foreign sales of the F-16, said in a statement that '[w]e have a qualified seat for the F-16, and we look forward to the opportunity to compete.' The service said an original sole-source award to Collins under the Next Generation Ejection Seat (NGES) program was 'based on previous market research and assessment of technological maturity.' But the program has been hit by delays, and officials decided to review the deal with Collins by querying industry again in August. Officials chose a new approach based on that market survey, as well as 'new data' and 'evolving operations demands,' according to the release. 'The decision to re-open the competition underscores our commitment to continually assess our strategies to ensure we meet warfighter needs and timelines,' Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said in the release. 'By reassessing market conditions and fostering competition, we ensure industry delivers the best possible solutions for both current and future Air Force requirements.' The Air Force’s original NGES plan called for reseating the A-10, though officials have since decided to retire the platform — mirroring a shrinking fighter fleet. Collins is on contract separately to provide a new seat for the B-2 fleet, and the first bomber got its new seats last month. It’s unclear how a competition might impact the already-delayed seat plan. For each platform under the NGES effort, 'the Air Force projects a 36-month integration and test program, followed by a 24-month manufacturing lead-time, followed by aircraft modifications,' an Air Force spokesperson previously told Breaking Defense. Asked how a competition could impact that timeline, the spokesperson replied that '[i]nformation gathered from industry in the [August] sources sought notice will inform us on potential impacts to platform integration timelines.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/air-force-reopens-f-16-ejection-seat-deal-setting-up-contest-between-collins-martin-baker/	2024-12-20T15:28:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/7963466-scaled-e1695394371635.jpg
Continuing resolution with $14B in submarine funds survives House vote	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Just hours before a midnight deadline is set to trigger a government shutdown, the House overwhelmingly approved a stopgap funding bill that keeps federal funding rolling until mid-March and adds $14 billion for submarines. The bill, approved in a 366-34-1 vote in which Republicans made up the only 'nay' votes, was the third deal floated this week amid a Republican back-and-forth in which President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk played starring roles. In the end, House Democrats overwhelmingly backed the bill after the White House voiced reluctant support. 'Following an order by President-elect Trump, yesterday Republicans walked away from a bipartisan deal and threatened to shut down the government at the 11th hour in order to pave the way to provide tax breaks for billionaires. This revised legislation does not do that,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. 'President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans — from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans — can continue as well as to grant assistance for communities that were impacted by devastating hurricanes,' she added. The measure now moves to the Senate, which is expected to pass the bill as early as this evening. Like previous proposals, the latest bill included more than $14 billion in additional funds for the Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines. That sum includes $5.7 billion in emergency funds for Virginia-class submarine construction for 'the improvement of workforce wages and non-executive level salaries.' That funding, which the Navy could incrementally dole out until the end of fiscal 2029, is aimed at mitigating ongoing instability in the submarine industrial base, which has had difficultly recruiting and retaining skilled shipbuilding technicians since the pandemic. It also included $9 billion for Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine procurement. The additional submarine funding was an uncontroversial provision that drew little conversation during the past week of negotiations. 'Importantly, the final Continuing Resolution maintains the Biden Administration’s request to Congress of over $14 billion for the Virginia and Columbia class submarine programs and the industrial base, which will help the Navy and industry boost production cadence and grow the supply chain.' Rep. Joe Courtney, the Connecticut Democrat who is ranking member on the House Armed Services seapower subcommittee, said in a statement. Other defense related increases that remained in the latest bill were the addition of disaster relief funding for military installations for damages caused by Typhoon Mawar as well as various hurricanes. However, previous language that would transfer a District of Columbia Air National Guard wing to the Maryland Guard was not included, as that move was part of a deal that would transfer the RFK stadium site to DC, which was not addressed in the current CR bill. The road to the current deal has been fraught with drama. The initial CR deal, negotiated between House GOP and Democratic leadership and released on Tuesday, included billions of dollars in farm aid and disaster relief, as well as a laundry list of additional provisions spanning from the ownership of Washington’s RFK stadium to a pay raise for congressional salaries to music tourism. Without Democrat buy-in to ensure passage of the bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson risked the CR being derailed by hardline fiscal hawks in his own party. However, Republicans were incensed by the unrelated items attached to the CR, which had ballooned into more than 1,500-pages. The wheels came off on Wednesday as Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have both been tapped to lead Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, took to social media and issued a string of posts decrying the bipartisan agreement as a waste of taxpayer dollars and calling for a shutdown unless a clean CR was put forward. Trump’s disavowal of the deal — and his demand that any agreement also tackle the debt ceiling — proved to be the final death knell, leaving Republicans scrambling to figure out a new plan with only two days left before federal funding ran out. With Trump’s blessing, Johnson put forward another bill yesterday: a clean CR with disaster relief and the farm bill, as well as suspend the debt ceiling. However, the bill failed in a 174-235 vote in which 38 Republicans voted against the measure. Republicans spent all day trying to put forward another option, at one point considering conducting four different votes for the CR, the farm bill, the disaster relief and the debt ceiling. Ultimately, House leadership opted for a single bill that dropped the debt ceiling issue. Democratic leaders repeatedly stated that Republicans would be responsible for getting a funding bill over the line without Democrat help, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stating on a Wednesday post on the X social media site, 'You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow.' Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, criticized Musk’s involvement in the process in a floor speech ahead of the vote. 'We need to rely on each other to keep our word, that when we have an agreement, we keep that agreement,' she said. However, both Democrats ended up voting for the bill. Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., implored Democrats to consider funding measures that included in the bill on their own merits, not what had been stripped out from the previous bipartisan agreement. 'If you vote no on this bill, you are effectively voting to shut down the government,' he said. 'These are things that we agree on, and there is nothing in this bill certainly that my friends on the other side disagree with.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/continuing-resolution-with-14b-in-submarine-funds-survives-house-vote/	2024-12-20T15:14:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231108_DVIDS_submarine_construction_820194-e1699443296744.jpg
Spain orders 25 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, links arms on Turkish trainer	Spain is set to operate a total of 115 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets after placing a new order for the fourth generation type (Airbus) BELFAST — Spain has signed off on an order for 25 Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation fighter jets under its Halcon II program. A contract between the Spanish government and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) was inked today and covers the acquisition of 21 single-seat and four twin-seat aircraft. The Eurofighter consortium said in a statement that deliveries to the Spanish Air and Space Force will take place between 2030 and 2035. 'The Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon jets will replace part of the legacy F-18 fleet, based in Torrejon and Zaragoza, and bring the total number of Typhoon aircraft in the Spanish Air Force to 115,' it added. In a related statement, Airbus, which builds all Spanish Air Force Eurofighters out of its Getafe site, said that the 'new aircraft will: boost Spain’s air-power capabilities and operations; reinforce its prominent position at the heart of NATO, and secure the programme’s industrial footprint.' Halcon is Spain’s national two-phase acquisition program to replace all F/A-18C/D Hornets, split between the already contracted $2.15 billion Halcon 1, covering 20 aircraft, and the new second batch order. The Halcon II effort, valued at €4.6 billion ($4.8 billion), was cleared by Spain's Council of Ministers in 2023. Alongside aircraft, the program also covers engines and support services. Gen. Javier Salto Martínez-Avial, chief of the Spanish Air and Space Force has long pressed for the Halcon II order not to be delayed, warning last year that deliveries could take 10 years. Halcon aircraft are to be equipped with state of the art avionics, electronically-scanning radar (E-Scan), and weapon systems that can support launch of Brimstone III and Full Meteor missiles, alongside new sensors and improved connectivity, according to Airbus. Separately, Spain has also decided to partner with Turkey to support development of the Hurjet advanced jet trainer. A Memorandum of Understanding for the collaboration was signed today between the Spanish Ministry of Defence and the Turkish Presidency of Defence Industries. The move could lead to Madrid acquiring the platform as a replacement for Northrop SF-5M aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/spain-orders-25-additional-eurofighter-typhoon-fighter-jets-links-arms-on-turkish-trainer/	2024-12-20T11:45:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/pm_38_677_677584-e8nd1ey288-scaled-e1734715882530.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: New Air Force review supports manned 6th-gen NGAD fighter concept	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — A recent internal Air Force analysis supports the development of a manned, next-generation fighter jet, three sources told Breaking Defense — a finding that comes amid a high-profile debate over the future of the multi-billion-dollar Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. While the Trump administration will make the final decision of whether to press forward with NGAD, which was paused earlier this year, the review’s results could strengthen the case to keep the program alive and award a contract for the future fighter. In a statement to Breaking Defense today, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall did not dispute that the overall conclusion of the analysis supports a next-gen manned fighter, though he did caution that other factors including cost would determine its outcome. 'While our analysis does demonstrate that there is value in a next generation crewed platform, the current NGAD design comes at high total and unit costs that may be unaffordable,' Kendall said. 'Our analysis also highlights that there may be significant opportunity costs associated with proceeding with NGAD, given the DAF’s [Department of the Air Force] strategic priorities and the potential level of Air Force and Space Force budgets. There are a number of interdependencies and alternative options at various risk and resourcing levels which the next administration will have to consider before making a decision. All options remain on the table,' he added. The NGAD program was temporarily suspended as the Air Force weighed whether it could afford an expensive next-generation fighter in light of ongoing budget constraints, the breakneck pace of adversary threats, and technological progress on competing spending priorities, especially a budding effort to field drone wingmen dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft. The CCA wingmen are expected to be a critical force multiplier for manned Air Force aircraft and have been described as a key component of the envisioned NGAD family of systems. Kendall said in public comments Thursday that other concerns also influenced the delay, like how the platform would fit into the service’s Agile Combat Employment — a method of dispersing operations to avoid a crippling attack, relying on a network of bases officials fret may not have adequate defenses. The service is also weighing what elements are needed to support an NGAD fighter, like a next-gen tanker, whose fate is currently in limbo. Air Force leaders decided to use the fall to review the NGAD concept, calling in help from former officials and researchers to conduct additional analysis. The process was expected to wrap up in time to inform the Air Force’s fiscal 2026 budget request, though the service recently announced it would punt a decision on the platform’s fate to the incoming Trump administration. Without sharing the results, Kendall said publicly Thursday that the NGAD analysis was 'mostly done' with the caveat that the new Trump team 'may want some additional analysis when they show up.' He noted that the Air Force is 'very close to being ready to proceed if that program continues its current form.' The Air Force’s NGAD hesitancy sent shockwaves through the defense industry, which after a decade of development was gearing up for a decision on the jet originally expected this year. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are believed to be the prime contractors vying for the jet’s lucrative contract, which would likely be the world’s first sixth-gen fighter. RELATED: As Air Force deliberates sixth-gen fighter plans, much at stake for Boeing A next-gen fighter effort also carries profound implications for the engine industrial base. The NGAD platform is the only aircraft publicly planned to use an 'adaptive' powerplant, which could offer leaps in fuel efficiency and thrust. GE Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney are competing to build the NGAD engine under a program called Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion. While the Air Force’s analysis substantiates the requirement for a sixth-generation fighter, it’s unclear whether the service will be able to find the funding to continue development of the NGAD aircraft and engine given significant budget pressure from other programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the B-21 Raider stealth bomber and the nuclear-tipped Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system, whose price recently ballooned by 81 percent. Kendall told Breaking Defense earlier this year he was confident that a sixth-generation fighter would be built, though he left the door open to an optionally manned version. Kendall said the operational challenges, primarily due to the rise of China, have been defined by an 'accumulation of threats,' noting that Cold War-era assumptions can no longer hold. 'We’re not up against the Soviet Union anymore,' Kendall said. 'We’re up against China, primarily, as the pacing challenge. And we’ve got to be sure we’re doing the right thing.' How the incoming Trump administration will handle the NGAD issue is unknown. President-elect Donald Trump has yet to name his nominee for Air Force Secretary, but Elon Musk — an influential associate of Trump who will run his Department of Government Efficiency initiative — has made his views clear. '[M]anned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones,' Musk recently posted on X, the social media platform he owns.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/exclusive-new-air-force-review-supports-manned-6th-gen-ngad-fighter-concept/	2024-12-20T11:06:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
State of Play: Industry readying for second chance at US Navy’s frigate program	One of the bays of 'Building 34' at Fincantieri Marinette Marine. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The Navy’s search for a second Constellation-class frigate shipbuilder has officially commenced, and the top shipbuilders in industry have begun staking out their positions for what will likely be another high-profile competition. The service last month put out a call to industry to start determining which shipyards might be capable of building the Constellation-class frigate, the first batch of which were awarded to Wisconsin-based shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine in 2020. Since then, the service has engaged in private discussions with at least six shipbuilders, and a contract could come in fiscal 2027, USNI News reported. It was not immediately clear which companies began discussions with the service, and a Navy spokesman declined to make that information public when contacted by Breaking Defense this week. Government RFIs are not legally binding, meaning the Navy has the right to discontinue its search at any time, but that scenario is unlikely. Since the 2020 award to Fincantieri, lawmakers — particularly those who represent constituents that work in shipyards — have pressed service officials year after year to select a second shipyard. That pressure is compounded by a review of Navy shipbuilding programs earlier this year by Secretary Carlos Del Toro, which acknowledged the current frigate program is already facing steep delays — up to three years in the worst-case scenario. Breaking Defense reached out for comment from the four shipbuilders who, alongside Fincantieri, sought the first frigate contract, as well as one potential new entrant to the competition. At the top of that list are Austal USA, based in Mobile, Ala., and HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, located just down the road in Pascagoula, Miss. Both shipyards have long histories building surface combatants for the US Navy, and executives from those companies have previously been vocal in their interest in vying to be the second frigate builder. For Austal, the award would add to an already growing and increasingly busy portfolio. The shipyard has picked up numerous contracts, including work on submarines, in recent years and is in the middle of both expanding its facilities as well as its workforce. RELATED: In expansion, Austal USA undergoes &#8216;unique evolution' beyond a two-trick shipbuilder 'We are aware of and tracking the Navy’s plan for a second builder for the frigate and will continue to assess the opportunity as it develops,' said Larry Ryder, vice president at Austal USA for business development and external affairs. Kari Wilkinson, the chief at HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, told Breaking Defense earlier this year her yard has plenty of space for new work, but ramping up the labor force to meet a larger workload will be the challenge, an issue facing many of the country's shipbuilders right now. 'Ingalls is committed to supporting our customer in ways that align to our shared objectives. We are interested in the discussions surrounding the frigate program and will continue to follow the Navy’s acquisition strategy development,' Kimberly Aguillard, spokeswoman for HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, told Breaking Defense. RELATED: At Ingalls, plenty of space for shipbuilding but ramping up workforce will be the challenge Like its competition in the south, Maine-based shipbuilder General Dynamics Bath Iron Works has a long history building surface combatants — primarily Arleigh Burke-class destroyers — for the Navy. That yard was also a known bidder in the original competition to design and build Constellation class. A company spokesperson declined to comment for this story, citing the open competition. Lockheed Martin participated in early frigate design refinement contracts alongside Bath Iron Works, Austal, HII and Fincantieri. Its bid would have hinged on a partnership with Fincantieri — where the frigate would be constructed — and using a design derived from the Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship, a separate Navy program also stemming from a Lockheed-Fincantieri partnership. Prior to the Navy making its final award, Lockheed opted out of the competition, citing a desire to focus its efforts elsewhere. 'Lockheed Martin will not compete for future FFG-62 construction but will support any prime shipyard as the system integrator of current or future US Navy capabilities,' a company spokesman told Breaking Defense this week. Rounding off this list is the Louisiana-based Bollinger Shipyards. That company did not compete for the original frigate contract, but was mentioned by Rear Adm. Kevin Smith, a Navy officer overseeing the program, last week as a potential second yard alongside the other shipbuilders contacted for this story. Bollinger is known for its work building US Coast Guard cutters as well as several Navy auxiliary ships. In 2022, its acquisition of Mississippi-based Halter Marine resulted in Bollinger taking ownership of the Polar Security Cutter program, a top Coast Guard priority to produce new American heavy icebreakers for the first time in decades. A spokesman for that shipyard did not respond to questions from Breaking Defense by press time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/state-of-play-industry-readying-for-second-chance-at-us-navys-frigate-program/	2024-12-20T09:57:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Building-34-e1681842275366.jpeg
Pentagon’s cybersecurity mandate CMMC 2.0 likely to survive under Trump	cyber security, digital crime concept, data protection from hacker (Getty images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to slash government regulations once he comes into office in January, but there’s at least one Defense Department provision that industry figures, and one key Pentagon official, say is likely safe from the deregulation campaign: CMMC 2.0. CMMC 2.0, or the second iteration of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, is a framework that essentially mandates that companies who do business with the Pentagon must themselves achieve a base level of cybersecurity, subject to external audit. 'CMMC was initially started under the first Trump administration,' Stacy Bostjanick, the chief of defense industrial base cybersecurity in the DoD's office of the chief information officer, said in November. 'We have made such progress, and so many people recognize the need for it. It endured, and we went through and did the proper rule making steps to make it, to memorialize it. I don't see it going anywhere.' Similarly Eric Crusius, a partner and CMMC compliance specialist at Holland&amp;King LLP, said, 'You'll probably see regulations melting away in other areas, such as environmental rules or labor.' But 'with respect to cyber security, I think we'll see a continuation of the policies that the Trump administration originally started because I think a priority for them is to protect our information from our adversaries, at least that's their stated priority, and this is consistent with that,' he told Breaking Defense. CMMC 1.0 was established in January of 2020 during Trump’s first term. Plans for an updated version, CMMC 2.0 were announced in December of 2023 under President Joe Biden and set new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information (CUI). CMMC 1.0 had a five-level scale for compliance, while CMMC 2.0 has a three-level scale. Additionally, a third-party assessment is being introduced depending on the level of CUI a contractor handles. Contractors at Level 1, who handle 'basic' protection of CUI and some contractors at Level 2 who handle 'general' CUI protection can undergo self-assessments to ensure they are CMMC compliant. The remaining contractors who classify as Level 2 and all Level 3 contractors have to undergo a third-party assessment. Earlier this week a final 'rule' for CMMC 2.0 went into effect, called the 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This rule gives the Pentagon the authority to establish and enforce cybersecurity requirements through the CMMC framework, essentially defining the CMMC 2.0 program itself. The next outstanding rule, 48 CFR, outlines how the CMMC 2.0 compliance will be integrated into DoD contracts, basically making the program a mandatory requirement. This rule will likely be released in the spring or summer of 2025, Bostjanick said. In summary, 32 CFR sets the standards and 48 CFR enforces those standards within contracts. (Bostjanick said that companies should not wait for the 48 CFR to come out to get their assessments completed.) In order to avoid a scramble to meet the new regulations with little notice, those requirements won't become mandatory until after a three-year phase-in period. Though some companies have expressed concern over the burden the cybersecurity regulations will put on them, Crusius said CMMC under Biden actually loosened a bit, paving a smoother road for a Trump administration to keep much of it in its current form. 'It was actually made a little bit more business friendly, I'd say, under the Biden administration,' said Cruisius, whose firm assists DoD contractors with being CMMC compliant. 'My sense is that based on the platform that the Trump administration ran on, is that this will continue to stay in place.' Similarly, Corey Bieber, a partner at K&amp;L Gates, told Breaking Defense that given the current climate of cyber threats, he doesn’t see a reason why the Trump administration would backtrack CMMC. 'This is meant to combat cyber security threats, but specifically advanced persistent threats, as mentioned in CMMC. I think that those threats are more real than ever and I don't imagine that the new administration is going to be backing off on investment in the Department of Defense in general when it comes to weapons,' he said. 'So why would they back off when it comes to protecting their cyber assets?' CEO of CyberSheath Eric Noonan, told Breaking Defense that the types of cyber related adversarial threats the US sees particularly from China is one reason Trump won’t diminish CMMC 2.0. 'It was actually President Trump's administration that came up with CMMC and recognized the fact that we are under attack, largely by countries like China, as you saw with the recent telecom attack. What we've been doing isn't working.' 'The Trump administration has a very strong track record of doing things to strengthen the supply chain, to strengthen cybersecurity, particularly when defending against the threat of China,' he later added. Not everyone is so sure that CMMC 2.0 is sticking around. Quentin Hodgson, formerly the Pentagon’s director of Cyber Plans, told Breaking Defense that given the fact that Republican administrations tend to scale back on regulations, CMMC 2.0 requirements could be reduced. 'It's possible that the new administration could decide to relook at that and say this is too high a burden or not the right way to approach improving cybersecurity standards in the defense industrial base,' Hodgson said of CMMC 2.0. 'I could see where there would be a relook at some of those things that were seen as maybe from a Republican or conservative point of view ... more heavy handed than it needed to be with respect to the private sector,' he added. Somewhere in the middle of these opinions lies Emily Harding, vice president of the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Harding told Breaking Defense that she doesn’t think that the concept of CMMC is 'perfect,' but it wouldn’t be the right call to get rid of the program entirely. 'You need something along the lines of a certification mechanism or an auditing mechanism. The general thought in the cyber security community is that you don't want a compliance checklist, because then people just study for the test. You get to the point where you can check all the boxes off the checklist, and then not beyond that,' she said. 'Is CMMC perfect? No, however, you wouldn't want to get rid of any kind of requirements at all, because I think that would have the opposite effect that you're going for. This is one of those sort of technical questions that I would expect the Trump administration won't tackle until they have people in place who actually understand it.' Trump’s transition team did not respond to Breaking Defense’s questions with regard to plans for CMMC.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagons-cybersecurity-mandate-cmmc-2-0-likely-to-survive-under-trump/	2024-12-20T08:24:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_cybersecurity_locks_GettyImages-1279388417-scaled-e1671476062691.jpg
As Air Force lays out Force Design, top strategist warns service is ‘underfunded’ to face China	U.S. and Allied aircraft conduct an elephant walk on Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, July 19, 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Michael Cossaboom) WASHINGTON — After sketching out a rough map of the world, Lt. Gen. David Harris, the Air Force officer charged with crafting his service's future concepts and strategies, started to illustrate the 'threat intensity' around the globe as he sees it — in this case, depicted as a line graph above the map. The line stayed low as it passed over the Western Hemisphere, but rose steadily as it moved east to reflect the military prowess of America’s adversaries, beginning its climb near Eastern Europe and the Middle East and peaking above China’s east coast — where officials worry US troops might be called up to defend Taiwan and repel a Chinese invasion. 'And then all of a sudden you get into where China is and Taiwan, and we see a spike, and it goes up,' Harris said in a recent interview at the Pentagon. In the past, the Air Force would design forces to 'find whatever the highest threat was' in order to 'cover every contingency known to man,' he said. But the range of threats today — especially the growing military power of China — requires new thinking. Ultimately, however, to make plans viable requires one thing above all else. 'Candidly,' Harris said, 'the Air Force is underfunded to do the things that we need to do.' Harris is not alone in raising concerns about resources the service requires to do its job, but his comments underline a challenge facing Air Force leaders. After helping to craft a new 'Force Design,' Harris has handed officials a framework for thinking differently about the service’s operations in light of new threats — one that must eventually map onto physical realities, like what kinds of aircraft could be employed and in what number. And that’s where the money comes in. Luckily for Harris and his colleagues, they may find congressional support, particularly under a new GOP majority. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for example, recently championed 'a full-scale rebuilding of the shrinking US Air Force' including by 'supercharg[ing] production' of the B-21 Raider. It all means that the Trump administration's first budget request could end up being the defining factor for how the Air Force’s new Force Design is employed, including what capabilities can be brought to bear within it. A largely conceptual framework — the document itself has not been publicly declassified, though some of its key attributes have been shared in an unclassified summary [PDF] — the new Force Design sets out three different 'mission areas,' whose attributes differ based on the threat environment. Filling out those mission areas then requires devising a force structure, building out specifics like the number of fighter jets needed for a scenario. The mission area construct was created, in part, to be a better steward of taxpayer dollars, Harris said, while emphasizing that the Force Design largely eschews specific platforms. 'This is a design. I'm not talking about force structure. I'm not talking about like, ‘B-21s are the only thing that can survive in here.’ It could be something completely different,' he said. 'You can have multiple force structures being able to meet [mission areas] at different price points in time. There's no one force structure.' The first mission area, called Mission Area 1, features capabilities that can 'live within and generate combat power from the dense threat area which will be under constant attack,' according to the Air Force’s summary. Here, pointing to a scenario like a battle in the Taiwan Strait, Harris said that extremely exquisite or highly attritable platforms — think stealth fighters and drones, respectively — will tend to play a leading role. 'The Mission Area 1 forces and what can go into there, it's highly dependent on the attributes of it. And I would say survivability is the biggest piece of that,' he explained. 'You can see how dense of a threat that is. Obviously, we put things in there that are survivable. Or the opposite end of the spectrum, attritable. Don't care if they're lost.' Deputy chief of Staff for Air Force Futures Lt. Gen. David Harris takes part in a panel discussion at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Air, Space &amp; Cyber Conference, National Harbor, Md., Sept 17, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya) Mission Area 2 features capabilities with sufficient ranges to 'operate from the defendable area of relative sanctuary beyond the umbrella of most adversary ballistic and cruise missiles or attack UAVs and project fires into highly contested environments,' according to the summary. In Harris’s rough map of the world, a Mission Area 2 tasking could be required somewhere like the Middle East, or out past Taiwan’s coast into the Pacific. The third mission area covers the relatively lower threat environment that defines much of the globe, 'with position resilient to limited adversary attack,' according to the Force Design overview. This mission area 'covers your homeland defense piece of it. It covers a little bit of strategic deterrence from all the bombers and tankers and things that come out of CONUS [Continental United States] to be able to power project,' Harris said. Mission areas can also be adjusted based on emerging threats, according to Harris, like a flare-up in the Middle East or Europe, which each may present different 'force packaging options.' They’re also interrelated: Mission Area 1 taskings won’t win a war outright, but they will help halt the spread of a threat and roll it back, especially by staying connected to the broader joint force. That approach can then open up battlespace opportunities in the process, like creating a more permissive environment conducive to something like a Mission Area 2 tasking. 'So it's a phasing, it's an approach, but it's also a way of thinking about the core missions of our Air Force, and how they connect together through this mission area 1, 2 and 3 construct,' he said. But when it comes to actually building a force structure to fill in a mission area, that may require risk or more money. Harris is not alone in raising concerns about resources the service needs to do its job. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, for example, has repeatedly warned about spending limitations, recently musing that a planned next-gen tanker may not be affordable. Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin too has been vocal on the issue, saying in November, 'The force is stressed, and we're still doing our very damn best.' Air Force officials have talked for years about growing the force to meet modern threats, noted Doug Birkey, the executive director of the Mitchell Institute. Highlighting raging conflicts like Ukraine and a potential clash with China in the Indo-Pacific, 'the fundamental challenge is that you need air power and space power for everything. And the Department of the Air Force has been severely underfunded since the Cold War,' he said. Service leaders’ hands are tied by competing prioritizing like simultaneously recapitalizing the air- and -land-based legs of the nuclear triad. Funding constraints combined with technological considerations also appear to be driving a pause for the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, a platform viewed by many as critical for an Indo-Pacific fight — raising questions about what a force structure could look like in that scenario. 'I think what it does is it challenges the way that we would actually execute in a Mission Area 1, or a Mission Area 2 or a Mission Area 3. I'm not just going to put it in one bin,' Harris said during a recent forum hosted by the Mitchell Institute, when asked about the impact if NGAD doesn’t come to fruition. 'There's probably multiple force structures, some of them may not include NGAD. But I'll tell you, it's less about the platform and more about the systems and how they're coming together, and how you actually replicate the effect of what that system would have.' The funding issue looms for the fiscal 2026 budget, now in the hands of the forthcoming Trump administration. Pentagon toplines the past two years have been held down by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and some in Washington are weary that spending cuts could be in the cards if Elon Musk’s and Vivek Ramaswamy’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' gets its way. 'The DoD quiver is pretty thin, and it’s time to reset in core areas,' Birkey said. Programs like the Sentinel ICBM, Columbia-class submarines and B-21 Raider stealth bomber 'are the real answer, and they’re not cheap.' Speaking during a virtual event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies Dec. 10, Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter made a blunt assessment of the current fiscal environment, warning of the consequences if it continues. '[I]f the Fiscal Responsibility Act shapes the resource posture of the nation, we will not be able to fulfill the National Defense Strategy,' he said. Asked about funding considerations, Harris emphasized the Air Force needs more resources specifically for a high-intensity scenario like a Taiwan Strait fight. Fielding new forces and maintaining existing ones also requires sustainment dollars, with Harris pointing to upkeep of Mission Area 3. The 'primary driver' of Air Force funding constraints, Harris said, is 'the new capabilities that we need to get. But there's also funding that's needed to sustain the current capabilities within Mission Area 3.' More broadly, Harris framed the funding needs as driven by modernization, as well as ensuring capabilities are properly supported. 'If I had to categorize it, modernization costs are something that we still need,' Harris said. 'And there's even some readiness pieces in here that allow me to have the right supply and support. All of that still needs to come together.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/as-air-force-lays-out-new-force-design-top-strategist-warns-service-is-underfunded-to-face-china/	2024-12-20T07:10:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Mobility-Guardian-2023-scaled-e1691087628535.jpg
V-22s cleared to fly following operational pause, with restrictions on newest parts of the fleet	An MV-22B Osprey, assigned to the Blue Knights, of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 365, takes of from the flight deck of the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 5). (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Alan L. Robertson) WASHINGTON — Naval Air Systems Command today is clearing the V-22 Osprey fleets to continue operations following a pause put in place earlier this month, albeit with some restrictions on how the newest parts of the fleet can operate. NAVAIR, the Navy's primary agency for procuring aircraft as well as determining their airworthiness, said in a statement that it has issued a fleet bulletin directing that V-22 Ospreys be inspected prior to their next flight to 'verify flight hours on each Proprotor Gearbox (PRGB).' 'Aircraft with PRGBs that currently meets or exceeds a predetermined flight-hour threshold will resume flights in accordance with controls instituted in the March 2024 interim flight clearance (IFC),' according to the statement. 'A new IFC, containing additional risk mitigation controls, has been issued to address aircraft with PRGBs below the flight-hour threshold. These controls will remain in place until the aircraft’s PRGBs are upgraded, or the predetermined threshold is exceeded,' the statement continued. NAVAIR oversees the V-22 Joint Program Office which delivers Osprey variants to the US Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps as well as international customers. The agency declined to publish details concerning the flight-hour threshold, number of aircraft affected or additional controls, citing operational security concerns. However, a source with knowledge of the program said that the issue stems from 'inclusions' in the metal of the gearbox, common small faults that inevitably occur during the metallurgy of producing the parts for both commercial and military vehicles. The NAVAIR analysis found that these inclusions led to cracks in previous V-22 incidents — but that if the cracks don't occur early in the part's lifespan, the inclusions won't present problems down the road. In other words, if the part is going to fail, it will fail early in the lifespan of the V-22. As a result, newer V-22s will be operating under safety guidance until they hit a certain number of hours, the source said, at which point they will be able to fly normal operations. Those restrictions are built around how much time it takes to get a V-22 onto the ground safely, the source said, noting it largely means crews need to plan out their flight path and be aware of their altitude during operations in case they need to make an emergency landing, the source said. Those requirements likely won't impact operations over land but are likely to have greater impacts during sea-based operations. 'NAVAIR remains committed to transparency and safety regarding all V-22 operations. The V-22 plays an integral role in supporting our nation’s defense. Returning these vital assets to flight is critical to supporting our nation’s interests,' the statement said. The Pentagon opted to pause certain V-22 operations earlier this month following what it called a 'precautionary landing' by an Air Force Osprey, which did not result in any injuries. That incident, and now this subsequent return to flight, is the latest in a string of incidents the Osprey fleet has faced in recent years as the Defense Department has grappled with a variety of technical issues. A fatal MV-22 Osprey crash that killed five Marines in June 2022 was blamed on the gearbox, with the department working with industry to design and field a new 'proprotor gearbox input quill assembly that mitigates the unintentional clutch disengagements and hard clutch engagement events,' according to a 2023 statement. All three services were then directed to replace the gearbox input quill assemblies after an undisclosed 'predetermined flight hour threshold,' which the service at the time said 'reduces the likelihood of a hard clutch engagement occurring by 99 percent, based on the data.' Since that June 2022 incident, the Osprey has been on a roller coaster of restrictions, shutdowns and returns to flight. In August 2022, Breaking Defense first reported that the Air Force was grounding its CV-22 fleet over safety concerns with the clutch of the aircraft. At the time, the Marine Corps did not follow suit, instead insisting their pilots could compensate for the issue and had been doing so for some time. While the Air Force returned to flight weeks later, the issue re-emerged and a Pentagon-wide grounding across a 'subset' of the Navy, Air Force and Marine V-22 models was instituted in February 2023. That was followed by a November 2023 crash off the coast of Japan that killed 8 airmen, with the Osprey only returning to operations months later, albeit with restrictions on how far it can fly from a safe landing spot.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/v-22s-cleared-to-fly-following-operational-pause-with-restrictions-on-newest-parts-of-the-the-fleet/	2024-12-20T05:44:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/5173378-scaled-e1723489932887.jpg

(Photographer: Bradley C. Bower/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — South Korean conglomerate Hanwha today announced it had closed its $100 million deal to take a controlling stake of Philly Shipyard, capping off one of the company’s most aggressive moves this year to solidify its foot in the American defense industrial base. 'Hanwha Philly Shipyard begins an exciting new chapter today,' said David Kim, the newly appointed CEO of what is now called Hanwha Philly Shipyard. 'We plan to grow and build on a long tradition of success, by expanding production using advanced technologies, and supporting the national revitalization of U.S. shipyards. 'Together, we begin working toward our vision for Hanwha Philly Shipyard: to be a trusted U.S. shipbuilder, challenging and redefining sustainable maritime solutions for commercial and government clients. We intend to do that by pushing the boundaries of shipbuilding by combining people with technology to build best-in-class vessels.' RELATED: Hanwha adds Coulter as global defense head Hanwha made its initial offer to purchase Philly Shipyard, which until now was owned by the Norwegian industrial investment group Aker, in June. The shipyard, based in the eponymous city was once the site of a US Navy facility and has focused on producing container vessels and tankers under Aker’s ownership. In addition to acquiring Philly Shipyard, Hanwha this year also named Mike Smith to lead its American business unit, announced its first win of a repair contract for a US Navy ship and pursued, but ultimately dropped, a takeover bid submitted to Australian shipbuilder Austal, whose American subsidiary is a key contractor for the Pentagon. In the background of it all has been outgoing Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, who has made encouraging foreign investment into American shipyards a key element of his 'Maritime Statecraft' initiative, as reported in this deep dive Breaking Defense report. He visited Hanwha and other Asian defense industrial giants early in the year and has publicly lobbied them to bring their money, technology and talents to benefit the US Navy. Those efforts have not always been welcomed by American industry.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hanwha-closes-100m-deal-to-take-over-philly-shipyard/	2024-12-19T17:11:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/GettyImages-146565286-scaled-e1718904824503.jpg
Incoming SASC head lays out acquisition reform vision	Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) speaks to the press on January 11, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) WASHINGTON— Move over, DOGE. The incoming head of the Senate Armed Services Committee has his own thoughts about how to boost Pentagon efficiency and speed up the pace it takes to field new weapons. Sen. Roger Wicker, R_Miss., today released a report outlining key reforms the Defense Department and Congresscould make to improve the acquisition process, as well as corresponding legislation called the Fostering Reform and Government Efficiency in Defense (FORGED) Act that lays out language to implement those changes. The report and accompanying bill comes as Congress races to pass an extension of government funding before it adjourns for 2024. But while business on the Hill gets ready to wind down, Wicker’s report and legislation hints at the priorities the incoming SASC chairman could focus on in next year’s National Defense Authorization Act, as well as potentially helping to set the defense agenda before President Donald Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20. 'The Department of Defense has been doing business the same way for far too long, which has heavily damaged both taxpayer confidence and American national security. We are entering a moment where major reform is possible. My legislation offers an opportunity to maximize the use of public dollars to buy second-to-none weapons systems, adopt new technology faster, and boost competition within the defense industry. I have started a national conversation about making a generational investment. Now we need to discuss how we can spend smarter,' Wicker said in a news release. The report proposes a five-part plan for making acquisition more efficient: cutting red tape, unleashing innovation, increasing competition, enabling decisive action, and modernizing the budget process. Each of those areas contain several recommendations for policy and legislative changes needed to make the weapons buying process smoother and less bureaucratic. For instance, to decrease red tape, the report suggests paring back provisions from Title 10 that could be overly restrictive. One such example is Section 3070, which limits the amount of on-hand supplies inventory to no more than two years, a recommendation that the report states may no longer make sense given the longer lead times that have become more common. It also suggests implementing additional recommendations from the Section 809 Panel, with the report noting that only three out of 98 recommendations were actually put into action. Under increasing innovation, the report recommends providing additional authorities for Software Acquisition and Middle-Tier of Acquisition, which it says should become the default acquisition method for all programs. It also endorses getting rid of the paperwork-heavy 'Milestone A' designation and replacing it with a 'buy-before-build' process that allows for experimentation. To increase competition, the report suggests reducing barriers to having multiple sources and streamlining the parts qualification process. It also recommends turning the services’ 'program acquisition officers' into 'portfolio acquisition executives,' which oversee a group of capabilities and are able to make tradeoffs among schedule, funding, and requirements. Finally, the report recommends a wholesale restructure of the budget, consolidating induvial line items for programs into ones made for an entire portfolio, and making legislative changes that would allow the Pentagon to better mitigate continuing resolutions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/incoming-sasc-head-lays-out-acquisition-reform-vision/	2024-12-19T14:51:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240529_wicker_speech_GettyImages-1918185840-scaled-e1716998965360.jpg
‘Not a warfighter’: Air Force secretary hits back at Musk comments on canceling manned fighters	Airmen assigned to the Wisconsin Air National Guard's 115th Fighter Wing complete post-flight inspections on U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II aircraft Aug. 13, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Airman 1st Class Josh Kaeser) WASHINGTON — As his tenure overseeing the Air Force comes to an end, Secretary Frank Kendall today offered a word of advice for the incoming Trump administration: the F-35 is here to stay, and now is not the time to talk about replacing manned fighter jets with drones. The Air Force’s in-development uncrewed wingmen, dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, have made significant progress, Kendall emphasized during a virtual discussion hosted by the Mitchell Institute. But asked directly about criticism tech billionaire Elon Musk has levied at officials for continuing to buy manned fighter jets instead of drones, the outgoing secretary suggested the world’s richest man needs to stay in his lane. 'I have a lot of respect for Elon Musk as an engineer. He's not a warfighter, and he needs to learn a little bit more about the business, I think, before he makes such grand announcements as he did,' Kendall said. 'It's provocative, it's interesting. I can imagine at some point — I don't think it's centuries, by the way, I think it's more like decades — when something like he imagines can occur. But we're not there, and it's going to be a little while before we get there.' Musk, who is set to co-lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) commission that could push for defense spending cuts, has taken aim at the F-35 in particular, calling officials 'idiots' for continuing to build it. Vivek Ramaswamy, the DOGE’s other leader, has echoed Musk’s fighter jet criticisms, arguing to shift funds into other initiatives like hypersonics. And the two businessmen have already demonstrated considerable influence over congressional Republicans even before the Trump administration has taken over, spearheading a successful charge this week to torpedo a bipartisan stopgap spending deal. In contrast, Kendall argued today that canceling the F-35 would be a fool’s errand. There’s no alternative in the near-term, the secretary emphasized, which would leave the West without an in-production stealth fighter. And even if the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter proceeds, it’ll be several years before the platform is operational, and will likely only be available in smaller quantities due to its cost. 'I don’t see F-35 being replaced,' Kendall said. 'We should continue to buy it, and we also should continue to upgrade it.' Plagued by issues from its inception, the F-35 certainly has plenty of fodder for the likes of Musk. Its problems continue: After a year-long halt of deliveries, prime contractor Lockheed Martin can now deliver upgraded versions of the jet, but those won’t be combat capable until next year at the earliest. Although largely a defender of the F-35, Kendall has also been a staunch critic of the jet’s problems after a long history with the program, particularly as the Pentagon’s former top acquisition official under the Obama administration. And according to Kendall, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. 'We need better performance out of Lockheed, quite honestly. They’re not delivering what they have been promising, and they're not doing it as fast as they could by a wide margin,' he said. 'We are committed to delivering the world’s most advanced aircraft — the F-35 — and its unrivaled capabilities with the government and our industry partners,' Lockheed said in a statement. 'As part of that, we are investing over $350 million in our company’s enterprise engineering developmental systems integration test capabilities, which will generate capacity and efficiency within the F-35 program as we continue to build the quarterback of the fighter force.' Still, Kendall said 'I don't think we're ready to do that yet,' and that F-35s should be added to the Air Force’s inventory at an 'affordable rate.' Many defense officials have made similar comments to Kendall, though others have been warm to Musk’s criticisms. Air Force Brig. Gen. Douglas Wickert, commander of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base, told reporters recently that fully roboticized warfare is likely 'centuries away,' stressing that important ethical considerations also need to be worked out when introducing lethal autonomy. 'I don't think it's like, believable to say you can cancel the F-35 and wait three years for the next capability,' Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf told Breaking Defense in an interview earlier this month. Remarking that there are several 'pretty questionable' capabilities the US spends money on, Schimpf said he 'probably wouldn’t' start with the F-35 but would encourage 'revisit[ing]' other programs to ensure that the 'right decisions' are being made. But Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, was more open to drones taking on a greater role. '[T]he Pentagon is stuck in saying, no, we want tanks, we want big ships, and we want, you know, jet fighters. Swarms of drones can be vastly more effective. And if Elon is willing to push that envelope and force that sort of change, I think that can make sense,' Smith said. 'Look at Ukraine,' he continued. 'If Russia could have achieved air dominance in Ukraine, they would have. They couldn't and they had a substantial advantage there. So I think thinking about that future from outside the box would be appropriate.' A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) After pausing the NGAD program earlier this year to conduct more analysis on the platform, Kendall appeared to confirm today that analysis is largely complete — though a decision about its fate still rests with the next administration. 'So we've taken a hard look at that,' he said of NGAD, adding 'we generally finished the analysis on that.' Kendall reasoned that with an election coming amidst the service’s analysis, 'I don't want to make a decision that's going to be disrupted and reversed, potentially by the new team,' which may take a different view of NGAD as well as how other factors like CCA could play a role. The secretary highlighted that although analysis is 'mostly done,' new Air Force leadership 'may want some additional analysis when they show up. But I want them to own this decision, and I don't want us to start industry down a specific course and then have to abruptly reverse that few months from now.' A decision on NGAD will be needed soon since it will be a prominent part of the service’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 budgets, Kendall said, though he noted that 'we're very close to being ready to proceed if that program continues its current form.'

New Space Force ‘International Partnership Strategy’ coming next year	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman hosts an office call to officially welcome UK Air Vice Marshal Paul Godfrey to the Space Force staff in the Pentagon, Arlington, Va., June 18, 2024. Godfrey, recently promoted to Air Marshall, is the former commander of UK Space Command and the first foreign officer to join the US Space Force command staff. (US Air Force photo by Andy Morataya) WASHINGTON — The Space Force is working on a new strategy for working with allied and partner nations to integrate their capabilities into US plans for future warfighting, starting from early concept development of needed capabilities and running through wargames and exercises, according to the project's leader. 'I am leading the charge for an International partnership strategy that hopefully will be out on the streets at some point in the next year,' Air Marshal Paul Godfrey, the British officer who serves as assistant to Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and is responsible for future concepts and partnerships, said on Wednesday. Saltzman in July appointed Godfrey, the outgoing head of UK Space Command to the position, marking the first time a foreign officer has been assigned to such a high position within a US service. Further, Godfrey told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) that his remit includes ensuring that there are clear 'touch points' for allies and partners to interact with the nascent Space Force Futures Command. Speaking with reporters on Dec. 11 at the Space Force Association's Spacepower Conference in Orlando, Godfrey explained that the goal is to allow allies and partners to have a hand in 'shaping' thinking at Futures Command from 'the beginning' about everything 'from the good ideas to all through the end' of the process, 'where hopefully you get an integrated-by-design architecture for operations, training, exercising and capability.' The goal is to ensure that by the 2035 timeframe, there will be budget alignment between the US and its close partners that works to fill gaps in their combined space capabilities, he said. Thus, Godfrey noted he is working closely with the service's task force for setting up the new command, being overseen by Lt. Gen. Shawn Bratton, Space Force deputy chief of space operations, strategy, plans, programs and requirements. Futures Command will expand upon the work previously done by the Space Warfighting Analysis Center (SWAC) by looking holistically at future requirements for 'the objective force' — the desired architecture of the Space Force including personnel, kit and operational concepts, Saltzman told CSIS in his fireside chat during the Wednesday event celebrating the service's fifth birthday. This includes taking into account things like 'the training infrastructure, the operators, the manpower requirements,' he said. 'So, what we're doing with futures is establishing all of those processes so that by the time you define the objective force, it's all the things the service needs to invest in in order to make sure we have capabilities on the other side,' Salzman elaborated. 'I really hope to establish a command element, a headquarters with a commander, early next year, and &#8230; I told them I was going to task them by the summer — so, [to do] whatever it takes to get up and running so you can start accepting taskings by next summer,' he added. 'Allied by design' has been one of the Space Force's mantras over the past year for its acquisition plans, with service leaders reviewing everything from classification protocols and data sharing processes to open up space system development collaboration with allied and partner governments, as well as industries. Those efforts, however, have been somewhat slow to bear fruit, with classification remaining a key obstacle.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/new-space-force-international-partnership-strategy-coming-next-year/	2024-12-19T11:34:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Air-Marshall-Paul-Godfrey-and-CSO-Chance-Saltzman-July-12-2024-e1720800175212.jpeg
Germany flexes submarine muscle with additional 4 boat order	Concept art of the German-Norwegian 212CD submarine (TKMS) BELFAST — Germany has opted to substantially boost its subsurface capabilities by tripling an order for new ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) 212CD (Common Design) submarines as part of an existing joint procurement with Norway. A contract to acquire four of the conventionally powered, diesel electric boats on top of two units already on order was signed off by Germany's procurement office today. The wider effort could also see Norway committing to an additional two vessel order, according to the office. The two European nations first linked arms on the joint acquisition in 2021, amounting to six subs in all, and valued at approximately €5.5 billion ($5.7 billion). The German parliament approved the increased 212CD buy on Wednesday, alongside a raft of other new defense spending commitments amounting to €21 billion. These include kickstarting procurement of Class 127 frigates, reactive armor for Puma Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) and additional Patriot missiles, as well as acquisition of Israel's Elbit Systems’ Precise and Universal Launching System (PULS) rocket artillery, according to an online statement from the Federal Ministry of Defence (BMvG). TKMS welcomed the decision by Berlin to order additional vessels, and noted it is 'receiving with this comprehensive order expansion in the current 212CD program one of the largest orders in the recent history of the company,' according to a company statement. It also said that the 'ongoing production of the existing 212CD submarines for Germany and Norway is on schedule.' TKMS is set to deliver the first German vessel in 2032 and the Norwegian Navy is expected to receive its first boat in 2029. To expand production capacity, TKMS has already invested more than €250 million in its Kiel facility. The company also said of the new order that it 'will involve advance payments that will have a positive impact on cash flow in the current financial year and will be used accordingly for the milestones of the order.' TKMS CEO Oliver Burkhard added, 'With the expansion of the 212CD order, other countries could join this project in the near future.' According to German Armed Forces literature, the new class of sub is 'designed to process an enormous amount of sensor data, which gives the crew new options for the compilation of situation pictures while enhancing the ability to network with allied units.' It also notes that the acoustic signature of the sub 'has been significantly reduced by comparison [to the 212A Class] and is designed to prevent discovery by potential adversaries in spite of the improvements in detection procedures.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/germany-flexes-submarine-muscle-with-additional-4-boat-order/	2024-12-19T10:29:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Type-212CD-Submarine-thyssenkrupp-Marine-Systems-scaled-e1734630736502.jpg
White House charges Pentagon to develop cislunar monitoring tech, including for ‘planetary defense’	Cislunar space is the region beyond Earth's orbit all the way out to the Moon. (Image: NASA) WASHINGTON — While a new White House action plan for forwarding cislunar science and technology leans largely on NASA to lead the charge, it also taps the Defense Department to spearhead development of capabilities to keep watch on activity in the vast area of space between the Earth and Moon. DoD, with the assistance of NASA and the Commerce Department, are tasked to 'identify and prioritize research and development needed to support extension of U.S. SSA [space situational awareness] capabilities into Cislunar space, to include aiding planetary defense, improved debris population modeling, and detection, tracking, and characterization of satellites in the Cislunar volume,' according to the National Cislunar Science and Technology Action Plan [PDF]. This includes taking the lead in the development of new, and/or improvement of current, ground- and space-based sensors for monitoring the cislunar region. In particular, the plan notes that the Pentagon should assess the value of putting new satellites in 'novel orbits' to monitor satellites and space debris near the Moon. Senior leaders of US Space Command and the Space Force have long said that while not an immediate priority, the service sees future military activity in cislunar space as inevitable as commercial opportunities for exploiting the Moon and its environs become more feasible due to the march of technology. Indeed, the Space Force already has committed small amounts of early research funds to exploring how to monitoring satellites at the semi-stable Lagrange points between the Earth and the Moon. DoD further is to spearhead efforts to 'evaluate the efforts and technology gaps of commercial and international contributors' to cislunar SSA, as well as 'identify and prioritize technology in support of the ground network and infrastructure, including processing, data management and exchange, and personnel needed to support and sustain' future cislunar SSA capabilities. The White House S&amp;T plan, along with a new policy on the establishment of 'lunar reference systems' [PDF] was announced by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Tuesday. Both are 'actions to advance the goals' outlined in the November 2022 National Cislunar Science and Technology Strategy. Lunar reference systems essentially are the models and tools needed to map the Moon's surface and other geological parameters and create a time standard since time runs differently on the Moon due to the laws of physics — baseline science that enables positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) just as on the Earth. The policy creates an interagency task force, let by NASA and including DoD, to undertake the job. Similarly, the Biden administration in April issued a policy and empowered a NASA-led task force 'to establish time standards at and around celestial bodies other than Earth.' Within the national defense community, it is the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency that is responsible for such activities. NGA on Tuesday announced the release of a new World Magnetic Model, 'which is critical for keeping GPS accurate due to shifts in the earth’s magnetic field.' The White House plan stresses that the goal of US cislunar policies and activities are aimed at developing the 'infrastructure that will be necessary to sustain a global presence' — in line with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that prohibits any one nation from claiming territory in space or on the surface of celestial bodies. 'The United States is committed to the safe, transparent, and sustainable exploration and use of Cislunar space for peaceful purposes,' the plan states, noting that the plan itself 'should be updated periodically to incorporate changing priorities, the perspectives of our international partners, and to remain aligned with the expanding pace of Cislunar development undertaken by all space faring nations and entities.' However, the stability of that US commitment may be in question with the incoming Trump administration. For example, former Trump White House liaison to NASA Greg Autrey and former Republican congressman Robert Walker in August penned an op-ed in Space News that suggested abandonment of the Outer Space Treaty, considered the magna carta of space and signed by 137 of the 193 UN member states.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/white-house-charges-pentagon-to-develop-cislunar-monitoring-tech-including-for-planetary-defense/	2024-12-19T09:51:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/441_420_MoonRotationSVSthumb.png
Preparing the industrial base for when the Army’s FLRAA tiltrotor is built at scale	Bell's V-280 Valor is the US Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft. (Bell) With the Future Long Range Attack Aircraft (FLRAA), the Army is introducing a new developmental aircraft type for the first time in decades. That creates myriad challenges for not only the prime contractor but for individual supply chains associated with the aircraft, the powerplants, and the digital backbone. Breaking Defense discussed the role of the industrial base in Future Vertical Lift with FLRAA Project Manager Col. Jeffrey Poquette. Breaking Defense: Before we get into the industrial base discussion, where does the FLRAA program stand at this moment in time? Jeffrey Poquette: FLRAA had its Milestone B decision back in the summer, which kicked off a lengthy phase in the acquisition program called EMD, Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Over the next year we're focused on getting to the critical design of the aircraft – all the exact things that Bell will use to produce the aircraft prototypes that we’ll then use for tests. All of that will inform a Milestone C decision in 2028, which is to make a decision on production of actual fieldable aircraft. What are the supply chain and logistical challenges of introducing a new aircraft type like a VTOL? The last developmental rotorcraft [in the Army was] about 40 or so years ago. So, yes, there are challenges and at the forefront are the industrial base and supply chain risk. This was highlighted during COVID, how fragile the supply chains are – everything from cars to electronics. On the defense side, we've seen it with ammunition and now with aircraft, which is a very complex weapon system with a lot of components. I wouldn't say that there are unique challenges particular to a tiltrotor. A tiltrotor is a kind of rotorcraft, a helicopter is a kind of rotorcraft, and both of them have complex supply chains that we have to manage carefully. Ensuring a resilient supply chain has been at the forefront of this program for many years now. We've stood up a supply chain risk management team that looks at everything from the raw materials, to finished products and subcomponents [at] the lowest level in the supply chain. As we work with industry to ensure we have that resilient supply chain, one of the ways that we control that is through something called a ‘consent to subcontract’, which is relatively new. [For example,] when Bell wants to subcontract with a supplier, they have to prove out a number of things, and one is supply chain resilience and risk level. My team then assesses it and before I sign off on that consent, we take a look at supply chain risk management. All programs have supply chain risks, and we've learned from that over the years and leaned forward early in the program to ensure that we have the mechanisms in place to carefully and appropriately manage a supply chain together with our industry partners. Army Col Jeffrey Poquette is the Army's FLRAA program manager. What are some of the key capabilities that you're looking for in this consent-to-subcontract process? What does industry need to show you? Hypothetically, if there was a material that was a particularly rare resource or difficult to obtain, we would manage that carefully, ensuring that there's multiple sources of supply. We also do Manufacturing Readiness Assessments, or MRAs, which we've done since before our Preliminary Design Review. When we look to industry's role, they know their supply chain best. Typically, the Department of Defense has always been reliant on industry to provide that information. When I go out to industry engagements and meet with suppliers, one of the first things I ask them, besides the ability to protect the program, is how is their supply chain, how have they been weathering the supply chain challenges of COVID? Have they recovered from that? What have they done to multiple source their own suppliers, tiers 3 and 4 down into the supply chain? Do they have risky raw materials that they need to source from overseas, that maybe the United States doesn't have a large access to? We take a hard look at that, and then when appropriate, we suggest to Bell that if we see a particularly risky supply chain then perhaps we don't provide the consent to subcontract until they remedy or mitigate that risk. How are you working now to prepare the industrial base for the long-term production of FLRAA? What is its role over the next few years in the run up to LRIP? There's two kinds of groups of companies right now when it comes to FLRAA. [The first is] the group that's already part of Team FLRAA, the ones that Bell has selected and that the government has approved to be a part of FLRAA. The [others] are the ones who want to become part of the FLRAA ecosystem. How do they do that, what should they be getting after? Those are the questions they ask me. One of the ways that people will be able to become part of FLRAA relatively easily should they provide a great product that's competitive in price and brings great capability, is [through] our Modular Open Systems Approach. In the past, we relied heavily on OEMs to integrate new capabilities; we would have to always go back to the OEM or the aircraft provider. What our Modular Open Systems Approach does is foster innovation, competition, price competition, and it allows us to focus on what matters. As a PM, I do not want to be spending a lot of money to integrate a great capability. I want to spend money on the great capability itself. I want the juices flowing out there in industry, and for the industrial base to be competing on the things that will matter to us. I'll give you some broad categories of technologies that we look to [such as] things that reduce weight, or have lower power requirements. The lighter you can get the aircraft, the more performance you get out of it. Dual-purpose technology that might do two things rather than one unique thing is very important to us. Being able to collapse capability into a chassis and have card-based solutions, so rather than eight boxes each doing a different thing, we have one box with eight cards that can provide the capability. That speaks to SWaP. Aviation survivability is always something we're interested in. That's all enabled by our digital backbone, which are the physical components of the aircraft that allow other capabilities to integrate into. What we want to do is open the door for innovation. Industry should know that once they get on the platform they're not locked in, because that same competitive spirit and the MOSA aspect of the aircraft will allow us to move on from them, maybe three or four years later when something better comes along. How do you balance the use of new developmental technologies on FLRAA versus mature technologies with high TRL? One of the approaches with FLRAA was to focus on the aircraft itself. You may have heard me say, ‘twice as far, twice as fast’. That's new technology we're trying to mature, and then we want to mature MOSA. But everything else right now in this early iteration of FLRAA will be high-maturity mission systems that you see today on the Apache, the Black Hawk, and the Chinook. It's an iterative approach. In the past, new aircraft tried to be everything all at once to everyone, and had a lot of new technology on the aircraft. What that does is inject risk into the program, and the potential for delays and expense. By focusing on the aircraft and MOSA, we give ourselves an opportunity to succeed with less risk, and then look to the future to take advantage of MOSA and those technology categories I've mentioned. A model of the Rolls-Royce AE1107 engine on the Sea Air Space 2023 show floor. The engine is the powerplant for the MV-22, CV-22 and CMV-22 Osprey variants, as well as the engine for the Army's V-280 FLRAA tiltrotor that attained Milestone B earlier this year. (Aaron Mehta / Breaking Defense) There’s also going to be an engine supply chain to build the Rolls-Royce powerplant. What are the specific industrial base challenges associated with the engine? One of the benefits of FLRAA is that because it's a contractor-furnished powerplant, Bell has chosen an engine that exists already. There will be changes. The 1107F is the engine being developed for FLRAA, but there is a family of 1107 engines out there. The Charlie is on the V-22, and there's a version on C-130 and other aircraft. The good news is it's a mature supply chain, and although there will be changes it's not like we're developing a new engine for this aircraft. You might remember, the FARA program was developing a new engine. The Improved Turbine Engine was being developed in parallel with the aircraft. In this case, we have a mature supply chain when it comes to the powerplant. The FLRAA digital backbone is also a key element of the program. Tell us about that industrial base? The digital backbone is a combination of hardware and software, and forms a subsystem that's integrated into the aircraft that enables the networking across the aircraft. I call it the nervous system of the aircraft that allows the relay of information. A lot of the components of that are not specialized. They're switches and routers and things that move information across cables. It’s not a unique supply chain, or particularly specialized. It’s really in the software – the software that they developed to enable the relay of information so that the flight-critical data gets priority. In the past, everything was point-to-point. Things that were critical had a box and a wire that took up size, weight, and power. If you can do all that relay of information on a single network, in this case the digital backbone, you get after that SWaP issue and don't have all these computers on board. In my estimation, it's the software that's the special sauce, so to speak, in the digital backbone. The Army wants more control over the intellectual property to prevent vendor lock and to modernize capabilities over time. What systems on FLRAA do you expect to have greater IP control over? During the competition, we were very deliberate in the development of our IP strategy. Historically, one of two things happens. We never know exactly what we need and when we're going to need it. We would ask for too little, not have what we need 10 years down the road, [and] realize we don't have access to that IP. Then you’ve got to get it, which may be difficult, expensive, or even impossible. The other end of the spectrum is you don't know what you need, but you don't want to take the risk of not having it. So you ask for it all, but end up getting a lot of stuff you don't need that you pay for. How do you get that minimum amount to do exactly what you need to do? IP for the Army is focused around logistics functions like training, maintaining, sustaining. The Army is very focused on field-type maintenance, and even at the depot level we do a lot. We have the heritage of wanting to be able to do that without reliance on contractor support, especially where the Army operates deep in areas that are considered hazardous. Unlike Afghanistan and Iraq where we had relative sanctuary on bases throughout those countries and it was easy to bring contractors in there, it may not be easy to do in the future. We’ve got to be able to maintain it and sustain it. So how did we do that? Rather than ask for specific IP, we presented to the contractor what it is we wanted to do. We did that in hundreds of use cases. We need to be able to develop training materials and manuals, we need to be able to change them when it's time to change them. We need to be able to instruct and train on how to do maintenance. We know what we want to do, we just don't know what we need to do it. Who better to know what we need than the contractors themselves, whether it's Bell or the OEM of particular components? What we did was incentivize the contractors during competition to provide the most that they could in order to meet those use cases. Once we had a winner in the competition, we signed Bell up to provide all that intellectual property. You asked about controlling the IP. We're more interested in access to the IP that we need so that we can do the things we need to do. That's a key takeaway. Because of that, we've been designated [as a] Department of Defense IP Pathfinder. Broadly, industry agrees that they want the Army to have what we need in order to execute the use cases. But the specifics of that takes a lot of hard work, and we [recently] spent a week with our industrial base talking through that, getting to the right words and agreements where they can feel comfortable that what they provide us to do those things we need to do will not put them at a competitive disadvantage in the future. Our strategy does just that. We've gotten a lot of support from our higher headquarters at ASA (ALT) in the Pentagon. I, my deputy, and my logistics division chief spend a lot of time talking about this very subject, and trying to propagate the approach, which I think is novel and effective in getting access to the appropriate amount of IP while still protecting the creators of that IP.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/preparing-the-industrial-base-for-when-the-armys-flraa-tiltrotor-is-built-at-scale/	2024-12-19T09:01:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221205_bell_valor_FLARA.png
Spain’s Navantia reaches rescue deal for struggling UK shipyard Harland & Wolff	The UK Royal Navy's RFA Fort Victoria will be replaced by a fleet of three Future Solid Support (FFS) ships (UK MoD) BELFAST — The British arm of Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navantia will acquire the UK shipyard Harland &amp; Wolff in a rescue deal that Navantia says will relieve the struggling yard from administration and protect the UK Royal Navy’s £1.6 billion ($2 billion) Fleet Solid Support (FFS) contract. The two shipbuilders have been in talks since October, but a breakthrough was made today, with a deal 'expected to be completed in January 2025,' according to Navantia UK. Under terms of the buyout the firm will acquire all four of Harland &amp; Wolff’s yards. Best known for building the Titanic, the ailing shipbuilder operates two yards in Scotland (Arnish and Methil), one in England (Appledore) and one in Northern Ireland (Belfast). 'The FSS ships are important for safeguarding the UK’s aircraft carriers’ military capability by delivering vital supplies to the Carrier Strike Group, and this deal will ensure the UK’s shipbuilding capability by retaining jobs and manufacturing in the UK,' the British Ministry of Defence said in a statement, noting an 'amendment' has been made to the FSS contract. In comments shared with media, UK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said that the FSS contract change was 'relatively minor.' He defended approval of the amendment as a 'far better solution than what was on the table when we initially came to office, which would have been a loan guarantee, which I believe would have lost the taxpayer all of its money, and not deliver the ships and not secure the yards or the jobs.' Neither Navantia UK or the UK Ministry of Defence disclosed the sum paid for Harland &amp; Wolff, but a fee in the region of £70 million has been widely reportedly. Harland &amp; Wolff have not commented on the deal publicly, and after requesting comment today, Breaking Defense received an email mirroring a September statement, which at the time noted that its subsidiaries were 'not subject to the insolvency process' and directing further inquiry to administrators at corporate consulting firm Teneo. A spokesperson for Teneo declined to comment. Drawing on a number of key issues relating to the rescue deal, Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told Breaking Defense that although the deal 'is potentially a significant lifeline' for Harland &amp; Wolff, several outstanding questions remain, including that of a 'price tag' and 'what will it mean for both the share and the type of work that will go to H&amp;W as part of the FSS contract?' As for wider implications of the buyout, he shared that the 'key in the long term for the UK shipbuilding industrial base is what level of commitment there will be from this government to future orders and the shipbuilding plan it inherited and the extent to which this deal will put H&amp;W in a position realistically to compete for future work as well.' Navantia had long lobbied for the UK to improve the terms of the FSS contract, arguing such a compromise was necessary to protect the build and delivery of the three-ship procurement. The future ships are set to boost British surface fleet store based capabilities which are currently held by a single UK vessel — RFA Fort Victoria — a hull over 30 years old. The new fleet will be operated by the Royal Fleet Auxillary, the Royal Navy's logistics and support arm. Production of the new ships is slated for 2025, and all three vessels are planned to be operational by 2032. The 216-metre-long vessels are set to be constructed in Belfast, Appledore and Navantia's Puerto Real facility in Cadiz, Spain. In October, plans for the ship passed the Preliminary Design Review, a milestone that Navantia UK said 'confirmed the robustness and maturity of the design.' London initially awarded a FSS production contract in 2023 to the Team Resolute consortium, made up of BMT, a British naval design and consulting group; Harland &amp; Wolff and Navantia UK. The award followed a long-delayed and often politically bruising effort by the MoD to select a contractor for the high-dollar program. The FFS effort is one of seven 'Royal Navy Fleet of the Future' programs included in the UK's 2022 National Shipbuilding Strategy Refresh [PDF].	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/spains-navantia-reaches-rescue-deal-for-struggling-uk-shipyard-harland-wolff/	2024-12-19T08:32:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/FLEET-20201004-001-01.jpg.iCewpNzrMWATAA.zbqWc07m8N-e1734617722719.jpg
Cutting losses? Assad, Syria, and Russia’s strategic flexibility	Russian troops accompany a convoy of Syrian civilians leaving the town of Tal Tamr in the northeastern Hasakeh province via the strategic M4 highway, on January 10, 2021. (Photo by DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP via Getty Images) The collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and Russia’s decision to stand-by and allow it to occur, has been held up by some in the West as indicative of Moscow’s imperial overstretch and declining regional influence. The Kremlin’s ongoing 'special military operation' in Ukraine is clearly straining Russia’s military, the thinking goes, so much so that it could not stem the rolling rebel tide and was unable and unwilling to prop up the regime any further. As attractive as this narrative is, Western analysts should be wary of putting too much emphasis on the idea that Russia was unable to help and not enough on the simple fact that it was unwilling. It’s more likely that Vladimir Putin saw Russia’s support for Assad for what it was: a relatively low-cost, high-impact arrangement that, as rebels advanced, outlived its usefulness. Strategy is fundamentally about trade-offs, and here it appears that Moscow made a clear decision: The benefit of continuing to support the Assad regime was not worth the cost. To read further weakness into it could mean underestimating the Russian bear. RELATED: Israel seeks to defang Syria, as 350-plus strikes destroy military sites and equipment To be clear, the fall of Bashar al-Assad is undoubtedly a setback for Moscow — one on which President Vladimir Putin was notably silent during a recent annual televised meeting with military leadership. Since the 2015 intervention, the Kremlin invested considerable financial resources and political capital on Assad’s behalf. But for this investment — comparatively small when assessed against, say, the resources America has poured into the region — it gained a foothold in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean. Its naval bases in the country served as a refueling stop in the Med and a jumping off point for operations in Libya and further into Africa. Those are valuable resources to be sure, but not ones Moscow was unwilling to let go if the cost of maintaining them became too high (especially if it can negotiate with the new power brokers in Syria to keep the bases). Some were quick to point Ukraine’s impact on Russia’s operations in Syria, but this is to misunderstand Moscow’s footprint in the country. While important, it was rather limited to providing airpower and advisors, with some private military contractors, as opposed to a large ground component. Would Russia have been more willing to counter the advance of the rebels were it not engaged in the special military operation? Possibly. It may have committed additional forces to defend the Assad regime. It is, however, equally possible that the regime reached a point at which further assistance was a losing proposition. RELATED: Russian bases and Hezbollah weapons: Key questions follow fall of Syrian regime The speed with which the Assad regime collapsed reflected a decidedly weak operational and tactical situation. Any counteroffensive on behalf of the regime would have been prohibitively costly for Moscow. This would have run counter to a central organizing tenet of the operation in Syria — its comparative low cost and low casualty rate. Throughout the relationship the Assad regime also proved to be a fickle and difficult partner for the Kremlin, unwilling to engage with the opposition and attempting to balance between Russia and Iran (and one off the other). The long-term disposition of Russia’s forces in Syria remains unknown. Early reporting suggests that Russian forces are repositioning from forward operating bases to Khmeimim airbase and the port of Tartous, and potentially evacuating from the country entirely — though for how long is unknown. The immediate impact of this is apparent as US officials report that anti-Islamic State operations have become easier due to the withdrawal of Russian air defense systems. Much remains contingent on how the relationship between the Kremlin and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham evolves. The certain antipathy towards Russia for its brutality on behalf of the Assad regime, and for enabling its stay in power, will likely play some role in the evolving. Yet, there is no guarantee that Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham will seek to permanently evict Russia’s forces from the country and may seek to turn Moscow from an opponent to merely a neutral actor. Much will depend on the actions of both the United States and Israel. What message did the Kremlin’s inaction send to autocratic regimes in Africa, those propped up by Moscow’s private military companies and Russian influence campaigns? Arguably, it demonstrated that Moscow is willing to continue to support a regime so long as it is winning and able to retain power — and willing to heed the Kremlin’s advice. The point at which a regime is no longer able to do so, the Kremlin will make a strategic decision and change course. It did not leave the Assad family to its fate, offering it a lifeline back to Moscow (and the family’s not inconsiderable properties) and ensuring it will escape international justice for the foreseeable future. What African autocrat wouldn’t wish for the same comparably graceful exit from power? The fall of Assad is a setback for Russia, but also a reflection of the Kremlin’s strategic flexibility. Focusing solely on the former and missing the latter is to engage solely in wishful thinking, which risks strategic surprise both in Syria and in the Kremlin’s activities further afield. Joshua C.

Cost, payload and EW defense: Israel’s Aeronautics CEO talks the future of tactical UAVs	An Orbiter 4 UAV from Israel's Aeronautics takes flight. (Aeronautics) JERUSALEM — As militaries the world over race to embrace drone warfare, the head of the Israeli defense firm Aeronautics told Breaking Defense the market is only growing for tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are bigger and more capable than most quadcopters, but smaller and much more affordable than large, long-range systems. 'We are living in interesting times. A lot of the systems we have are called to duty and are active in all aspects of the modern war theatre, locally and around the world,' Aeronautics CEO Dan Slasky said in an interview. 'We see this in the Middle East and Ukraine.' 'There are many types from quadcopters to small UAVs out there. However the ones that survive and are effective are the ones that are specially designed to survive and excel in the modern battlefield,' Slasky said. '[In] the dollar-to-mission ratio, [it] is more cost effective to have a system that is robust and can withstand jamming or counter measures.' As for payloads, Slasky said he's seen a high level of interest in drones that carry synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tech — enhancing surveillance missions by being able to 'see' through clouds and some foliage. 'We have integrated SAR radar on our systems, which brings enhanced ISR, all-weather, additional agility, real time comms and response,' he said. Once drones are packed with payloads and have gotten to a new level in terms of flight time and cost, Slasky said a third innovation is adding vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. The movement of drones into VTOL is something other companies have been focused on as well. For instance, in October Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) unveiled a new APUS line of VTOL quadcopters that it developed in partnership with Aerotor. 'There has been a big pull in army- and navy-related missions with the needs of precision landing. We’ve defined this as a strategic vector,' Slasky said. Aeronautics, a subsidiary of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is the maker of the Orbiter family of tactical UAVs, from the 29-pound Orbiter 1K to the Orbiter 5, which has a max take-off weight of 165 pounds. It's this latest version, unveiled at a defense show in Paris in 2023, that Slasky says should be able to compete with much larger, more expensive airframes that are more vulnerable to air defenses. (The company equipped the Orbiter 3 and 4 with VTOL capabilities.) Slasky claimed Orbiter 5 could take on as much as '80 percent' as those more traditional medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) systems. The Aeronautics system is already active in operations and is 'successfully performing roles that also were traditionally handled by larger MALE systems and across multiple dimensions,' he said. Aeronautics is hardly alone in attempting to capture the tactical unmanned munition market, going up against products made by Rafael's competitors at major Israeli firms like IAI and a host of international and American companies. RELATED: Meet Anduril's new loitering munitions, the firm's first (but not last) weapons program Aeronautics doesn’t disclose the cost and recent customers, which is typical of Israeli defense companies. A previous report indicated that Croatia had acquired six of the Orbiter 3 drones for $5.7 million, and Finland had acquired up to 180 drones for $31 million. Cost breakdowns are complex because contracts include many other aspects than just the drone itself, including the payloads and launchers and other details. Slasky said Israeli firms have a leg up on some of their competition because many of their systems have been used in combat. 'There are a lot of UAV companies out there but not many have proven and positive feed-back from the battlefield,' he said. While the drone market may be ripe, Slasky acknowledged some recent challenges, including France's decision to ban Israeli firms from major defense shows — a loss of a major business opportunity. 'I don’t know how to gauge what the impact was on us with the cancellation. We had a whole line up of meetings set up and customers wanted to meet us,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/cost-payload-and-ew-defense-israels-aeronautics-ceo-talks-the-future-of-tactical-uavs/	2024-12-19T06:54:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_Aeronautics_orbiter4_HANDOUT-e1734382374836.jpg
Aussie annual defense report stripped of data: ‘Kind of useless now’	Hunter class missile frigate concept art (BAE Systems Australia) SYDNEY — The Australia Department of Defence has decided to withhold large chunks of basic data for the country's annual review of its major weapons programs, in a move government auditors say results in a 'reduced level of transparency and accountability to Parliament.' The Major Program Review (MPR) comes out of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), roughly akin to the US Government Accountability Office, workinig off data provided by the defense department. However, it is not legally required, but rather produced 'in the public interest, for the benefit of users of the report inside and outside the Parliament,' as the parliamentary committee on audits is quoted in the report. But this year the DoD 'advised the ANAO of its decision that certain information relating to forecast dates, capability delivery information, variance information and risks and issues was not for publication (NFP), and would not be included in the relevant PDSSs [data sheets] for 20 of the 21 projects.' The DoD told the auditors that 'Australia’s strategic circumstances have markedly changed since the MPR was first implemented. Defense has assessed that some details, both in respect of individual projects and in aggregate, would or could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the security, defense or international relations of the Commonwealth without sanitization of the data.' The move continues a recent trend of holding back information in these reports. In the 2021-2022 edition, only four projects had that information withheld. That jumped to 12 projects for the 2022-2023 edition, and now 20 projects in the 2023-2024 edition. The auditors themselves say that 'the 2023–24 report does not provide the same level of information compared to reporting prior to 2020–21 and provides a reduced level of transparency and accountability to Parliament and other stakeholders. So, in plain English, arguably the most important information for judging the effectiveness of acquisition management for all but one of the major programs reviewed has not been made public. 'I simply see this as the latest step in defense's endless quest to see it is not held accountable for its chronic poor performance,' Marcus Hellyer, a top Australian defense acquisition and budget expert, told Breaking Defense. 'The whole thing is kind of useless now, because you can't look at individual projects.' Because of the information withheld for publication, only averages were offered for program costs and schedule performance. The report estimates 442 months in delays on the 21 programs audited, with an average schedule slip of more than two years. The approved cost of Australia's top defense projects has soared 74 percent by $41 billion from $22.8 billion. Because of the decisions to withhold specific program information, Hellyer said it is largely impossible to get useful information about individual programs. Last year's report found that delays rose substantially from 405 months in 2020-21 to 453 months in 2022-23 for the country’s 20 biggest projects under the government of Anthony Albanese. The Labor Party government has sharply criticized its predecessor’s poor management of defense acquisition and promised to do better. Defense Minister Richard Marles 'did say he was going to fix things, but how does anyone know what's broken if you don't have good data?' Hellyer asked.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/aussie-annual-defense-report-stripped-of-data-kind-of-useless-now/	2024-12-19T05:52:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/Hunter-class-missile-frigate-concept-art-scaled.jpg
Setting national security priorities in a changed world	The outcome of the recent presidential election sets the stage for the United States to reassess its military and diplomatic goals. By crafting the appropriate national security strategy, the nation avoids costly policy errors and sets the stage for proper long-term investment in its defense capabilities. The upcoming budget review should be about defining the threat, understanding the needed force to defeat it and ensuring that the industrial base is properly incentivized and capable of equipping the armed services. In an unpredictable world a strong and innovative military is essential to protect the United States and its economic interests. At $850 billion, the planned budget for FY 2025 is probably below what would be ideal, but at this level it is modest insurance relative to the resources the military protects. Government outlays for defense are just under 3% of the $28.3 trillion U.S. GDP. If we go back 10 years, defense spending was about 3.3% of GDP. Three decades ago, in 1993 when the Cold War ended, military spending was under $280 billion, or 4.1% of GDP. So, the cost to defend our nation is declining as a percentage of economic output. Looking at it another way, the total active-duty force is down from 1.8 million at the end of FY1993 to just under 1.4 million today. The DoD’s civilian workforce is 10% smaller at around 800 thousand. The U.S. has a stronger defense with fewer soldiers. Could we find ways to be more efficient, probably. Is there non-essential work being performed by the civilian workforce; of course. So, here are some thoughts on change. For the annual budget, the Pentagon should spend more time on the outliers, with a lighter touch on the recurring items, reducing bureaucratic costs. Find the levers in procurement laws that can speed up reviews and enhance oversight. Select practices that cut paperwork on recurring buys. Operating and Maintenance is 40% of the DoD budget; invest to reduce recurring costs. Craft better proposals and raise the hurdle for bid protests. Deliver the budget on time. Delay costs money and harms readiness. It’s in the national interest for all parties to work together. The ability to deliver more for proportionally less has been driven by forward-thinking leaders who recognize that strategy drives outcomes, not folks with green eyeshades. The adversary gets a vote too, so the Department of Defense needs to have a competitive fighting force while it evolves and deploys new technologies to defeat new threats. For example, it needs to kill thousand-dollar drones with directed energy systems or small projectiles, not million dollar missiles. A compelling strategic framework is Defense Secretary Rumsfeld’s vision set out in the May/June 2002 issue of Foreign Affairs. He argued that our security challenges are not as predictable as those of the Cold War. Given the advances and spread of technology, his argument is as relevant today as when he wrote it. His prescience is notable. He cited the need for more unmanned weapons, long-range systems and improved information networks. Those ideas are a reality with the B-21 bomber, the unmanned MQ-25 drone, and significant funding for software-defined radios and cyberspace activities. In addition to restructuring their industrial footprint, the industry took other actions to deliver economic value to the Pentagon and shareholders. Multi-year contracting was employed with efficiencies shared with the Pentagon. Competitive development programs were crafted to balance risk and innovation. In recent years, the Army had Night Court, a process that scrapped lower priority programs to free up about $35 billion to fund its modernization. The Pentagon has pursued partners in Silicon Valley, and it created the Defense Innovation Unit in 2015 to help the U.S. military make faster use of commercial technologies. There are many lessons from the war in Ukraine; funding and industry response to battlefield needs were faster than a budget cycle. In a related example, contracting terms could be further revised to pay for war reserve capacity. Future contracts should have a war-related surge clause. Solely employing unit costs as the metric for value misses the need for long-term preparedness. Finally, Congress, with its control of the nation’s purse strings, needs to support a concrete plan that delivers recurring and verifiable value to the public and to the Pentagon’s suppliers. Howard A. Rubel was a highly regarded sellside equity analyst for nearly 40 years, actively engaging with industry participants as it was undergoing a major transformation. Beginning in 2018, he broadened his industry experience by serving for six years as V.P. of Investor Relations for General Dynamics.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/setting-national-security-priorities-in-a-changed-world/	2024-12-19T05:19:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/shutterstock_2498849159-scaled.jpg
Lawmakers introduce bipartisan SHIPS Act to boost commercial shipping	A container ship passes under the International Gateway Bridge at the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California, US, on Monday, June 17, 2024. (Tim Rue/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers today introduced legislation aimed at strengthening the American shipbuilding and commercial maritime industries following what they characterized as 'decades of neglect.' The bill in question, dubbed the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security for America Act, is being sponsored by Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Todd Young, R-Ind., as well as Reps. John Garamendi, D-Calif., and Trent Kelly, R-Miss. Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., who has been tapped by the new Trump administration to be national security advisor, has also previously expressed support for the bill. 'This historic bipartisan proposal would restore American leadership across the oceans by establishing national oversight and consistent funding for U.S. maritime policy, incentivizing domestic shipbuilding, enabling U.S.-flagged vessels to better compete in international commerce, rebuilding the U.S. shipyard industrial base, and expanding the mariner and shipyard workforce,' according to a written statement from the lawmakers. The bill would establish a maritime security advisor within the White House tasked with coordinating inter-agency decisions for how to implement a national maritime strategy. It would also create a 'Strategic Commercial Fleet Program' focused on expanding a US-flagged international fleet to 250 ships within 10 years. The four lawmakers said that fleet currently sits around 80 ships compared to China’s 5,500. The bill would also require that government-funded cargo be moved aboard US-flagged vessels as well as requiring a portion of imported goods from China to do the same, among other things. 'We’ve always been a maritime nation, but the truth is we’ve lost ground to China, who now dominates international shipping and can build merchant and military ships much more quickly than we can,' said Sen. Kelly. 'The SHIPS for America Act is the answer to this challenge.' Outgoing Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has made commercial shipping and shipbuilding a focus area of his this year. During an event last week hosted by the American Society of Naval Engineers, he urged the new administration to continue his efforts, theorizing that the neglect the commercial shipbuilding sector has faced in recent decades presents an opportunity for the White House to boost the economy with new jobs. 'If we want to expand our economy, you've got to expand the supply chain. You’ve got to expand the number of companies that are participating in the growth of the economy itself,' he said. 'And there aren’t a lot of places where you could effectively do that here in the United States, [but] because we have abandoned the commercial shipbuilding industry since about the 1980s, that creates a new opportunity for growth in a significant way.' Given the limited time the current Congress has left in session, the bill will almost certainly need to be refiled next year before it can be considered by the relevant committees or the larger chambers. Legislation related to national security often doesn’t receive standalone votes, but rather is included in the annual defense policy bill.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lawmakers-introduce-bipartisan-ships-act-to-boost-commercial-shipping/	2024-12-19T02:30:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241218_container_ship_GettyImages-2157596020-scaled-e1734546315731.jpg
Navy picks Northrop to deliver nuclear command TACAMO aircraft	The Northrop Grumman-led industry team will deliver the E-130J for the U.S. Navy’s TACAMO mission. (Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Navy today awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Northrop Grumman to be the mission systems integrator for Navy's next-generation plane for commanding nuclear-armed forces in an emergency, beating out competitor Collins Aerospace. TACAMO is the acronym the Navy uses for the mission known as 'take charge and move out.' The new plane, dubbed the E-130J, will eventually take over that mission for the legacy fleet, the E-6B Mercury. Its purpose is to provide the chain of command a secure and reliable platform to communicate with any one of the forces encompassing the nuclear triad. 'Our TACAMO mission is foundational to our nation’s nuclear triad,' said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in a written statement announcing the contract award. 'The E-130J will carry on the proud legacy of Navy TACAMO aircraft and keep our nation safe.' Under the new contract, Northrop Grumman will integrate the mission systems needed onboard the E-130J, including the Collins Aerospace-made Very Low Frequency communications system, a critical component that allows the plane to communicate with subs deep below the ocean’s surface. The airframe will be Lockheed Martin-made C-130J-30s, a stretched version of the C-130J transport aircraft. 'The contract is for three Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and options for up to three System Demonstration Test Articles (SDTAs) and up to six aircraft in the first lot of production. Collins Aerospace and Lockheed Martin are directed subcontractors to support the integration and airworthiness,' according to the Navy statement. Northrop’s team for the contract includes Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, Raytheon’s Crescent Systems, and Long Wave Inc. 'Our performance on Navy programs like the E-2D and E-6B prove we deliver on what we promise, and we will bring this expertise in helping the Navy deliver the E-130J on time and optimized for this strategically important mission,' said Jane Bishop, vice president and general manager of global surveillance division for Northrop Grumman. As Breaking Defense previously reported, Northrop Grumman’s primary competitor for the contract was RTX-subsidiary Collins Aerospace. Collins could not be immediately reached for comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/navy-picks-northrop-to-deliver-nuclear-command-tacamo-aircraft/	2024-12-18T17:18:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/northrop-tacamo-e1734569548549.png
Providing an asymmetric advantage with quadcopters and fixed-wing VTOLs	Red Cat's Edge 130 vertical takeoff and landing drone is a Blue UAS approved military-grade system for longer-range high-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. (Red Cat photo) Red Cat’s new family of systems includes a common ground control system for three aircraft: the American-made Teal 2 quadcopter and the Edge 130 Blue, a VTOL fixed-wing system – both of which are on the Defense Innovation Unit’s Blue List – and a new FANG line of first-person view (FPV) drones of different sizes and capabilities. We discuss the asymmetric advantage of these systems with Red Cat Founder and CTO George Matus. Breaking Defense: Tell us about Red Cat and its two main subsidiaries: Teal Drones and FlightWave. Red Cat Founder and CTO George Matus. George Matus: Red Cat is a drone technology company founded by our CEO Jeff Thompson in 2018. We develop robotic hardware and software primarily for U.S. government and NATO allies. Our mission is to provide critical situational awareness and enhance the effectiveness and safety of military and security operations around the world. Red Cat provides American-made technology products to the drone industry through its two wholly owned subsidiaries: Teal Drones and FlightWave. Red Cat acquired Teal in September 2021. Teal is a Salt Lake City-based drone company that I founded in 2015. Post acquisition, Teal started to evolve from our roots in consumer drones to address the needs of public safety and national security use cases. Our company built the first mass produced drone built entirely in the U.S., with Department of Defense compliant components, and today has a factory staffed with over 100 employees. In the summer of 2024, Red Cat acquired FlightWave Aerospace Systems. This was a strategic move to build out a family of small unmanned systems. FlightWave is an industry leader in Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) drone, sensor and software solutions. This acquisition brought the Edge 130, a Blue UAS approved military-grade system into Red Cat’s product line. The strategy was to expand Teal’s capabilities with extended range and endurance, additional payloads, and broader use in maritime environments. What’s the significance of being on the Blue List? Teal was one of the first Blue UAS-approved companies going as far back as 2020. The Blue UAS effort was started by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to establish a trusted supply of drones to the U.S. Government. This stamp of approval means being compliant in both supply chain and cyber security, and follows a regimented process to ensure a company and its products meet all of the associated requirements. Teal was the first U.S. company to ever mass produce this category of drone in America and was prepared to be part of Blue UAS as soon as the program was created. What’s driving the requirements for quadcopters? What are the missions and payloads they’re most suited for? Quadcopters are being used for many different use cases across enterprise, public safety, and defense. Teal’s products are dual-use such that they can be deployed across each of these verticals. Specific to defense, we’re now seeing that drones are currently the most impactful technology in war. When we consider what to design and build, we essentially combine three methods: first we listen carefully to end-users and their feedback, we design toward official requirements provided by our government customers, and third we use our experience to fill in any gaps we see to make the best product possible and delight our users. Our drones are fully modular, interoperable, and designed to be similar to smartphones, where they have powerful compute and sensors onboard that allow advanced software and applications to run on top of that. Our flagship product right now is the Teal 2 which is being deployed across the country and with allied countries around the world. For our new line of FPV drones, the most appropriate missions are short-range, any environment ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) with the option for delivery of kinetic effects. Now with Red Cat’s acquisition of FlightWave, we’re introducing a fixed-wing VTOL system into our product line. The Edge 130 is a longer-range high-endurance ISR aircraft and rounds out our family of systems. This is the world’s most affordable and first backpackable family of systems. Red Cat's Teal 2 quadcopter is an American made drone weighing under three pounds, and features a high-resolution dual EO/IR sensor, modular architecture, powerful onboard compute, and a variety of software integrations for autonomy and AI. (Red Cat photo) Describe this new family of systems that Red Cat announced at Eurosatory. In the context of defense, there is a paradigm shift underway on the architecture of battlefields. Increasingly, the U.S Department of Defense and ministries of defense globally are moving away from conventional platforms that are large and extremely expensive, and are beginning to adopt small, low-cost products that provide true asymmetric advantages. Red Cat is at the forefront of this sea change. Our goal is to give warfighters the tools they need to be successful on the modern battlefield. That was the genesis of the Red Cat Family of Systems. What we announced at Eurosatory includes three aircraft with complementary capabilities and a common Ground Control System (GCS). The core of the family is the Teal 2 quadcopter. It is an American made drone that’s designed to 'Dominate the Night'. Weighing under three pounds, it features a high-resolution dual EO/IR sensor, modular architecture, powerful onboard compute, and a wide variety of software integrations for autonomy and AI. It’s ruggedized to be used in any environment and harsh weather conditions, while also offering field repairability on all subsystems. The next entrant into the family of systems is the Edge 130 Blue, a VTOL fixed wing system that can be assembled and launched in just one minute by a single user to capture and stream high-resolution aerial imagery with long-range capability. Still weighing under four pounds and being backpackable, the Edge 130 can fly for over 2 hours, an industry-leading endurance among all Blue UAS approved drones today. Rounding out the Family of Systems is a new FANG line of first-person view (FPV) drones of different sizes and capabilities. The first in the line of FPV drones provides precision strike capabilities and gives warfighters the option to combine the ISR capabilities of the rest of the family. What is Red Cat’s ability to manufacture at scale? Our factory in Salt Lake City houses both our R&amp;D team and manufacturing team. We’ve designed our products and infrastructure to scale with demand into the thousands of drones per month. Our vetted supply chain vendors enable the company to source the components needed to build these drones at those large volumes. Having R&amp;D integrated very deeply enables for agile development and innovation. Our factory, with its state of the art tools and processes, combined with our world class team, is helping America to rebuild its drone industrial base which we believe is vital to our national security. Tell us about Partners and the consortium. We believe that no single company can protect this country alone. A few months ago we announced the Red Cat Futures Initiative to solve this problem. The RFI is a robotics and autonomous systems consortium designed to bridge critical UAS technology gaps for warfighters. It is an independent, industry-wide community of partners dedicated to putting the most advanced and interoperable uncrewed aircraft systems into the hands of warfighters. As a leader in the drone industry, we developed and launched this initiative to support the Pentagon’s desire to accelerate innovation for its Replicator Initiative and the need for low-cost, autonomous systems across air, land, sea, and subsea environments. The consortium will collaborate to ensure requirements based UAS production that meets the needs of specific missions, as well as reduce vendor lock-in and promote innovation and interoperability. The RFI will also engage in R&amp;D and government advocacy that accelerates technology maturation. The RFI brings together the most innovative UAS hardware and software companies focused on AIU/ML, swarming, FPV, command and control, charging/power, payloads and others based on the needs of warfighters. At launch in May 2024, the founding partners included Ocean Power Technologies, Sentien Robotics, Primordial Labs, Athena AI, Unusual Machines, Reach Power, and MMS Products. The shared goal of RFI is advocacy, integrations, and co-marketing that bridges considerable tech gaps in the UAS industry through modular open architecture. I am very excited to be partnering with so many amazing companies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/providing-an-asymmetric-advantage-with-quadcopters-and-fixed-wing-vtols/	2024-12-18T11:16:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Red-Cat-Edge-130-Blue-with-Overwatch-Gimbal-1.png
UK looks to protect funding for rapid Watchkeeper UAV replacement	British Army Watchkeeper Unmanned Aerial Systems are set to be axed from service next year as part of defense cuts. (UK MoD) BELFAST — The United Kingdom has learned from watching Ukraine that its Watchkeeper unmanned aerial vehicle is 'no longer fit for operational purpose,' but the ministry of defense is committed to protecting funding that will go towards its replacement, according to a senior official. 'We are working really hard with the army and ensuring they're funded to deliver the sorts of drone capability in 2025 to replace the drone [Watchkeeper] that's being retired,' Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Military Capability) Lt. Gen. Robert Magowan told lawmakers from the UK Defence Committee on Tuesday. In November, London said it had decided to scrap 46 of the British Army medium-altitude, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) drones as part of sweeping equipment cuts aimed at delivering savings of £500 million ($632 million) over the next five years. Magowan's comments on the lack of operational utility offered by Watchkeeper are in keeping with those of John Healey, UK Secretary of Defence, who justified the early retirement of the aircraft on grounds that 'technology has overtaken' it. Magowan did not elaborate further on the replacement effort but did note that the Watchkeeper retirement will allow the MoD to still save 'quite a lot of money' that would otherwise go toward support costs for the aircraft. Elsewhere in Tuesday's hearing, lawmaker questions prompted additional revelations from Magowan across a number of other key programs, including plans to replace 17 Royal Air Force-operated Puma medium lift helicopters, also axed under the latest round of military cuts. He said that a 'range of capabilities' are currently being explored that could 'plug gaps' when the rotorcraft, which are permanently based in Brunei and Cyprus, are retired in March 2025. The UK has already committed to the acquisition of six Airbus H145 Jupiter helicopters to replace the Puma's in 2026, so it appears that Magowan is suggesting an interim or stop-gap acquisition could be approved. He did not share additional details. The Puma's premature withdrawal from service from Brunei and Cyprus has previously drawn concern from Airbus. In November, the company noted in response to the move that, though it welcomes the H145 business, 'we regret the likely impact on the UK's defence industrial base, with the potential loss of skilled engineering roles and wider consequences for the aerospace supply chain.' Magowan also said that the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) New Medium Helicopter (NMH) program, designed to source a successor for a separate fleet of Puma aircraft, is 'playing out now,' adding 'there's one bidder left and that bidder has significant investment in the in the UK.' The single bidder is presumably a reference to Leonardo, the only manufacturer to put forward a bid after Airbus and Lockheed Martin both walked away from the competition in August because of requirement problems and fears linked to not receiving 'adequate long-term returns.' In a program update last week, Maria Eagle, UK minister for defence procurement, said that 'there are no plans to change the extant New Medium Helicopter procurement process.' She added, 'The New Medium Helicopter competition remains sensitive, and the evaluation and approval process must complete before further details, including aircraft numbers, can be confirmed.' The previous Conservative government had said the procurement could be 'up to' 44 airframes, but Breaking Defense has reported industry expects the real number to be around 30 platforms, and FlightGlobal recently reported it could be as few as 23. NMH contract award is set for next year, but the UK's Strategic Defense Review (SDR), due for release in mid-2025, could complicate matters because it has been designed to evaluate national defense priorities and equipment planning. Also in the hearing Magowan said that the BAE Systems Bofors Archer, an interim self-propelled howitzer, is set to enter service with the British Army in 'early 2025,' while the UK and Germany are in 'close negotiations' on the longer term solution, expected to be the KNDS Remote-Controlled Howitzer 155mm (RCH 155) 52 cal.

Senate passes defense bill despite Democrat concerns on transgender care ban	Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, left, and Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, arrive for a hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, May 2, 2024. (Photographer: Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate overwhelmingly passed the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act today, with Democrats coming out in droves to approve the $884 billion bill despite controversial transgender care provisions. The NDAA, which passed in a 85-14 vote, corresponds to a $895 billion topline for defense spending, adhering to the budgetary limits set in last year’s Fiscal Responsibility Act. That’s a departure from the Senate Armed Services Committee’s initial version of the bill, which would have broken the FRA and boosted the defense topline to $923.3 billion. The bill now moves to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has indicated he'll sign it into law. During a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, SASC’s top Republican Roger Wicker, who spearheaded the push for additional funds, said the topline increases 'should have been part of the bill today.' 'Regrettably we missed an opportunity to strengthen the president-elect’s hand as he takes office in a precarious world situation,' he said. SASC Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the concern from senators who wanted to see a higher defense topline 'is well reasoned' given current threats, but noted that the creation of the FRA was demanded by House Republicans. RELATED: House passes $884B NDAA despite transgender care ban controversy The bill was widely adopted by Senate Democrats despite the last-minute inclusion of language that would block gender-affirming care that could potentially cause sterilization for the transgender children of servicemembers, which was inserted at House Speaker Mike Johnson’s behest. Only about half of House Democrats voted for the typically-bipartisan measure due to the Tricare restrictions. In remarks ahead of the vote, Reed said he 'disagrees strongly' with the inclusion of the provision and will continue to advocate for servicemembers and their dependents. However, 'we have before us a very strong National Defense Authorization Act,' he added. During a phone call with reporters ahead of the vote, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Democrats successfully removed all of the anti-transgender provisions that were in earlier versions of the bill aside from the care ban for transgender minors and noted that he personally opposed that provision when it came before SASC for a vote. However, Kaine said the NDAA was ultimately 'very, very strong for every last member of the military and their families,' noting the 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers and other quality of life improvements. The bill authorizes $883.7 billion for fiscal year 2025, including $849.9 billion for Department of Defense programs. It also approves $33.3 billion for national security programs in the Department of Energy and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and $512.4 million for defense-related activities. The NDAA permits the transfer of National Guard space units to the Space Force, restricts F-35 deliveries, imposes new design requirements for certain Navy ships, and allows the Air Force to retire aging A-10s, F-16s and F-15s. The bill also authorizes additional funds for a third Arleigh Burke destroyer and six more F-15EXs, among other plus-ups and spending cuts, but congressional appropriators will have the final say on approving the budget.

In deal with Portugal, Turkish naval firm STM signs first export contract to NATO nation	Turkish defence company STM General Manager Ozgur Guleryuz (R) signs an agreement during the signing ceremony for the construction of the Multifunctional Naval Platform at the Marinha Central Facilities on December 17, 2024 in Lisbon, Portugal. (Photo by Zed Jameson/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish naval defense firm STM signed a contract with Portugal for two Auxiliary Oiler Replenisher and Logistics Ship (AOR+) — the first contract for naval ships between Turkey and a NATO nation — the firm said in a statement Tuesday. 'Türkiye, which is one of the 10 countries in the world that manufactures its own warships, has now started to produce these products as well as export them to our friendly and allied countries,' Turkish Secretary of Defence Industries Haluk Görgün said in the statement. 'Developing strong defence and defence industry cooperation with our NATO Allies is a top priority for Türkiye.' The ships will be able to transport and resupply naval vessels at sea with fuel, drinking water, cargo and ammunition, according to a statement by the Portuguese navy, and if necessary could aid in disaster support. Specifically, STM said the two AOR+ vessels will be able to operate for 90 days at sea and 'have the capacity to transport armored vehicles, enabling them to support joint and amphibious operations. With an aft vehicle ramp, each vessel will be capable of carrying up to 20 light tactical armored vehicles.' Görgün added that the agreement is a step towards broader cooperation with the Portuguese navy in other areas, such as unmanned maritime vehicles, electronic warfare systems, and further shipbuilding and naval modernization projects. The contract was signed Tuesday in Lisbon, and work on the ships is expected to begin in 2025, and the Portuguese navy said they expect delivery by 2028. Turkey has been beefing up its naval defense sector and production capabilities in recent years with shipyards, floating docks and multi-purpose ships. In 2023, another Turkish firm, Havelsan, unveiled its unmanned submarine Caka, designed to perform infrastructure and naval protection missions. Earlier this year, Turkish Aksaz Shipyard command was inaugurated and launched the first national submarine floating dock with a 3,000-ton lifting capacity. In November, Turkish firm Baykar's unmanned combat aerial vehicle performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/in-deal-with-portugal-turkish-naval-firm-stm-signs-first-export-contract-to-nato-nation/	2024-12-18T09:36:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/GettyImages-2189881493-scaled-e1734535702223.jpg
The ‘Last Supper’ era is over — it’s time for the ‘First Breakfast’	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) In less than two months, President-elect Trump will take office facing significant national security threats to US interests — particularly from China. Unfortunately, he will also have to grapple with a Department of Defense (DoD) and defense industrial base struggling to overcome decades of neglect to meet our nation’s increasingly complex defense needs. The administration has a chance to take action early on. Within one month of taking office, the incoming secretaries of defense and state should sit down with key industry leaders for the 'First Breakfast' — a frank and overdue conversation between the government and industry on these threats, what the government needs from industry, and industry’s take on how the government can help it meet these needs. While the term 'First Breakfast' has been offered in this context before, what we propose is something more comprehensive — a path to the relationship reset between government and industry in order to confront our hardest national security challenges. In the twilight of the Cold War, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and his deputy, Bill Perry, invited the CEOs of the nation’s largest defense companies to the Pentagon for a meeting in the Secretary’s dining room, now known as the 'Last Supper.' In that 1993 meeting, Perry presented the group with a tough message: Defense budgets would shrink and the industry would need to consolidate to survive. Industry took that warning to heart, with the number of prime defense contractors shrinking from 51 to 5 by 2003 as a result of rampant mergers and acquisitions. For much of the three decades since the Last Supper, the US enjoyed a period of uncontested military overmatch against our adversaries, unencumbered by the threat of a legitimate near-peer competitor. However, we now find ourselves in an era of historic uncertainty and international security challenges — a period in which Mara Karlin, a former senior DoD official, recently posited as a turn toward 'total war,' in which all elements of national power are leveraged against a broad array of targets to reshape the world order. After decades of industrial mismanagement by the government, we now find our national advantage eroded and in need of urgent reinvigoration. We are faced with the need to have a similarly urgent, but very different conversation to reverse the failures of the past — it is time for the 'First Breakfast’. But given the complexity and opportunity of the modern geopolitical and economic environments, this meal needs to look different. It should bring together not only the few remaining primes but also innovative new entrants, insurgent mid-sized companies, and national security-attuned private equity. Recognizing the modern focus on transforming conflict through automation and cutting-edge, rapidly evolving software, the First Breakfast should include our nation’s leading software companies. And given the inextricable synergy between diplomacy and defense in securing our national interests, the need to support partner and allied militaries, and the opportunity to leverage industrial capacity and capital abroad, the secretary of state should co-lead this discussion. (A disclaimer: Our employer, Beacon Global Strategies, represents a broad spectrum of clients, including defense and non-defense companies ranging from small startups to industry leaders.) The discussion should lead with a candid conversation about the myriad of strategic threats we face and the erosion of our industrial overmatch — in both technology and mass. The next administration should be transparent about the operational challenges our military faces and include industry as the essential ally required to overcome them. Foundational challenges such as workforce shortfalls, the reality of static defense spending, and the impact of increasingly expensive, but necessary, investments in modernization and personnel should be discussed frankly as realities that directly inform industrial investment. A successful First Breakfast would produce a path toward restoring trust, improving government-industry cooperation, increasing opportunities for new defense industry entrants and fostering competition, and reducing friction between industry and decisionmakers based on a shared understanding of each other's motivations and challenges. But crucially, this cannot kick off a two-year process towards the development of a new industrial strategy. Instead, within four weeks of meeting, the group should produce a list of guiding principles, detailing what government needs industry to do better, what the government can do to enable industry to meet government demand, and what issues the two need to continue working on side-by-side. The group should plan follow-on gatherings to develop and concrete actions and deliverables and track progress against the guiding principles for mutual accountability. Importantly, this must not be a partisan endeavor — congressional senior leaders must be allies in these efforts to invigorate defense industrial base innovation and production. For too long, Congress has abrogated their duties to pass timely and regular appropriations, instead relying on continuing resolutions that defer their constitutional responsibility to a later date all the while immobilizing the entire defense community, leading to additional costs to the taxpayer. Senior congressional leaders should understand the gravity of inaction and partisan brinksmanship, and resume their responsibility as partners, not parochialists. Of course, our military and industry have discussed many of these issues on the margins for years, particularly as our national security focus shifted away from counterterrorism and towards near peers. And efforts at all sorts of reform, from acquisition to foreign military sales to overcoming the 'valley of death' are vital. A clear, blunt and more strategic 'First Breakfast' conversation can push these difficult policy reforms forward. It's clear that our nation’s defense-industrial trajectory just isn’t sustainable. The 'First Breakfast' would be a significant step towards resetting the government’s relationship with industry and orient the full strength of American power and ingenuity toward the national security challenges of today and the future.

China’s nuclear arsenal keeps growing amidst leadership purge: Pentagon report	The Chinese military's new DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles, that can reportedly reach the United States, are seen at a parade to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, at Tiananmen Square on October 1, 2019 in Beijing, China. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — At a time when the Chinese government is purging its officer rolls and dealing with a slowing economy, it has continued growing its nuclear arsenal and conventional arms ambitions, according to a new Pentagon report. That finding is part of the Pentagon’s congressionally mandated 2024 China Military Power Report, an annual document providing US insights into the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) strategy and weapons development. This year’s report, largely covering 2023 activities, does not offer up any new bombshells about PLA weapon development or strategy, but still serves as a valuable window into the US government’s perspective on Chinese military activities. When it comes to the ongoing military purge inside China, a senior US defense official said, 'The PLA [People’s Liberation Army] continues to struggle with deeply rooted problems of corruption.' In the second half of 2023 alone, at least 15 high ranking military officials and defense industry executives were removed from their posts for corruption, the official told reporters Monday ahead of the report’s release. Several of those officials were directly responsible for overseeing equipment projects related to modernizing China's ground based nuclear and conventional missiles. For now, the Pentagon anticipates that this anti-corruption push will continue, in part, because Beijing believes that keeping weak or corrupt leaders in key positions inside the PLA, it could potentially slow China down from achieving its 2027 weapon modernization goals and, eventually, trying to reunify with Taiwan, the US defense official added. The official threw cold water on the much-ballyhooed fear that an invasion of Taiwan is on the calendar, saying 'On 2027, I would reiterate that we don't think that conflict [with Taiwan] is imminent or inevitable: We think that we have deterrence today that's real and strong.' Still, 'We do judge that that is a capability development milestone that could give the PLA greater capacity to be a more credible military tool for the Chinese Communist Party's unification efforts,' the official later added. When it comes to China's arsenal of weapons, the report doesn’t disclose any massive departure from previous predictions. The PLA is still on track to hit its goal of having 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, and as of mid-2024, that stockpile had surpassed 600 — roughly 100 more than was listed in last year's report. 'We're showing a rate of growth that is pretty well consistent with what we've described in reports over the past… few years, about their nuclear expansion and modernization,' the US senior defense official added. Also similar to last year’s report, the US assesses that the PRC has completed construction of its three solid-propellant silo fields, which will cumulatively contain at least 300 new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) silos. And the PRC is also still interested in developing a new, conventionally armed, intercontinental range missile system that could strike targets in Hawaii, Alaska and inside the continental United States — an idea disclosed last year and not expanded on. The PRC’s space industry, meanwhile, is 'rapidly expanding' its intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, navigation, and communication satellite constellations, according to the report. 'Through 2030, the PRC will continue to leverage its nonmilitary and commercial space activities to expand its global influence,' it added. 'Beijing’s policies to encourage private investment in space activities have influenced a broad range of firms to enter the commercial space market.' The PLA Navy. meanwhile, has maintained a fleet of 'more than' 370 ships and submarines, while the PLA Air Force continued to modernize its aircraft and drones. 'The PLA transferred significant portions of PLA [Navy] shore-based, fixed-wing combat aviation units, facilities, air defense, and radar units to the PLA [Air Force],' the report said. 'Given time, this shift will probably enable better command and control over the PRC’s integrated air defense systems as well as the network of ground-based air domain awareness radars supporting the PRC’s national integrated air defense system network.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-keeps-growing-amidst-leadership-purge-pentagon-report/	2024-12-18T07:00:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/221129_china_icbm_parade_GettyImages-1172705774-scaled-e1669731562738.jpg
Autonomy changes everything about combat engineering	Combat engineering tasks are a significantly dangerous set of activities. Combat engineers, or 'sappers' as they're called, clear the battlefield ahead using explosives and machines with front-end equipment so maneuver forces can travel forward unhindered. For countermobility, their mission is to slow down opposing land forces with terrain-based effects like Dragon’s teeth. Deployment of robotic combat engineering assets will significantly reduce risk to exposed soldiers in the breach executing mobility/countermobility missions, while maintaining or increasing the tempo of movement for maneuver forces. In this editorial eBRIEF, Breaking Defense examines the challenges and opportunities associated with robotics and autonomy for combat engineering.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/autonomy-changes-everything-about-combat-engineering/	2024-12-18T05:23:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Breaking-defense-eBrief-Pearson-Engineering-Featured-Image.jpg
Raytheon, Ursa Major log successful solid rocket motor flight test	A solid rocket motor developed by Ursa Major is preparing to be tested at its Berthoud, Colorado campus. (Ursa Major) WASHINGTON — RTX weapons arm Raytheon and defense startup Ursa Major Technologies have completed two successful test flights of a missile propelled by a new solid rocket motor, the companies announced today. The recent tests mark a step forward in Ursa Major's path to become a third provider of solid rocket motors for the US weapons industry around 2026, when qualification of the technology is currently scheduled, the companies stated in a news release. 'There is a new player on the scene in the solid rocket motor industry,' Ursa Major CEO Dan Jablonsky told reporters during a roundtable. 'This is an Army program that we've been working on with Raytheon. In this particular program, we went from concept and design to firing and flight on the range in just under four months, which is lightning fast.' The two test flights, held at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California, involved a Raytheon-made missile propelled by an Ursa Major solid rocket motor measuring less than 10 inches in diameter, Jablonsky said. However, much about the capability Ursa Major is developing — and the weapon that will use it — is shrouded in mystery. Jablonsky declined to comment on whether a missile from an existing program of record or a newly-developed design was flown during the tests. Nor did he comment on the range of the weapon involved or the exact size of the rocket motor. RELATED: Ursa Major takes aim at DoD solid rocket motor market A Raytheon spokesperson referred questions about the missile to the Army, adding that the company 'is working with several rocket motor suppliers to rapidly develop and deliver affordable solutions to the US Army at the speed of relevance.' Over the next year, Ursa Major plans to do more test flights with Raytheon, including with an extended range version of the weapon. It will also expand its facilities to enable the company to ramp up production when the design is fully qualified, he said. 'Not only do we expect to pick up programs of record in the vicinity of what we've just flown … but we used and proved out our agile manufacturing techniques in doing so,' Jablonsky said, adding that Ursa Major could provide surge capacity for other programs of record with Raytheon or potentially other weapons companies. The US solid rocket motor industry is currently limited to only two vendors: L3Harris’s Aerojet Rocketdyne subsidiary and Northrop Grumman, which acquired manufacturer Orbital ATK in 2018. The already fragile SRM industrial base was hit hard by supply chain constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and has struggled to recover as demand for weapons skyrockets due to the war in Ukraine. Executives from defense primes like RTX and Lockheed Martin have expressed frustration with current providers' production capacity and schedule challenges, and are injecting money and technical know-how with other companies interested in broadening the industrial base. But while several defense tech startups such as Ursa Major Technologies, Anduril and X-Bow Systems have announced plans to enter the market, it will take years for their designs to be tested and qualified. RTX Ventures, Raytheon's venture capital arm, has been investing in Ursa Major since 2023. In the 14 months since Ursa Major first stood up its solid rocket motor manufacturing cell, it has grown that unit to about 40 employees, Jablonsky said Ursa Major has developed configurations of motors from two-inch diameter — about the size used for shoulder-launched weapon systems, to 22-inch diameter motors that could be used for vertical launch systems. The company is also producing its own energetics — a decision that Jablonsky said will keep Ursa Major from having to rely on the same suppliers already working to their limits to support existing solid rocket motor requirements. Other major weapons makers are also engaged in partnerships with potential new motor suppliers. In August, Lockheed announced it would partner with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems to develop the latter company as solid rocket motor manufacturer for Lockheed’s Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS). At the time, executives said the first motors would roll off GD’s production line in Camden, Ark., around 2025. If that effort is successful, GD-OTS could begin producing motors for additional systems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/raytheon-ursa-major-log-successful-solid-rocket-motor-flight-test/	2024-12-17T21:01:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/URSA_Solid_Rocket_Motor-scaled.jpg
Congress unveils stopgap funding bill with $5.7 billion for Virginia-class subs	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023.

(Photo by Tony McDonough / AFP) (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — After days of grueling negotiations, House leadership today released a stopgap funding proposal that would extend federal funding into mid-March and add $5.7 billion in emergency funds for Virginia-class submarine construction. Now Congress has until Friday night to pass the continuing resolution (CR) before federal spending runs out, giving lawmakers a tight timeframe to move through procedural hurdles and avert a government shutdown. Congressional leadership reached a deal on this evening after days of negotiations, which initially saw Republicans seeking extra funds for farmers and Democrats pushing for additional disaster relief to be included in the spending bill. Ultimately, the 1,574-page agreement expanded to include a laundry list of other issues, including public health and workforce programs as well as the future of Washington’s RFK Stadium. For defense, the most newsworthy item is the pot of additional submarine funding, which will allow the Navy to incrementally fund emerging needs on the Virginia-class submarine contract or 'other nuclear-powered vessel programs' until the end of fiscal 2029. Specifically, it would fund 'the improvement of workforce wages and non-executive level salaries,' the bill text states. The funds are classified as emergency spending — a critical designation that allows the Defense Department to sidestep current spending limits imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, as well as any future budget caps. The funds could provide additional funding flexibility for the Navy as it tries to strengthen the submarine industrial base, which is struggling to hire and retain skilled technicians and boost small suppliers. Other defense related increases include the addition of disaster relief funding for military installations that suffered damages caused by Typhoon Mawar as well as various hurricanes. It also directs the Air Force to transfer the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard to the 175th Wing of the Maryland Air National Guard. While inserting language on various domestic issues was seen as critical for House Speaker Mike Johnson to win Democrat support — a key consideration, given the GOP’s razor-thin majority in the House and potential need to amass a two-thirds majority for bill passage — the accumulation of provisions unrelated to the CR itself could rankle hardline and fiscal conservatives who had pushed for a bare-bones CR. During a news conference this morning, Johnson said he is hopeful he can get House Republicans on board and defended the last-minute additions to the bill. 'It’s not a Christmas tree, it’s not an [omnibus]. … This is a small CR that we had to add things that were out of our control,' Johnson said, noting the need for additional aid for farmers and disaster relief funding. The CR would extend until March 14, ahead of an April 30 deadline to pass a full-year appropriations bill before across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration kick in, under the terms of the FRA.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/congress-unveils-stopgap-funding-bill-with-5-7-billion-for-virginia-class-subs/	2024-12-17T17:00:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/virginia-australia-scaled-e1723223982442.jpg

HASC leaders turn up heat on Space Force leadership over acquisition plans	House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., left, and ranking member Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., attend the House and Senate committee markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, November 29, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The leaders of the House Armed Services Committee are hitting at Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman about whether the Space Force is adequately building its acquisition workforce, according to a new letter obtained by Breaking Defense. In the letter addressed to Saltzman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R.-Ala., and Rep. Adam Smith, D.-Wash., respectively the chairman and ranking member of the HASC, say they are concerned Saltzman and his team are too focused on boosting operators inside America's youngest military branch: 'We fear a divide that elevates operators at the detriment to other core functions of the Space Force will have negative impacts, potentially not immediately, but as we look to 2030 and beyond,' the duo wrote. The letter, which is dated today, calls out that acquisition issues were notably absent in Saltzman's presentations last week during the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference, something the members say is a disconnect from the CSO's earlier effort to bring together acquisition and operational experts via new organizational structures called Integrated Mission Deltas. 'As we received your remarks last week at the Spacepower conference, the omission of acquisition, training and testing has raised some questions as to the previous focus on maintaining alignment across these areas. We believe this is needed to not only be successful in developing the next generation space warfighter, but also to ensure that the Service will have the skillset and workforce to design, develop, and acquire systems that Guardians are going to need in the future,' Rogers and Smith wrote. The letter echoes remarks made by Rogers earlier today at a Space Force fifth birthday event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) — likely a sign that the HASC leadership is comfortable making their frustrations with Saltzman's emphasis on operators public. To that end, the HASC leaders in the letter demand that the service provide answers to a series of questions about how acquisition expertise is being integrated into Guardian development and training. This includes providing a breakdown of what specialties are held by the officer corps by rank, 'to include operations (13S, 14N, 17X), engineering (62E), and acquisition (63A).' Further, the Space Force is tasked to describe how the new integrated deltas 'will be staffed with the required acquisition personnel beginning in 2026;' what acquisition training and development programs are being provided to junior officers; and how the service is planning to recruit, train and retain acquisition officials.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hasc-leaders-turn-up-heat-on-space-force-leadership-over-acquisition-plans/	2024-12-17T11:37:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/roger-smith-scaled-e1734463410948.jpg

(Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As it works to expand globally, South Korea’s Hanwha is bringing over Michael Coulter from Leonardo DRS to take a newly-created role of Global Defense CEO. Coulter, in this new role, will 'be responsible for overseeing the global defense businesses of Hanwha Aerospace and its subsidiaries such as Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Systems,' according to a Dec. 15 announcement. Hanwha 'aims to strengthen its strategic position by delivering integrated land, sea, and air solutions in key global markets, particularly the United States,' the announcement adds. Coulter recently was Leonardo DRS’s senior vice president of corporate business development. A Navy reserve officer, Coulter also held several Pentagon and State roles in the 2000s.

Hypersonic missile defense deserves predictable and sustainable funding	An early Glide Phase Interceptor design concept. (Missile Defense Agency) On Nov. 21, Russia’s Vladimir Putin gave the West a clear window into his strategic thinking and intent. By using the 'Oreshnik' missile against Ukraine — a weapon Putin claims is a 'hypersonic' threat, although analysts are mixed — he not only demonstrated his willingness to use the advanced parts of his arsenal, but also the unprecedented capability they represent. Afterwards, Putin bragged that the weapon is immune to missile defenses. Putting aside the question of whether this is a 'true' hypersonic weapon, his broader point is correct: As of this moment, the US has no real defenses against a hypersonic threat. Earlier this year, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) was forced to an unfortunate decision regarding its Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program, which is supposed to provide America’s first defense against hypersonic glide vehicles. The reasons for and the consequences of that decision should serve as a cautionary tale for both the next Congress and incoming administration, especially if our country is to take serious weapons currently in the hands of adversaries like Mr. Putin. In the past, MDA had touted its commitment to its own 'best acquisition practices,' which included 'fly before you buy' and extending corporate competition deeper into the acquisition process. However, GPI had an early 'downselect' decision, picking one corporate contractor as the winner for the program and ending the competition. The decision came five years earlier than planned, before even an evaluation of the competing teams’ Preliminary Design Reviews. This is highly unusual. Lt. Gen. Heath Collins, the MDA Director, described the decision as 'resource driven.' This is Pentagon code for when the Department of Defense is presented with an arbitrary top line budget number — devoid of study, analysis, or overarching strategy — and then forced to fit its entire spending under that ceiling. In a recent interview, Collins stated, 'As we came into [FY] 25, the Fiscal Responsibility Act … put pressure on the entire department to make really tough prioritization and resource-informed decisions.' For GPI, a highly probable consequence of this early downselect decision is an unpredictable funding stream for the program. This, compounded with its relative programmatic immaturity and the potential for developmental challenges, raises concern about when the warfighter can expect GPI’s capability in their hands. As Masao Dahlgren from the Center for Strategic and International Studies has stated, 'downselecting so early in the development process adds risk — if any delays come up, there won’t be a competing design to choose.' This effort is currently represented by the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) satellite capability, two of which were launched into orbit this past February. To ensure full and complete compatibility between the interceptor and the sensing and tracking system, these capabilities must be developed in parallel, so as to inform the design and final configuration of both. In the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress mandated an early, terminal phase initial operating capability against hypersonics be provided by 2029. This interim solution is prudent, but this initial rudimentary system — aptly termed a 'gap-filler' — must not be allowed to compete for budget with the fully operationally capable GPI vehicle required by 2032. Two distinct and adequate funding streams are essential. Back in April 2023, Rep. Doug Lamborn, Chairman of the House Strategic Forces Subcommittee, spoke to the importance of these programs when he said, 'Given the rapid pace with which our adversaries are pursuing and fielding hypersonic systems, I am eager to hear ideas from DoD on how to pull both HBTSS and GPI to the left.' While that may no longer be possible given the fiscal realities forced upon MDA, Lamborn’s sentiments certainly describe the absolute need not to allow either program to languish. The incoming Trump administration has already signaled its desire to re-prioritize missile defense in a way the current Biden administration has not. Congress should make common cause with the new administration and breathe new life into missile defense of the homeland and forward-deployed US assets by providing a stabilized and predictable funding stream for GPI. The budget should be adequate for development and testing, and be resilient enough to weather the inevitable challenges any new program will encounter. Sufficient funding is the key to securing an acquisition timeline to field a fully operationally capable GPI by 2032. The stakes are indeed very high, and if Mr. Putin has shown us anything, it is that there is no time to waste. Major General Howard 'Dallas' Thompson (US Air Force – ret.) is a former Chief of Staff at NORAD and NORTHCOM.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hypersonic-missile-defense-deserves-predictable-and-sustainable-funding/	2024-12-17T10:54:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-19-at-5.31.16-PM-e1734125879645.png
Rep. Pat Fallon introducing bill to block DoD IT contracts with Chinese entities (Exclusive)	Keyboard with China flag key (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon plans to introduce a bill today that will prohibit the Department of Defense from doing information technology-related business with Chinese entities, Fallon tells Breaking Defense. The bill, titled the 'Safeguard American Innovation Act,' would ban the Secretary of Defense from 'entering, renewing, or extending an IT contract' with companies that have specific ties with the People’s Republic of China, according to a preview of the bill sent to Breaking Defense before its release. 'The ‘Protecting American Innovation Act’ is vital to securing our nation’s technology and deterring foreign threats, particularly from China. Recent cyberattacks like SolarWinds and Salt Typhoon have shown how vulnerable our defense and IT systems are to foreign interference,' Fallon, a House Armed Services Committee member, told Breaking Defense in an email. 'This bill will take action to prevent this by blocking any Department of Defense (DOD) contracts with companies tied to China that could jeopardize our national security.' With the 118th Congress ending in just a few weeks, this iteration of the bill is effectively dead on arrival. But Fallon said he is introducing the bill now so it will be a priority in the next Congress, and a spokesperson said the plan is to reintroduce the language once the 119th Congress is up and running. 'Along with the return of President Trump’s leadership, Rep. Fallon’s intention going into the 119th Congress is to ensure US equities are protected from the PRC influence to prevent what we saw with Salt Typhoon and Solar Winds. Innovation is our main asymmetric advantage and Congress needs to protect that at all costs,' the spokesperson said in an email. According to the proposed language, the Secretary of Defense will be barred from doing business with IT companies that are characterized as the following: Fallon, who serves on the HASC's subcommittee for Cyber, Innovative Technologies and Information Systems, said that one major concern he has with the DoD doing IT business with Chinese entities is due to the fact that 'China’s laws force companies to share sensitive technology, including software source code,' adding that this 'poses a serious risk.' 'By banning contracts with companies that operate in China, are funded by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), or allow China access to critical code, this bill helps ensure our IT infrastructure remains secure and our technological advancements stay out of adversaries' hands. This legislation is essential to protecting American innovation, keeping our military safe, and maintaining US technological leadership,' he added. Related: Chinese sanctions on US drone firm were ‘signal’ about supply chain weaknesses: DIU official Fallon’s bill to address IT concerns comes after several years of rising anxiety from the Pentagon and lawmakers that the US supply chain is still interwoven with Chinese entities. There have been efforts to get at this problem. For example, in 2020 the Defense Innovation Unit launched its Blue UAS program, a 'holistic and continuous approach that rapidly vets and scales commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology for the Department of Defense (DoD)' in part to ensure parts don’t come from adversaries. And on the Congressional side, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act states that beginning on Oct. 1, 2027, no funds appropriated or made available for the DoD can be spent to procure a battery produced by the listed Chinese-owned and -operated companies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rep-pat-fallon-introducing-bill-to-block-dod-it-contracts-with-chinese-entities-exclusive/	2024-12-17T07:59:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_cybersecurity_china_keyboard_GettyImages-184947489-scaled-e1677516091595.jpg
Lithuania agrees to purchase 44 Leopard 2 tanks in country’s largest-ever defense deal	An Leopard Tank of the Bundeswehr Panzerlehrbrigade 9 (9th Armoured Demonstration Brigade) during a presentation of capabilities by the unit on May 20, 2019 in Munster, Germany. (Photo by Morris MacMatzen/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Lithuania has signed off on plans to procure 44 Leopard 2 tanks, in what the Lithuanian government is calling the single largest defense acquisition project in the country’s history. Minister of National Defence Dovilė Šakalienė signed the documents on Monday while visiting with German defense minister Boris Pistorius in Berlin. While costs and delivery dates were not made public in the statement, Šakalienė told the Baltic News Service that the goal is to have the tanks by 2030. 'The agreement on Leopard acquisition is the largest contract Lithuania has ever signed. It is a pivotal stage of modernizing our armed forces and strengthening the regional security,' Šakalienė said in a statement, according to an online translation. 'The new tanks will facilitate integration and interoperability of [the] Lithuanian and German militaries.' The Leopard, produced by Franco-German conglomerate KNDS, has seen a resurgence of interest since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company is pursuing new concepts for future Leopards, and won a large contract with Norway in 2023 — although that was scaled back months later. However, KMDS has seen strong competition in Europe from South Korean made vehicles. Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Dovilė Šakalienė and german defense minister Boris Pistorius signed an agreement on Leopard tanks on Dec 16 2024. (Lithuanian government) Lithuania, which shares borders with both Russian ally Belarus and the Russian territory of Kaliningrad, has increased its defense spending since the Ukraine conflict began. The previous government, which lost its election in October, promised to spend at least 3 percent GDP on defense starting in 2025, and Gitanas Nausėda, the long-standing Lithuanian president, was quoted by BNS as saying, 'I hope we can reach 3.5 percent, and in the near future, even 4 percent.' During her visit to Germany, Šakalienė also pledged that Lithuania remains committed to hosting a Germany brigade in Lithuania, near the Belarussian border. Lithuania is in the process of building out infrastructure for the 5,000 German soldiers and their families, something Šakalienė discussed with Pistorius, per the statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lithuania-agrees-to-purchase-44-leopard-2-tanks-in-countrys-largest-ever-defense-deal/	2024-12-17T07:25:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/germany_Leopard_2-scaled-e1694462454396.jpg
Rogers warns Space Force leadership not to overly prioritize operations	Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. (Credit: Andrew Harnik/AP Photo/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As the Space Force nears its fifth birthday on Dec. 20, one of its strongest proponents in Congress is warning the service has spent too much focus on training operators for a future fight at the expense of developing technology and acquisition experts within the Guardian cadre. 'The Space Force has to be led by more than just operator. A deep understanding and connection with technology is at the core of the Space Force,' said Rep. Mike Rogers, R.-Ala., in written remarks obtained by Breaking Defense ahead of his speech today at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'Operators, acquisition, intel, and cyber professionals must all be on equal footing,' While welcoming the push by Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman (and his predecessor, Gen. Jay Raymond) for 'building a warfighting culture and normalizing space as part of the joint fight,' Rogers stressed that at the same time 'the development of acquisition and other professionals is just as important. 'After all, what are those operators going to operate if acquirers aren’t acquiring?' asked Rogers, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee. 'The House Armed Services Committee is going to be keeping a close eye to ensure that the Space Force is paying adequate attention to imbuing Guardians with acquisition skills,' a congressional source told Breaking Defense. One of the primary reasons Rogers was an early proponent of the service's creation was the pressing need for space acquisition reform, the source noted. Indeed, Rogers and his former counterpart, now-retired Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., led a bipartisan effort to create the first civilian Space Acquisition Executive (SAE) at the Pentagon to help consolidate oversight of the myriad entities with space systems buying power. In his speech today, Rogers also advocated for growing the Space Force in order to meet the ever-increasing threats from China and Russia. However, doing so doesn't necessarily mean 'a wholesale increase in end strength,' he said. Instead, he suggested that both the Air Force and the Defense Department writ large 'transfer' some of their personnel billets over to the Space Force — a move that would surely cause push-back from the offices that would lose personnel. He also argued for more budgetary investment in the newest military service, citing both the growth in its mission areas and the highly technical nature of space operations that requires constant innovation. That said, Rogers cautioned that Congress does not want to be in the position of throwing good money after bad. 'We can no longer afford to wait 8-plus years to develop requirements, and conduct long drawn-out competition processes. Nor can we afford these endless cost-plus development contracts,' he said. Rogers praised the progress on this front made so far by Frank Calvelli in his role as the first SAE, but said it is not enough. 'The Department must be more agile and continue to use every lever that has been given to it by Congress to 1) increase competition on these programs; 2) minimize requirement changes; 3) buy commercial; and 4) find ways to partner and draw more non-traditional companies into the defense market,' Rogers said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rogers-warns-space-force-leadership-not-to-overly-prioritize-operations/	2024-12-17T06:17:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/rogers-scaled-e1692899918123.jpg
Portugal seals order for 12 A-29N Super Tucano aircraft	Concept art of a Portuguese Air Force A-29N Super Tucano (Embraer) BELFAST — Portugal has ordered 12 A-29N Super Tucano aircraft from Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, in a deal valued at €200 million ($210 million). The company announced in a Monday statement that it had signed an agreement with the Portuguese Ministry of National Defense for the acquisition and added Lisbon will become the launch customer of the NATO standard version of the light attack and training plane. 'This acquisition reflects Portugal’s commitment to modernizing its Air Force with a versatile and proven aircraft, ideally suited for Advanced Pilot Training, Light Attack, Close Air Support (CAS) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions,' said Embraer. The order for the aircraft sits under Portugal's Close Support Aircraft program, one of eight major equipment projects prioritized by the country's Military Programming Law, a multiyear defense spending plan. In line with operational requirements, Embraer stressed that the new Super Tucano's will be equipped with 'advanced avionics, NATO-specific communications systems and other non-disclosed new capabilities.' Embraer has been marketing a NATO-specific version of the A-29, a light- attack prop plane, for several years, but Portugal marks the first customer to sign on. The Portuguese Air Force has been left with an advanced trainer capability gap since retiring Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets in 2018. Portugal's Council of Ministers officially approved the order last week and shared that the acquisition, as a whole, will also include 'a flight simulator, logistics, support, goods and services,' according to an online translation of a government statement. 'The project will involve a strong participation of Portuguese industry in highly technological areas, with a view to reconfiguring the aircraft to NATO standards and specifications,' added Lisbon. Foi hoje assinado o contrato de aquisição de 12 aviões #SuperTucano que vão no futuro equipar a #ForçaAérea. Esta aeronave será empregue em missões de apoio aéreo próximo bem como formação avançada de pilotagem.

A select group of local Portuguese aerospace companies are set to be involved in development and systems integration of the aircraft, based on a prior Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). That agreement was signed in April by Centro de Engenharia e Desenvolvimento de Produto (CEiiA), Empordef Tecnologias de Informação, S.A. (ETI), GMVIS Skysoft, S.A. (GMV) and OGMA S.A. The latest Super Tucano order also strengthens Brazilian and Portuguese defense co-operation, building on Lisbon's 2019 order for five KC-390 Millennium tankers, the second of which was delivered in June. Embraer on Tuesday also announced the establishment of a new Portuguese subsidiary, Embraer Defense Europe, aimed at supporting 'strategic objectives in creating relevant and cutting-edge defense and security solutions for customers in Europe and NATO.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/portugal-seals-order-for-12-a-29n-super-tucano-aircraft/	2024-12-17T05:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/A-29N-SUPER-TUCANO-FAP-scaled-e1734441846914.jpg
For artificial intelligence to be mission-critical, it must hallucinate less	The Air Force CIO and Air Force Research Laboratory are accelerating initiatives to provide Guardians, Airmen, and contractors the ability to responsibly experiment with Generative AI, with adequate safeguards in place. (U.S. Air Force graphic). The Defense Department has doubled down on a data-driven military empowered by artificial intelligence. The use of AI for mission-critical applications for national defense, however, has been hindered by one reason in particular – hallucinations. Hallucinations happen when large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. It’s not uncommon for LLMs to hallucinate as often as 1 in every 10 responses, according to a study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. It’s that 10-percent error rate that’s slowed a fuller potential for AI in the DoD. Now, however, there’s a new software solution called Retrieval Augmented Generation Verification (RAG-V) that addresses hallucinations in LLMs by drastically reducing their occurrence. Introduced by Primer, which builds practical and trusted AI for complex enterprise environments, RAG-V nearly eliminates hallucinations by adding a novel verification stage. John Bohanon is vice president for data science at Primer. 'RAG-V makes it possible to take a Large Language Model and put it into a mission-critical setting so warfighters can rely on it; that's the heart of the matter,' said John Bohanon, vice president for data science at Primer. 'In some settings you want hallucinations; it's called creativity, such as when you want ideas for throwing a party. These models are very creative and come up with stuff out of thin air. 'The dark side is if you're using it in a setting where factuality matters in getting answers to questions, hallucinations can be bad – especially when they're subtle. When it's an obviously incorrect piece of information, it's easy for a human to catch it. The dangerous thing is when the model’s confident and it looks correct, but it’s a hallucination saying it in such a plausible, credible way that it can fool you.' Primer works by incorporating a verification step akin to fact checking that grounds the LLM's responses in substantiated data sources, reducing the above-mentioned error rate from around 5-10 percent – which is the state-of-the-art for leading LLMs – to just 0.1 percent. This dramatic improvement in reliability is critical for applications where factual accuracy is paramount, enabling warfighters and analysts to trust the AI-generated insights and make time-sensitive decisions with increased confidence. Beyond detecting hallucinations, RAG-V also provides detailed explanations of any errors, allowing the system to iteratively improve and further enhance trust. Primer's approach represents a significant advancement in responsible AI development, addressing key challenges around transparency and accountability that are essential for the adoption of these transformative technologies in the defense sector. RAG-V reduces hallucinations High-profile AI hallucinations have already made the news, especially in the legal profession where a lawyer submitted a court brief partially created with ChatGPT that invented case law. It’s not a mystery why hallucinations happen, though. They’re caused by the way LLMs are trained. Even though they seem to be a mysterious piece of new science, they're trained in a relatively simple manner that’s like a game of fill-in-the-blank. The LLM is fed text, for example, with some of the words hidden and the model fills in the blanks. Do that billions of times and the LLM becomes very good at putting words together – just not always the right words. What the model's trying to do is generate words that seem as high probability as possible, and read like they would’ve been written by a human. A partial solution for hallucinations came on the scene in 2021 called Retrieval Augmented Generation – without the verification part created by Primer – that mitigated hallucinations down to the level they’re at today. RAG works by retrieving relevant information from a trusted system of record and then including it in the prompt for the generative model. The prompt also instructs the model to answer the user’s question only on that retrieved data without filling in the blanks. Even with RAG, these models don’t always follow direction and still make errors and hallucinate. What Primer has done to bring down hallucinations to the point where trust can be restored on the part of the user is add a new, last step that fact checks the data against verifiable sources – hence the verification in RAG-V. With RAG-V, warfighters executing mission-critical applications can now add a trustworthy LLM capability to their toolkit in these times of great competitors also developing advanced AI capabilities where operations across multiple domains and at the edge are needed. Matthew Macnak is senior vice president of customer solutions engineering at Primer. 'In order for us to stay ahead of competitors like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea – all of whom are using LLMs – our AI at its core is about helping the end users do something more efficiently by doing it with less effort in a faster manner,' said Matthew Macnak, senior vice president of customer solutions engineering at Primer. 'Primer is a full platform; it’s not just powered by an LLM so we can actually take a version of that into the field and still have the ability to process massive amounts of unstructured information with fewer personnel and more reliability due to RAG-V. 'Imagine that we can put our AI systems into something the size of a suitcase and then place it on an aircraft that's doing ISR missions. Now you have a few operators able to ingest, let's say, thousands of voice or text collects and analyze that information in real time rather than just collecting the data, going back, and waiting for the data to be analyzed. Now they can have a result in situ rather than waiting on someone else to tell them what to do.' More trust, fewer hallucinations Even with RAG, Large Language Models have error rates so bad – typically 5-10 percent of the time – that they can’t be trusted for many defense applications, as highlighted. The rate depends on the data and what questions are being asked of the LLM, but that makes them unacceptable for intelligence operations, for example. 'If you have something that's going to fib one out of every 10 times you ask it a question, that means that you have to check its work every single time,' noted Bohanon. 'You have to be hypervigilant and therefore that's a deal breaker in a setting where you're using this to actually augment a human. When the stakes are high, you can't afford to have to use a tool that you can't trust.' When it comes to LLMs, Bohanon suggests being a skeptical buyer. When an analyst’s need to brainstorm can be addressed with ChatGPT, for example, they’re likely in safe territory regarding hallucinations. But if the need is mission critical with high stakes, users should be wary of LLMs without a final step for verification and fact checking. 'Even when they're used with best practices like RAG and other guardrails for Large Language Models, they still have an unacceptable error rate. Potential users should come in with the mindset that this technology is new and there's only a few shops out there like Primer that are taking that problem seriously.' Added Macnak: 'We’ve all heard ‘trust but verify.’ The valuable part of RAG-V is that it allows the user to see exactly why it made a decision and more importantly how that output was verified. Our focus remains on the end user, whether that's an analyst, operator, or warfighter. 'To that end, we're building products and technology around those individuals that actually work in order to serve them. The 0.1 percent error rate we’ve reached with RAG-V is a great example of why we're doing this for users making mission-critical decisions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/for-artificial-intelligence-to-be-mission-critical-it-must-hallucinate-less/	2024-12-17T05:25:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/THEAIR_1.jpg
Poland acquires General Atomics MQ-9B SkyGuardian in $310M deal	Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, announces a deal to buy American MQ-9 SkyGuardian drones. (Poland's MND) WARSAW — Poland has signed off on a $310 million purchase of MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones from General Atomics. Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, signed the documents on Dec. 12. While the agreement is the first purchase from Poland of the SkyGuardian — the name for General Atomics’ Reaper — Warsaw has been operating similar drones since February 2023, when the country entered into a $70.6 million lease with General Atomics for MQ-9A Reapers. Warsaw didn’t initially disclose the number of systems purchased, but a Monday press release from GA-ASI announced Poland purchased three MQ-9Bs and two Certifiable Ground Control Stations (CGCS), as well as three years of GA-ASI’s SkyGuardian Global Support Solutions. Poland will acquire three #MQ9B SkyGuardians to serve as its primary intelligence, surveillance and recon capability, joining a growing network of operators that includes the United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, India and the U.S. Read here: https://t.co/O6GXxUQYlv pic.twitter.com/ld4EXZ5iCD &mdash; GA-ASI (@GenAtomics_ASI) December 16, 2024 'This is a significant expense, but we are investing in the highest quality equipment,' said Kosiniak-Kamysz. He stated that the plan is for deliveries by first quarter 2027, 'However, we hope that this will happen sooner, which is what we are seeking from our proven partners.' A GA-ASI representative stressed after ceremony, 'It is possible that the delivery will be accelerated, because one of the first SkyGuardians intended for Poland has already been almost completed at the GA-ASI plant in San Diego.' 'This is an investment in Polish security and cooperation with a strategic partner — the United States. Poland is not only investing in the arms industry, but also strengthening economic relations with allies,' Kosiniak-Kamysz added.

The SkyGuardian comes with auto-takeoff and landing under SATCOM-only control, and can operate in unsegregated airspace. According to GA-ASI, the MQ-9B has seen contracts signed with 'Belgium, Canada, the Japan Coast Guard, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, Taiwan, India, and the U.S. Air Force in support of Special Operations Command.' The SkyGuardian purchase comes months after Kosiniak-Kamysz announced the creation of a so-called 'Drone Force,' following the model that Ukraine created earlier this year. (Earlier today, Russian defense minister Andrey Belousov also called for the creation of a drone-focused military branch.) 'A few months ago, I announced the creation of drone forces, which is becoming a fact,' Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'From January 1, 2025, drone forces will no longer be a plan, but a real part of the Polish Army. […] Building drone forces is an absolute priority for us. 'An effective deterrence and defense policy requires investment in this type of troops. On the one hand, we have simple drones that can be mass-produced, even using 3D printers, and on the other – the most advanced drones, such as the ones we are currently buying.' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/poland-acquires-general-atomics-mq-9b-skyguardian-in-310m-deal/	2024-12-16T12:47:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_poland_buys_mq9_BART-e1734381773849.jpg
Following delay, congressional panel on future US Navy can start work	Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group in the Atlantic Ocean, April 2019. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Maxwell Higgins) WASHINGTON — After more than a year of delays, a congressional commission focused on outlining the optimal size and composition of the future US Navy is set to begin work, according to sources familiar with the panel. The commission, originally empaneled in the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, was tasked by lawmakers to 'undertake a comprehensive study of the structure of the Navy and policy assumptions related to the size and force mixture of the Navy, in order— (I) to make recommendations on the size and force mixture of ships; and (II) to make recommendations on the size and force mixture of naval aviation.' The body’s final work was due earlier this year, but ultimately delayed as key lawmakers who were required to appoint individual members had not made their selections. A congressional aide told Breaking Defense the panel is now able to begin working. A second source also confirmed that 'work is underway now' and that 'all 8 members have been officially appointed.' Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was appointed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and selected earlier this month to co-chair the panel, according to the congressional record. Breaking Defense previously reported Mitchell Waldman, a defense and aerospace industry executive, and Bryan McGrath, a retired Navy officer, were both appointed to the commission.

First delivery for Air Force One slides to 2029, source says	Airman First Class Emily Albright (center) prepares to set chocks around Air Force One's landing gear Thursday, Jan. 30, 2014. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by 1st Lt. Nathan T. Wallin/Released) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s troubled project to provide two new Air Force One jets is facing new delays, likely pushing the delivery of the first jet out to 2029 or even later, a source told Breaking Defense. The Air Force is still working to validate the schedule for when Boeing can deliver the militarized jumbo jets, meaning they might arrive even later than 2029, according to the source, who requested anonymity to share non-public information. 'It’s an honor to be entrusted with this responsibility and we take pride in this work,' Boeing said in a statement. 'Our focus is on delivering two exceptional Air Force One airplanes for the country.' Negotiated under the previous Trump administration, the Air Force One deal has proved painful for Boeing amid massive headwinds, including over $2 billion in losses and years of delays. The jet’s first flight was last scheduled for March 2026, Breaking Defense previously reported, a setback of an additional 16 months. The Wall Street Journal first reported the new delivery date. An Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that Boeing is expected to provide a new master schedule in the spring. Once that’s delivered, the Air Force will then 'conduct a schedule risk assessment to inform establishing revised' dates for key milestones, such as when the aircraft could be operational. Officials expected the program to be about two-to-three years late under the revised 2022 schedule, which set the delivery of the first jet for September 2026 but with a year of schedule margin. The second was set to be delivered in February 2027, also with a full year of wiggle room. It’s not clear specifically when the jets would arrive under a revised plan. Boeing has faced a slew of challenges refurbishing the two 747s under contract for the program, ranging from supply chain to workforce. The new lags mean President-elect Donald Trump — who personally intervened in negotiations for the two jets — likely won’t be able to fly on a new Air Force One before his second term concludes. The first jet was originally expected this year. Trump’s return to the White House could also change the aircraft’s design once again, from a white and light-blue hue to his original preference for white, red and dark blue, Politico previously reported. The Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the aircraft’s 'livery options' were finalized last year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/first-delivery-for-air-force-one-slides-to-2029-source-says/	2024-12-16T09:52:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Air-Force-One-e1734368967339.jpg

(U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Brahim Douglas) SAVANNAH, Ga. — The US Army has made upgrading its command and control capabilities a priority, but has shared relatively few details about how exactly they’re pursuing the sprawling project. But last week at the service’s biannual Technical Exchange Meeting, service officials dove deeper into plans for the next-generation C2 (NGC2) program, revealing among other details a tiered 'technology stack' the capability will be built on, and how industry can make it a reality. 'We're really, no kidding, trying to do this different[ly] than we've ever done it before without falling into some of the traps,' Mark Kitz, program executive officer of the Command, Control Communications-Network portfolio, told Breaking Defense. The plan can seem a bit complicated, as Army officials acknowledged, so they urged industry to keep an eye on the program’s ever-evolving characteristics of need (CON) document. 'It's not going to be one empirical document that drives us,' Gen. Patrick Ellis, director of the Army’s network cross-functional team, said on a TEM panel. 'There's going to be multiple in there. As we write those multiple documents, we're using that as our North Star to say, ‘Okay, this is what we're trying to design towards.’' (The document, first published in April, was last updated on Dec. 9.) The document won’t be the only thing that’s ever-evolving. Officials said they’re attempting to build as much flexibility into the acquisition process as possible, both to encourage creativity from vendors and to be able to drop those who aren’t cutting it. 'The government's actually not really good at building escape hatches into our contracts, and we need to be,' Alexander Miller, the senior advisor for science and technology and the chief technology officer to the Chief of Staff of the Army said during a panel. 'As much as we're talking about bringing on the right players, we're going to get rid of the wrong players. If we aren't being good teammates, and you aren't being good teammates, or somebody out there isn't being a good teammate, we don't want to team with them.' The technology stack, as described by Army officials and shown in a slide presentation at the TEM, was included in the CON document in order to 'drive home the importance that we have all of this in place,' Joe Welch, deputy to the commanding general at Army Futures Command, said during a panel. At the top of the stack is the application layer, which is responsible for user-facing applications like file transfer systems, web browsing, etc. — think anything that the user can see on the front end. Under the application layer is the operating systems layer, the software layer that underpins the user interface. Welch called this layer the 'integrated data layer' that’s responsible for 'the collection of services, data interfaces and data models that ultimately are supportive of those applications and allow applications to be built without having to rebuild services that other things may already be taking advantage of.' The third layer is the compute layer, which serves as the infrastructure layer that harnesses the processing power used to run the application and the operating systems layer. That may sound like fairly standard tech, but Welch said the compute layer 'is enormously more challenging when we start getting into the tactical operational environment.' Compute resources are not as readily available out in the field as they are at larger command posts or rearguard headquarters. 'It's a very hard optimization problem, and if it doesn't work, the applications and the services that I just mentioned, those top two layers, are not going to work either,' Welch said. The transport layer is at the bottom of the tech stack. This layer is responsible for managing the delivery of data between applications. It’s the way that data moves across the battle space, Welch said. As Breaking Defense has reported, battlefield bandwidth has emerged as an obstacle in data-rich and/or electronically contested environments. 'They could be WiFi. They could be radios, mesh networks. They could be pLeo [proliferated low-Earth orbit satellites]. They could be specially designed wave forms to minimize our electromagnetic signature. It could be all of the above, right? So that needs to work seamlessly as well,' he said. When finding the appropriate tools for the tech stack layers, Welch said the service needs to keep the standardization of application programming interfaces, or APIs, into account. 'A lot of the challenges we have with our systems today is that there is no standard way of communication between these layers. The layers are built in a disparate fashion, and there's also no communication between them. So that is a main focus area that we're going to have. The goal is open and standardized APIs, but the way that we achieve that is going to be very deliberate,' he said. The tech stack, as described last week, may not be the same one the Army wants next month or next year, however. Down the line, layers might be added as the service and its vendors establish what capabilities and requirements are needed through trial and error, Welch said. He emphasized that because of this, the service is going to write requirements that are less prescriptive, but still give industry enough of an idea of what the Army needs for NGC2. 'We're continuing to better describe the problem characteristics of the solution space, but still we are not getting prescriptive in a sense of, ‘This is the technology we need, this is the vendor we need to get it from,’ those types of things,' Welch said during an interview on the sidelines of the conference. 'It's still very much in the attributes of the solutions more so than the solutions themselves.' In another effort to create more flexibility in the program, the Army will not have one lead systems integrator for NGC2, but instead will have a few team leaders, Kitz said in an interview. 'Having competition and giving our users opportunities to prototype with more than one solution is potentially powerful, and it also stimulates industry investment, because there's more opportunities for industry. We certainly want to avoid this incumbency, right? We don't want an [integrator] who's going to lead us for the next 10 years, right? We want constant competition. We want constant new teaming.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-technology-stack-driving-the-armys-next-gen-c2-plans/	2024-12-16T09:43:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_DVIDS_george_c2_laptop_8298338-scaled-e1734368595302.jpg
Bring on the unstoppable rise of thinking war machines	GHWB Sailors perform a weapons trial on a Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) on the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77) during carrier qualifications. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Brandon Roberson) The war in Ukraine has demonstrated, once and for all, that drones are here to stay — but it has also underlined that battlefield communications are fragile and easily disrupted, leaving drones unable to receive their orders from their operators. The US military is developing ways to defeat pervasive signal jamming, but it should recognize there will be no silver bullet, and that there will be times when the jammers win. The solution: The military will eventually need more machines that can think like human soldiers, deciding autonomously what to destroy and who to kill in ambiguous battlefield conditions. And to secure future battlefields, the Pentagon, and the public, will need to get over its 'Terminator' fears and embrace reality. The Pentagon is working to mitigate the effectiveness of Russian signal jammers in Ukraine, trying to enhance the jam resistance of weapons systems provided to the Ukrainian military. As another method to defeat jamming, Ukrainian forces seem to be targeting electronic warfare systems themselves, using munitions that aim for equipment emitting jamming signals. The architecture of proliferated satellite constellations has offered some protection against jamming, but Russia is increasingly successful at degrading Starlink service and has consistently been able to disrupt many other signals — like GPS and drone command and control links. For navigation, military officials are also looking at GPS alternatives that do not use signals, like image-aided and laser scanner navigation technologies. This is a cat-and-mouse game between the jammers and the jammed, with both sides racing to develop technologies that defeat each other's latest and greatest capabilities. What works one week might be obsolete the next. And that means that human control — differentiating between enemy and friendly soldiers and civilians, enemy and friendly aircraft and civilian airplanes, among other battlefield variables in various weather conditions and during daytime and nighttime — can never be assured, even mission to mission. Hence, the need to limit direct operator control. Broadly speaking, automated decision-making for identifying and engaging targets is not a new concept. Existing weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, mines, torpedoes, as well as systems like the Phalanx radar-guided gun and Israel’s Harpy drone, make lethal decisions autonomously, albeit following a very tight script that probably falls short of being considered artificial intelligence. Though a magnetic underwater mine detonating is an automatic reaction to it coming near a metallic warship hull, the action — the 'decision' made — looks more like the instincts of a closing Venus flytrap than like human decision-making. For years, the United States has looked at ways to incorporate AI into weapon systems, but has shown hesitancy towards AI-enabled autonomous weapons making lethal decisions without a human in the loop. Improved electronic warfare techniques should create an added sense of urgency and a reason for US policymakers and military leaders to reassess that reluctance. Unlike the United States, neither Russia nor China appear to be circumspect about AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapons. Moreover, they are already collaborating on AI-powered weapon systems. Along with other weapons, Russia has been testing a tank-like robot which could conceivably one day operate autonomously, potentially making real-time decisions on the battlefield about what to shoot. China is developing a myriad of warfighting systems, like submarines and aircraft, that are designed to make decisions autonomously without a human in the loop. Other countries are taking a similar approach. For example, Ukraine is working to deploy swarms of automated drones that do not require communications with operators to identify and attack their targets. The Pentagon lags behind, despite the fact there are no laws [PDF] that prohibit the development or use of AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapon systems. Perhaps the best example is the Bullfrog counter-drone system, which would become the first publicly known AI-enabled autonomous lethal weapon used by the US military. This system is a leap beyond legacy ones like Phalanx, Harpy, or underwater mine because it's not just reacting to one input—like a radar signature, radio emission, or magnetic signature—but rather using sensors to comprehensively understand its environment, identify hostile drones, and make decisions based on its human-trained algorithms. But Bullfrog is the exception, unfortunately, and not the norm. The US military should focus more on AI-enabled autonomous lethal weapons, particularly ones focused on drones, developing the technology so that it meets military requirements and addresses ethical concerns. Like Bullfrog, such systems can be designed for two modes—one allowing a human in the loop and another with full autonomy—so that fully automated capabilities are only used when and where appropriate to battlefield conditions. It must be acknowledged that lethal autonomous weapons will make mistakes. But humans also make mistakes. And civilians, or simply the wrong targets, fall into the crosshairs of today’s weapons systems that are guided by humans. Whereas humans may be susceptible to emotions, such as revenge, in the heat of battle, a weapon system trained using machine learning would not. Arguably, this means that machines might even make more predictable and rational decisions than people on the battlefield. They will also have to operate 'alongside' human soldiers, so work will be needed to examine and optimize the human-robot battlefield relationship. And if the US develops these systems now, AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapon systems elsewhere are more likely to reflect American and allied respect and adherence to the law of war, not ceding first mover advantage to Russia and China. During a future war in which the US military may not be able to consistently access parts of the radio spectrum, it will still need to offensively use uncrewed drones and defend against them, probably in very complex and fluid environments. Possession of AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapons will probably make Russia and China more eager and willing to jam as much radio spectrum as possible, because they will not need it for the tactical fight on the battlefield. If human soldiers find themselves cut off from communications with commanders, they can survive and win. If remotely operated machines are cut off, they do not work. The United States should focus on developing AI-enabled machines, particularly aerial drones and counter-drone systems, that can think, fight, and destroy without human direction. There is no reason to delay efforts to design and build algorithms and autonomous lethal warfighting systems that meet military needs and adhere to US values and principles. Otherwise, the United States cedes a huge battlefield advantage to Russia and China.
