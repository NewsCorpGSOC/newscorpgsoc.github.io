No sailors in sight: DARPA launches warship designed ‘from the ground up’ to be truly unmanned	DARPA’s NOMARS is a 180-footlong warship designed from the ground up to not have humans aboard. (Photo courtesy of DARPA) WASHINGTON — A key Pentagon research and development agency said it has successfully launched and will soon begin sea trials for a vessel dubbed 'NOMARS,' a warship built from the ground up to sail without any humans aboard. 'The No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program has built a ship designed to operate autonomously for long durations at sea,' according to a statement from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on Tuesday. 'Construction of the prototype, unmanned surface vessel (USV) was completed in February 2025.' Sea trials for the ship, dubbed Defiant (USX-1) and which does not have any mission or combat systems installed onboard, are scheduled for spring 2025, the statement added. DARPA in August 2022 selected tech and engineering firm SERCO to design and build NOMARS, a USV measuring 180 feet long and weighing 240 metric tons. While the Pentagon’s interest in unmanned surface vessels is well documented — and industry’s supply of options is vast — NOMARS aims to fulfill a somewhat surprising gap given the technology's name: An operational ship with no people aboard. The majority of USVs the Pentagon uses are either small drones that could not physically carry a human (i.e. Saildrone) or they have been modified to operate autonomously but still have all the relevant spaces to sustain life (i.e. Mariner). The US Navy has taken to calling the ladder 'optionally manned ships.' Proponents of the technology argue that allowing for 'optional manning' defeats the purpose of unmanned ships from the start. The spaces required for human life — bunks, food storage, bathrooms, life preservation equipment — are costly. Cue the NOMARS program. 'The NOMARS program aims to challenge the traditional naval architecture model, designing a seaframe (the ship without mission systems) from the ground up with no provision, allowance, or expectation for humans on board,' according to DARPA. 'By removing the human element from all ship design considerations, the program intends to demonstrate significant advantages, to include: size, cost, at-sea reliability, greater hydrodynamic efficiency, survivability to sea-state, and survivability to adversary actions through stealth considerations and tampering resistance.' Doing as much presents its own sets of challenges, but also a new world of potential solutions. For example, what happens if a fire breaks out aboard Defiant? The answer, Navy officials and others have previously told Breaking Defense, is that the ship can be equipped with a special gas that floods its internal spaces. That gas, which would have health repercussions if humans inhaled it, can deprive the compartment of oxygen, snuffing out a fire.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/no-sailors-in-sight-darpa-launches-warship-designed-from-the-ground-up-to-be-truly-unmanned/	2025-03-05T05:10:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250304_defiant_ship_DARPA_cropped.png

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jackson Adkins) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump today announced the creation of a shipbuilding office in the White House centered on revitalizing the nation’s commercial and naval shipbuilding industry. 'To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,' Trump said during a presidential address to a joint session of Congress, to applause from Republican lawmakers. 'And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs. 'We used to make so many ships,' the president added. 'We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon, it will have a huge impact.' Trump did not specify what kind of financial incentives the office could provide to industry, nor did he provide other details about the role the new office will play in bolstering naval shipbuilding. The Navy’s shipbuilding industrial base has faced supply chain constraints and workforce shortages after years of consolidation and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the mass retirements of skilled laborers. Over the past couple of years, Congress has provided billions in additional funds to shore up the submarine industrial base, which has been especially impacted by supply chain challenges. The announcement of the new shipbuilding office is part of what Trump characterized as a focus on building 'the most powerful military of the future,' which also includes the construction of a comprehensive missile defense system for the United States homeland that is now being called Golden Dome.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/trump-announces-new-white-house-shipbuilding-office/	2025-03-04T20:27:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/7987135-e1696858610380.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: Lockheed out of Navy’s F/A-XX future fighter program	An F/A-18 Hornet assigned to the Gladiators of Strike Fighter Attack Squadron (VFA) 106 prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71). (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Alex Millar/Released) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Lockheed Martin is out of the running for the Navy’s sixth-generation fighter jet program, known as Next Generation Air Dominance or F/A-XX, Breaking Defense has learned. A source with knowledge of the program told Breaking Defense that Lockheed submitted a bid to the Navy, but the proposal did not satisfy the service’s criteria. The company is now no longer proceeding with the bid. The Navy previously told Breaking Defense in November that the service was evaluating proposals, but it is unclear when Lockheed was knocked out of the competition. The outcome leaves a horse race between Northrop Grumman and Boeing to replace the venerable F/A-18 and E/A-18 with a new air superiority fighter. At stake for Northrop is its first fighter contract since the F-14 Tomcat, famed for its appearance in the original Top Gun movie; at stake for Boeing is the future of its fighter arm, which has seen a massive investment in its St. Louis facility on a gamble that the company will win a sixth-gen contract from the US military. Lockheed referred a request for comment to the Navy. The Navy did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Lockheed, which cornered the market on fifth-generation fighters through its ubiquitous F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor, still has a shot to build a sixth-generation jet through the Air Force’s separate fighter competition, also known as Next Generation Air Dominance, where the company is facing off against Boeing. The F/A-XX program is the highest-profile aircraft competition in the Navy in two decades, but the service has kept the effort highly secretive. Little is known about the capabilities or requirements of the aircraft, aside from the fact that it will be built to complement the F-35 aboard the service’s warships and will have a different airframe and engine than the Air Force’s sixth-gen fighter effort. John Phelan, the Trump administration’s pick to become the next Navy secretary, characterized F/A-XX as a 'next-generation aircraft, offering significant advancements in operational reach and capacity within contested environments' in written answers to questions from lawmakers published last week. The program 'is intended to enable Carrier Strike Groups to outpace adversaries while maintaining naval air dominance,' and will involve collaboration with the Air Force and Marine Corps on autonomy, mission systems, communication architectures, and autonomous combat drones, he wrote [PDF]. In its fiscal 2025 budget request, the Navy delayed about $1 billion of research and development funding that had been slated for F/A-XX in order to fund other readiness priorities while keeping the service’s budget within the constraints of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. 'We’re absolutely committed to the capacity and lethality of the carrier wing,' Rear Adm. Ben Reynolds, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for budget, told reporters in March 2024. 'The capacity [and] the firepower of the air wing is orders of magnitude above anything else that [the Defense Department] has.' Navy officials have publicly remained committed to awarding an F/A-XX contract this year, a contrast with the Air Force, which put its NGAD program on hold last year as it assessed the program. The Air Force conducted an internal analysis last year, which supported the development and fielding of a manned sixth generation fighter, but officials punted a decision on whether to continue the program to the Trump administration. Stephen Feinberg, the nominee for deputy defense secretary, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the decision on the Air Force program could be made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or President Donald Trump. Justin Katz in Washington contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/exclusive-lockheed-out-of-navys-f-a-xx-future-fighter-program/	2025-03-04T14:03:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/220617_f18_aircraft_carrier_1638656-scaled-e1655486661613.jpg
Air Force fields FMS inquiries for MH-139 Grey Wolf helo as test campaign progresses	An MH-139 Grey Wolf flies in formation with UH-1N Hueys as part of an initial operational test and evaluation campaign. (US Air Force photo by Senior Airman Mary Bowers) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Ahead of potential orders, the Air Force has begun gathering interest in foreign military sales (FMS) for the service’s MH-139 Grey Wolf helicopter, another signal of confidence in the platform that has now entered a key evaluation phase. Supplied by Boeing as a replacement for the Air Force’s aging UH-1N Huey, the Grey Wolf as envisioned will be primarily tasked with supporting nuclear security, as well as ferrying VIPs in the Washington, DC-area. And, in an interview with Breaking Defense on Feb. 26, Boeing's Manager for Utility Helicopter Programs Azeem Khan said the helo has already sparked international interest. 'As we look at the program moving forward, we’re also excited [about] the interest and the demand signal that we’re seeing, both domestically and from potential customers around the world,' he said, noting that the attention spurred the Air Force to open an FMS office. 'We’re not far enough along to talk specifics at this moment, but the versatility of the platform [for] military customers is generating interest, and we’re continuing to take a look at those and see where we take this program on its next chapter.' Asked to comment on an FMS office for the program, an Air Force official told Breaking Defense that the service 'is fielding FMS inquiries for the MH-139. However, nothing has been formalized at this time.' Foreign sales would be a boon for Boeing as well as the Italian firm Leonardo, whose commercial AW139 serves as the Grey Wolf’s baseline. It may also help restore some helicopters the companies were originally expecting to manufacture following the Air Force’s apparent move to cut the Grey Wolf’s program of record. Former Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter previously explained the cuts would likely affect some of the helo's secondary roles, like VIP flights and search-and-rescue assistance. However, a Pentagon report last year revealed the service may be looking to add back in some aircraft for the Grey Wolf program, meaning that some roles may be on the table once again. Still, Khan said that though Boeing officials are aware of talks of trimming the MH-139 buy, a decision to change the program of record has not been finalized. 'As of today, we have not been formally notified that our program of record has been cut. We execute on what we have in front of us, and it's focusing on our requirements and our contractual deliverables,' he said, adding that a contract award for the program’s next production lot is expected sometime this year. As the evaluation campaign has proceeded, users have identified some needed changes to the platform, which the Pentagon’s top weapons tester said in a recent report [PDF] range from altering cabin seating to redesigning the aircraft’s gun mount and accompanying bag to catch spent shells. 'What we're delivering, from a configuration perspective, is what we are on contract for, and what the aircraft is being tested through is that configuration,' Khan said. Since the helicopter’s contract was awarded in 2018, 'needs and desires have also changed, but we're maintaining the contracted configuration, and we’re always open to opportunities to continue to enhance and improve that where it makes sense. And that's just part of the journey of this product life cycle, and we’re in close coordination with the Air Force.' Meanwhile, the platform itself continues to progress through its test campaign. According to an Air Force press release, on Jan. 28 an MH-139 embarked on its first initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) flight at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana by escorting a missile convoy, kicking off assessments of the helicopter’s effectiveness in operational scenarios. The IOT&amp;E stage is expected to continue through June of this year, the Air Force press release says. Khan said the aircraft’s initial operational capability, or the milestone that indicates when a system has been fielded in sufficient quantities and can be maintained to support real-world operations, is expected 'toward the back end of the year.' Sometime after that, the program is expected to enter full rate production, he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/air-force-fields-fms-inquiries-for-mh-139-grey-wolf-helo-as-test-campaign-progresses/	2025-03-04T11:43:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/grey-wolf-mh-139.jpeg
Nominee for top DoD policy job sidesteps questions on Russian invasion of Ukraine	Elbridge Colby, then the Robert M. Gates senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, asks U.S. Air Force Gen. Paul J. Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a question during a National Defense University Center conference in Washington, Jan. 19, 2016. (DoD photo by Army Staff Sgt. Sean K. Harp) WASHINGTON — Less than a day after President Donald Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, his pick for the top Pentagon policy job frustrated Democrats by refusing to state outright that Russia invaded Ukraine. Elbridge Colby, who Trump nominated for the Defense Department’s undersecretary for policy in December, has previously stated that the invasion of Ukraine was 'an evil act by the Russians.' However, during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee today, Colby repeatedly sidestepped questions on the topic, citing the sensitivity of ongoing peace negotiations led by Trump. 'I stand by my record, but at this point, I think there's a very delicate diplomatic process going on where the president is rightfully trying to resuscitate the peace process,' he said in response to questions by SASC top Democrat Sen. Jack Reed. He later dodged similar questions from other senators, including Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Angus King, Ind.-Maine, Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. 'It's important to be discreet and say things at the appropriate time and place,' Colby told King. 'The problem is, you tell us you're going to tell truth to power,' King said. 'The most obvious truth is that Russia invaded Ukraine. Everybody in the world knows that, and you won't say it here today, because it appears that you don't want to offend the president.' Duckworth said Colby’s refusal to state 'a known fact' was tantamount to 'saying you don't know whether or not Hitler invaded Poland.' Colby’s testimony comes days after a disastrous meeting between Trump, Vice President JD Vance — who introduced Colby during the hearing — and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last week. The meeting was set for the parties to agree to a mineral-rights deal, but devolved into a public argument in which Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being insufficiently thankful to the United States for billions of dollars in military aid. Numerous news outlets reported on Monday, citing White House sources, that Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine as a result. Colby, whose longtime tenure in government includes positions such as the Pentagon’s deputy assistant secretary for strategy and force development, is best known as one of the authors of the Trump administration’s 2018 National Defense Strategy, which centered on great power competition with China and Russia over counterterrorism. Known within Washington circles as a foreign policy 'realist,' Colby has advocated that the United States pare back its involvement in the Middle East and Europe — including its aid for Ukraine — to focus its resources against the Chinese threat. In his opening comments, Reed said that Trump’s decision to cut military aid to Ukraine damages US relationship with its allies and could embolden China. 'The administration’s actions are doing great harm to America’s standing in the world, showing anyone who is paying attention that the United States can no longer be trusted,' he said. 'President Xi will take note.' However, Colby stood by his past statements that the US must prioritize a potential fight in the Asia-Pacific theater over its support of Ukraine. 'I don't contest the fact that the Chinese are looking at what we're doing in Ukraine at all,' Colby said. 'But fundamentally, Senator, my view — and I think it should be of particular interest to this committee, sir — is that we have to have the military capabilities in Asia, or relevant to Asia, to be able to conduct a local defense of Taiwan at a cost and level of risk that the American people are prepared to tolerate, and that has been my main focus.' 'A longer term top priority for me would be, if confirmed, would be to revivify our defense industrial base, so that we are no longer in a position where our defense industrial base cannot produce at levels, where we can resource in multiple theaters at the level that we need,' he added. Later in the hearing, Colby defended Trump’s actions on Ukraine, stating that the president is a 'deal maker' whose unpredictability gives him leverage during negotiations. 'With President Trump, you have a very different dynamic. You don't know what he's going to do, but you can get a deal with him,' he said. While Colby is likely to be confirmed, his nomination has come under scrutiny from some Republicans who have quietly questioned his noninterventionist stance on the Middle East, resulting in GOP heavy hitters like Vance and Elon Musk stepping in to defend his record, Politico reported last month. However, only Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Dan Sullivan of Alaska asked pointed questions regarding Colby’s position in the Middle East, with both lawmakers interrogating the nominee on his position on Iran. Colby responded that a nuclear armed Iran — particularly one with access to intercontinental ballistic missiles — would be an existential threat to the United States, and that he would provide military options to the president to stop Iran from gaining access to nuclear weapons. Multiple times throughout the hearing, Colby stated he would help support defense acquisition reform efforts, with Vance characterizing Colby as a 'good guy' that would be willing to work with Democrats on such policy objectives. 'That means not just buying more weapons,' Vance said. 'That means being smart about how we buy weapons in a way that enhances our technological edge and ensures that upstarts, not just the big five incumbents, but upstarts, can participate in the process of procurement and of giving our troops the weapons systems that they need.' Colby’s reticence to assign blame for the Russia-Ukraine conflict echoed statements made by Stephen Feinberg, Trump’s nominee for deputy secretary of defense, during his nomination hearing last week. Elsewhere on Capitol Hill this morning, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a confirmation hearing for two State Department nominees and the representative to NATO, where Democrats pressed nominees with similar questions about whether Russia invaded Ukraine. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., asked Christopher Landau, who has been nominated to be the State Department’s deputy secretary, 'Do you think that Putin and Russia were the aggressors in Ukraine?' 'Senator, at this point, there are peace negotiations taking place across the world —' Landau responded before Van Hollen cut him off, and posed the same question to Matthew Whitaker, who is nominated to be the US representative to NATO. 'I’m not here to assign labels, but I would say that JD Vance on Friday said that Russia invaded Ukraine,' he responded. 'Ok, so you don’t know if they’re the aggressor,' the senator shot back.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/nominee-for-top-dod-policy-job-sidesteps-questions-on-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/	2025-03-04T11:26:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/2363052-scaled-e1741112606915.jpg
‘Europe’s moment:’ EU unveils $843B ‘ReArm Europe’ spending plan, as US-Ukraine relations flail	Ursula von der Leyen delivers an announcement on a new $843 billion EU defense package (European Commission) BELFAST — As allies brace for the US to cut military funding for Ukraine, the European Union announced today a new €800 billion ($843 billion) package to 'rearm' the continent, dubbed &#8216;ReArm Europe.' Unveiling the plan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, was blunt, saying, 'We are in an era of rearmament. And Europe is ready to massively boost its defense spending.' 'This is Europe's moment, and we must live up to it,' she added. Coincidentally or not, the announcement comes on a day when President Donald Trump will address the US congress, and as multiple reports say Washington has decided to cut off military aid and may stop the transfer of weapons to Ukraine following an explosive meeting in the Oval Office between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ReArm Europe funding will be dependent on securing €650 billion over four years by triggering a 'national escape clause' that suspends budget rules, allows national governments greater flexibility over public funding and could produce, on average, a 1.5 percent defense spending increase per member state. A 'new instrument' offering €150 billion of loans to member states would be responsible for delivering the remainder of the funding. Additionally, member states will be able to redirect funding from other EU projects to increase defense related efforts. Von der Leyen stressed that the rearmament project rests on 'spending better – and spending together,' while at the same time will focus on developing 'pan-European capability domains.' She referred specifically to ammunition, air and missile defense, artillery systems, drones and missiles as weapons that Europe needs to invest in. 'Of course, with this equipment, Member States can massively step up their support to Ukraine,' she added. We are living in dangerous times. Europe‘s security is threatened in a very real way. Today I present ReArm Europe. A plan for a safer and more resilient Europe ↓ https://t.co/CYTytB5ZMk &mdash; Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) March 4, 2025 The rearmament plan also signals a stronger joint procurement push by the EU, which von der Leyen said will 'reduce costs, reduce fragmentation increase interoperability and strengthen our defense industrial base.' European officials voiced strong support for von der Leyen’s rearmament plan. On X, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis labelled it a 'significant step toward strengthening our collective European security.' He added, 'We must now work out the details to ensure that all member states benefit—regardless of their current defense spending.' Similarly, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s outgoing foreign minister, said the initiative was an 'important first step' in strengthening Europe defense. More broadly, the level of spending proposed under ReArm Europe is directly in line with calls from industry to urgently move the needle. Last month, Saab CEO Micael Johansson, told Breaking Defense that if the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP) could not go beyond a proposed budget of €1.5 billion and reach 'hundreds of billions' then a 'coalition of the willing' should be formed to fund major equipment projects and scale up production. Von der Leyen's announcement comes two days before European leaders gather for a 'special' European Council meeting in Brussels to discuss additional support for Kyiv and 'exchange views on European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine,' according to an EU statement. Since Friday's explosive meeting in the Oval Office, Europe has been scrambling to come to grips with the reality that it may be alone in challenging Russia. That means any strategy needs to not only involve improving individual state defenses, but also helping to support Ukraine going forward. Whether Europe can step up and fill that void is very much a question, one on display Tuesday morning at a a UK defence committee hearing on European security. Julian David, CEO at TechUK, said that even outside of obvious heavy equipment like ATACMS, Patriot and HIMARS, the MoD would be unable to replace US communications and 'information, surveillance and reconnaissance' capabilities. He added, 'Everybody talks about Starlink, but it's a broader problem than that, and that really does need thinking about, even at the level of GPS.' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, said that production of ammunition across Europe would effectively need to double in order to make up for the absence of US stocks. 'That’s a big ask,' he explained.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/europes-moment-eu-unveils-843b-rearm-europe-spending-plan-as-us-ukraine-relations-flail/	2025-03-04T11:05:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/P065815-187142-scaled-e1741108794189.jpg
Mach announces deal with Army lab for vertical takeoff ‘Strategic Strike’ cruise missile	California-based defense firm Mach announced on March 4, 2025 it was working with a US Army lab to develop a new vertically launched cruise missile dubbed Strategic Strike. (Mach) WASHINGTON — Mach Industries has announced a recent deal with an Army research lab to work on a vertical takeoff (VTO) cruise missile called Strategic Strike. Based in Huntington Beach, Calif., the company said today that the Army Applications Laboratory awarded it with an undisclosed amount of funding last year to work on a new weapon for soldiers at the company- through brigade-level formations. The weapon, according to Mach, is being designed to hit targets up to 290 km (180 miles) away and host a 10-plus kg (22-lbs) warhead. 'The primary objective for Strategic Strike is to launch from beyond enemy radar range, reducing the probability of detection, and increasing launch team survivability,' Mach said in the press release. 'Tactical maneuver units will be able to engage and prosecute high-payoff targets, such as radar arrays and artillery pieces, well beyond the forward line of troops.' The company said it locked down the weapon’s design in September 2024 before 'successfully' testing out its vertical take-off during a full-performance, wing-borne flight in mid-January. It is now integrating 'artificial intelligence visual' and radio frequency sensing techniques into the cruise missile to enable it to hit a target when GPS and communication is severed — a growing requirement as strategists watch the electronic warfare-saturated combat environment in Ukraine. 'The combination of VTO, high speed and range/payload is radically novel for the current fighting force,' Mach said in the press release. 'At the culmination of the contract, Mach will provide the warfighter with a VTO asset that has HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] range, cruise missile speed, and Hellfire effects.' As novel as it is, Mach is not the only company working on a new class of such vertical takeoff weapons. While not a cruise missile, Anduril Industries has been working on a subsonic, vertical takeoff and landing drone dubbed Roadrunner-Munition (Roadrunner-M) that the company says can be reused on surveillance missions or in a kamikaze-like fashion to strike moving aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/mach-announces-deal-with-army-lab-for-vertical-takeoff-strategic-strike-cruise-missile/	2025-03-04T10:48:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250304_strategic_strike_MACH.png
New thinking needed to safeguard our spectrum	U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Geoffery Smith, 20th Communications Squadron installation spectrum manager, views the display on a radio spectrum analyzer at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., Jan. 13, 2017. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Kathryn R.C. Reaves) If the Pentagon was asked to relocate its air bases, radar stations, missile silos, and other facilities to make room for wind farm developers, Congress would reject the idea out of hand. Such a massive disruption would threaten our national security and cost taxpayers untold billions of dollars — all to benefit a few. Yet effectively the same debate is taking place over another kind of real estate: the radio spectrum bands set aside to carry the military’s wireless transmissions, including the frequencies needed and used today and in the future for radar, targeting, and command-and-control systems, and potentially for envisioned systems like hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. Some in industry are again seeking to gain exclusive control over additional portions of the spectrum, including those used by the military, through spectrum auctions. Some in Congress are taking the proposal seriously. At the center of the debate is a slice of spectrum the military cannot plausibly replace: the mid-band frequencies between 3.1 and 3.5 GHz that offer the ideal mix of range and capacity for defense applications. For example, the Navy’s Aegis AN/SPY radar operates in this band. That is one reason defense champions in Congress have repeatedly raised concerns about the security threat posed by efforts to sell off these critically important segments of military spectrum. Former Pentagon CIO John Sherman explained that vacating the band would be 'absolutely untenable,' taking decades to complete. It would also cost more than taxpayers could ever hope to gain from auction revenues. Moving the Navy’s Aegis radar system alone comes with a price tag of $120 billion. What many fail to consider is that Congress doesn’t need to eject the military from these frequencies in order to free up spectrum for private use and gain the appropriate economic benefits for the American people. Reframing the discussion from one or the other, to one with the other is not only possible but necessary. Proven spectrum sharing models, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), demonstrate that the military can retain priority access to key spectrum while safely and securely opening the band to factories, warehouses, rural internet providers, schools, airports, and other innovative users. As a result, consumers gain the benefits from new wireless technologies, improved connectivity, and more competitive prices — without forcing massive costs and dangerous disruptions on our armed services. We should continue to aggressively pursue proven sharing technologies, innovate new ones, and scale to multiple geographic areas and spectrum ranges. This approach affirms US global leadership in spectrum innovation. Bureaucratic inertia may tempt Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to fall back on an exclusive, full-power licensing model rooted in the cell phone technologies of the 80s and 90s. That playbook assumes a false choice between national security and commercial innovation. In fact, spectrum sharing models support dual-use innovative technologies, maintain national security needs, and allow commercial use of the contested frequency bands. It’s time for new thinking. Military leaders have made it clear they are prepared to share key spectrum with a diverse array of users — so long as these commercial systems don’t interfere with operations or force the Pentagon to vacate vital frequencies. Now it’s up to Congress, the FCC, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to embrace spectrum sharing as the only reasonable solution to the country’s current spectrum stalemate. By setting aside dangerous and costly proposals for relocating military spectrum, we can clear the way for innovative sharing technologies that will reinforce US wireless leadership, boost competition, and create jobs. National leaders don’t need to accept the false choice between exclusive, full-power licensing and military readiness. It’s a recipe for failure. Instead, we should build on proven models for shared spectrum that can preserve our national security while still maximizing the use of a scarce national resource, increase taxpayer revenue, and advance American businesses and technologies around the world.

Space Systems Command chief backs ‘important’ work of Space Development Agency	Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant speaks during a Department of the Air Force worship service at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., Sept. 10, 2023. (U.S. Air Force/Eric Dietrich) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The head of the Space Force’s main acquisition arm expressed full confidence in the Space Development Agency (SDA) on Monday, offering support for both the entity’s work as well as its independent status within the service. 'I think it's fantastic work. It's continuing. It's important,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander of the Space Force's Space Systems Command (SSC), said in a Monday roundtable with reporters at the AFA Warfare conference in Aurora, Colo. 'And I think the Space Development Agency will continue to be an incredibly important part of the Space Force, independent and completely separate from SSC.' Originally established outside the Space Force by reporting directly to the Pentagon’s research and development office, SDA was required by Congress to transfer into the Space Force in 2022, but has maintained its quasi-independent status. However, as Breaking Defense first reported, the Trump administration is reviewing whether SDA should be more fully rolled into the Space Force acquisition system. SDA also finds itself at an awkward place, as its leader, Derek Tournear, is currently suspended while being investigated over whether he improperly steered a contract to a preferred company — something that led to Garrant briefly serving as SDA's acting head before being replaced. Despite all that, Garrant was clear he has been impressed with the work SDA has done. 'They have demonstrated, I'll call them inter- and intra-constellation crosslinks, which is pretty amazing when you think about how quickly they did that,' he said. SDA is currently developing a low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation that can transport data around the world, using a so-called 'mesh' network that relies on laser communications links between satellites. And the agency's approach has drawn concerns from the Government Accountability Office, which found in a February watchdog report that SDA has yet to prove the technology is viable. Asked about the report’s findings, Garrant said making sure the laser links — otherwise known as optical communications — work will be critical for the Space Force’s orbital architecture to function. 'Optical crosslinks are important to all of our constellations, not just in LEO but between orbital regimes as well. When you contemplate moving data at operationally relevant speeds, we're going to need to be able to do that. We're going to have to be able to do it between constellations as well,' he said. 'So it's a critical area that will get the attention that the GAO is pointing out.' The Elon Musk led DOGE effort to cut the federal workforce has been hitting agencies across the government, and Garrant said SSC has not been spared of large workforce cuts. 'A considerable number of SSC employees' took the deferred resignation plan offered to federal workers, according to the general, who added that there are a 'number' of probationary employees at the command whose easier-to-fire status has made them a favorite target of DOGE’s workforce cuts. Garrant said officials are working to quickly off-ramp employees, as well as ensure essential work remains covered. Garrant additionally said SSC will play its part to contribute to a budget drill ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that seeks to shift roughly eight percent of DoD funding to new priorities. In a separate roundtable with reporters Monday, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said the Space Force’s options for the budget drill essentially amounted to time and capacity, meaning that projects could be delayed or fewer systems could be fielded for the same mission in order to save money. 'I think that there is a recognition that we have a new mission, and the new mission comes with new resources. It's just about how much of those resources you get, how fast you get it,' Saltzman replied when asked what areas the Space Force may have to pull back in. 'I haven't really seen a push to give up anything. It's more about capacity and timeliness' for certain programs, he added. And as the Space Force jostles for funds under Hegseth’s new approach, Saltzman made his priority clear in a keynote address to the AFA conference on Monday. The Space Force, Saltzman said, must establish 'space superiority,' including by exercising 'space control' — protection of friendly space assets and denying adversaries the ability to use their own space capabilities — by degrading, disrupting or even destroying enemy satellite systems if necessary. 'Space control is a new function for our fledgling service and it's my No. 1 priority whenever I speak to executive and legislative leaders, because we currently don't have the resources to perform it as effectively as the Joint Force requires,' Saltzman said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/space-systems-command-chief-backs-important-work-of-space-development-agency/	2025-03-04T09:05:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/garrant-scaled-e1741094779597.jpg

Tech bros to the rescue? Reagan Institute 2025 scorecard dings Pentagon on ‘scaling’ innovation	SpaceX Transporter-5 launch, 25th May 2022, carrying 5 ICEYE radar imaging satellites. (Photo: SpaceX) WASHINGTON — As Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes dramatic changes at the Pentagon, the thinktank named for the icon of old-school conservatism urged President Donald Trump to hit the gas on high-tech weapons built by non-traditional industry players. The Ronald Reagan Institute determined its recommendations before Sec. Hegseth's order to reallocate $50 billion in funding, said the institute's director, former Pentagon official Roger Zakheim, in a breakfast briefing with reporters, but they're 'highly complementary' to what the new administration is trying to do. The Pentagon has made real progress in reaching beyond its typical contractors to 'maturing defense startups' the institute's report said, with Zakheim specifically calling out Anduril, Palantir, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX as 'trailblazers.' But, it goes on, a sclerotic defense bureaucracy and a rusting US industrial base make it hard to scale up production to the levels required for major war. Meanwhile, China not only dominates heavy-metal manufacturing — with twice America’s manufacturing capability output and 230 times the capacity for building ships — but is investing heavily in cutting-edge R&amp;D to catch up to America in AI, quantum technology and hypersonics. Those are the principal takeaways from the Reagan Institute’s latest 'report card' on what it calls the 'national security innovation base' — a clunky but carefully chosen term for something much larger and more complex than the traditional 'defense industrial base.' First issued in 2023, the annual report looks not only at Pentagon procurement and R&amp;D, but across the US economy at metrics like most-cited scientific papers and amount of 5G spectrum. This broad view catches some strong positives that traditional military metrics miss. '[The] US leads with 61 notable machine learning models,' the report says, 'followed by China with 15 and France with eight.' And venture capital investment in defense-related fields, it says, has risen from $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to a whopping $14.7 billion in Q4, 'four consecutive quarters of growth' driven almost entirely by rising interest in AI. 'There's plenty of capital in the system,' said McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant Dale Swartz, an advisor on the report. 'You increasingly have very large rounds being being raised — on both sides of the Atlantic, by the way. At this point &#8230; some of the largest VC-backed companies, both in the US and Europe, are in the defense and space arena, which is actually a pretty novel development over the past couple of years.' It’s private-sector innovators like those funded by venture capitalists that the Reagan Institute sees as driving much-needed change and preserving America’s high-tech edge. That said, not all the good guys in the report are Silicon Valley upstarts: It notes the leading role played by 'corporate venture capital' investments by long-established defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon/RTX. Even the Pentagon bureaucracy has made progress, according to this report, especially compared to the Reagan Institute’s first scorecard in 2023. There’s money moving through streamlined acquisition pipelines that were under-used in 2022, for example a 22 percent increase in Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards. There are also new channels for faster funding of non-traditional contractors, like over $4 billion provided by the Small Business Investment Company Critical Technologies Initiative (SBICCT, a joint initiative of the Small Business Administration and the Department of Defense). But, the report laments, these streamlined processes and innovative technologies remain a relatively small part of the massive Pentagon budget. (Since the Reagan study looks back at 2024, it doesn’t comment on the recent announcement that Trump’s new Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has ambitious plans to reallocate $50 billion from 'legacy' programs to new priorities). And while American tech has kept its cutting edge, mass production remains anemic. In fact, to emphasize this issue, the 2025 report adds a new category for 'Manufacturing Capacity and Industrial Base' — for which it gives the United States a 'D.' Meanwhile, the US defense industry — upstarts and established players alike — has been thrown into uncertainty by Trump's suspension of aid to Ukraine. Also Congress has yet to pass regular appropriations for the fiscal year which began Oct. 1st, forcing the Pentagon to operate on (slightly modified) funding lines from 2024. But Zakheim insisted there was light at the end of the budgetary tunnel, in the form of proposed 'reconciliation' bills that could add up to $200 billion to defense. 'Reconciliation is something that is not dependent on president's budget request,' he told reporters. 'It's Congress generating it, and doesn't require the 60-vote threshold [in the Senate]. And of course, why it's so critical.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/tech-bros-to-the-rescue-reagan-institute-2025-scorecard-dings-pentagon-on-scaling-innovation/	2025-03-04T07:36:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/SpaceX__Transporter-5.jpg
Navy contractor KEEL to open new $70M facilities for submarine fabrication	Metal Trades' Yonges Isand facility in South Carolina. (Photo courtesy of KEEL) WASHINGTON — South Carolina-based Navy contractor KEEL is planning to invest $70 million in three new facilities totaling 60,000 square feet focused on submarine and aircraft carrier component manufacturing in Charleston, the company’s chief executive told Breaking Defense. 'We’re purpose building KEEL to help solve the capacity challenges in nuclear Navy shipbuilding,' said Brian Carter. 'This is a critical step in us adding capacity to the industry that will directly impact the and improve the schedule for building both Virginia [and] Columbia [class submarines] and future' aircraft carriers. The company, which took its current shape in January 2024, was formed through a merger of two South Carolina companies — fabricator Pegasus Steel and shipyard Metal Trades — along with the Michigan-based Merrill Technologies Group. Its current work for the Navy is focused on building the Columbia-class submarine superstructures that are ultimately delivered — by truck or barge — to prime contractors General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII Newport News. KEEL also fabricates numerous components to be used on future Ford-class aircraft carriers. Carter said the expansion will include three facilities that will all start construction in 2025 or 2026 and be completed by or in 2027: a preparation and paint building; a facility for Columbia-class superstructure fabrication; and a building for employees. KEEL’s announcement comes on the heels of numerous other Navy contractors announcing expansions in the region. HII earlier this year closed on its acquisition of metal fabricator W International. Meanwhile, Leonardo DRS last week also announced a facilities expansion in South Carolina focused on manufacturing space for naval propulsion technologies. Carter said South Carolina's proximity from HII and General Dynamics Electric Boat is likely a key factor in why numerous other Navy contractors are opening up shop in the region. 'It's critical that it's an easy voyage, if you will, for both truckable and bargeable components to both Newport News and Electric Boat,' he said. 'But it's far enough away where it's a different labor market, and we can tap into some really great infrastructure here for training and developing our trades workforce. 'If you look at the growth of Charleston last 10-15, years, it is becoming more of a manufacturing hub, and there is quite a population growth that's occurred along with that,' Carter continued. 'And so it &#8230; should grow into more of its own shipbuilding ecosystem, if you will, to support these priority Navy programs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/navy-contractor-keel-to-open-new-70m-facilities-for-submarine-fabrication/	2025-03-04T05:45:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Keel-MetalTrades-157_Full-Aerial-with-Water_BB-scaled.jpg
Empty seats as Air Force limits AFA attendance, in line with ‘spirit’ of DOGE orders	Sparse attendance at AFA's Warfare Symposium following a Trump executive order. (Michael Marrow / Breaking Defense) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air &amp; Space Forces Association (AFA) Warfare Symposium held each spring is typically a packed affair, as thousands of airmen and Guardians crowd the halls of the three-day event standing shoulder-to-shoulder with industry and other attendees. But this year’s conference, held on the outskirts of Denver, Colo., at the Gaylord Hotel in Aurora, is a stark departure from past iterations. The halls are largely empty compared to years' past, as orders from above have barred many members of the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes the Air Force and Space Force, from showing up. Perhaps the clearest example of a drop in attendance came during keynote addresses from Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, where a number of audience members gathered near the stage but dozens of other chairs were noticeably empty. Most years when either top officer speak at this conference, it's a standing-room-only event. A full house for a panel at AFA's 2024 Warfare Symposium. (AFA Flickr) While a representative for AFA did not respond to Breaking Defense's request for attendance figures, the relatively empty conference rooms and hallways were accompanied by other, smaller indications of a drop in visitors. For example, it's often hard to establish cell signal due to the sheer number of other phones in the vicinity. This year, that's not a problem. The DAF recently made the decision to limit attendance 'to comply with the spirit of' President Donald Trump’s Feb. 26 executive order that implements the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk, according to a DAF spokesperson. 'Attendance has been limited to individuals with a direct role in the conference such as speakers, moderators, panel members, award winners and their supervisors, senior leaders with previously scheduled industry engagements, and local participants that attend at no cost,' the spokesperson said, adding that a virtual option is available for other registrees. AFA is the first large trade show held since the Feb. 26 order, and could raise questions about how future industry events may go. Vendors pay a hefty price to host booths in an exhibition hall that can serve as a meeting place for government customers and other officials — a primary driver of corporate attendance. If the severe drop in foot traffic here is a window into the future, it’s not clear how industry may be prompted to change its approach, particularly if fellow military services make similar moves to scale back their presence at major conferences. One industry source told Breaking Defense that they had seen roughly a 10 percent drop in meetings with senior service leadership following the Feb. 26 order. However, they said other senior leader engagements are largely continuing as planned, meaning there's still value for companies in showing up. 'We don't have this kind of interaction' except at shows like AFA, 'so it's very good from a company to really feel the pulse where the whole Air Force organization is headed and how we can support them,' the official said, who was granted anonymity to share internal planning details. 'So if that went away, yeah, that would be bad.' Another consideration, the source said, is that young airmen and Guardians who operate industry equipment may not have as many opportunities to interact and share feedback with suppliers. Whether the Pentagon's pullback from the AFA show should be taken as an omen may be too soon to tell, some industry sources said, particularly as Trump administration initiatives change by the day. 'I think the question is whether this is a temporary thing, or whether it becomes permanent,' a second industry official told Breaking Defense from the show floor.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/empty-seats-as-air-force-limits-afa-attendance-in-line-with-spirit-of-doge-orders/	2025-03-03T15:58:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250303_afa_colorado_empty_MARROW-scaled-e1741045601409.jpg
Air Force pauses deliveries of Boeing’s KC-46 tanker	A KC-46A Pegasus arrives at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., Dec. 21, 2021. (US Air Force photo) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air Force has instructed Boeing to halt deliveries of the KC-46 tanker after cracks were found on two production aircraft awaiting their handoff to the Air Force. The decision to pause deliveries was made on Feb. 27 by the service’s KC-46A program office 'due to the identification of in the ‘outboard fixed-trailing-edge support structure’' of the two planes, an Air Force spokesperson said. 'The damage does not pose a safety-of-flight concern; however, identified cracks must be repaired before returning an aircraft to service,' The spokesperson said. 'Boeing, the Program Office, and Air Mobility Command are working to quickly identify the root cause and develop both a near and long-term way ahead.' A source with knowledge of the program told Breaking Defense that the issue revolves around cracks found on the aileron hinges of two aircraft yet to be delivered to the Air Force. The service and Boeing have been aware since 2018 that the KC-46 — like its parent aircraft, the commercial 767 — could develop cracks to the aileron hinges over time, but the discovery of cracking on brand new aircraft led the service to stop deliveries. 'We are working closely with the customer to assess a potential issue on KC-46 aircraft and to mitigate any potential impact to the fleet and in-production airplanes,' a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. The War Zone was first to report news of the pause. The KC-46 has experienced numerous technical issues and schedule delays during its development and fielding, chiefly the redesign of the aircraft’s Remote Vision System — a collection of sensors that allow the boom operator to refuel a receiver airplane without visually looking out a window — which is expected to be fielded in 2026. Those issues and others have resulted in billions of dollars in cost overruns for Boeing, which is locked into a fixed-price contract that holds it responsible for paying costs above a certain threshold. Losses on the KC-46 amounted to $2 billion in 2024, Boeing stated in regulatory filings released in January. The Air Force last paused KC-46A deliveries for a two month period beginning in March 2024, which occurred so that the service could inspect production and fielded aircraft for a broken component on the aircraft’s boom. The service recorded a new 'category 1' technical deficiency for the program a couple months later after discovering that vibrations from a fuel pump that were damaging bleed air ducts, Air Force officials told reporters in July.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/air-force-pauses-deliveries-of-boeings-kc-46-tanker/	2025-03-03T12:05:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/6990563-scaled-e1741031493269.jpg
After JAG firings, a difficult truth about military legal independence	The Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, Lt. Gen. Stuart W. Risch, visited Puerto Rico on Feb. 8 as part of his ongoing efforts to spread awareness about the Judge Advocate General program. (Photo by Sgt. Marcuss Moyett) The recent decision by the secretary of defense to fire all three service Judge Advocates General (JAGs) sent shockwaves through the military legal community. Being a military lawyer myself, this decision went beyond a mere headline: It was deeply personal, as one of the JAGs who was dismissed was my boss. Like many in the JAG Corps, my initial reaction was frustration. The prevailing wisdom holds that JAGs are neutral arbiters of the law, advising commanders without political influence. Their role is ensuring legal soundness of policies, not shaping them based on partisan considerations. The idea that they were removed for being 'roadblocks' to policy seemed like an attack on that very principle. But as I sat with this, I realized that history tells a more complicated story. This event, as shocking as it is, may not be an aberration. Instead, it reveals a truth about military legal advice, a truth I was reluctant to acknowledge but now feel compelled to explore. For those of us who have spent our careers in the JAG Corps, there is a comforting belief that our role is fundamentally different from that of civilian political appointees. We do not serve at the pleasure of the president like the attorney general, and our function is often described as purely legal, not political. But if that were entirely true, why has history repeatedly placed military lawyers at the center of political battles? Take, for example, the John Yoo torture memos from the early 2000s. Yoo, a lawyer in the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), authored memos that provided legal justification for enhanced interrogation techniques, a policy deeply intertwined with the Bush administration’s political objectives. When Congress sought clarity on these policies, they did not call military commanders to testify. They called upon the expertise of lawyers from both the civilian and military sectors. Yoo and other administration-aligned lawyers provided testimony to Congress defending the policy decisions as legally justified. JAG officers, including the Judge Advocates General at the time, testified as well, voicing legal concerns about interrogation policies. The military testimony stood in stark contrast to the administration’s position, and it contributed to the eventual rollback of some policies. This historical example illustrates a difficult reality: Legal advice in government is never purely neutral. It is always part of the policy process. JAGs, whether we want to admit it or not, play a role in shaping and legitimizing military policies. Our legal opinions do not just exist in a vacuum; they influence what the Department of Defense is able to do, and as a result, they inherently intersect with politics. Unlike the attorney general, who is publicly nominated, confirmed by the Senate, and explicitly recognized as a political appointee, the selection of the Judge Advocates General is a closed process that takes place within the JAG Corps itself. This insularity has long been seen as a safeguard against political pressure, ensuring that military legal advice remains independent. But it also means that when legal interpretations do not align with an administration’s policy goals, there is no mechanism for resolving that conflict — except for the kind of sweeping firings we just witnessed. The secretary’s decision, whether intentional or not, highlights an uncomfortable pair of questions: If JAGs function in a manner similar to civilian legal advisors who help implement executive policy, should their selection process be more transparent? And if we acknowledge that military legal advice plays a role in legitimizing or obstructing policy, can we still assume that JAG selection should be insulated from the administration? None of this is to say that the secretary’s decision was the right approach. Blanket firings based on perceived policy misalignment, rather than demonstrated misconduct or incompetence, create serious risks. First, such a move weakens confidence in military legal integrity. If JAGs can be dismissed purely because they provide legal interpretations that do not align with policy objectives, future legal advisors may feel pressured to offer guidance that is politically expedient rather than legally sound. It could also politicize military legal advice even further. If the standard for removal becomes disagreement with an administration’s preferred policy direction, future JAG appointments may shift toward those who are perceived as more politically agreeable rather than legally rigorous. And finally, it sets a precedent for instability. The role of JAGs should not be about political loyalty. While legal interpretation is an inherently political process, there must be room for good faith legal disagreement without fear of dismissal. This moment calls for a serious discussion about the role of JAGs in military policy and whether the selection process should be reformed to better balance legal independence with accountability. In summation, the three key questions to consider are: These are not easy questions, and there are no simple answers. But ignoring them will not make the problem go away. The secretary’s decision may have been controversial, but it has forced us to confront a reality we can no longer dismiss: Military legal advice is not separate from politics, and our system does not fully account for that truth. One potential solution, which would require Congress to get involved, would be to adjust the timeline of the JAG selection process to align with a new presidential administration. A selection process that begins after election confirmation and ends sometime within the first 100 days of the new presidential term would provide two layers of protection: If the process were to remain untouched by political influence, the timing would make it appear it was underwritten by the administration protecting the JAG Corps, and on the other hand, if political influence is inserted into the process there is time to adjust and make it an acceptable selection within the normal administration confirmation time. As a military lawyer, I want to believe that our role remains one of principled legal guidance, unaffected by political shifts. But history suggests otherwise. If we do not grapple with this challenge now, we risk future administrations making similar moves, potentially with even more direct political motivations. The JAG Corps must decide whether to engage in this debate proactively or risk being reshaped by it. MAJ Trent Kubasiak is a judge advocate with Eighth Army in the Republic of Korea.

How to stop American AI from becoming the next Myspace	Image courtesy of RAFT. Recently, Vice President JD Vance delivered some hard truths to our European friends at the Paris Artificial Intelligence Summit. In short, he broke down the inevitable results of excessively regulating AI: it would hurt small, innovative startups the most; it would discourage American R&amp;D investments; and, last but certainly not least, it will drive nations around the world into the arms of the Chinese Communist Party. The Vice President’s message should be well received following last month’s DeepSeek panic. The Chinese company’s apparent breakthrough sent markets into a frenzy, and President Trump said it 'should be a wake-up call' for American tech companies. I can’t imagine many of America’s innovators slept through this alarm – we have ground to make up. DeepSeek sparked such a reaction largely because it’s performed so well in tests compared with rival American AI models like OpenAI, DeepMind or Llama. Remember when Facebook first came onto the scene and destroyed Myspace? Or when Apple wiped the floor with Motorola and Nokia? It’s our job to ensure that American AI models don’t become the next Myspace, and that requires more innovation and less regulation – our national security, as well as the national security of our friends and allies around the world, depends on it. First, just as the vice president did with our allies in Paris, we need to look ourselves in the mirror and accept some hard truths. There’s no denying that we’re at an institutional disadvantage to the CCP when it comes to developing these new technologies. I’m not referring to the fact that China has roughly nine times as many engineers as the U.S., or that they have as many as 15 times more science and technology graduates. I’m referring to the fact that American tech companies rightly abide by the principles of responsible AI – the consideration of societal impact, legal standards, and ethical values. The Chinese Communist Party simply does not share these concerns. That’s why the risk of losing this race is so high – it would mean nations around the world adopting and deploying Chinese AI models that can be used for malign purposes. We know that DeepSeek gathers data on its users – very similar to the way TikTok collects data – and censors responses to comply with the CCP’s speech controls. Vice President Vance was right to warn our allies that 'partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in, and seize your information infrastructure.' America’s responsible, ethical AI technology standards are the very reason our partners and allies are right to follow U.S. leadership in this space. We need to be responsible, but we also need to recognize that unnecessary regulation will slow innovation and make it harder for U.S. companies to compete with China. If the U.S. and our allies can accept this reality – that innovation and responsibility are not mutually exclusive – and then translate it into policy that encourages competition, then we’ll have appropriately responded to China’s wake-up call. If you ask DeepSeek what happened in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, it’ll respond, 'I am sorry, I cannot answer that question.' We need to ask ourselves, 'How are we going to outpace China and ensure U.S. leadership in AI?' Fortunately, and unlike DeepSeek, we have an answer: American competition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/how-to-stop-american-ai-from-becoming-the-next-myspace/	2025-03-03T11:12:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-28-at-10.06.11 AM.png
Poland signs $300M lease for Apache attack helicopters	The AH-64D leasing ceremony occurred at Latkowo, home of the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade. (Lance Cpl. Wojciech Król/CO MON) WARSAW — Poland has formally signed a $300 million leasing agreement for eight AH-64D Apache attack helicopters, a bridge to when the Polish Land Forces will receive their full order of Apaches. The deal was signed Feb. 27 by Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s deputy prime minister and minister of national defense, at Latkowo, home of the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade. The agreement covers not only the leasing of the rotorcraft themselves, but support for training and operations. The leasing decision was made 'so that our soldiers can gain skills and be fully prepared for the arrival' of the future Apaches, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'We are spending $300 million on it, so that our pilots, ground support personnel can get to know and learn all the skills, can take control of this equipment.' Poland in August signed its Letter of Acceptance on a $10 billion order of 96 Boeing-made AH-64Es, procured through a Foreign Military Sale case. Under that agreement, Poland will become the second largest Apache operator in the world, behind only the US Army. Deliveries are expected to run between 2028 and 2032, with 15 helicopters to be delivered in that first year. Once the Apaches are fully procured, they will be subordinated to the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade (1 BLWL), a tactical unit consisting of the 49th Air Base in Pruszcz Gdański, the 56th Air Base in Inowrocław and the Central Group of Tactical Air Area Control Teams. The AH-64s will be based at Inowrocław, Malbork and Świdnik. But the Polish government did not want to wait that long to be able to begin training and operations. Hence, the decision to go for the leasing agreement. 'Because of to this [leasing], we will be ready to accept these helicopters faster,' Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'We will have trained crews who will be able to operate this equipment. […] In addition, spare parts, a logistics package, simulators, armament, i.e. all the elements that are needed for this agreement to be fully valuable' will be met, he said. Last year the first Polish airmen completed the AH-64E Aviation Qualification Course and Instructor Pilot course as well as the AH-64E helicopter repairer and the American Language Course-General English at Fort Novosel in Alabama. Deputy Minister of National Defense Paweł Bejda, who was also at the signing, emphasized the domestic economic benefit of the deal, thanks to commercial offsets for Boeing that were required by the government. Thanks to those offsets, 'the Military Aviation Plant No. 1 in Łódź and Dęblin will be able to service both the composite structures of helicopters and their [T-700-701D, CT7-2E1 and CT7-8E] engines. Importantly, the same engines are also used in Leonardo [AW101 and AW149] and Black Hawk helicopters,' Bejda said. 'At the same time, the Military University of Technology will be able to train students, technicians and engineers for service and repair of composite components and engines. 'In this way, we are fulfilling the commitment that at least 50 percent of [any] expenditure on arms will remain in Polish defense companies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/poland-signs-300m-lease-for-apache-attack-helicopters/	2025-03-03T11:09:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Poland-AH-64D-leasing-1bd5cc49-b7a9-49de-a2bf-eab6813e891a.jpg
Amid US rift with Ukraine, UK proposes peace plan with ‘coalition of the willing’ boots on the ground	A UK Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon conducts a NATO air policing mission (UK MoD) BELFAST — In the event of a peace agreement for the conflict in Ukraine, the UK has vowed to establish a European 'coalition of the willing' to protect Kyiv from Moscow, by deploying 'boots on the ground, and planes in the air.' British Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced the move on Sunday during a meeting of 18 European leaders in London, set against a disastrous breakdown in relations between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a recent heated argument at the White House. The proposed coalition is the key point at the heart of a four point plan launched by the UK, in collaboration with France, Ukraine and others. The other three points are to: 'Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can’t mean we sit back,' Starmer said of the coalition pledge — a sign that European nations are split over the idea as it could potentially draw them into armed conflict with Russia. 'Instead, those willing will intensify planning now — with real urgency,' explained Starmer. 'The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground, and planes in the air. Together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting.' RELATED: Estonia &#8216;seriously' discussing sending troops to &#8216;rear' jobs in Ukraine, official says During questions with lawmakers today however, Starmer said that the government is 'nowhere near' the phase of holding a parliamentary vote on British troops deploying to Ukraine. Also, success of the coalition is dependent on 'strong US backing,' according to Starmer's remarks Sunday, despite a clear gulf between the Trump administration and similar UK calls for Washington to act as a security guarantor overseeing a peace settlement. Trump has excluded Europe and Ukraine from peace negotiations, initially demanded Kyiv sign over a $500 billion share of raw earth minerals in return for continued US military aid and balked at deploying US forces to support a peace deal. 'We have agreed that the UK, France and others will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting,' said Starmer. 'Then we’ll discuss that plan with the United States and take it forward together. The purpose of today’s meeting was to unite our partners around this effort to strengthen Ukraine and to support a just and enduring peace for the good of all of us.' He ruled out accepting any 'weak deal,' but it remains to be seen how outstanding differences between Europe and the US over Ukraine will be reconciled. Russia has previously pushed back on UK- and French-backed plans for a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Meanwhile, London also announced on Sunday that it had approved a £1.6 billion ($2 billion) deal for Ukraine to acquire over 5,000 Thales made lightweight-multirole missiles (LMM). The contract is funded by a British export finance loan, and the French manufacturer's UK arm will produce the air defense weapons from Belfast, Northern Ireland. As noted by London, it marks the largest contract signed by the UK MoD and Thales in Belfast to date and builds off a similar LMM contract signed last year for 650 missiles. To support the latest contract, a Ukrainian industry partner will manufacture launchers and command and control vehicles for the 29-pound weapon, which is designed to target armored patrol carriers, inshore attack craft and drones, according to Thales. 'This large deal and its timing underline the gap between the UK and Washington DC on support for Ukraine,' said Trevor Taylor, director of the Defence, Industries and Society Programme at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), in a statement to media. 'It also stresses the value of the UK’s industrial capabilities as a critical enabler of UK foreign and security policy. The production arrangements for the launchers and command and control vehicles for Ukraine mark a deepening of the cooperation of Western European firms with Ukrainian industry,' he said. The UK's LMM contract comes on the heels of Starmer committing to increase national defense spending to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-us-rift-with-ukraine-uk-proposes-peace-plan-with-coalition-of-the-willing-boots-on-the-ground/	2025-03-03T09:54:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Eurofighter-Typhoon-e1732642769504.jpg
How Metrea hopes to grow the private air refueling market	Metrea refueled German Typhoons during the Pacific Skies exercise in 2024. (Metrea) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Far away from home and flying high above the seas for an event called 'Pacific Skies' last year, a small group of three German Eurofighters made several pitstops behind KC-135 Stratotankers, helping the jet fighter notch its longest-ever flight of roughly 10 and a half hours. It was a refueling mission like any other, except for one detail: Stratotankers supporting the flight were privately operated by the aerospace company Metrea, underscoring the growing role that commercial air refueling services can play to meet soaring demand among militaries for tanking. 'Pacific Skies was our largest and most complex deployment ever,' the German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, wrote in response to questions from Breaking Defense. Through the event, the service says it was able to 'demonstrate that our Luftwaffe is able to deploy around the world.' Founded in 2016, the American-based Metrea has quickly risen as an aerospace player, with three business groups that span air and space, electromagnetic and cyber, and digital and synthetics. Besides air refueling, Metrea’s air and space division offers other services such as supporting contractor-operated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions in far-flung locations like West Africa. Air refueling is a growing focus for Metrea, particularly after the company agreed last year to buy a fleet of 14 KC-135s set to be retired by the French Air and Space Forces, growing the firm’s tanker inventory to a total of 18 on top of four previously acquired KC-135s from the Singaporean government. (Five planes in Metrea’s fleet of 18 are operational now and one is undergoing heavy maintenance, with additional tankers entering service 'based on customer demand,' the company said). According to Metrea, the French deal means the privately-held business now boasts the world’s fifth-largest refueling fleet, behind four countries. 'As many [KC-135s] as we can get in service in ‘25, we're going to put them to work,' Jon 'Ty' Thomas, the head of the company’s air and space group and a retired Air Force lieutenant general, said in an interview with Breaking Defense. Globally, air forces’ 'demand for air refueling is growing,' Thomas said, whether through buying more aircraft or running more sorties for an existing fleet. And having commercial tankers available could help supplement military planes thirsty for gas, Tim Walton, an air refueling expert at the Hudson Institute, said in an interview. 'Commercial aerial refueling tankers could support training, testing and evaluation and coordinate fighter movements in peacetime, which could help meet the high demand for aerial refueling services across the globe,' Walton said. While a range of factors from budget constraints to mission needs will ultimately shape future demand for private air refueling, Walton noted that 'ideally, it will increase if the government can take new approaches to aggregate different demands for training, deployment of aircraft and foreign military or direct commercial sales in support of foreign aircraft.' Metrea’s highest-profile international refueling to date with the Luftwaffe for the Pacific Skies event started out at the 2023 Royal International Air Tattoo in the United Kingdom. Metrea brought along its own KC-135 fresh out of heavy maintenance, catching the eye of several potential customers, including the Germans. Officials kept Metrea in mind, and ahead of Pacific Skies, they reached out to see 'if support for our deployment would be possible,' the Luftwaffe said. While the service operates refueling assets like the Airbus A330 MRTT and A400M, as well as the Lockheed Martin KC-130 — with the A330 providing a 'majority' of refueling missions for the deployment — like many nations, German armed forces are 'always slightly short when it comes to bigger deployments or exercises,' the service said. Pacific Skies is essentially a catch-all term to describe the overarching deployment of German forces to the region for a series of exercises. For the record-setting Eurofighter flight, the jets were ferried from one exercise in Japan called Nippon Skies to Hawaii for the biennial Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, exercise. Ahead of the journey, Metrea staged one of its KC-135s at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo and another at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, paving the way to support the trans-Pacific flight to Hawaii, according to Rory Cattelan, a former KC-135 instructor pilot who helped plan the event for the company. After rendezvousing with the Germans outside Tokyo, 'we dragged them [the Eurofighters] pretty much around the Pacific Rim, staying within 600 miles of a suitable alternate the whole time,' Cattelan said. A few hours later, the first aircraft passed the last of its gas and peeled off for Wake Island, dropping into a 'lovely thunderstorm,' while the aircraft from Guam carried the German jets the remaining way to Hawaii. Und wer wissen will, wie das mit dem Tanken in der Luft an einer KC135 der Firma @MetreaAero ist, der Boss zeigt es höchst persönlich in diesem Video.Dank an Metrea für die Unterstützung bei unserem #Weltrekordflug. Ohne Euch wäre das nicht möglich gewesen. #Pacificskies24 pic.twitter.com/xMIbZARRm4 &mdash; Team Luftwaffe (@Team_Luftwaffe) July 26, 2024 'We were just nervous this wasn't going to happen because it was really tight on gas as far as how much they needed and what we could support, and definitely didn't want them to fail their world record flight,' Cattelan said. 'In the end, it went off pretty good.' Metrea also helped the Luftwaffe get back to Europe, the service said, providing gas between Hawaii and Guam, Guam and Malaysia, then Malaysia to the UAE. In total, Metrea says it offloaded roughly 475,000 pounds of fuel over the course of 25 sorties spanning 160 flight hours. 'I think what we proved as a company is the complexity of the mission set that we're able to handle as a commercial entity,' said Joe Parker, a career boom operator and Metrea employee who helped execute the event. 'So I think what we proved as a company could be taken as a lesson learned, but really it was more, ‘We got this,’ and we kind of put our best foot forward in that regard.' From the Luftwaffe’s end, the experience of refueling with a commercial air refueling operator is 'pretty similar' to a traditional military run, particularly since air refueling is standardized in NATO. The service was even able to hire Metrea by tapping into the company’s active contract with the US Navy, easing some of the 'bureaucratic workload.' And what did the Luftwaffe learn from the endeavor? 'That commercial AAR [air-to-air refueling] is also a valid option for future deployments,' the service said. Describing Metrea’s business model of providing 'effects-as-a-service,' Thomas explained the company helps fill gaps that occur as part of militaries’ 'daily competition,' or day-to-day activities in lower-intensity scenarios. Much of the Air Force’s tanker force structure lies in the Guard and Reserve, whose assets and personnel are not always available for daily refueling taskings. Similar problems affect other militaries as well, Thomas said, noting that’s where Metrea comes in. 'It's not a choice of like, ‘Oh well, I could do that, or I could have a USAF tanker,' he said. 'It's, ‘I can have a commercial tanker, or I can have nothing. And so that's how we've grown the market.' Many of Metrea’s approximately 1,000 employees are either former military or a member of the Guard or Reserve. That depth of experience helps smooth operations for Metrea when serving military customers, but also provides a natural limit on what the company could provide under an all-out-war scenario. 'Probably a good fraction of our crews aren't wearing the Metrea blue flight suit' in that event, Thomas said. 'They're wearing the United States of America and US Air Force green flight suit, because they’re Guardsmen or Reservists and they've been mobilized,' he added. 'So our capacity is going to be constrained by the dynamics of that day.' 'We're not going to be able to have the luxury or be willing to take the risk of, on America's worst day, 20 of those tankers are coming out of a commercial company,' he added. 'That's not our place.' Walton, too, expressed skepticism that commercial refueling could shape what’s ultimately required by US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), which tasks air refueling missions and sets requirements for the fleet. 'Although it’s possible that private aerial refueling could exert downward pressure on the size of the government aerial refueling fleet, I think it’s unlikely, given that the US Transportation Command’s mobility requirements study has established a pretty high floor for the number of tankers required for the fleet in potential contingencies.' The minimum air refueling fleet number is mandated by Congress and is currently set at 466 tankers. At the direction of Congress, TRANSCOM has also studied the issue of incorporating more commercial tanking services. The command’s analysis previously found that the current air refueling fleet is sufficient to support global operations, but that 'the Air Force has and continues to explore the potential use of commercial tankers for training and other non-combat missions to help ease the pressure on the organic tanker fleet,' according to a statement from TRANSCOM. A day will come, however, when Metrea’s fleet of Eisenhower-era KC-135s will be tough to operate, particularly as the plane becomes increasingly difficult to maintain due to diminishing sources for parts as the Air Force retires the fleet. At that point, the firm may have to pivot, Thomas acknowledged. 'The [KC-]135 ecosystem does exist. And actually, let's be honest, the only way that it works for us is that there's a larger ecosystem in which we operate,' he said. 'If there's a day when the USAF isn't operating KC-135s in quantity, we'll have a hard choice to make as to what we're going to do,' he continued. 'But that day is like at least two decades away.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/how-metrea-hopes-to-grow-the-private-air-refueling-market/	2025-03-03T07:48:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250303_metrea_refueling_METREA_jpeg.jpg
The F-22 is having a modernization moment	A 1st Fighter Wing's F-22 Raptor from Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va. pulls into position to accept fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker with the 756th Air Refueling Squadron, Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, Md. off the east coast. It was 2 a.m. when the blast of the Klaxon rattled the halls of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, outside Anchorage, Alaska. Unidentified aircraft had approached U.S. airspace over the North Pole, and U.S. Air Force pilot John 'Schlem' Rogers – unsure whether it was real or a drill – had minutes to suit up, jump in his F-22 Raptor and investigate. Rogers can’t divulge exactly what happened that night years ago, but he did say the F-22’s low observability, high maneuverability and superior situational awareness gave him the advantage. 'Gear matters, engineering matters, quality matters,' said Rogers, director of business development in Avionics for Collins Aerospace, an RTX business. 'Knowing that the systems onboard that F-22 were going to work allowed me to take the aircraft over the most extreme parts of our planet to keep our airspace safe.' Rogers’ story shows the power of the F-22 Raptor. At times overlooked, this combat-proven, fifth-generation fighter jet is taking on new importance as the U.S. Air Force considers enhancements that could keep it ready and relevant for years to come. A Raptor renaissance Why the renewed interest? In short, the U.S. Air Force needs to supplement its F-35 fleet while plans for a new generation of fighter jet take shape. And the F-22’s capabilities – many of which come by way of RTX products and services – can meet that need. 'The Air Force and government see the F-22 as its primary stealth fighter,' said Jake Ullrich, senior program director for Advanced Products and Solutions at Raytheon, an RTX business. 'All systems on the F-22 are meant to complement each other – to maximize both the intel coming in and the actions being taken.' And better data coming in means pilots will need more sophisticated ways to see, process and act on that information. It’s why teams across RTX continue to advance cockpit technologies for the F-22 to help pilots stay ahead of the threat when a mission is changing rapidly and unfolding across several domains. Here’s a look at some of the RTX advancements that are helping the F-22 stay future-ready. The definition of air dominance Achieving air dominance means controlling the skies against enemy threats. In this role, the F-22 is often in a support position, carrying the right munitions to meet the needs of the particular mission. One of the most powerful weapons onboard is the Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. John 'Clyde' Thayer is a 22-year U.S. Air Force veteran and former F-15C pilot who now serves as director of Air Dominance Requirements &amp; Capabilities for Raytheon. He explained why the weapons delivery capability of the F-22, along with its ability to fly fast and high, has helped earn the AMRAAM missile a reputation as the premier air dominance weapon around the world for nearly 30 years. 'When the pilot fires a missile, it is a very quick timeline for the doors to open, the missile to eject from the aircraft and the rocket motor to fire,' he said. 'At that point, the aircraft can immediately maneuver as needed to defend itself – without being detected.' The AMRAAM missile, equipped with its own guidance system, takes over from there. Thayer said recent upgrades, as part of the U.S. Air Force’s F3R (Form, Fit, Function Refresh), will bring even more processing power to the air-to-air AMRAAM guidance sections. This, in turn, will enable software improvements to take performance even higher. In particular, it will allow operators to extend the missile’s time of flight. 'We know the missile flies a lot farther than it was originally designed to,' Thayer added. 'The F3R improvements – perfectly fitted to the F-22 platform – will help us get the most out of the AMRAAM missile in the air dominance role.' The Raytheon team is ramping up production to 1,200 AMRAAM missiles a year, which will ensure the F-22 stays mission-ready. In air-to-air missions, the F-22 carries: Unlocking engine potential 'The F-22, when it starts up, has been described as a big muscle car,' said former F-22 pilot Rogers. 'It’s loud, it vibrates. As it gets into the air, it turns into a bit of a Ferrari. It’s smoother, it kind of growls. It has its own personality.' A lot of that personality comes from the two Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engines that power the F-22, each packing 35,000 pounds of thrust. Caroline Cooper, who oversees the F119 program at Pratt &amp; Whitney, an RTX business, said the engine’s unique thrust-vectoring capability, and its capacity to fly at supersonic speeds without turning on the afterburners, have contributed to the F-22’s superior maneuverability. The F119 is the original fifth-generation fighter jet engine, and the direct predecessor of the P&amp;W F135, which powers the F-35 – another fifth-generation fighter. Cooper credits data gathered over Pratt’s long history supporting these fifth-gen platforms for driving the engine control software update that’s expected to unlock more performance potential for the F-22. The fleet software update is scheduled to begin in 2025. 'A more modern F-22 will need additional mission capacity,' said Cooper. 'That's going to require more thrust in certain parts of the design envelope, and this software update provides it.' Years of F-22 operation have also given Cooper’s team an advantage in predicting maintenance for engine parts: They can use actual, full-flight data to pinpoint when it's time for replacements. 'When we run this data through our advanced engineering algorithms, it gives us insight we can then use to extend the life of our parts,' she said. 'This means more time on wing and more cost savings for our customers.' Designed to win And more time on wing for customers translates to more mission time. This will be increasingly important, as the F-22 readies for tomorrow’s fight. Rogers, recalling his time in the cockpit, has every confidence the aircraft is up for the challenge. 'The F-22 was not designed to win 51-49,' he added. 'It was designed to win 100 to zero.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/the-f-22-is-having-a-modernization-moment/	2025-03-03T05:24:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AFA-AWS-Air-Warfare-lead-image_600x300.jpg
Firings sap NOAA office responsible for licensing remote sensing satellite firms	Planet satellite imagery shows widespread destruction in central Kahramanmaras, Turkey following the devastating 2023 earthquake. (Image courtesy of Planet Labs PBC.) WASHINGTON — Mass firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have resulted in what is essentially a shut down of the unit responsible for licensing US remote sensing satellites, according to multiple sources, with license holders receiving emails notifying them all correspondence would now be handled by NOAA's Office of General Counsel. 'This is a temporary arrangement to address continuity of operations as no senior personnel remain in the office due to reductions in force,' reads a copy of the email from the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA) division seen by Breaking Defense. 'CRSRA is unable to state when this arrangement might end.' CRSRA is the division within NOAA's Office of Space Commerce responsible for regulating space-based commercial remote sensing, including work involving companies such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky that provide imagery to the National Reconnaissance Office for use by the Defense Department for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. NOAA, in turn, is under the Department of Commerce. 'The email is correct, the Office of General Counsel will be supporting the continuity of license applications and processing for companies involved in the process,' a spokesperson for the Office of Space Commerce told Breaking Defense in an email. While it is too soon to judge the impact of the situation, if extenuated the likely outcome would be a slow down in the approval of new licenses for aspiring satellite imagery firms and of any pending license modification requests from current operators. The Trump administration began firings Thursday at NOAA, with some 800 personnel out of a total staff of some 13,000 terminated, the New York Times reported today. Among those was the head of CRSRA Sarah Brothers, sources who deal with CRSRA told Breaking Defense. 'Per our long-standing practice, we do not discuss internal personnel and management matters. NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation’s environmental and economic resilience,' the Office of Space Commerce spokesperson said. NOAA operates US weather satellites also used by the military, and has been central to research on climate change. In addition, the Office of Space Commerce sent out a notice today that it has cancelled a planned March 5 meeting of the NOAA Advisory Committee on Excellence in Space (ACES). The industry group has been active in helping the Office of Space Commerce on a number of key issues, including how to best provide oversight and management of on-orbit activities that fall between the cracks of current federal regulatory regimes. The notice, also reviewed by Breaking Defense, does not indicate whether the planned meeting would be rescheduled. However, the space-focused news outlet Payload today reported that ACES has been swept up in the cull of advisory committees mandated in a Feb. 19 Trump administration executive order seeking to slash the federal bureaucracy. Further, the head of the Office of Space Commerce's program to create a civil space traffic management regime designed to take the burden of warning non-military satellite operators of potential on-orbit crashes off DoD's shoulders, Dmitry Poisik, also has been fired, the same sources told Breaking Defense. Poisik was hired in July 2024 as the first director of the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS) program, and thus fell under the Office of Personnel Management's order for termination of all federal agency 'probationary' employees. In most federal agencies, personnel who have yet to complete one full year in their job are given 'probationary' status. Nonetheless, work under the TraCCS program appears to be continuing, with the Office of Space Commerce today issuing a call for industry comment on its proposal for a new 'pathfinder' project. 'The pathfinder would investigate commercially available capabilities for the identification and cataloging of space objects immediately after their launch and deployment,' the notice explains.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/firings-sap-noaa-office-responsible-for-licensing-remote-sensing-satellite-firms/	2025-02-28T13:23:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Turkey-Earthquake-Damage-e1711045037612.jpg
The US Air Force lacks imagination, and that’s a dangerous thing	A US Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon assigned to the 480th Fighter Squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany (left), flies alongside a German air force Eurofighter Typhoon assigned to the 74th Tactical Air Wing over Germany, Feb. 16, 2023. (US Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Allison Payne) Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin has called his service to action, warning it faces a 'time of consequence' when 'the decisions we make, the actions we take' will determine if the Air Force is ready for the future fight. Deciding today what weapons, concepts and capabilities Airmen will need 10 or 20 years from now is no easy task, especially with war’s character changing rapidly. Despite what some would say, the fundamental problem is not the size of the service’s budget, but a culture that is reluctant to embrace the risks that come with innovation. This leaves the service vulnerable to technological and doctrinal surprise — something we’ve seen before, from the shock of Pearl Harbor to the aerial attacks on September 11. To meet the moment, the Air Force will need to hedge against a failure of imagination. And that means knowingly opening the service up to risk in several areas — especially around programs being allowed to fail and dollars sometimes being burned on new ideas. The Air Force, like any organization that has enjoyed enormous success, prefers to hold fast to what worked in the past, pursuing a procurement strategy that revolves around a small number of advanced, expensive platforms with long development cycles. But adding new technology to try to sustain this old way of fighting is unimaginative. The Air Force’s reluctance to embrace the near-term risks that come with innovation creates strategic risks. With Russia adapting to the battlefield in Ukraine, Iran pursuing a cost-imbalance strategy, and China pursuing the same or similar technologies as the United States, adversaries need only employ a little imagination to take the Air Force by surprise. The Air Force’s caution is understandable: If you are building something designed to last for many decades, you better get it right. Consider the venerable B-52 bomber, a platform still flying after more than 60 years, or the F-16, which remains a workhorse as it approaches its sixth decade in service. This hardware-centered mindset emphasizes perfecting a platform design before it ever reaches full production, much less the warfighter — a process that works well when change is slow and incremental — like moving from 4th to 5th generation fighters. In an age of rapid technological leaps, however, this process rewards the status quo and stifles real innovation. New capabilities or operational concepts are too easily rejected as unproven, and unprovable, ways of fighting. The Air Force — like the other services — is too often more concerned with near-term risks to budget and procurement programs than long-term strategic and operational upsides. If the United States and China ever got into a shooting war, Chinese military planners would expect the US Air Force to follow a familiar script, seeking to generate overwhelming precision effects from a smaller number of traditional fighters and bombers, supported by reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers. After studying US military operations extensively for the last thirty years, China has honed its anti-access/area-denial playbook to counter it. Predictability is a vulnerability. And the solution lies in spreading risk. Instead of building a small number of super-expensive platforms made by a few large defense firms, the US Air Force should diversify its approach, developing a wider variety of systems in smaller numbers, with the flexibility to scale up when needed, add technology as available, and discontinue procurement of certain platforms when technology negates their benefits or capabilities. The service should also adjust and refine requirements for different mission needs and different adversary strategies. The Air Force currently upgrades platforms in blocks, periodically and incrementally adding new technology and capabilities while keeping the basic platform the same. While this approach is supposed to reduce training and sustainment costs, it prevents revolutionary change while driving up costs of sustaining an aging force. To implement this hedge strategy, the US Air Force needs to rethink its approach to procurement before it’s too late. First and foremost, adopt a shorter and less bureaucratic requirements process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation, which sets the policies and procedures governing acquisition with a focus on protecting taxpayer dollars, applies whether procurement is of a multi-million-dollar system built to last decades, or an expendable platform expected to become quickly obsolete. The upshot is that the marginal costs per unit of compliance is very high for low number, low-cost platforms, effectively discouraging innovation. The Air Force should therefore work with Congress to expand rapid and flexible acquisition authorities for lower-cost platforms, which would allow the Air Force to pursue a wider range of systems, and, after testing and evaluating them, decide whether to field them or change course. Second, the Air Force should work with Congress to allow more budget flexibility for emerging concepts and capabilities. The current process attempts to predict the future several years in advance, including what companies will be producing, what adversaries will do, and what capabilities will be available. Services have to program and plan their budgets for the Program Objective Memorandum more than two years before funds would become available, assuming the budget is approved and passed. This means a new company with an emerging capability has to wait over three years after developing it and convincing the Air Force of its value before potentially profiting. This is an eternity for new entrants, but something larger and more established companies can price into their contracts. Third, the Air Force should promote a development and procurement culture for most capabilities which encourages risk-taking over risk avoidance, signaling the value it places on innovation through promotions and budget priorities. Incentives today reward caution and punish creativity. The object is to preserve what has won fights in the past. But no one wins when high-priced legacy systems with dubious long-term advantages continue to win out over new capabilities that deliver the same or better effects at lower cost. Finally, the defense industry itself needs to change. Washington should cultivate an environment where many companies contribute to the development of airpower — not just a handful of defense giants who have an inside track because they know the rules of the game and lobby to keep those rules in place. A broader, more innovative defense market will better prepare the Air Force to create, rather than react to, the next wave of aerial surprises. A more agile, less predictable US Air Force, particularly one built around massive numbers of mobile, dispersed and lower-cost sensing, decoy, and weaponized drones (of varying capability), would simultaneously complicate both Russian and Chinese military planning. These platforms would seem similar but do different things, making it hard for the People’s Liberation Army to know which blips on the radar screen are the ones that can sink ships, which are the ones that are sensing the ships, and which are the ones — like decoys — just there for the confusion. Such surprise threatens to disrupt Chinese military plans and unbalance the PLA, giving the United States the initiative. Such diversity would also complicate Moscow’s calculus in rebuilding its military and give the United States and its NATO allies more options for deterring or defending against Russian aggression. The US Air Force has gotten comfortable with its predictability. That has to change if it is to succeed in future conflicts. Col. Maximilian K.

Meink, deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space, answers questions during a space budget briefing March 5, 2014, at the Pentagon. (U.S. Air Force photo/Scott M. Ash) WASHINGTON—Two Democratic senators are raising alarms about Troy Meink, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Air Force, following reports that Elon Musk recommended Meink for the job after he pushed a lucrative satellite contract towards Musk’s SpaceX. In a Feb. 27 letter to Meink, Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asked Meink to disclose information about his relationship to Musk and whether Meink, in his role of principal deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office, arranged a multibillion-dollar contract solicitation to favor SpaceX above other companies competing for the award, as reported by Reuters earlier this month. 'These reports raise concerns about your ability, if confirmed as Secretary, to treat contractors fairly and prioritize the Air Force’s mission over Elon Musk’s business interests,' wrote Duckworth and Warren, who as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee will have a role in evaluating Meink’s fitness for the Air Force secretary job. Citing seven people familiar with the contract, Reuters reported that the NRO inspector general began an investigation into Meink's role in a classified contract awarded to SpaceX in 2021 after noting changes to the program's requirements. It is unclear whether the probe is still ongoing. Duckworth and Warren said the Reuters report contained 'incredibly serious allegations of misconduct and favoritism,' noting that as Air Force secretary, Meink would be involved in key contracting decisions that involve Musk and SpaceX directly, as well as determining whether the service will move forward with a crewed sixth-generation fighter, which Musk has criticized. The senators requested answers by March 6 to a list of questions probing Meink’s dealings with Musk and SpaceX ahead of his nomination, whether Meink has ever been under investigation for his role in contracting decisions, and allegations from the Reuters report, including if he steered contracts toward SpaceX and threatened to withhold future contracts from L3Harris if it filed a protest. Warren and Duckworth's letter is the first sign of turbulence for Meink's nomination, which initially appeared set to cruise through the confirmation process before the publication of the Reuters report. Unlike Trump’s other service secretary picks, who have been relatively unknown in the national security realm, Meink is a familiar presence in the defense world, having served as deputy under secretary of the Air Force for space in the Obama administration before being tapped for the NRO job in 2020. Meink met with SASC Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., last week. Wicker's statement on the engagement makes no note of the allegations against Meink, with the senator saying that Meink 'understands that air and space power are essential to America’s military rebuild under President Trump.' SASC has not yet set a date for Meink’s confirmation hearing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/warren-duckworth-probe-air-force-secretary-nominee-on-dealings-with-elon-musk/	2025-02-28T08:19:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Meink-e1737049777778.jpg
Trump taps former Navy diver Hung Cao for service’s No. 2 civilian job	Then-US Senate candidate Hung Cao speaks during a campaign rally on November 2, 2024. Cao has been tapped to be the Navy's number two civilian by President Donald Trump. (Photo by ALLISON JOYCE/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced late Thursday night that he would nominate Hung Cao, a former Navy diver and immigrant from Vietnam, to be the next under secretary of the Navy. 'I am pleased to announce that Hung Cao will be our next United States Under Secretary of the Navy,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Hung is the embodiment of the American Dream. As a refugee to our Great Nation, Hung worked tirelessly to make proud the Country that gave his family a home.' Cao previously deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia as well as serving in positions at the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the FBI. In 2022, he unsuccessfully ran for a Virginia's 10th congressional seat — losing to Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton — and unsuccessfully challenged Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine in 2024. Trump's first under secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly, served as the Navy's No. 2 civilian from December 2017 through November 2019 and then as acting SECNAV until April 2020. Cao's nomination came hours after John Phelan, Trump's nominee for Navy secretary, was on Capitol Hill for his own confirmation hearing. Phelan's hearing largely lacked any fireworks with most senators — Democrats included — focusing on the standard array of Navy topics, from improving the Navy's shipbuilding record to addressing the Pentagon's dwindling munitions stockpile. 'I think what is missing from what I can see is a sense of urgency,' Phelan said of the Navy’s shipbuilding record. 'We’re just going along and everybody — it’s Kumbaya. It’s almost as if you’re waiting for a crisis to happen to ignite things. And I think in the business of warfare, that’s a dangerous place to be. So I think why the president selected me is I will bring a sense of urgency to this. I will bring a sense of accountability to this.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-taps-former-navy-diver-hung-cao-for-services-no-2-civilian-job/	2025-02-28T05:58:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/cao-scaled-e1740749286984.jpg
Rafael, Kratos team to produce solid rocket motors as Prometheus Energetics	ASHDOD, ISRAEL &#8211; JULY 08: The Iron Dome air-defense system fires to intercept a rocket over the city of Ashdod on July 8, 2014, in Ashdod, Israel.

In the past 3 weeks more then 130 rockets where reportedly fired from Gaza into Israel. (Photo by Ilia Yefimovich/Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Rafael, the Israeli company that makes Iron Dome, is creating a joint venture with US firm Kratos to produce solid rocket motors (SRMs). The new venture, called Prometheus Energetics, seeks to cash in on the growing demand for SRMs, which help power munitions of all sizes, including the Iron Dome interceptors. The companies said in a Feb. 26 statement that they have selected a 500-acre site 'near the United States Navy and Army facility in Crane, Indiana.' Kratos and Rafael said Prometheus will be controlled in an 'approximate 50/50 partnership.' The firms are investing $175 million in the new joint venture along with 'required property, plant, equipment and personnel needed for the new, state-of-the-art energetics manufacturing campus and facilities.' Production is expected to begin in 2027 after Rafael completes a technology transfer to Prometheus, with Eric DeMarco, Kratos president and CEO, saying in the statement that the company expects to provide 'tens of thousands of SRMs and casted warheads' for both the US and Israel. 'We believe Prometheus, once up and running at full rate production, will be a step function catalyst in value creation for Kratos’ stakeholders and the U.S. defense industrial base,' added DeMarco. Yoav Tourgeman, the president and CEO of Rafael, described the new investment as a 'strategic leap forward' for Rafael and its 'commitment to strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base while ensuring our allies and partners have access to the most advanced, combat-proven energetics solutions.' Learn More: Who else is getting into the SRM business? He said the initiative taps business opportunities in the American market with 'with the increasing demand for energetic products, while significantly enhancing our ability to deliver resilient and reliable supply solutions to our customers.' It will strengthen supply chain independence and bolster 'critical capabilities needed to address evolving national security challenges,' he added. This is the second joint venture of this type in the US for Rafael, after it established R2S with Raytheon to produce Tamir missile interceptors in East Camden, Arkansas. It fits into a broader effort by Israel to secure its supply chains for various weapons systems that were heavily used in the recent war, both by investing domestically and looking for partners abroad. Both the Iron Dome interceptor and Rafael’s David’s Sling interceptor use solid rocket motors. David’s Sling has been sold to Finland and the US Marines have conducted live fire training integrating Tamir into the Medium Range Intercept Capability.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/rafael-kratos-team-to-produce-solid-rocket-motors-as-prometheus-energetics/	2025-02-28T05:25:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221018_iron_dome_launch_2_GettyImages-451830874-scaled-e1666112637899.jpg
Pentagon needs further industry collaboration on O-RAN development for 5G interoperability	US Marines with Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (TTECG), familiarize themselves with 5G-enabled devices at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, Aug 16, 2022. (US Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Isaiah Brummett) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense needs industry partners to become more involved in the process of making open radio access network (O-RAN) capabilities a reality, Pentagon leaders and warfighters said Thursday. O-RAN architectures allow users to mix and match different hardware and software components from various vendors when creating 5G networks. The goal is to provide more flexibility, cost efficiency and seamless interoperability, all while ensuring the network is as secure as possible. O-RAN has been a hot topic within 5G circles in recent years, but official direction on the principle wasn’t released until last October in the DoD’s most recent 5G guidance. Now the Pentagon wants more help from industry to make O-RAN become a reality at a faster pace, Director of the DoD CIO’s 5G Cross Function Team Juan Ramírez said during a Potomac Officer’s Club event today. 'We've actually developed an open RAN strategy that, God willing, we get our money and we don't get cut, we will actually start to see more deployment of open RAN. Yes, the department has been at the forefront of it, but we can’t be the only ones,' Ramírez said. 'This is something that we are working with industry on, and we are getting support from industry, but we want to see it push faster. From that perspective, I would say the DoD is leading it [O-RAN], but it shouldn't be the only one. We're a small player when we look at the overall amount of money that is out there for network modernization.' When asked during a panel what needed to change to make 5G more applicable for military use, Johnson Wu, the commercial and technical lead of the Defense Innovation Unit’s cyber and telecom portfolio, replied 'cross vendor interoperability.' 'We are still doubtful whether all this cycling stuff and 5G relays are actually interoperable,' he added. Coming from experience in the tactical domain, Zachary Taylor, senior communications officer in the Army’s special operations 75th Ranger Regiment, admitted that he tends to be skeptical of 5G capabilities because of their lack of interoperability and the lack of education on how they can become interoperable. If industry learns how to work together to be able to plug one device from one vendor into another device from another and teaches the warfighters how the process works, he said, the possibilities of 5G are more promising. 'It is not a silver bullet, right? It doesn’t solve everything,' Taylor said of 5G. 'What I need industry to do is work with other industry partners and be willing to take that critical feedback from the warfighter. 'Most of the warfighters don't understand how to implement some of these different technologies. So what we need from industry is an education piece. We're not subject matter experts. There's a lot of technology. The rapid evolution of technology is just going to outpace our knowledge.' Capt. Lucas Vancina, 5G technical lead at the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity, said the most helpful component of 5G is when it can operate in an O-RAN fashion. 'Definitely the extensibility of the open architecture aspect is probably the biggest advantage from my perspective, like the backwards compatibility,' Vancina said, explaining the capability of a 5G network component being able to work with a legacy system. 'It can be both backwards compatible using the non-3GPP inner working functions [which are responsible for connecting networks like Wi-Fi, fixed-line and code division multiple access to 5G networks] and but also having that built in capability and plan roadmap for future use cases like 6G, is one of the biggest things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-needs-further-industry-collaboration-on-o-ran-development-for-5g-interoperability/	2025-02-27T13:42:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/230316_DVIDS_5G_phone_test_7423737-scaled-e1678992887468.jpg
SECNAV nominee says he’ll bring ‘urgency’ to Navy’s shipbuilding	President Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Navy John Phelan listens during a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on February 27, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The nominee for Navy secretary pledged to lawmakers he'd be focused on correcting the course of problematic shipbuilding programs as well as replenishing dwindling munitions stockpiles, while largely avoiding any significant controversy. John Phelan, a prominent financier and GOP campaign donor who was tapped to become Navy secretary a few weeks after President Donald Trump won the election, testified today before the Senate Armed Services Committee and appeared poised for an easy confirmation. 'I think what is missing from what I can see is a sense of urgency,' Phelan said of the Navy's shipbuilding record. 'We're just going along and everybody — it's Kumbaya. It's almost as if you're waiting for a crisis to happen to ignite things. And I think in the business of warfare, that's a dangerous place to be. So I think why the president selected me is I will bring a sense of urgency to this. I will bring a sense of accountability to this.' Asked about the Constellation-class frigate — one of the most delayed shipbuilding programs, according to a review by the previous administration — Phelan called the program a 'mess' and said the service is producing a frigate that 'looks more like a carrier, or a battleship or a destroyer.' RELATED: Trump slams Navy's frigate program over cost increases At one point, Phelan said Trump has texted him multiple times complaining about the state of the Navy's ships and shipbuilding, and asked what he was doing to fix it. The nominee said he responded by reminding Trump that he had not yet been confirmed. Phelan's hearing was largely uneventful in the sense that most questions focused on the standard cast of Navy-oriented topics, from investment in the service's Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launcher Cruise Missile (SLCM-N) to the dwindling stockpile of munitions the Defense Department has been facing since the start of the war in Ukraine. As for SLCM-N, a weapons program the Biden administration had advocated canceling, Phelan said it is a 'critical component' to the nation's defense. On the subject of dwindling munitions, the nominee said the stockpiles were 'dangerously low' and pledged to focus on the issue 'very quickly.' One of the few contentious moments of the hearing came when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., repeatedly asked Phelan about what the senator characterized as a broad, topline cut to the Pentagon's budget ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. (The Defense Department has denied Hegseth is cutting the budget and has said it intends to shift monies towards the new administration's priorities.) Phelan responded by saying he was not privy to discussions around that choice and therefore couldn't comment on its efficacy. Following the hearing, Blumenthal told reporters Phelan 'clearly dodged' the senator's questions. That 'should leave all of us wondering whether he has the guts and grit to lead the greatest Navy in the history of the world in a time of greater challenges than ever before,' the senator said. Unlike most service secretaries, Phelan, whose career has centered on private investment, does not have experience serving in uniform or as a civilian at the Pentagon, a fact he briefly addressed in his opening remarks. 'I understand that some may question why a businessman who did not wear the uniform should lead the Navy. I respect that concern,' he said. 'The Navy and the Marine Corps already possess extraordinary operational expertise within their ranks. My role is to utilize that expertise and strengthen it to step outside the status quo and take decisive action with a results-oriented approach.' Trump's first confirmed Navy secretary, Richard Spencer, also came from a business and financial background prior to being tapped to lead the Navy and Marine Corps. However, Spencer did serve as a Marine Corps aviator in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Kenneth Braithwaite, Trump's second confirmed Navy secretary, was a career naval officer in both the active service and reserves, but only served as its chief civilian for several months at the end of Trump's first term in office.

RoQS for a hard place: DARPA seeks radically more ‘robust’ quantum sensors for ‘inhospitable’ fieldwork	Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are developing a small vacuum chamber that could aid in non-GPS navigation. (Credit: Sandia National Laboratories) WASHINGTON — The latest atomic clocks use quantum science to measure time to a trillionth of a second. In a lab setting, quantum sensors allow ultra-precise measurements. But the Pentagon wants to take this new technology to the field, to navigate warzones without needing GPS or hunt submarines without using sonar, to put it on helicopters and jets and satellites, with all the vibration and radiation that entails. In those harsh environments, the same exquisite sensitivity that makes quantum tech such a good sensor also makes it extraordinarily vulnerable to interference, drowning the desired signal in irrelevant noise. Past efforts to ruggedize quantum sensors have focused on taking today’s finicky lab tech and shielding it from interference: One might wrap a sensor in metal to shield it from electromagnetic radiation, for instance, or install it on a vibration-cancelling boom instead of in the body of an aircraft. But in a new interview with Breaking Defense, Jonathan Hoffman, a program manager at the fringe-science-loving Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), argued that those kinds of Rube Goldberg fixes don’t address the underlying problem. Hoffman's team is in the midst of a project, dubbed Robust Quantum Sensors or RoQs, that he hopes will discover a fundamentally new approach. 'We’re looking for ideas that don’t require what I call these ‘band-aid’ solutions,' Hoffman said. 'Our hope is this is a philosophical, foundational change in how we build we quantum sensors. &#8230; Rather than saying ‘I’m going to shield away the problem,’ how do I, at the very beginning of my sensor design, think about all those interferences and figure out a way around [them]?' That’s an extremely difficult problem, and the potential solutions can get esoteric. Some of the ones Hoffman described sound similar to the latest developments in quantum computers, which suffer a similar hyper-sensitivity to outside influences and are also looking for alternatives to brute-force shielding of a fundamentally fragile core. They might require using different types of subatomic particles or finding new ways to 'superimpose' quantum states of particles. But Hoffman made a point of not endorsing any specific method. 'We didn’t pick one or the other,' he emphasized in the interview. 'Any quantum sensor that can do the job … is on the table for us.' The RoQS program had its public briefing for interested parties — from tech startups to government-funded labs — at the end of January, with initial abstracts due last week and full proposals by the end of March. Evaluating these complex scientific ideas will take a while, so Hoffman said he doesn’t expect to announce a list of winners or any specific dollar values until the end of summer. The award announcements, expected in August, will kick off a 30-month initial phase. Each competitor will have to take their quantum sensor and get it to work on a helicopter. That’s not targeted at any particular Pentagon aircraft program, Hoffman emphasized. He picked that challenge because a helicopter in flight is one of the most inhospitable environments for any sensor, with vibration, noise, heat, and all sorts of other interference to test the technology. 'There’s nowhere to hide,' he said. Meanwhile, in parallel, Hoffman and his team will work with Pentagon programs that are interested in quantum sensing to see what technical requirements and constraints they have. Once the 30-month initial phase is over, he said, competitors who got their tech to work on the test helicopter will then have 12 months to work with one (or more) of those partner programs to tailor it to work on their specific weapons system. 'All this would be done in close partnership with various government entities to make sure we can bring this onto the right platform, integrate it there, and demonstrate the significant advantage these quantum sensors can bring,' Hoffman said. This is not just a science experiment but an experiment in defense procurement as well, he said. 'Can we bridge the valley of death' between R&amp;D and actual fielding, he asked. 'If we can prove that the worst-case platform interference experience you can experience doesn’t matter to our sensors, then we’ve collapsed the TRL [Technological Readiness Level] chain.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/roqs-for-a-hard-place-darpa-seeks-radically-more-robust-quantum-sensors-for-inhospitable-fieldwork/	2025-02-27T09:48:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/211101_sandia_avocado_handout-e1635776824520.jpg
Preparing the defense industrial base to surge, collaborate, and deliver	Across the defense industrial base, the Defense Department is urging prime contractors and suppliers alike to deliver systems faster – everything from missiles, artillery, and air defense, to electronic warfare, drones, and maneuver vehicles. In this Breaking Defense webinar, we examine how DoD supply chain leadership is helping industry meet delivery requirements and targets by addressing strategies to surge production, improve supply chain visibility, and develop alternate sources of vital materials that can constrain and bottle up the supply chain, in addition to prioritizing demand signals that focus industrial-base efforts — as well as potential partnerships with international companies to meet domestic demand.

Dennis Blair: Pentagon purge a sign of dangerous times ahead	Former commander in chief of the US Pacific Command, Dennis Blair, delivers a speech at a conference of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF) in Tokyo on April 13, 2015. (YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP via Getty Images) The Trump administration’s recent Department of Defense leadership changes are unprecedented in their scale and riskiness. Far from bringing fresh and smart perspectives to national security, they are most likely to weaken the combat effectiveness of the armed forces at a dangerous time for the United States. A diverse officer corps at all ranks produces higher combat effectiveness because it is drawn from a wider and deeper talent pool. The armed forces have learned over the years that not all the best military leaders are white males, and that we need to draw from the best leadership talent in the 35 percent of Americans who are not white and the 50 percent who are not male. The armed forces bring in the best people they can attract at the start of the very competitive merit-based 'up or out' promotion system. The larger the talent pool from which the entrants are drawn at the bottom, the better will be the leaders at all levels through the very top four-star positions. Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps colonels and Navy captains have been tested and judged, and the best of them promoted through a dozen jobs over twenty-five-year careers. Only 3 percent of them are selected for general and admiral. Further promotion only gets more selective as the jobs become tougher: The roughly 300 one-star flag and general officers ultimately are winnowed down to just 38 four-star generals and admirals at the highest levels of command. Gen. CQ Brown, the most senior African-American military officer in the armed forces and Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the most senior female officer in the Navy, had worked their way through this grueling obstacle course of the military promotion system with top performance at every level of command. They were the only current members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who were not white and male, and they were doing a fine job in their very difficult assignments. Senior officers have been and should be dismissed for poor performance and for insubordination. However, the decision to dismiss Brown and Franchetti without performance-based justification will weaken the faith of all current and potential officers in the fairness of the officer promotion system and shrink the talent pool of future military leaders. Arbitrary personnel decisions in the senior officer corps do damage beyond reducing the officer talent pool, at a time when the armed forces are fighting for talent. They also move less competent leaders into the top jobs. The basis for promotion up the officer ranks has been superior performance, especially in operational assignments, and leadership growth potential. What has not been a factor has been connection with or sponsorship from civilian politicians or political parties. The traditions of the American military profession are operational competence, political neutrality and institutional loyalty, not political or personal loyalty or connections. Politicization of the officer corps will move the wrong people to the top military positions, where they will provide incompetent and sycophantic military advice to political leaders and poor leadership to the troops. The experience gained in a merit-based promotion system is crucial. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the new nominee for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dan Caine, will be the least seasoned defense leadership team in modern history. Whatever their personal qualities and success early in their careers, they have not been tested in high-stakes national security leadership roles — positions where wisdom is forged under pressure, where failure carries real consequences. History provides sobering examples of the cost of inexperience at the top. General Ambrose Burnside, General George Custer, Admiral Ralph Ghormley, General Ricardo Sanchez all had admirable personal characteristics and early careers but were not ready for the higher commands to which they were assigned. The challenges of inexperienced leaders at the top will be compounded by removing the civilian experts. The combination of forced early retirement for senior officials and a hiring freeze of new civil servants is a shortsighted move that will save little money but likely hobble the Pentagon. Yes, reform is needed to modernize the department. However, the problem is not the size of the civil service, but its outdated personnel system that makes it difficult to remove poor performers and reward top talent. Instead of reforming this system, the administration is choosing indiscriminate cuts that hollow out expertise when it is needed most. Make no mistake, a weaker civilian workforce means a weaker Department of Defense — just as threats from China, Russia and rogue states demand sharper strategic thinking. The current administration claims to support a strong military. You could have fooled me. Choosing inexperience at the highest levels, cutting without improving civilian staff, dismissing respected leaders without cause, and politicizing military promotions all point to a weakened force, not a stronger one. These are mistakes with lasting consequences that will endanger national security and, if history is any guide, they will take blood and treasure to correct. Admiral (ret.) Dennis Blair is the former Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Command and Director of National Intelligence.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dennis-blair-pentagon-purge-a-sign-of-dangerous-times-ahead/	2025-02-27T08:12:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-469552254-scaled-e1740665696871.jpg
US defense industry could struggle to sell to new German government: Analysts	Soldiers participate in Saber Junction in Hohenfels, Germany, Sept. 13, 2024. The exercise is designed to assess readiness to execute unified land operations in a joint, combined environment (US Army) BELFAST — Germany’s conservative CDU/CSU-led government in waiting, and Europe’s urgent plan to rebuild its military capabilities through self-reliance, puts US industry and future orders from Berlin on shaky ground long term, a trio of analysts tell Breaking Defense. Notably, those concerns include whether Germany will stay the course on an $8.8 billion order for Lockheed Martin F-35A fifth generation fighter jets. Though he has still to formally take up office, Friedrich Merz, the CDU’s choice for chancellor, has proposed securing 'independence' from the US, criticized President Donald Trump's 'America first' doctrine and said he is prepared for the 'worst case scenario,' implying a future where the US would no longer be considered a trusted ally. Additionally, he has publicly called for Ukraine to be part of peace negotiations with Russia, pushing back on the White House decision to exclude Kyiv and European nations from proceedings. On Sunday, Merz told German television, 'After Donald Trump’s remarks last week, it is clear that the Americans, at any case the Americans in this administration, do not care much about the fate of Europe,' adding, 'This is really five minutes to midnight for Europe.' The US has since opposed a UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sided with Moscow a second time by drafting another resolution, passed by members, which called for an immediate end to the conflict but without any criticism of Russia. Merz on the other hand has kickstarted German armed forces modernization plans by opening up discussions with the Social Democrats around a €200 billion emergency defense fund, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Amid such moves, posturing and strategic thinking rests the F-35 order, comprising 35 aircraft, and a collection of other highly lucrative US contracts, including Boeing P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA), CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and RTX Patriot air defense systems. Assessing the level of cancellation risk tied to the four major orders, JJ Gertler, a senior analyst at the Teal Group, told Breaking Defense, 'The most significant existing contract in which there may be buyer’s remorse and an attempt to go a different direction is the German commitment to F-35.' He put the stealth jet at the top of the list as it demands 'an ongoing relationship with the United States, because of their presumed access to all of the data going to and from the airplane,' and added 'it is not a one-time purchase decision like some of these other systems, and the US’ reliability as a partner has to be considered more seriously.' Similarly, Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy firm, said that 'the most survivable US export programs are the ones that need the least care and feeding from the US, and can be sustained with in-country resources. The F-35 is incredibly dependent on a constant stream of upgrades and parts.' Offering an opposing view, Jim Townsend, adjunct senior fellow in the transatlantic security program at the Center for a New American Security thinktank, said that the F-35 order is 'safe,' largely because Germany has 'no other option' but to acquire the aircraft to replace retiring Panavia Tornados. 🇩🇪#F35 Milestone achieved!

The German F-35 fleet is also set to be equipped with US B61-12 bombs to undertake NATO nuclear deterrence missions, with first deliveries expected in 2026. A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin told Breaking Defense in a statement, 'Questions regarding German politics are best addressed by the German government. Questions relating to Germany’s procurement of F-35, through a government-to-government contract, are best addressed by the governments involved.' At the other end of the spectrum is the contract to procure 60 CH-47F helicopters, which the analysts said is likely to continue forward, in part because the only competition was between two US firms — Boeing and Lockheed, which was offering its CH-53K King Stallion design. (Boeing declined to comment.) The 'odds of [CH-47F] cancellation are probably lower than in a case where the runner-up was European (or where a viable European counterpart might exist, like Airbus’s intent to develop a P-8 equivalent based on their airliners)' explained Gertler. The Chinook case is also helped because the aircraft can be supported by 'in-country depots,' as opposed to over reliance on the transfer of supply chain goods from the US, according to Aboulafia. In 2024, Tim Flood, Boeing's vice president of international business development, told Breaking Defense that the company plans on making first CH-47F deliveries to Germany in 2027, while the first of eight P-8’s is due for handover this year. A CH-47F Chinook assigned to B Company, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) perches on a mountain in the Alps in Germany (US Army National Guard) Air defense is another major investment for Germany, as over the course of 2024 alone, Berlin inked two Patriot air and missile defense system orders worth $2.4 billion and received approval from the US State Department to acquire up to 600 Lockheed Martin Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement munitions and related equipment, valued at approximately $5 billion. Additionally, Germany is one of four European countries involved in a $5.5 billion acquisition of up to 1,000 Patriot Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T). The deal is contracted to COMLOG, a joint venture between RTX and European missile house MBDA, through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency. RTX deferred questions on Patriot to the German government for this report. Like Europe as a whole, Germany is acutely focused on replenishing air defense stocks to replace systems gifted to Ukraine. Berlin has supplied Kyiv with an undisclosed number of Patriot missiles as well as three complete systems, including spare parts and four launchers, according to a military support factsheet. Patriot has been credited with shooting down Russian Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missiles and Su-34 fighter jets during the war, though delivery delays have been a point of tension. Townsend voiced confidence that Patriot orders for Berlin will go through as planned, noting the weapon system 'is too important for German air defense to be left behind and the delivery schedule is too long to delay the purchase.' Aboulafia added that a lack of alternative options could keep missile defense deals with the US on track. 'Conceivably, Eurofighter could replace the F-35, with enough time/money to qualify it for the nuclear mission,' he said. 'By contrast, Patriot might just be in a class by itself.' Currently signed agreements may be one thing, but there seems to be agreement among the analysts that future US sales to Germany will face longer odds. Gertler, for example, forecast that Merz’s push for 'independence' will likely lead to a situation where 'the US will lose its position as the default answer to every hardware requirement.' He added, 'Going forward, there will be no preference for US equipment stemming from a regard for their role as a guarantor of European security – at least so long as that commitment remains vague.' As Germany becomes more 'protectionist' in a bid to deliver weapons programs and rearmament at pace, US market entry restrictions or complete loss of market access could take hold, suggested Townsend, especially if the European Union decides to take more of a leading role over major projects. Earlier this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched plans related to a new 'designated European instrument' that she said would let the bloc deliver 'targeted and efficient defense spending' and that would specifically support European integrated air defense, deep strike capabilities, UAVs, ammunition and missiles, per Politico. 'I think in the short to medium term, the US will have the upper hand' over Europe, said Townsend. 'But in the long term, if European industry is able to rise to the challenge, they'll have competition, particularly in terms of price. The US tends to have the pricey, exquisite systems and maybe that's not always the answer to things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/us-defense-industry-could-struggle-to-sell-to-new-german-government-analysts/	2025-02-27T07:01:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/DOD.mil-image-Collins-240913-A-VS161-2582M-scaled-e1740600109136.jpg
A joint project? Turkey’s KAAN fighter program attracts Gulf interest, exec says	The second flight of the national combat aircraft KAAN, which was initiated by the Turkish Defence Industries Presidency (SSB) in order to meet the combat aircraft requirement of the Turkish Air Forces Command and developed by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), is carried out successfully in Ankara, Turkiye on May 06, 2024. (Photo by TUR Defence Industries Presidency/Anadolu via Getty Images) IDEX 2025 — Turkey has seen 'lots of interest' from foreign nations in potentially joining its next-generation fighter jet project, including from an unnamed Gulf country that is 'seriously considering' joining development, a senior Turkish industry official told Breaking Defense. As of now, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) General Manager Mehmet Demiroglu said that the jet, known as KAAN, is under development only by Turkish companies as 'there is no official [outside] participation yet. 'There are lots of interest [from a] number of countries, but these things are taking a lot of time and high-level decisions,' he said in an interview last week at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi. 'It will be a joint program.' Turkish media claimed in 2024 that Saudi Arabia was in talks to procure 100 KAAN fighter jets, but those reports were never confirmed by Ankara or Riyadh. (The Gulf kingdom has also expressed interest in joining competing fighter programs.) RELATED: Why Saudi Arabia is interested in GCAP — and whether it should be After the first KAAN prototype flew in 2024, Demiroglu said he expected the second and third prototypes to 'be flying by the end of the year and early next year, and we'll be heavily testing these prototypes. ' Demiroglu said that the firm plans to 'shorten the testing period, because we need to do lots of testing and to be able to deliver our first production to [the] Turkish air force in 2028-2029 time frame.' In May 2024, TAI announced that the firm will deliver 20 aircraft by 2028. Demirogu clarified that the delivery of the KAAN jets will start that year. 'I can tell [you] we didn't change our target, but we will see. No one can guarantee that this is going to happen at [a] specified time, because the world is in a different place compared to 10 years ago,' he said. Demiroglu added that for the firm to be able to deliver KAAN with the needed qualifications, it 'need[s] to do lots of homework, and with the latest developments in computing area, testing and experience building with the Hurkus, Hurjet and other [Turkish air] platforms, we are confident that we'll do much shorter time than normally expected,' he said comparing the KAAN development timeline to the lengthy development of the American-made F-35. KAAN, which is described as a 5th-generation fighter jet will have 6th-generation features, Demiroglu said, adding that that the firm is working on manned-unmanned teaming concept between KAAN and Turkish UAV maker Baykar. During IDEX, TAI displayed a model of the KAAN fighter jet alongside the Hurkus 2 trainer and light attack turboprop aircraft. Without going into any specific initiatives, Demiroglu said that Turkish industry more broadly is having 'very, very, very advanced discussions' with Saudi Arabia related to a number of projects. 'We are in discussion to find out the best collaboration model,' he said. A model of the KAAN fighter jet on display at Turkish Aerospace Industries stand at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) He said he was confident that during 2025 Turkish firms 'will announce at least a couple of big projects' with the Kingdom. About interest in Hurkus 2 that was on display at the show, Demiroglu said that 'there are interests, but that interest will grow, because if Turkish air force is accepting a platform, that means it's a good platform.' He added that TAI is discussing export deals of Hurkus trainer and light attack version, not only in Gulf countries but also with countries from Africa, Central Asia and the Far East. More broadly, Demigroglu said that in the next five years TAI will focus on 'how fast we can deliver [and] how cost competitive these platforms will be without sacrificing any bit from the quality.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/a-joint-project-turkeys-kaan-fighter-program-attracts-gulf-interest-exec-says/	2025-02-27T02:22:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/kaan-e1715707472727.jpg
Japan targets weapons sales through Indo-Pacific, as industrial ties lag strategic ones	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches fourth of Mogami-class frigates, Mikuma. Credit Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force TOKYO — Japan is in talks with Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries as part of a push to export weapons and subsdystems throughout the Indo-Pacific, according to a senior defense official here, part of a campaign to increase defense industrial ties regionally. The US ally's main thrust is the high-profile effort to sell Australia the Mogami-class frigate, which has attracted unprecedented support from the highest reaches of the Japanese government and industry. The official, who spoke to Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity, also pointed to a long-simmering attempt to provide technology to Indonesia for what had been described as a destroyer program. The official said Friday there were talks with other countries but declined to name them. As for the Philippines, the Japanese defense minister publicly pledged closer defense cooperation on Feb. 24 in the wake of the persistent and aggressive pressure from China on Manila to give up some of its internationally recognized waters in the South China Sea. Defense Minister Gen. Nakatani said during his first visit to the Philippines that the two countries believe they must 'further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration in order to maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific' because of the difficult security situation. That cooperation will include increased sharing of technology and the provision of weapons like the radar systems Japan recently has gifted to the Philippines. The air defense radar were installed at Wallace Air Station on the island of Luzon. Nakatani said nothing specific about weapon systems marked for eventual sale or transfer. Taken together, Tokyo's moves appear to be indicative of a lag between defense policy — where relations with Australia, South Korea, the Philippines and other regional players have grown substantially closer in the last two years — and weapons exports, perhaps the most concrete proof of closer cooperation between two countries. 'The defense relationship is not catching up with other areas of defense cooperation between the two nations [Australia and Japan],' the senior defense official said. 'The defense cooperation has been pushed up so much, but equipment cooperation — we've done some joint research projects — but not this big deal yet.' To catch up, Japan has moved swiftly to make good on its policy to begin exports. In the last year it moved from making its first appearance at an international air show, the 2024 Singapore event, to providing radars to the Philippines and engaging in a full court press to sell the Mogami to Australia, in what could be a turning point for Japan-Australia defense industry relations specifically. The Japanese government also created a joint board of senior government officials and of industry leaders late last year to coordinate policy and actions and ensure Australia, in particular, is as well informed about Japanese intentions and capabilities as possible. Japan has proposed a $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) sale to Australia of the Mogami frigate to answer Australia's request for bids for surface vessels to supplement the Hunter class, which are most focused on anti-submarine warfare. The Mogami, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is competing against a German offering from ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (KTMS), builder of Australia’s current Anzac-class frigates. KTMS is offering the Meko A-200, an upgraded version of the 30-year-old Anzacs. Selling the Mogami to Australia could 'open up the doors to other industrial cooperation, which is attracting more and more Japanese industries interested in the Australian market,' the official said. Closer cooperation could include the Lucky Country's guided weapons enterprise known as GWEO (Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance). Japan has invested heavily in missile systems and has 'much industrial expertise,' the senior defense official told Breaking Defense. Outside Australia, the nascent discussions with Indonesia about supplying technology — some reports from Indonesia said the Mogami frigate was discussed — are clearly in the early stages after years of on and off talks with the previous government. With the election last year of Prabowo Subianto, the former defense minister, those discussions have restarted, the official said. But they are less focused on a destroyer than on what the official called 'maritime security.' As Prabowo's team reviews its acquisition plans, Indonesia's plans will come into clearer focus. 'We'll discuss maritime security with them and we'll find out what capabilities they want and what capabilities we could provide to them,' the senior defense official averred.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/japan-targets-weapons-sales-through-indo-pacific-as-industrial-ties-lag-strategic-ones/	2025-02-26T12:55:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
‘Let’s be frank’: Hegseth’s budget shakeup will be ‘painful’ but there’s ‘hope,’ Air Force official says	U.S. Air Force and Massachusetts Air National Guard pilot Capt. Martin 'Heklr' Clark, climbs into the cockpit of an F-15C Eagle aircraft prior to flight, April 20, 2016, as part of the Frisian Flag 2016 exercise, Leeuwarden Air Base, Netherlands. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by 1st Lt. Bonnie Harper/Released) WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s direction for the military services to collectively free up roughly $50 billion for fiscal 2026 will be 'painful,' a top Air Force official said today, though he predicted the process will benefit the service in the long run. 'Let's be frank,' Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, a chief architect of the service’s new force design concept, said in a conversation hosted by the Hudson Institute. 'The Air Force has gotten smaller. The Air Force has gotten older. And as you look at where the Air Force has gone, we've protected core [missions], which is homeland defense, strategic deterrence and power projection. So there's not many places where we can go for these things.' Those limited opportunities for paring back, Kunkel reasoned, means 'it's going to look really, really bad' once Hegseth’s budget drill gets underway. Nevertheless, the general found reason for 'hope.' The process is not anticipated to change the service’s overall topline and is instead shifting dollars toward the Trump administration’s new priorities — including in the out-years under the Pentagon’s five year budget planning cycle. 'When you look at it from that perspective, the Air Force is going to do really well in the future,' Kunkel said, adding that the service’s newly minted force design will provide options for leadership to invest in. 'When you look at the secretary's priorities and you look at our force design, you're like, ‘There's a match, there's a match, there's a match.'' A leading hot-button issue for the service is a futuristic stealth fighter known as Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), whose fate has still not been formally decided by the Trump administration after being paused last year. Without providing too much detail, Kunkel stated that 'the fight looks much better when NGAD is in it' as opposed to having to operate without it. 'NGAD remains an important part of our force design, and it fundamentally changes the character of the fight in a really, really good way for the joint force,' he said, such as by ensuring 'less operational risk' as the service pursues air superiority. If the fighter is not fielded, 'that fight is just gonna look a little bit different, and we may not be able to pursue or achieve all of our policy objectives.' Kunkel additionally observed that for the NGAD concept to be viable, the platform will need support from survivable bases it can launch from and tankers that can gas it up. Concerning base defense, elsewhere in the conversation Kunkel echoed comments from other officials that the Air Force may need to have its own indigenous base defense capabilities instead of traditional reliance on the Army to provide them. And on tanking, the general said that a next-gen tanker also currently in limbo 'might be part of the solution,' but there are other operational approaches that can achieve a similar outcome without it. Asked about reforms to the requirements process, including the at-times-cumbersome Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Kunkel said a key lesson from the war in Ukraine has been the value of rapidly iterating systems that are then quickly delivered to the field. That necessity, in turn, will likely require a different way of doing business. OP ED: The Pentagon's joint requirements process must go 'We've got to make changes in our processes, which is going to require some changes to the law to get ourselves to be more adaptable,' Kunkel said. He declined to comment on specifics.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/lets-be-frank-hegseths-budget-shakeup-will-be-painful-but-theres-hope-air-force-official-says/	2025-02-26T10:44:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240213_pilot_cockpit_2550991-scaled-e1707844904759.jpg
The Pentagon’s joint requirements process must go	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) A wave of efficiency talk has arrived in Washington, epitomized by the Department of Government Efficiency now roaming the halls of the Pentagon. But as policymakers examine how government actually functions, it's becoming clear that the goal shouldn’t merely be cost savings, but higher competence. One glaring example stands ready for immediate action: the Pentagon's sclerotic joint requirements process. In a new Hudson Institute report, 'Required to Fail,' we outline the need to immediately put this process out of its misery. For over two decades, the Defense Department has labored under a bureaucratic ritual known as JCIDS — the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System. Created with noble intentions, this process has devolved into a crushing administrative burden that actively impedes America's military modernization. Far from ensuring strategic alignment or joint warfighting capabilities, JCIDS has become a bureaucratic priesthood fixated on formatting, enthralled by committees, and divorced from tangible warfighting needs. The numbers tell a damning story. It takes over two years just to get a military requirement approved through this system. During that time, technology evolves, threats advance, and opportunities evaporate. While China rapidly fields new capabilities, and commercial technology cycles span mere months, America's military remains trapped in endless document reviews and formatting refinements. Consider this absurdity: When engineers once discovered that the F-35’s combat radius fell short of its validated key performance requirement by just six nautical miles — about one percent — it triggered nearly a year of bureaucratic wrangling. Instead of acknowledging that 584 nautical miles might be perfectly adequate, or rethinking the entire approach, the system doubled down on its initial, arbitrary decree. Hours of senior leader time, including that of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, evaporated in the pursuit of percentage points that had no inherent strategic significance. This isn't just inefficiency — it's institutional madness. The fundamental flaw lies in JCIDS's delusion of perfect planning. The system imagines an immaculate cascade from high-level needs to engineering specifications, all knowable years in advance. But reality intrudes: Technical constraints, shifting threats, and budget realities collide with these neat theoretical cascades. When they do, instead of adapting, the system demands costly acrobatics to preserve the illusion of perfection. But here's the cruel irony: After climbing this bureaucratic mountain, these documents accomplish nothing. They don't align money. They don't identify program managers for urgent joint needs. They simply accumulate in an ever-expanding pile of validated requirements that don't get published, don't get culled, just accumulate. An unprecedented wave of decorated senior military leaders has promised to fix this system. From General Cartwright's blunt calls for elimination through Admiral Winnefeld's streamlined forums, General Selva's accelerated timelines, General Hyten's software-era rhetoric, and Admiral Grady's top-down pronouncements — each inherited the same unwieldy machine and promised to fix it. Each has been absorbed into its inertia. Congress has finally lost patience. The latest defense bill mandates a clean-sheet redesign of military requirements. But tinkering won't solve this. The entire apparatus needs to go. Remarkably, this is relatively straightforward: One minor revision to Title 10, removing the legal requirement for document validation, coupled with an internal Defense Department memo scaling back the joint requirements oversight council, would suffice. What the Joint Staff calls progress just indicts the system for its futility — broad capstone documents you can drive a truck through and that don't track accountability, alongside a capability portfolio review model that dominates calendars but doesn't move money. Over more than 30 years and twenty major revisions to the joint requirements system — calling it top-down and bottoms-up, changing document names and approval authorities — the Pentagon has failed to ever question whether the idea of rubber-stamping documents could lead to desired its outcomes. The solution isn't more paperwork — it's understanding warfighting outcomes. Rather than prescribing solutions years in advance, the Pentagon should start with clear problem statements of warfighting need, then move to campaigns of experimentation where service systems and new prototypes can be linked together to see what solutions work best. Our recent report explores what this new approach might look like and how it could function. But to make things better, we don’t need to wait for a new system, we can start today. This isn't about making government smaller for its own sake. It's about recognizing that sometimes less really is more. By removing this bureaucratic albatross, we could free up America's brightest officers in joint roles to focus on actual warfighting innovation rather than debating section headers while our adversaries field new capabilities. Abolishing JCIDS can be the first needed step in streamlining Pentagon processes — picking off the low hanging fruit in the monstrosity that is defense acquisition. If Congressional and Pentagon reformers can’t do what it takes to kill such a non-value-added process, they will have no chance in tackling more difficult choices. Let's give JCIDS the funeral it deserves. Our military's future depends on it. William C. Greenwalt is a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former deputy undersecretary of defense for industrial policy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/the-pentagons-joint-requirements-process-must-go/	2025-02-26T10:02:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
Too soon? GAO questions tech readiness of satellite laser links	SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) will depend on laser links between satellites and to ground stations to provide high-speed data transport and missile warning, tracking and fire control. (Illustration: Government Accountability Office) WASHINGTON — While the Defense Department is counting on laser links to enable new satellite constellations for rapid communications and missile tracking, the Space Development Agency has yet to prove that the technology is viable, according to a new report by Congress's watchdog agency. SDA 'has taken steps to develop laser communications technology but has not yet fully demonstrated it in space,' finds the GAO report, 'Laser Communications: Space Development Agency Should Create Links Between Development Phases' released today. Thus, GAO recommends that DoD 'fully demonstrate the technology's capabilities before investing further, among other things' — which would require slowing SDA's two-year acquisition cycle to ensure workable laser links can be integrated. The SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) is a 'mesh network' — defined by the GAO as 'a decentralized type of network that automatically configures and adapts itself to route data most efficiently' — of large constellations of small satellites in low Earth orbit. The two main constellations will provide data transport and missile warning/tracking. Not only is the PWSA the planned backbone of DoD's Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept, but it also now has been tagged as a foundational element of President Donald Trump's Iron Dome for America concept of a homeland defense missile shield. Laser communications links between satellites, and then from satellites to ground stations, are the linchpin of the PWSA's mesh network concept. In addition, the Space Force is planning to use optical inter-satellite links for future satellites in medium Earth orbit designed to track hypersonic missiles and vehicles. 'Laser communications could improve capabilities beyond traditional radio frequency communications that DOD has traditionally used, in part, because data can be transmitted faster,' GAO explains. Advantages include 'the ability to transmit at much higher data rates through significantly narrower transmission beams, which enables more secure communication between users.' At the same time, senior SDA officials long have acknowledged that optical inter-satellite links are the long pole in the tent for the PWSA. The GAO report stresses that 'this technology is much more complex' that traditional radio-frequency satellite communications. Obstacles include: stabilizing the laser beam to eliminate 'jitter' that disrupts the signal; pointing, acquisition and tracking with enough precision so that terminals on each end of the communication link can reliable 'speak' to each other; and minimizing atmospheric disturbances in transmitting laser signals from satellites to user platforms on the ground or in the air, according to the report. Due to the technology's complexity, 'the Space Force is working with multiple vendors to develop it,' GAO notes. 'Nevertheless, the number of vendors involved adds further complexity to the overall effort. Among other things, the Space Force will need to ensure that different vendors’ satellite optical communications terminals (OCT), devices used to establish laser data transmission links, are able to communicate with each other,' the report states. And so far, GAO says, SDA's development program has not made discernable progress to demonstrate that these problems can be overcome. 'SDA's demonstration tranche—referred to as Tranche 0 or T0—has faced development challenges and delays and has not fully demonstrated the capabilities expected from it. For example, SDA planned to launch the first T0 satellites in 2022 but launched them in 2023 and 2024. Further, this initial group of satellites has not yet fully demonstrated laser communications technology in space,' the report elaborates. 'Specifically, as of December 2024, SDA reported that one of its four prime contractors in T0 had demonstrated three of the eight planned laser communications capabilities while another contractor had demonstrated one of the eight capabilities. The remaining two contractors have not yet achieved any planned capabilities.' GAO's Feb. 26, 2025 report finds little progress made by SDA vendors on development of optical communications terminals. (Government Accountability Office) Further, GAO asserts, 'SDA has lowered its expectations for T0 but has still faced challenges.' For example, the report said that as of December 2024, SDA contractors have demonstrated two of the planned optical communication terminal capabilities that were planned for Tranche 0 satellites. 'SDA officials said contractors have also achieved a laser link between two satellite vendors, York Space Systems and SpaceX, but both of those companies are using the same OCT developer. This means SDA has yet to demonstrate a link between two OCT vendors in space as originally planned,' the report adds. GAO goes on to criticize SDA for using a development approach 'thus far is inconsistent with the leading practices,' in particular the fact the agency 'is proceeding through tranches and increasing the complexity of its development based on designs that have not yet met initial capabilities. As a result, SDA is at risk of unnecessarily investing in new efforts without yet delivering on promised capabilities intended to support critical missions.' DoD this month provided formal responses to GAO's findings and recommendations, the report says, and 'concurred with our recommendations.' However, 'DOD notes that it believes it is already implementing our recommendations,' GAO says. 'We disagree. The evidence presented throughout our draft and final report supports our view that SDA is not already taking the actions we recommend. We continue to believe SDA would benefit from taking steps aimed at implementing our recommendations.' The GAO report is yet another blow to SDA, which has been embattled by a bid protest by Viasat that, as first reported by Breaking Defense, was the trigger for the Air Force’s Jan. 16 decision to place SDA Director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. That protest has resulted in a requirement for the agency to recompete one of the contracts awarded under that bidding process. Meanwhile, DoD has launched a review of the agency's semi-independent status as an acquisition unit under the Space Force — a move that has resulted in pushback from some members of Congress.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/too-soon-gao-questions-tech-readiness-of-satellite-laser-links/	2025-02-26T09:30:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-12.01.23 PM-e1740589957405.png
Army picks Carnegie, Forterra for autonomous logistics truck prototyping	Oshkosh PLS (Palletized Loader System) trucks equipped with Leader-Follower autonomy systems. (Oshkosh Defense) WASHINGTON — The US Army has quietly selected two companies to develop and test autonomous logistics trucks, with officials hoping to get them into the fleet as soon as 2027 — if budgets allow. Officials from the Army and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) told Breaking Defense Tuesday that both Carnegie Robotics and Forterra have been selected to move forward with prototyping work on the Autonomous Transport Vehicle System (ATV-S) ahead of a mid-fiscal 2026 decision point that could narrow the field to a single winner. The Army and DIU did not disclose how much funding each team received under the new deals or when those contracts were awarded. In fact, no official announcement was ever made, with the revelation that a downselect was complete only coming to light Tuesday during comments from Army officials, including Maj. Gen Michelle Donahue, the commanding general for the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command/Sustainment Center of Excellence. 'We must optimize the combinations of humans and machines to increase lethality, survivability and agility, while streamlining and reducing and anticipating those logistics burdens,' Donahue said at the National Defense Industrial Association’s tactical wheeled vehicles conference. 'The integration of autonomous systems for resupply, maintenance and energy distribution will be a game changer.' 'We will capitalize on ATV-S autonomous replenishment of critical commodities to extend the division commander's operational reach and his endurance, or her endurance,' Donahue later added. 'We expect our divisional composite truck companies to increase sustained throughput by 50 percent while autonomously navigating varied and unpredictable routes while maintaining continuous movement.' RELATED: Frustrations mount over Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle autonomy, acquisition approach Getting to this point hasn’t been a direct line for the service. After plowing ahead developing the Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) for several years — an effort to outfit Oshkosh Defense’s Palletized Load System trucks with autonomy software — in 2023 the service began sunsetting work on that developmental initiative and returning the vehicles back to the fleet without the autonomy packages. The new aim was to find commercial solutions under an acquisition pathway dubbed ATV-S. DIU began supporting that work, in part by standing up the Ground Expeditionary Autonomous Retrofit System (GEARS) project. Then in 2023, DIU selected three teams — Carnegie Robotics, Forterra and Neya Systems — to spend a year developing and testing viable prototypes that could eventually be scaled for mass production. 'We made a lot of headway on this program, really, in the last approximately 18 months, we went from…experimentation, to let's get it onto a program timeline to field to multiple units over time,' Kyle Bruner, the project manager for force projection under Donahue’s command, said on Tuesday. Now with the downselect to two teams, the initiative is officially in phase two with the goal of eventually having PLA A2 heavy expanded mobility tactical trucks (HEMTTs) roll off the production line with a 'digital backbone' ready for the autonomy suites. As for picking a winner to provide that autonomy solution, the Army wants to begin phase two testing later this summer. However, Bruner and Donahue said the stalled FY25 defense bill on Capitol Hill could derail that plan. Since Congress has not yet passed a defense spending bill for this year, the department is operating under a continuing resolution that maintains FY24 spending levels, and that’s a problem for the ATV-S. 'I said 12 to 18 months [for fielding]. It could even be 24 months…if we can't go forth with the final source selection for that capability,' Donahue said. Such a decision would be delayed if the service and DIU do not have funds to test out ATV-S prototypes as planned. That testing roadmap, the duo separately explained, involves using some form of the autonomous trucks at the upcoming Project Convergence capstone event at Ft. Irwin, Calif. next month.

Smaller polygons and cell alerts: How Israel’s Home Front Command honed its civilian alert system	People take cover as sirens sound to warn of incoming rockets, during a funeral ceremony in the northern town of Mitzpe Netofa on November 3, 2024. (Photo by JALAA MAREY/AFP via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Israel’s warfighting in Gaza and Lebanon may have spawned some technological leaps when it comes to combat operations, but according to an Israeli security official, advances weren’t constrained only to the fighting itself. Israel’s Home Front Command, which is charged with protecting Israeli civilians, also evolved over the course of the year-plus conflicts, honing existing technology and developing new communication techniques to alert the populace to any threats — mostly coming in the form of rocket or drone attacks. 'Our motto is to get the early warning to every citizen in any place in Israel in any time,' the official, who requested their name not be used for security reasons, told Breaking Defense. 'Because of the threats Israel has, it’s the most advanced system in the world.' RELATED: As &#8216;dome' air defense discussions rage, Turkey's Aselsan sees an opening, CEO says The Hamas attack on Oct. 7 and subsequent attacks by that group, as well as by Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and directly from Iran, tested the alert system to its limits. Six months into the war, the Israel Defense Forces estimated around 12,200 rockets had been fired at Israel from Gaza, Lebanon and other fronts. To better alert civilians to the threats, some of the Home Front Command’s adaptations were a refining of current systems. Israel has relied on a siren alert system in which sirens have been placed throughout the country. The country itself is digitally divided into different polygons. When a projectile appears to be heading towards any particular polygon — after likely being spotted by the same radar system that supports Israel’s multi-layered air defense shield — all the sirens in that polygon are commanded to sound the alarm. But in previous decades the polygons could be quite large, meaning a solitary rocket could send the people of a whole city running for shelters, when the threat was really much more localized. Over time, Home Front Command has managed to be more precise in its predictions, and in its geographical alerts — essentially shrinking the polygons, and therefore the number of civilians who really need to be alerted. Home Front Command also worked to alert individual citizens directly through their cell phones. The first method was with an app developed by the military in recent years that civilians could download that would receive alerts based on the cell phone’s geographical position. But during this war, the command also added a new tactic: issuing alerts directly to relevant phones using cell broadcasts. That system uses existing cell technology but doesn’t have to rely on the user having downloaded the app or having GPS to locate the phone (a good thing, since Israel reportedly jammed some GPS signals near combat zones.) The direct cell broadcast alert was first used during Iran’s second ballistic missile and drone attack on Israel in October 2024, the official said. (Drones also provide a novel problem for an alert system that relies on threats having a predictable trajectory, though the official said vaguely the command has learned lessons from Ukraine's experience fighting Russia to better deal with those.) RELATED: What it was like on the ground during Iran's attack on Israel Beyond cell phones, the official said the Home Front Command has worked to beam alerts directly into Internet of Things devices, like Smart TVs, so that someone watching the TV at home would get a digital alert if they need to run for shelter. Each singular alert systems has its weaknesses — what if a civilian can’t hear the sirens, or doesn’t have the app, or isn’t near their phone, etc. — but the official suggested that the idea is to have a layered alert system that raises the odds of citizens getting at least one warning that they could be in danger. In the future, the official said, Home Front Command could try to beam alerts directly into smart cars, so drivers would be immediately made aware of threats. Cloud computing, the official added, is being evaluated to see if it could offer aid as the program gets more data heavy. 'We always look ahead for new technology and how they can be implemented in our systems and do it even better,' the official said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/smaller-polygons-and-cell-alerts-how-israels-home-front-command-honed-its-civilian-alert-system/	2025-02-26T07:30:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250225_israel_siren_GettyImages-2182009055-e1740508737549.jpg
Space Force: Vive la difference, advises a new AEI policy paper	Space Systems Command headquarters in Los Angeles, Calif., at sunset. (SSC) WASHINGTON — The Space Force should 'embrace its exceptionalism' and push Congress and the Trump administration to allow the service to forge new ways of doing business — from how it buys kit to how it trains Guardians to how it defines its missions, according to a new policy paper from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). '[T]he Space Force is fundamentally different from the other services, and it should not settle for being bound by the same rules, processes, and constraints,' asserts author Todd Harrison, a senior AEI fellow and long-time military space policy guru. The paper, 'Embracing Space Force Exceptionalism,' is a chapter from AEI's 2025 book, Affording Defense: Investing in American Strength to Confront a More Dangerous World, edited by Mackenzie Eaglen. Urging the Space Force to 'be more aggressive' in breaking the mold set by its sister services, Harrison argues that the newest military service 'is better positioned to take on new missions in a multiple theater force-planning construct.' Such new missions include not only ones necessitated by adversary advances in space power, such as 'offensive and defensive counterspace,' but also 'existing missions that can be better performed from space than from other domains' in heavily contested environments, such as detecting, tracking and targeting enemy forces on the ground. Harrison also posits a fundamental reshaping of the Space Force's organizational structure that would group command units around mission-specific areas such as satellite communications or positioning, navigation and timing. AEI Senior Fellow Todd Harrison is recommending that the Space Force reorganize its command structure around mission areas. ('Embracing Space Force Exceptionalism,' American Enterprise Institute, Feb. 25, 2025) The paper makes seven major recommendations: 'Congress and the White House recognize that the Space Force is different, and the public assumes it is different, but the Space Force itself has not fully accepted its uniqueness. The Space Force is the exceptional service, and Space Force Exceptionalism should be the heart of its culture, values, and vision,' Harrison concludes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-vive-la-difference-advises-a-new-aei-policy-paper/	2025-02-26T05:52:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221020_SSC_hq_sunset.png
EXCLUSIVE: Hegseth draft memo lays out software acquisition reform push	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Joint Task Force North, US Northern Command, to see the efforts military men and women are undertaking in support of US Customs and Border Protection to secure the southern border at Fort Bliss, Texas, Feb. 12, 2025. (US Army/Sgt. 1st Class Andrew R. Sveen) WASHINGTON — Pentagon leaders are crafting a plan to shake up how they buy and field technology, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starting things off by potentially directing that the department adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) as the preferred method for software development. In a draft memo obtained by Breaking Defense, Hegseth calls on the department to adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway, a practice created in 2020 to accelerate software development by implementing best practices from the private sector. At its core SWP is a streamlined method for procuring software programs bespoke to DoD requirements. Through the SWP organizations can deploy capabilities into platforms within six months or less, DoD has previously stated that the goal is to speed this process up into hours or days. The memo also directs the use of Commercial Solutions Openings and Other Transactions as the 'default solicitation' and award avenue for acquiring capabilities. 'Software is at the core of every weapon and supporting system we field to remain the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. While commercial industry has rapidly adjusted to a software- defined product reality, DoD has struggled to reframe our acquisition process from a hardware- centric to a software-centric approach,' the memo reads. (As the memo has not been signed out, it is possible wording could change in the final version of the document.) 'When it comes to software acquisition, we are overdue in pivoting to a performance-based outcome and, as such, it is the Warfighter who pays the price.' Speaking on background, a defense official told Breaking Defense that the department will not comment 'on alleged unsigned draft memos' but did not push back on the contents. 'As a general matter, the department is committed to ensuring our warfighters have cutting-edge digital capabilities,' the official said. 'Through that lens, we are looking at the best methods to accelerate the delivery of scalable, secure digital solutions by leveraging commercial innovation, removing bureaucratic barriers, and prioritizing performance-based outcomes.' Commercial Solutions Openings is a solicitation process developed by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) that allows the DoD to work with nontraditional defense companies in a more flexible, faster, collaborative manner. Any contracts awarded as a result of this process are handed out as Other Transaction Agreements (OTA). 'This applies to any software pathway program in the planning phase prior to execution. Department Components are prohibited from implementing further guidance on this point that would set out restrictive measures, guidelines, frameworks, directives, or policies other than required by statute,' the memo states. Furthermore, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, alongside the DIU director, have to develop and submit an implementation plan on how to best utilize these practices within 30 calendar days of the memo being signed. The memo is expected to kickstart a process aimed at getting new technologies and weapons into the field at a faster clip, which is emerging as a focus for the Trump Pentagon, as Breaking Defense previously reported. Related: DoD acquisition reform guidance expected soon, with focus on rapid prototyping There has also been speculation, including in a Defense One article earlier this month, on how the new Trump administration may restructure offices, to include possibly combining pieces of the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, DIU and Strategic Capabilities Office. (It may be notable that DIU is called out in the memo, potentially as a sign that the organization's approach and use of OTAs will have greater usage as the Pentagon seeks to increase ties to the commercial sector.) However, the defense official cautioned that it is still early days of 'pie in the sky brainstorming sessions' designed to explore a variety of options to make the Pentagon 'more effective and efficient.' 'I strongly caution against buying into one rumor of how this could go at this point,' the defense official previously told Breaking Defense. 'Each of the organizations, like DIU, have strengths that would only make sense to build on.' Earlier this month, one source that works closely with a broad swath of defense companies described this look at acquisition as par for the course anytime a new secretary enters the Pentagon. 'With all new administrations, there is a pretty much ‘stop, relook and clarify priorities period,’' the source said. 'And right now there is a sense of urgency with acquisition reform.' Many of the non-traditional tech companies, the source added, are ecstatic with the 'rumored frenzy' of acquisition change. That could potentially include revamping the DIU and funneling more work its way, with companies who focus on software, autonomous systems and capabilities that do not rely on GPS, given the ever-increasing threats from electronic warfare, hoping to cash in. 'They don’t need to recreate the wheel, [but they] need strong leadership with a determined focus,' the source added, referring to the DoD.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/exclusive-hegseth-draft-memo-lays-out-software-acquisition-reform-push/	2025-02-25T12:41:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8855959-e1740511956929.jpg
Nominee for Pentagon No. 2: ‘Plug’ shortages, kill legacy programs to ‘defeat’ China	Nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen A. Feinberg listens to the opening remarks of a Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C., Feb. 25, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 job indicated his willingness to chop legacy programs and called for the department to more closely align itself with the private sector during his confirmation hearing today. If confirmed as deputy defense secretary, billionaire investor Stephen Feinberg said he would bring his private equity chops to work at the Pentagon, driving greater efficiency and financial accountability, improving the defense acquisition process by increasing competition, and working to ensure the US military has the cutting edge technology it needs. He listed shipbuilding, aircraft development, nuclear modernization, cyber defense, hypersonics, counterspace capabilities and counter-drone platforms as key technology 'shortages' needed to beat China, which he called the biggest and most challenging threat the United States. 'China is the first nation we’ve ever competed with that has both a great economy and a great military. China’s entire private sector is fully committed in supporting that military development and as such, they effectively have unlimited funding,' he said during his opening comments in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'Not meaning to be too negative, but we really need to plug these shortages, focus on our priorities, get rid of legacy programs, be very disciplined, and while at the same time focusing on the economics.' 'If we do that, given America’s great innovative capability and entrepreneurship, we will defeat China,' he said. Feinberg is the co-founder and CEO of Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm whose holdings have included defense companies such as hypersonic testing firm Stratolaunch and which has a 70 percent stake in tactical wheeled vehicle maker Navistar Defense, according to Cerberus's website and news reports. Feinberg has not previously held a position in government, but during Trump's last administration he headed the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives private citizens access to classified information so they can assess how the Intelligence Community goes about its normally cloistered business. Trump tapped Feinberg for the deputy defense secretary job in late December, calling him 'an extremely successful businessman.' Typically, the deputy is a largely managerial position, overseeing matters related to the Pentagon’s budget, workforce and its overall bureaucracy — thus leaving the defense secretary free to focus on overarching strategy, policy and political matters. 'There is great opportunity to improve our cost structure, our efficiency, our operations, to really save a lot of money that could be plowed into mission. We do not have great financial accountability, financial metrics or systems — [there's an] awful lot of low hanging fruit there,' Feinberg said. 'This is in my wheelhouse, hopefully. I spent a career helping organizations improve and after doing it so many years, I certainly made sincere mistakes, but … I think I can add some value there.' The Pentagon could improve its supply chain by 'working more closely with our private sector,' specifically by better understanding what drives their leadership boards or how they respond to shareholder pressure, Feinberg said. At a different point in the hearing, he said that the current acquisition system favors legacy defense contractors by incorporating 'gold-plated' technical requirements and rigid regulations that holds commercial companies and nontraditional vendors back. '[There’s] a lot we can do by getting into the program detail, line by line. My view is the deputy has to go program by program, line by line, not hand it off to somebody,' he said. Throughout the hearing, Democrats interrogated Feinberg about a recently announced 8 percent spending cut — which Feinberg said would be reinvested inside the Pentagon to fund top spending priorities — as well as plans to the reduce Pentagon’s workforce by at least 5 to 8 percent. 'Over the weekend, [Defense] Secretary [Pete Hegseth] announced that 5,400 probationary employees would be dismissed, and it apparently was not done with any analysis, it was just preemptive,' said Sen. Jack Reed, the committee’s top Democrat. 'You run companies. Have you ever walked in and fired thousands of people without any analysis for the costs or benefits?' To this question, and other similar ones from other lawmakers, Feinberg stated that layoffs were necessary when restructuring an organization to become more effective. 'Every person is significant, and these cuts are always hard. But I believe that most of the cuts that we will see will be from people that want to retire, people who would like to resign early,' he said. 'There’s obviously over 900,000 civilians in the in DoD so while you can never, you know, not take one person seriously in these kinds of reorganizations, there's always turnover. And without some turnover, you can't become an efficient organization.' Feinberg offered few specifics about any plans for individual weapons programs. After Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., pressed the nominee on whether the nuclear deterrent was the Defense Department’s 'highest priority mission,' Feinberg offered that 'it might be,' but added that he wanted to receive classified briefings before answering that more directly. He later said that 'there's nothing that could be more important than our nuclear modernization,' but noted that 'we also need hypersonics.' And when about whether the US Air Force needs a sixth-generation fighter by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Feinberg said it was a 'controversial issue' and that he would offer his best advice to Hegseth — or even Trump, should the president get involved in the potential acquisition. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., laid out concerns about Feinberg’s business dealings and financial interests in a 23-page letter sent on Feb. 17, which stated that his Cerberus holdings could pose a conflict of interest if not properly divested. (Warren did not ask Feinberg about this issue during the nomination hearing, instead pressing him on Cerberus’s ownership of several hospitals in her home state.) 'I have serious concerns about your qualifications and ability to take on the responsibilities of the role. You have serious conflicts of interest, with holdings in seven companies that do nearly $16 billion in business with the Defense Department,' she wrote in the letter. 'As the Deputy Secretary of Defense, you will have to look out for what is best for the Department and the nation, not private backers, shareholders, or companies in your portfolio,' Warren said later in the letter. In ethics documents submitted on Feb. 18, Feinberg said he would 'divest all of my interests in Cerberus including, but not limited to, my equity interest, carried interest, incentive fees/allocations, and capital commitments' prior to assuming the role of the deputy secretary of defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/nominee-for-pentagon-no-2-plug-shortages-kill-legacy-programs-to-defeat-china/	2025-02-25T11:23:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250225_feinberg_testimony_8885249-scaled-e1740510119294.jpg

Senate approves Daniel Driscoll as 26th Army secretary	Daniel Driscoll, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee to be secretary of the U.S. Army, speaks during a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Driscoll was questioned on a range of topics including Army retention rate. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The US Army is poised to get a new civilian leader after the Senate today approved Daniel Driscoll as the service’s 26th secretary. Confirmed on a 66-28 vote, Driscoll’s nomination was publicly viewed as less controversial than others put forward by President Donald Trump. It wasn’t immediately clear today when Driscoll would be sworn into office and officially take over the role as Army secretary. He will be greeted, though, with a service in the throes of modernizing its weapon portfolio, ramping up the defense industrial base and grappling with recruiting. The entire Pentagon is also working through a variety of changes and exercises ranging from each service identifying 8 percent of planned fiscal 2026 funding that can be redirected for other priorities to looming civilian cuts. Driscoll — relatively unknown before his nomination, with a limited social media presence — previously served as an advisor to now-Vice President JD Vance, is a graduate of Yale Law School, a former Army soldier, and has spent time working in the private equity arena. During his Senate Armed Services Committee hearing late last month, he seemingly garnered support from both sides of the aisle. In a bit of a rarity for Washington, he received a bipartisan show of support with Sens Markwayne Mullen, R-Okla., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both introducing him to the panel during the start of the hearing. 'I spoke to Dan a number of times in the course of his preparing for his appearance here today, and those conversations convinced me that he is willing to work on the basis of collegiality, to be transparent and open with this panel with the Congress and our colleagues,' Blumenthal said during his introduction. Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI., the committee's top Democrat, also seemingly threw his support behind Driscoll, saying he brings 'integrity, intelligence and the experience of the young officer leading soldiers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/senate-approves-daniel-driscoll-as-26th-army-secretary/	2025-02-25T10:02:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/daniel-driscoll-scaled-e1740506487433.jpg
President Trump must use every tool to speed up arms for Israel	Maj. Allyn Swavely, a participant in the Senior Officer Orientation course, helps guide the body of a MK-84 onto the Munitions Assembly Conveyor at Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 30, 2017. Bombs built by munitions Airmen can range in weight up to approximately 2,000 lbs and have multiple configurations depending on operational demands. (U.S. Air Force photo/Senior Airman Justin Parsons) A shipment of 1,800 MK-84 2,000-pound bombs arrived in Israel on Feb. 16, several weeks after President Donald Trump announced the end of a months-long freeze of critical US weapons deliveries to Israel. But there are still more weapons that Israel needs stuck in US bureaucratic processes. To fulfill his promise that these weapons 'are now on their way,' Trump should use his emergency authority to push past remaining roadblocks. Despite Trump removing the Biden administration’s ban on delivering MK-84 bombs, numerous other transfers remain stuck, including MK-83 1,000-pound bombs, MK-82 500-pound bombs, Hellfire missiles, and tank and mortar shells. JINSA’s Mike Makovsky and Blaise Misztal revealed in November that the Biden administration had been slow walking these weapons, as well as armored bulldozers that the Trump administration has now started to deliver. Such hindrances in arms deliveries, whatever their cause, only increase risk to Israel, the Middle East, and the United States. Now, with Iran accelerating its nuclear program and its proxies threatening to abandon the fragile ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza, Tehran could see any further delays as opportunities to exploit. Conversely, rapidly arming Israel, by both providing vital capabilities and signaling US commitment, is critical to deterring and defeating Iran-backed aggression. Yet, beyond delays within the Biden administration, Congress has also put up roadblocks. In January, President Joe Biden alerted Congress that he planned to send $8 billion of weapons to Israel, including Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Guidance Kits, 500-pound bombs, AMRAAM and Hellfire missiles, and 155mm artillery rounds. However, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), the ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, put a hold on packages. His hold could have held up the weapons indefinitely because of the specific process the Biden administration used to notify Congress about the sale. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires the State Department to publicly notify the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee before selling weapons to a foreign partner, at least 30 days for most countries or 15 days for close partners like Israel. But there is also another, informal process known as 'tiered review' that the State Department has been using since 2012. Under tiered review, State alerts the relevant committees that it plans to submit formal notification of a weapons sale within 40 days. It then waits to receive approval from all four of the committee leaders before actually making the notification. By withholding his approval, Meeks effectively put a hold on Biden’s January arm package, just as he had with other, similar shipments, some dating back to October of last year. While there is no legal requirement to honor such holds, the State Department usually does and did so in this case. To rectify this situation, the Trump administration notified Congress on February 7 that it will skip tiered review for new packages — avoiding any further holds — that advance $8.4 billion of weapons for Israel to formal review, starting the clock for Congress to take action. As part of the overall sale, the State Department approved a $6.75 billion foreign military sale (FMS) deal for thousands of SDBs, MK-82s, JDAMs, and fuzes. A separate FMS covers an estimated $660 million of Hellfire Missiles. In addition, the Pentagon announced a direct commercial sale of artillery shells. If legislators want to prevent these sales, they will have to pass a resolution blocking them. No such efforts have ever succeeded. A resolution from Rep. Meeks in January 2021 sought to block the transfer of SDBs to Saudi Arabia, and the Senate overwhelmingly rejected resolutions from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in November 2024 that tried to block selling tank and mortar rounds and JDAM kits to Israel. There is an even faster way to move weapons to countries that urgently need them, as Israel currently does. The AECA also allows the president to waive the notification period if he verifies that 'an emergency exists,' allowing the immediate delivery of the weapons. Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump, have used this authority. In May 2019, the Trump administration invoked the waiver to push through 22 pending arms transfers to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The Biden administration used waivers to send weapons quickly to Ukraine in April 2022, in April and May 2024, and to sell Israel artillery rounds and other equipment in December 2023. Israel is still waiting on multiple weapons, not just 2,000-pound bombs, delayed by the Biden administration. Trump should force his State and Defense departments to advance any remaining stuck items and submit an emergency waiver to immediately deliver backlogged weapons to Israel. After months of delays, the United States should provide Israel with the weapons it needs as soon as possible. Blaise Misztal and Ari Cicurel are the vice president for policy and associate director of foreign policy, respectively, at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA).	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/president-trump-must-use-every-tool-to-speed-up-arms-for-israel/	2025-02-25T09:51:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/3797111-scaled-e1740426693313.jpg
Russian ‘menace’ prompts UK defense spending uplift to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027	F-35B fighter jets from the UK Carrier Strike Group launch from the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier to undertake sorties under NATO command in the Atlantic (UK MoD) BELFAST — In a bid to counter Russia’s 'menace,' UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced today that British defense spending will be increased to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027. Addressing lawmakers, Starmer also pledged to raise the bar further by committing to a 3 percent GDP target by 2034. Britain currently spends around 2.3 percent GDP on its military. The new spending plan, funded by foreign aid cuts, marks the 'biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War,' according to Starmer. In simple terms, London will spend an additional £13.4 billon ($17 billion) annually on defense from 2027. At a strategic level, Starmer said that 'we must stand with Ukraine' because if a 'lasting peace' is not secured, then economic problems and security threats 'will only grow.' He was also clear eyed about Russia's continued threat. 'Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets,' Starmer commented. 'They have launched cyberattacks on our NHS [National Health Service]. Only seven years ago, [carried out] a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury [England].' Though he did not share how the new funding will be spent, the announcement comes just days before Starmer visits US President Donald Trump in Washington, and appears to be carefully timed to demonstrate the UK is leaning forward to meet Trump’s demand that Europe does more to protect its own security. Starmer had long planned to put forward a 'path' to spending 2.5 percent GDP on defense in the spring. The UK is the third European country to announce new modernization or spending increases, behind France and Denmark, since Trump pivoted toward Russia by labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator' and forecasting that 'he is not going to have a country left.' Amid transatlantic security relations plagued by disharmony, Starmer pleaded for differences to be set aside. 'We must reject any false choice between our allies, between one side of the Atlantic or the other,' he said. 'That is against our history, country and party, because it’s against our national interest. The US is our most important bilateral alliance. It straddles everything from nuclear technology to NATO to Five Eyes [intelligence sharing pact] AUKUS and beyond.' Such a resounding endorsement of the so-called UK-US 'special relationship' differs, however, with a political reality that has seen Washington exclude Europe and Ukraine from peace talks with Russia. At odds with the US position on peace negotiations, Starmer said 'we must ensure' Ukraine negotiates 'their future.' Other issues between the UK and the US remain outstanding. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said last week that a security 'backstop' linked to a peace settlement is required because 'only the US' is capable enough of stopping Russia from launching another attack on Europe. Starmer is expected to raise the backstop idea with Trump directly this week. The British leader has also said he is prepared to deploy UK troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force, should a peace agreement be struck. 'This week, when I meet President Trump, I will be clear I want this relationship to go from strength to strength, but … strength in this world also depends on a new alliance with Europe,' said Starmer. He added that European nations will 'find new ways to work together on our collective interests and threats, protecting our borders, bringing out companies together, seeking out new opportunities for growth.' Echoing Trump's messaging, Starmer said, 'European allies must step up and do more for our own defense.' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, a UK aerospace and defense trade body that represents over 1,400 prime manufacturers, subsystem suppliers and small- and medium-sized enterprises, told Breaking Defense in a statement that the 2.5 percent spending announcement 'does deliver on the long-term demand indication that allows us to do what we do best: deliver capabilities that are needed to uphold our security, in a way that delivers value for money to the citizens we are here to protect. This clear signal from Government today is very welcome.'

Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Space Force has set up a 'technical integrated planning team,' or IPT, to put together a picture of its current and potential future contributions to the Trump administration's Iron Dome for America missile shield, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said today. 'I think we have a central role to play,' he told a small group of reporters. 'We are leaning forward establishing this technical IPT to try to pull together all of the systems and start thinking about it from an overarching perspective.' The Space Force already is responsible for missile warning and tracking, currently operating the Space Based Infrared System satellites, and developing their replacements under the multibillion-dollar Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) program. The service also has two new programs aimed specifically at tracking hypersonic missiles underway: the Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking — Medium Earth Orbit program being managed by Space Systems Command and the Space Development Agency's Tracking Layer constellation that is part of its overarching Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). Pursuit of the PWSA is specifically called for in President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 executive order laying out his priorities for the Iron Dome for America concept. Pentagon development and deployment of 'proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept' also is mandated in Trump's executive order. That, however, has not been something on the Space Force's agenda until now. The order gave Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth 60 days to develop the plan to defend the homeland against 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-team-mapping-services-contributions-to-iron-dome-missile-shield/	2025-02-24T14:53:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240717_DVIDS_saltzman_speech_8238081-scaled-e1721238990255.jpg
Leonardo DRS to expand new sub facility with $45M investment from HII	USS Greeneville (SSN 772) enters Diego Garcia’s harbor Aug. 21, 2020. (US Navy Photos by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Michael T. Porterfield.) WASHINGTON — Leonardo DRS plans to expand its new South Carolina naval propulsion manufacturing facility through a $45 million infusion from HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding, Leonardo announced today. 'The investment is expected to expand the capabilities of DRS’s new, 140,000 square-foot naval propulsion manufacturing facility currently under-construction in Goose Creek, SC, and includes capital equipment and other infrastructure enhancements,' according to a company statement. 'The $45 million [submarine industrial base] investment will serve as a catalyst for a 40,000 square-foot expansion of the facility in support of capabilities critical to current and future U.S. Navy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.' The facility in Goose Creek, S.C., is also proximal to W International, a metal fabricator which was recently acquired by HII to bolster its own submarine manufacturing space. HII is one of two prime contractors for the US Navy’s submarine programs. 'This significant investment is the result of extensive collaboration between Leonardo DRS, the U.S. Navy, and our shipbuilding customers,' said Jon Miller, senior vice president and general manager of the Leonardo DRS Naval Power Systems. 'It signifies the depth of our combined resolve to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation’s submarine industrial base with respect to capacity needed to deliver critical capability on-time and on-budget for the warfighter.' Leonardo’s new facility is slated to open in 2026. The company is currently producing Columbia-class electric propulsion system components, including the main propulsion motor, the main propulsion drives and main propulsion controller. Separately, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems announced today that General Dynamics Electric Boat, the Navy’s other submarine prime contractor, awarded it a contract to fabricate and deliver three shipsets of Virginia Payload Tubes for Block VI submarines. GA-EMS is scheduled to deliver the shipsets, each of which include two payload tubes, by the end of 2030. 'This contract follows a 2023 contract award for a single VPT shipset that qualified GA-EMS as a viable supplier with proven manufacturing capability to fabricate and deliver complex, safety-critical components for use on Navy submarines,' said Scott Forney, president of GA-EMS. 'We are excited to continue working with Electric Boat to apply our world-class fabrication and precision machining capabilities, experienced program management, and engineering and quality assurance expertise to help ensure the VPTs are available on time to support an aggressive Virginia-class build schedule.' A company statement did not disclose a dollar amount associated with the deal.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/leonardo-drs-to-expand-new-sub-facility-with-45m-investment-from-hii/	2025-02-24T13:00:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/6327059-Virginia-class-sub-scaled-e1631834346549.jpg
UAE’s defense giant EDGE Group inks $2.9B in deals at IDEX 2025	Emirate conglomerate EDGE Group had perhaps the largest exhibit of any company at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group wrapped up an Abu Dhabi defense expo with just under $3 billion in new deals, most signed with the United Arab Emirates. The firm said in a statement on Friday that it signed 16 contracts, launched 46 'solutions,' and inked 32 strategic international agreements at this edition of International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) 2025. Among the largest contracts, at $1.2 billion, was with the UAE's Ministry of Defense for aerial munitions. Another deal, worth $524 million, was signed between the UAE's navy and EDGE subsidiary Maestral for in service support. 'This has been a very busy week for EDGE, and the support of our main customer and solid commitments and interest from international customers and partners, highlights the tremendous success we continue to enjoy,' said Hamad Al Marar, EDGE Group Managing Director and CEO, in the statement. He added that the firm looks forward to the next edition of IDEX in 2027, 'where I am confident EDGE will once again surprise the industry with the huge achievements few considered possible five years ago' when EDGE was founded. During the show, EDGE displayed dozens of platforms in an expansive, central exhibit, from large armored vehicles to UAVs to unmanned ground vehicles, to aerial munitions and small arms. 'While EDGE signed business partnerships to consolidate domestic industrial capabilities in the naval, land, and air sectors, the largest volume of deals revolved around the automation domain,' Leonardo Jacopo Maria Mazzucco, an analyst at Gulf State Analytics, told Breaking Defense. For instance, EDGE has launched new armored and robotic vehicle at the show dubbed HAVOC RCV and also has signed a contract to integrate MILSAR radars from Turkish Meteksan Defence on its unmanned aerial system Garmoosha. The firm has also teamed up with US-based GM Defense and integrated its drone launcher on GM Defense's light tactical vehicle. American contractor GM Defense and Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group have announced a new agreement to explore 'light tactical vehicle'-focused projects, in a move that came as the two firms put on display what one such team-up could look like: a G ride boasting an EDGE drone launcher. He added that 'the significant number of agreements signed by EDGE with international weapon manufacturers speaks volumes about the Emirati company’s 360-degree business expansion strategy, securing a strong foothold in the West and Asian defense markets alike.' EDGE Group signed a large number of agreements to codevelop defense platforms including among others, a memorandum of understanding with Turkish FNSS to update UAE’s armed forces infantry fighting vehicles, a strategic partnership with German HENSOLDT to cooperate in naval technologies and with Brazilian SIATT to supply Brazilian Navy with MANSUP anti-ship missiles. 'For EDGE, the rapid operationalization of business partnerships is vital to the company’s quest to build human capital, strengthen domestic know-how, and generate revenues from sales,' Mazzucco said. ​In his opinion Albert Vidal, a research analyst for the London-based thinktank IISS, said that what really deserves attention are 'the products that EDGE unveiled, the partnerships announced, and the display of the work done by Advanced Concepts, the Electro-Optics Center of Excellence, and the Radar &amp; EW center.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/uaes-defense-giant-edge-group-inks-2-9b-in-deals-at-idex-2025/	2025-02-24T11:11:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/img_5477-scaled-e1739816889511.jpg
France accelerates rearmament plan, eyes more Rafale fighters and frigates	A French Air Force Rafale F3R fighter jet on display at the Dubai Airshow 2023 (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — France's defense minister has called for Europe to 'accelerate our rearmament,' and Paris is speeding in that direction with new plans to acquire up to 30 additional Rafale fighter jets, three more frigates, and more drone and electronic warfare (EW) platforms. Through a series of posts on X, published Sunday alongside an interview with Le Parisien, Lecornu said the rearmament push was driven by a need to defend French and Ukrainian 'collective security.' The French action arrives amid a decisive shift in US foreign policy that demands Europe takes more ownership for its defense and has witnessed a firm pivot toward Russia, led by President Donald Trump. France is the second country on the continent, behind Denmark, to signal a renewed focus on modernization in the wake of Trump labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator.' Lecornu did not mention the US or the Trump administration’s stance on European security relations or war in Ukraine specifically but vowed that French military manufacturers 'must join forces with Ukrainian companies to produce locally and massively what the Ukrainians will need.' Strengthening such industrial co-operation is in France’s economic interest, added Lecornu. The move also comes as French President Emmanuel Macron held a meeting with Trump in Washington today, which including participating in a G7 call from the Oval Office. Ahead of the trip Macron said that he would explain to Trump that a Russian victory over Ukraine would be 'a huge strategic mistake,' according to Politico. For three years, Ukraine has been fighting with admirable courage against an aggressor—Russia. For sovereignty and freedom. Our support for Ukraine will remain unwavering. I am in Washington to reaffirm this and to move forward with President @realDonaldTrump and our allies. pic.twitter.com/ZUehOczJhM &mdash; Emmanuel Macron (@EmmanuelMacron) February 24, 2025 In lieu of France facing 'threats over time and in potentially multiple theatres' Lecornu disclosed that Paris intends on acquiring between 20 to 30 additional Dassault Rafale fourth generation fighter jets, raising its frigate fleet from 15 to 18 ships and vowed to speed up the pace of drone and EW procurements. He did not share the exact type of aircraft or electronic systems in question or any costs involved. As Breaking Defense previously reported, France has placed an order for 42 Rafale aircraft, under a tranche five procurement plan, in a deal worth over €5 billion ($5.5 billion) that will see deliveries run between 2027 to 2032. In all, it has ordered 234 of the twin-engine platforms. In terms of maritime modernization, the French Navy already expects five Naval Group made FDI frigates to enter service by 2030. The first-in-class Amiral Ronarc'h is set for delivery this year, according to the shipbuilder. Financing of the new rearmament plan will depend on 'political and budgetary choices' with a war finance meeting, led by Lecornu and Eric Lombard, France’s economy minister, scheduled to take place on March 20. Industry and private investors will also participate in the event. Looking at new ways of raising funding for rearmament, Lecornu said that, 'we are also considering offering French people who wish to do so the opportunity to mobilize their savings to support the national effort.' He did not elaborate on how such a scheme would work but it could amount to a type of defense bonds initiative.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/france-accelerates-rearmament-plan-eyes-more-rafale-fighters-and-frigates/	2025-02-24T09:16:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/French-Air-Force-Rafale-F3R-fighter-jet-e1699908112769.jpg
New plug-and-play AI can protect pilots of non-stealth planes: Raytheon	Raytheon's AI-enhanced Radar Warning Receiver was flight-tested on an Air National Guard F-16 fighter, similar to this Arizona Air Guard jet. (Air Force file photo) WASHINGTON — One of the largest defense companies on the planet just unveiled a small upgrade that could make a big difference in the survival rates of US aircrews. And by deploying an AI device powerful enough to be militarily useful, yet small enough to be retrofitted on a fighter jet, Raytheon’s new Cognitive Algorithm Deployment System (CADS) is a major step towards a long-sought holy grail of 'cognitive electronic warfare.' The problem CADS helps to solve is a growing one: Adversaries like Russia increasingly employ — and export — reprogrammable digital radars that can rapidly reconfigure the signals they use to locate, track and shoot down airplanes. Those rapid changes, in turn, can confound Western radar-warning systems, which work by comparing each signal they pick up to a pre-loaded database of known threats. Raytheon is fighting back by upgrading its warning systems with AI, allowing them to analyze and identify the danger in real time — and, with a little luck, alert the pilot before it’s too late to evade. By exploiting ever-more miniaturized hardware and streamlined software, Raytheon’s CADS can run radar-analyzing algorithms on an electronics module compact enough to slot into the company’s existing ALR-69A Radar Warning Receiver (RWR). Over 600 of those RWRs are already widely used on older, legacy aircraft in both US and foreign service, ranging from the C-130 turboprop transport to the massive KC-46 tanker to the F-16 jet fighter. Such fourth-generation planes lack the stealth, sensors, and computing power of the fifth-generation F-35. (The full electronic-warfare capabilities of the F-35 are highly classified and subject to much speculation). So adding CADS could be an easy defensive upgrade to an increasingly vulnerable fourth-gen fleet. 'It’s a digital RWR that’s very flexible,' said Michael Baladjanian, Raytheon’s vice president of electronic warfare systems. 'It can go on any kind of F-16,' he said, for example, or any number of other aircraft. Specifically, the ALR-69A consists of four sensors installed around the aircraft being protected — the exact configuration depends on the type of plane — and a central processor housed in the fuselage. That processor is built with space for future upgrades, so Baladjanian’s team designed the CADS module to slot right in, without any modifications required to the ALR-69A itself. 'I didn’t have to redesign the actual 69A,' he said. 'I just had to put the card in.' It’s also easy to upgrade the CADS module itself, Baladjanian continued: 'The really cool part about it, is it's able to hold third-party apps.' That’s because CADS is built using an 'open architecture' meant to accommodate new software packages from different vendors, not just Raytheon, as long as they comply with certain technical standards. (The details of those standards, unlike on most 'open source' projects, are classified). Raytheon and the Air National Guard have already flight-tested an ALR-69A upgraded with CADS running three different radar-analyzing algorithms, he said. One was developed by Raytheon, albeit a different division from Baladjanian’s; one came from Georgia Tech, a frequent partner of the Pentagon; and a third came from a small firm called Vadum (a spinoff from the University of North Carolina). 'We were able to very easily take all three algorithms and … integrate them in our lab, in less than a day,' Baladjanian said. Then Raytheon flew the CADS ALR-69A on its own test aircraft, followed by a flight on an Air Guard F-16. 'Flight testing will continue through this year,' he added. The company and the Air Force are still negotiating any purchase of CADS, so it’s too early to know numbers, pricing, or schedule, especially with the Pentagon budget facing uncertainty. But Baladjanian already has his eye on further advances. Adding more and better algorithms to the CADS digital toolkit is the obvious first step, he told Breaking Defense. But in the not-too-distant future, he envisions expanding the AI’s capabilities from passively identifying radar signals to actively countering them. He’s 'looking at electronic attack,' he said. Such AI-controlled jamming is something technologists and tacticians have sought for years. Known in the trade as cognitive electronic warfare, it’s seen as a way to untether EW from slow-moving, ground-based analysis. In the traditional process, intelligence centers issue a Mission Data File of known threats, which aircraft must load before taking off. Then, if they encounter an unfamiliar signal, they can only collect the data, not act on it; and on landing, they must send it off to the intel hub to analyze and come up with countermeasures — a process that takes hours, days, or even months. By contrast, an aircraft with onboard AI could analyze the unfamiliar signal in near-real-time and generate custom countermeasures in mid-flight. What Raytheon’s rolling out is not that complete capability, not yet. But it’s a big step towards it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/new-plug-and-play-ai-can-protect-pilots-of-non-stealth-planes-raytheon/	2025-02-24T06:00:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AZ-ANG-F-16-080331-F-0000X-0005-scaled-e1740163594442.jpeg
With UAVs, air defenses and a full-sized, modified tank, Russian firms make splash inside IDEX 2025	A Russian tank on display at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Two years after being relegated to a separate pavilion at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi, Russian defense companies were back inside the conference center for this edition, where they took the opportunity to show off their wares — including several systems informed by their experience in the conflict in Ukraine. A full-sized main battle tank was on display, equipped with what appeared to be significant modifications like a metal cage, layers of chains, reinforced rubber shields and a green leather-like cover low on the tank intended to reduce the vehicle's heat and radar signature. 'This configuration of the T-90MS Main Battle Tank is the latest one. It features multiple protection against almost any threat, rocket propelled grenades, anti-tank guided missiles with high scores of anti-tank warheads, including those of tandem structure, unmanned aerial vehicles [and] first-person-view drones,' a RosoboronExport official told Breaking Defense at the show last week. The official declined to say whether that particular tank had participated in the battlefield in Ukraine, but said that it is fully operational. One of the reasons the government-owned organization decided to ship and display a tank of this size and other equipment at IDEX in Abu Dhabi, particularly, he said, was to 'demonstrate to the whole world the effectiveness and power of the Russian military hardware and the approaches of our experts.' At the last edition of IDEX, which took place in early 2023 and just a few months after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Russian companies were not listed as official exhibitors. Instead they were grouped together in an outdoor pavilion — one that happened to be just yards away from a US Army tent. This year several Ukrainian defense firms were also present at IDEX, all just steps away from Russian firms. (Ukrainian industry officials at the show were not immediately available for comment at IDEX; Breaking Defense has requested follow-up interviews.) RELATED: Russians playing with Javelins: US Army, Russia display weapons yard apart in the desert Such is the nature of international defense shows in general, but the welcoming back of the Russian firms inside IDEX this year coincided with Gulf nations playing a key neutral, diplomatic role on the world stage as well. While IDEX was going on, Saudi Arabia hosted talks between the US and Russia concerning the fate of the war in Ukraine, and the United Arab Emirates hosted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Elsewhere in the Russian floor space Kalashnikov displayed its Kub-10E loitering munition on its stand, just next to High Precision Complexes Holding's Pantsir-SMD-E air defense system, which itself sat next to other launchers. Unmanned Systems Group displayed its 'combat-tested' Supercam S350 UAV with Vertical Take-off and Landing capabilities. Another Russian firm, The Ural Works of Civil Aviation, debuted internationally the export version of what it also called its 'combat tested' Forpost UAV, according to the firm’s statement. That so many Russian firms attended IDEX is no surprise, as Middle East and African nations account for fully half of RosobornExport's orders, according to a TASS report. 'We implement and discuss with partners projects on cooperation in the area of arms and military equipment for all types of armed forces,' TASS reported CEO Alexander Mikheyev as saying.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/with-uavs-air-defenses-and-a-full-sized-modified-tank-russian-firms-make-splash-inside-idex-2025/	2025-02-24T04:44:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250220_IDEX_russia_tank-scaled-e1740138645759.jpg
Hegseth fires Navy top officer, Air Force No. 2	Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti participates in a wreath laying ceremony at the Anitkabir &#8211; Atatürk Mausoleum, in Ankara, Türkiye, June 3, 2024. During Franchetti’s visit, she met with Turkish military and government leaders, where she emphasized the value of strong partnership and collaboration between the two navies. (U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist Amanda Gray) WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth today announced he was removing Adm. Lisa Franchetti as the chief of naval operations, unceremoniously ending early the tenure of the first woman to become a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In addition, Hegseth said he would be replacing Gen. James Slife, the Air Force's No. 2 officer, as well as replacing the top Judge Advocate General for the Army, Air Force and Navy. 'I am also requesting nominations for the positions of Chief of Naval Operations and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff. The incumbents in these important roles, Admiral Lisa Franchetti and General James Slife, respectively, have had distinguished careers,' Hegseth said in a Friday statement. 'We thank them for their service and dedication to our country.' 'We are also requesting nominations for the Judge Advocates General for the Army, Navy and Air Force,' Hegseth added. Trump and his supporters, including Hegseth, have repeatedly talked about ridding the military of general officers they deem as 'woke.' Franchetti’s firing follows that of Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, who Trump removed as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff minutes before Hegseth's announcement. RELATED: Trump fires CQ Brown, nominates retired Air Force 3-star as replacement In January, the administration removed former Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan within hours of taking power, citing her focus on DEI, among other things. Vice Chief Adm. Kevin Lunday is serving as the interim commandant. Tonight's announcement marks the early end of the first woman to serve as a service chief. Franchetti, a career surface warfare officer, first ascended to the ranks of the top Pentagon brass in April 2022 when she was tapped to be the Navy’s second-most senior officer, the vice chief of naval operations. She held that post until August 2023 when then Adm. Michael Gilday finished his own tenure as CNO and she subsequently became the service’s top officer. Franchetti was only the second woman to become VCNO, following behind now-retired Adm. Michelle Howard, and subsequently became the first woman to be a member of the joint chiefs. (Adm. Linda Fagan, commandant of the Coast Guard, became the first woman to lead a branch of the military in June 2022, but that service operates under the Department of Homeland Security rather than the Defense Department.) When a service chief is removed or unable to do their job, the current vice automatically takes over in the interim, meaning Franchetti’s removal puts VCNO Adm. Jim Kilby in command of the service until a new top Navy officer is nominated and confirmed. The lack of a service chief also puts a strain both on the vice chief and officers down the chain of command, as was on display in 2023 when Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville blockaded the promotions of hundreds of military officers, including top brass. Slife was tapped for his current role in September 2023, though the nomination was caught up in Tuberville's hold. He was eventually confirmed by the Senate and pinned on his fourth star in December of that year. The ousted general is a special operations pilot by craft. Amassing over 3,100 hours flying aircraft like the legacy MH-53 Pave Low as well as the MQ-1 Predator, he achieved the rating of command pilot, according to his service biography. He earned his commission as an Air Force officer through ROTC at Auburn University in 1989. Slife previously led Air Force Special Operations Command for over three years. He was elevated to his current role after Gen. David Allvin, who has been the service number two, was named Chief of Staff.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-franchetti-slife-fired-brown-hegseth-woke/	2025-02-21T17:24:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8446820-scaled-e1726655704624.jpg
Trump fires CQ Brown, nominates retired Air Force 3-star as replacement	Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr., addresses the audience during the Brig. Gen. Charles E. McGee Leadership Award ceremony at the Samuel Riggs IV Alumni Center, University of Maryland, College Park, Md., Jan 27, 2023. (US Air Force/Andy Morataya) WASHINGTON — After four decades in uniform, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown was unceremoniously ushered from his post nearly two-and-a-half years early tonight via a social media message by President Donald Trump. His unprecedented replacement: John Caine, a retired three-star Air Force officer. 'I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country, including as our current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,' Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. 'He is a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader, and I wish a great future for him and his family.' It was not immediately clear if Brown was fired effective immediately, and if so, if Adm. Christopher Grady, the vice chairman, is now serving as the country’s top officer. In a separate statement, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth also announced that he was seeking nominations to replace Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff Gen. James Slife. It was not immediately clear if those two had been removed from their positions. RELATED: Hegseth fires Navy top officer, Air Force No. 2 Trump and Hegseth have been on a quest to rid the military of 'woke' generals supporting diversity and those who carried out orders related to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan. And while Brown was not serving as President Joe Biden’s chief military adviser during the US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Trump supporters have repeatedly invoked his name when talking about 'woke generals.' 'First of all, you got to fire the chairman [of the] Joint Chiefs, and … obviously you’re going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense. But, any general that was involved — general, admiral, whatever — … in any of the DEI woke shit has got to go,' Hegseth said in an episode of the Shawn Ryan Show podcast just days before Trump named him to lead the Pentagon. 'Either you’re in for warfighting, and that’s it, that’s the only litmus test we care about.' However, Brown was not the first up on the chopping block. On inauguration night, Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan became the first service leader to be terminated. (The Coast Guard is under the Department of Homeland Security.) Brown instead continued on in his role, even greeting Hegseth outside the Pentagon on his first official day as the new secretary. When a reporter asked Hegseth if he would fire the four-star general, he patted Brown on the shoulder and said, 'I'm standing with him right now. I look forward to working with him.' More chaos and distinction from Trump on national security. Firing CQ Brown as joint chiefs chair is completely unjustified. Smart, competent leader to be replaced by a retired 3 star? More weakening of America. Putin just keeps smiling. &mdash; Rep. Adam Smith (@RepAdamSmith) February 22, 2025 While Brown has been long rumored to be in the crosshairs of the new administration, that wasn't the case during Trump's first tour at the White House. After graduating from the ROTC program at Texas Tech University in 1984, Brown was commissioned into the Air Force. He spent his tenure as a fighter pilot, commander of the 31st Fighter Wing, Central Command’s deputy commander and head of US Air Forces in the Pacific (PACAF). Trump later tapped the general to serve as the Air Force’s 22nd Chief of Staff, the first Black man to serve in the post. By October 2020, when Trump administered Brown's oath of office, the country was in a period of civil unrest after police officers killed George Floyd. The four-star general had spoken out about the incident, saying his own experience 'didn't always sing of liberty and equality.' Then after three years serving as the top-ranking uniformed Air Force official, Brown was sworn in as the 21st chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under the Biden administration — normally a four-year posting expected to run through October 2027. As to Brown’s replacement: Caine retired in 2024, according to his Air Force bio. However, he appears to have made quite an impression on Trump over the years, with the president having talked him up several times to crowds. 'Despite being highly qualified and respected to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the previous administration, General Caine was passed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden. But not anymore!' Trump stated in his Truth Social post. According to a February 2024 report from the Washington Examiner, Trump talked about how Caine told him that he could defeat ISIS in four weeks if given the power to do so, and then claimed that the officer donned a MAGA hat, despite such outward displays of politics not being allowed by the military — a story that, if true, will set off alarm bells for those who are worried about the politicization of the military. It’s unclear exactly what mechanism would allow Caine to take the role. One potential route would be for Trump to recall the retired officer to active duty, and then nominate him for the Chairman’s job, which requires a full Senate confirmation. This story may be updated with more information.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-fires-cq-brown-nominates-retired-air-force-3-star-as-replacement/	2025-02-21T16:53:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/CQ-brown-photo-e1696005207753.jpg
As DoD shifts $50B in spending, can an old playbook protect legacy programs?	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth hosts a bilateral exchange with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Feb. 5, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered the Pentagon to take a look at its fiscal 2026 budget plans and find 8 percent savings which can be realigned away from legacy efforts and towards new priorities. And that opens up two key questions: Can the services use an old playbook to pull an end around and save their programs, or will the Trump team be able to really break the mold? And with certain areas known to be protected, what pots of money might be on the cutting room floor? It’s hardly the first time a Pentagon leader has talked about a large-scale shift of funding towards more modern priorities. As Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a long-time DoD budget guru, put it: 'The Pentagon is used to budget drills like this.' Perhaps the best comparison to what Hegseth seems to be doing is former defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld’s push for 'transformation,' launched in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. As part of that effort, Rumsfeld wanted to see a shift from legacy programs towards newer capabilities, including drones, space systems, precision munitions and missile defense. Heavy armor, manned fighters and large surface vessels, Rumsfeld said, were outdated for the War on Terror age — criticisms and focus areas that match up with current comments from Hegseth and Elon Musk. The similarities to Hegseth's push are even more direct when looking at the industrial base. Per a Congressional Research Service report, 'Transformation could affect the defense industrial base by transferring funding from ‘legacy’ systems to transformational systems, and from traditional DOD contractors to firms that previously have not done much defense work.' But what happened, according to analysts, is that Pentagon planners were quick to shift how they described their programs, making sure their big, legacy items now fell under the 'transformation' rubric rather than seem outdated. As Roman Schwiezer, an analyst with TD Cowen, told Breaking Defense, 'I remember under Rumsfeld, everything from the F-22 to the USMC's new combat boot was called ‘transformational’ to try to protect it from cuts.' So with significant shifts seemingly planned between Hegseth’s memo and Musk’s desire to cut, should we expect to see Pentagon planners run the old playbook again? Brad Bowman, a senior director at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Breaking Defense that 'of course' the Pentagon moves money around to protect certain programs. He also said that given the nature of the current geostrategic environment combined with inadequate defense spending, 'I don’t blame them.' 'I’d recommend they do that. I’m just being blunt,' he said. 'Some programs are parochial and unneeded or unnecessary, redundant and should be killed, but many are necessary. … Now is the moment for increased defense spending, for increased defense industrial base production capacity, for stockpiling weapons and focusing on building combined combat readiness and deterrence.' Bowman added that while the services should not act deceptively or immorally, they should do what is necessary to defend programs and capabilities that 'make sure that our service members have what they need to do their missions be successful and come home to their families.' But John Ferrari, a retired Army one-star who did budgeting inside the building for years, isn’t so sure the old playbook will work the way it used to. 'I do think this is very different in feel from when Rumsfeld last did this and everything became transformation,' said Ferrari, now at the American Enterprise Institute. 'This team is looking at old defense companies and new defense companies very differently.' One thing that is certain: Everyone in the defense sector is waiting for the next shoe to drop. Hegseth’s memo called out 17 priority areas whose investments should not be cut — implying that those are areas that may also get plus-ups with the redirected funding. Those priorities were: Southwest Border Activities; Combating Transnational Criminal Organizations in the Western Hemisphere; Audit; Nuclear Modernization (including NC3); Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCAs); Virginia-class Submarines; Executable Surface Ships; Homeland Missile Defense; One-Way Attack/Autonomous Systems; Counter-small UAS Initiatives; Priority Critical Cybersecurity; Munitions; Core Readiness, including full DRT funding; Munitions and Energetics Organic Industrial Bases; Executable INDOPACOM MILCON; Combatant Command support agency funding for INDOPACOM, NORTHCOM, SPACECOM, STRATCOM, CYBERCOM, and TRANSCOM; and Medical Private-Sector Care. One key problem with shifting funds in accordance with Hegseth’s directive is that some programs can blur the lines between an exempt and non-exempt category. Homeland missile defense, for example, requires a 'layered system' that requires a plethora of sensors from the ground up to the air and then into space, along with different intercept capabilities such as fighter jets that can shoot down cruise missiles, said Doug Birkey, the Mitchell Institute’s executive director. And even exempt categories can require non-exempt linkages to function. Although the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft program is spared from losing funds, the concept relies on teaming with manned fighters. 'It’s ‘and,’ not an ‘or,’' Birkey said. 'I just caution about cherry picking certain things, because we need to look at the enterprise that gets the solution.' Given that list, what areas of the department might be in trouble? Ferrari says to first look at people. He noted that military pay (a number he puts at about $181 billion) was not listed as protected, which means a smaller force structure, with cuts likely coming from land forces seen as less helpful in a China conflict. Civilians will also likely take a big cut overall, with defense agencies in the 'fourth estate' — parts of DoD that don’t fall under one of the military departments — likely targets. That process got underway late Friday, with a statement from the Pentagon that it planned to cut 5-8 percent of its civilian workforce, with 'approximately 5,400 probationary workers' to be fired starting next week. A 2023 Government Accountability Office study put the DoD civilian force at around 700,000 people, so a 5-8 percent cut would involve anywhere from 35,000-56,000 firings.

Zachary Rufus) 'They have escaped serious reductions [in the past], this time feels different,' Ferrari said, predicting that groups like the Defense Finance Accounting Service (DFAS), Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), and Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) could be cut 'in half.' The fact that private sector medical care is protected, he noted, could also be a bad sign for Defense Health Program efforts. Services' contracts for IT and staff support, leased buildings, federally funded research and development centers and R&amp;D labs are also likely targets the planners could go after as they try to protect warfighting priorities, he said. And eventually, cuts will come for major programs. Ferrari predicts the F-35 (a favorite target of Musk), the Army’s Future Vertical Lift and Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, and some naval programs will be offered up as sacrifices. Those kinds of items are part of another Pentagon playbook: putting up cuts that will hurt jobs in Congressional districts in order to entice Congress to come protect them. However, the combination of Musk’s DOGE team, a secretary who has boasted about not having any ties to legacy contractors, and a president who has shown interest in weapon procurement in the past means that may backfire this time, said Harrison. 'If the services respond this time by proposing cuts to things that are politically unpalatable to ward off the reductions they may end up having to live with those cuts,' Harrison said. 'This administration has flipped the script on what is politically acceptable and how much risk it is willing to take.' On the flip side, what might do well? Jeff Rowlison, vice president for space and intelligence at American Defense International, told Breaking Defense that 'despite any real guidance' yet from DoD, the Iron Dome for America program 'is going to be like the gold rush for companies — everyone is going to rush to show how they can contribute to the effort.' And until that guidance is released, he added, there also likely will be 'a disjointed' race among the military services 'to associate everything with Iron Dome.' Doug Loverro, former head of Pentagon space policy, agreed that military space programs 'will be a relative winner here along with missile defense in general, but so will other administration priorities.' And in some ways, the services might benefit from a willingness to cut among Republicans that hasn’t been there in previous years. One Army source said the service is planning to use this exercise as an avenue to push for cuts it has been eyeing for some time but had trouble getting through Congress, in hopes that lawmakers allow them to be cut this time. At the end of the day, there was widespread agreement from the analysts that the Pentagon needs to have the freedom to make smart choices and not just cut towards an arbitrary number. 'If we’re going to argue for more defense spending, you’ve got to make sure that the Pentagon [are] responsible fiscal stewards. Yes, yes and yes,' Bowman said. 'But in this moment, any DOGE initiative, any efficiency initiative that gets in the way of those topline priorities … is exactly the wrong approach at the worst possible moment.'

DISA: DoD to achieve federated ICAM connection across all military services by end of fiscal year	Airman 1st Class Gerald Mack, cyber operator with 175th Cyber Operations, Maryland Air National Guard, monitors cyber attacks during Exercise Southern Strike at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, April 21, 2023. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense plans to achieve federal identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) connection on unclassified networks across all military services by the end of this fiscal year, according to a Defense Information Systems Agency official. ICAM — the practice of performing constant checks to ensure that users are allowed to access the information they are trying to access — is essential to the DoD’s larger zero trust 'never trust, always verify' philosophy that operates under the assumption that the network is always compromised. Federated ICAM allows one organization to accept another’s identity processes and procedures to gain access to each other's data on an existing platform. It’s a vital part of information sharing, Brian Hermann, the program executive officer for PEO Cyber at DISA said during a media roundtable today. 'ICAM is how we work across the department, as well as how we work with our mission partners. Enabling our work with allied and coalition partners means we have to have some connectivity and understanding of who we're working with in that coalition, to make sure that we have an understanding of their access rights and grant them access to DoD resources,' he said. Hermann explained that at the beginning of this fiscal year DISA stood up a federation hub that allows the agency to be able to have a 'total picture' of all the information an individual has access to, basically guaranteeing that ICAM is working the way it's supposed to. With this hub, DISA started working with the Army to get its ICAM solutions federated. He said he expects the Army’s ICAM federation solutions to be completed by the end of March. 'Then roughly about three months later, be done with the Navy, followed by the Air Force by the end of the fiscal year,' Hermann said. 'We're going to use the lessons that we learned out of [the services] to go ahead and do the federation across all the other ICAM solutions that exist within the department,' he added. When asked the reasoning behind the order in which the services were attaining federated ICAM, Hermann explained that it was mostly due to 'deconfliction of timing' concerning other 'activities' that the services had going on. 'I can't really say for example, that the Army's technical solution was more advanced or more mature than any of the others. I think it was just a timing issue,' he said. Related: ‘A light bulb moment’: US, Canada achieve ‘vital’ federated ICAM connection through joint pilot Once the services have achieved federated ICAM connection, the next step is to work with the Defense Manpower Data Center to help it achieve federated ICAM followed by other components of the DoD, which Hermann did not expand on. Throughout this process, DISA will also start working toward federated ICAM with allies and partners — something the department piloted in December when it announced it had achieved federated ICAM connection with Canada. However, before the DoD begins widely establishing federated ICAM access with other nations, Hermann said it needs to speed up the process of federation, which he said will be possible through lessons learned from the services. 'When we start to federate with external partners, allies &#8230; ad hoc kinds of coalitions that we might fight with, we have to be able to move very quickly to make sure that we can continue to work and collaborate with those mission partners,' Hermann said. 'I think speed has to get down to days, not months, is my observation, if we're going to be a supportive part of providing that warfighter support.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/disa-dod-to-achieve-federated-icam-connection-across-all-military-services-by-end-of-fiscal-year/	2025-02-21T11:55:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/7758909-scaled-e1740165576715.jpg
Saltzman bars Space Force staff from Mitchell Institute events	CSO Gen. Chance Saltzman offer remarks during the Mitchell Institute Spacepower Security Forum in Washington, D.C., March 27, 2024. (DoD photo by Joseph Clark) WASHINGTON — Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has barred all Space Force personnel from participating in any events sponsored by the Mitchell Institute, pending further instructions. The ban was conveyed to Space Force and US Space Command leaders in a Thursday evening email blast signed by Maj. Gen. Steven Whitney, Space Force staff director. 'CSO has directed that all Guardian participation with the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies is stopped until further notice. Instructions will follow when he clears future participation. This does not affect participation at the AFA's Warfare Symposium, only Mitchell Institute sponsored events,' the email states. 'I ask that you disseminate this guidance to your teams.' The email does not list a reason for the decision. However, it follows hard on the heels of the Feb. 19 release of a new Mitchell report calling on the Defense Department to more clearly define the Space Force's role in warfighting. The report, which was based on a workshop attended by Guardians, also found that Saltzman's overarching theory of space power, dubbed 'Competitive Endurance,' gives the impression of being weighed toward defensive operations rather than offensive actions — and that there continues to be some hesitancy within the Guardian corps about warfighting in space. A spokesperson for the Space Force was unable to respond by press time. While maintaining 501c3 status as an independent think tank, Mitchell traditionally has advocated for the importance of US military air power and the US Air Force, and increasingly in recent years for space power and the Space Force. Indeed, it was named for Army Brig. Gen. William Mitchell, who according to the organization's website, 'was a visionary of early airpower and the importance it would play in post-world-war global security and future wars.' In response to a request for comment from Breaking Defense, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, Mitchell Institute dean, said that Saltzman 'is dedicated to infusing a warfighting attitude in the Space Force.' Nonetheless, he said, 'for decades, military personnel were prohibited from saying ‘warfighting’ and ‘space’ in the same sentence. Circumstances are far different now given adversary actions. The Space Force leadership knows this and is pressing hard to evolve the service. 'Mitchell Institute will continue to advocate for the Space Force, and the absolute need to increase their resources, personnel, and authorities that are all essential to realize &#8216;peace through strength' for our nation,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saltzman-bars-space-force-staff-from-mitchell-institute-events/	2025-02-21T09:54:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Salzman-at-Mitchell-scaled-e1740143242552.jpeg
Saab CEO floats Euro defense ‘coalition,’ plans to fly unmanned combat demonstrator	Saab CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense that the company hopes to generate interest from Germany in the GlobalEye spy aircraft. (Saab) BELFAST — Swedish manufacturer Saab is one of Europe's largest defense companies, famed for the development and manufacture of Gripen fighter jets among a wide variety of other major platforms across air, land and sea domains. The company also has a special interest in the US, largely due to it supplying aft fuselages for the Air Force's T-7A Red Hawk advanced trainer program, while a new Michigan-based shoulder-fired munitions final assembly line is scheduled to begin production next year. US and European security ties are beginning to fray, however, as new leadership in Washington insists the continent drive up defense spending, tells the Munich Security Conference that Europe's primary threat rests 'from within,' and looks set to be much less of a reliable ally going forward. Against such a backdrop the implications for Europe's defense industry could be profound. Breaking Defense sat down with Saab CEO Micael Johannson on Sunday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference to discuss transatlantic tension, the potential for a European 'coalition of the willing' to fund major, collaborative defense projects, the state of Saab's weapons production and plans to flight test optionally manned and unmanned Swedish future fighter demonstrators over the next four years. This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity. MICAEL JOHANSSON: First of all, I do think that a strong transatlantic link is still important, and I don't think we should sort of jump into too many conclusions [or] we should give up on that obviously. Since we have operations in the US I don't think that is so much affected by this. This is a local business. Locally perceived, important stuff for the US DoD and the defense forces in the US, and we are still pushing to grow that. We're building a new facility in Michigan to manufacture munitions and support weapons, of course, that's still absolutely in play. It's more on a political level, to decide, okay, 'how strong do we have to be in Europe?' We come from a peace dividend and if we didn't sort of hear the wake up call a number of years ago, when the [Ukraine] war started, or even back in 2014 [when Russia invaded Crimea] I mean, now we should sort of understand that we need to do more in Europe, nation by nation, of course, but also as part of the alliance, being a strong pillar in NATO. I think [this is] important and I wish that we could sort of get our act together to do a few more things together in Europe, to create scale and identify a number of flagship projects that we need as capabilities [from the] European perspective, and also being aligned with what NATO needs going forward for a regional defense, but also as a strong sort of deterrence capability [in] Europe. We can identify those projects. We all talk about integrating air and missile defense systems. We have great defense industries that would support that. We have unmanned, collaborative combat aircraft. We have all these things with critical underwater infrastructure [threats] that we have to manage somehow. We can do more on the sensor side, on [the] space side, we could do more on sovereign security of supply when it comes to munitions and powder factories and stuff like that. How do we get there is the problem. A British Army Pathfinder Regiment soldier test fires Saab next generation light anti-tank weapon or NLAW (UK MoD) The European Commission was talking a couple of days ago about having a deficit break by triggering an emergency clause [effectively allowing governments more flexibility over defense spending]. Is that the right path to take? If this sort of triggers nations within Europe to take the next step to spend more then I think that is probably a very good way to go, nation by nation. I'm not sure that will help the collaboration issue. I'm more looking at our Commission having defense and security really high on the agenda. We have a new defense commissioner [Andrius Kubilius] that is writing his white paper together with Kaja Kallas [European Commission vice president] and [come] 14 March, we will see what that includes. I think theoretically, these are good initiatives to try and create some sort of European defense industrial program, with those flagships, the projects that I mentioned as examples. But then of course we need all the countries agreeing, by consensus, 27 of us, that we want to put money into this, substantial money. We are not talking about €1.5 billion ($1.56 billion) in Europe [the proposed budget of the European Defence Industry Programme]. We're talking hundreds of billions of euros, I think, over a time period to do this. Will that happen? I don't know. But if that is not manageable from an EU Commission perspective, we need to see a coalition of the willing, because when I look upon this, it seems countries have different views of the threat environment. I mean, it's obvious in the Baltic states, in Poland, maybe Germany, Sweden, Finland, maybe a few others that really want to, sort of step up and do things. (Days after Breaking Defense spoke with Johansson the Financial Times reported that the European Union is considering reallocating €93 billion of unused COVID recovery funds to the defense sector.) Saab has shared plans to hit a production target, across all of its ground combat weapons, of 400,000 units per year from 2025. Is that on track? Yes, we are on par with what we expect in terms of output, and we have a huge backlog now to execute also and so that will come into play at the end of this year. Are you able to give a figure for 2026, will it level out or increase? It will go beyond [the 2025 production rate] but I won't specify a number It will happen when our [Carl-Gustaf M4 shoulder launched recoilless rifle] facility in India comes into play in 2026 and also in the US [Michigan munitions facility] at the end of 2026. Production increase is also planned with our missile capability, short range air defense capability, and also sensor capability. That's why we opened a new [Giraffe 1X air surveillance radar] facility in Fareham to be able to manufacture, or start to manufacture the 1x at large scale. So we are investing heavily, a bit more front loaded than we assumed a couple of years ago, but it's the right thing to do. Pal Jonson, Sweden's defense minister, has said the government expects to launch a future fighter 'inquiry.' Is that a good step politically to also tie in with future fighter activities from the Swedish Armed Forces and studies already underway? It's public news that there is a concept program ongoing where the alternatives are, continue the way we do it today which is in itself, of course, an ecosystem of companies joining to support us as the prime. The other option is to join, and I am not saying SCAF [Future Combat Air System] or GCAP [Global Combat Air Programme] but finding an international partnership, but it is very important to retain the OEM [Original Equipment Manufacturer] capabilities that we have. I can't foresee that we will throw that out the window after nine decades of cost efficient, highly performing platforms being developed and manufactured. The third alternative would be to buy something off the shelf, which I have a hard time seeing, that Sweden would actually turn that way because that would mean lots of cost and infrastructure effects and stuff like that. They will do some sort of assessment on the three alternatives. I don't know when exactly they will come to a conclusion. Sweden could decide on which procurement path to take for a future fighter designed to replace Saab's Gripen fighter jet earlier than expected, company CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense (Saab) We are supporting the program. We're doing concepting and we will fly things over time and they stated between 2028 and 2030 they have to take this decision. I think it will happen a bit earlier, but that's my personal view, we need to settle which way we go because that's good for us, that's good for Sweden, good for the [NATO] alliance. Of course there will be assessments, but I cannot see that there will be a request for information or something like that, sent out [to industry]. Do you think we will see anything flying soon [from Saab on the future fighter concept phase]? Absolutely we will definitely fly things. Manned or unmanned? Unmanned [flight testing around] 2027-2028. Before that, we will probably fly something optionally manned, and maybe partly show off some mission sort of capability that would be more AI than pilot-oriented. The AI package would be developed in-house or from a start up? We have a collaboration with Helsing. We work with them, and we also have an equity stake. So of course, we will use AI from the company broadly. But of course, we're looking into what can support more efficient missions when using AI agents. I won't go into details around that. Are you happy with the level of funding provided for future fighter related activities? We are on contract for lots of these things. There will be more to come. Touching on the GlobalEye joint Nordic purchase idea, do you think there will be an agreement soon? I hope so. It's mainly sort of a discussion between the politicians, MoDs and defense forces, around [the question of] what sort of capability do we need? Do we need to add one or two platforms and/or if Finland or Denmark would join that to start with. Of course, that would be great and I think we need that capability, not only for the Nordics, but also the Arctic perspective, to be able to cover that. As the UAE deal is complete, what are your GlobalEye export priorities? I think there's an interest from France. Hopefully we can get the Germans interested. I'd love to see it as an interim solution at least for the NATO iAFSC [initial Allied Future Surveillance and Control] as they call it. I know the E-7 has been selected, but there's some sort of schedule problem there, I think, so we are offering [GlobalEye] if there's an interest, but then we go nation by nation. We have some interest or potential customers that are interested in Asia-Pacific region, but also Middle East. There are quite a few sort of leads or campaigns [happening]. Has Saab made first Gripen E deliveries to Satenas air base yet? We have delivered [aircraft] to the FMV [Swedish Defence Materiel Administration] test center. Given news around a possible F-35 sale to India, do you see that as a competitive issue for the Gripen campaign? We have a very competitive opportunity. We've said to them that we're prepared to more or less build a small Linköping [Gripen's Swedish manufacturing base] in India, to transfer technology, build production, and also knowledge transfer for a platform like Gripen [is important]. It has to be a highly performing platform, which it is and I think it's suitable for what they need. But then again, I can't judge politically how discussions are going. Is there a commensurate type loss on T-7 for Saab, in line with Boeing's losses? It's not proportional at all to what Boeing has written off, which is public information and I won't give you a number, but is that substantial? Absolutely not. I think the investors have sort of understood that if you look upon the combination of aerostructures which has not been giving us black numbers over the last few years, but will go into a positive sort of scenario now — [when you consider] T-7 and then Gripen — we've always said that it should be sort of high single digit numbers [for profitability]. They're now being pushed down a bit, and you are roughly at 6 percent I think, 5.9 percent last year for aeronautics. So that gives you a feeling.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-ceo-floats-euro-defense-coalition-plans-to-fly-unmanned-combat-demonstrator/	2025-02-21T01:05:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/20210220-en-3896563-1-scaled-e1637694229726.jpg
As ‘dome’ air defense discussions rage, Turkey’s Aselsan sees an opening: CEO	Aselsan showcases its wares at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — As the US is sorting out what exactly an American Iron Dome will look like, Turkey is forging ahead with its own Steel Dome — and eyeing potential exports for such air defense systems to both NATO allies and eager Gulf customers, according to a senior Turkish executive. 'The Steel Dome is very promising system. All nations want to have this kind of system,' Ahmet Akyol, president and CEO of Turkish electronics giant Aselsan, told Breaking Defense here in Abu Dhabi. 'We are a member of NATO. These are our allies. Also we have got many brother countries in this [Gulf] region and all around the world. So the decision is [a] government decision, but we are ready to contribute [to] peace and prosperity of all brother and allied nation nations.' Announced in August 2024 and with a name that invokes Israel's multi-layered defense system that includes its Iron Dome platform, Steel Dome is meant to be a network-centric air defense system equipped with artificial intelligence and is expected to protect Turkey’s entire airspace from 'very low altitude to very high altitude' and 'very short range to long range' threats, according to a statement issued at the time by the government’s Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB). Aselsan is one of a handful of Turkish firms, including ballistics maker Roketsan, charged with making the concept a reality. Akyol said there is no projected end date for the Steel Dome to be complete, as it's a layered system that's continuously updated. 'We can provide this solution for Turkey and for allied countries right now,' Akyol said. 'So in Turkey, this is in progress. Every year we are delivering new systems of the Steel Dome concept, and it will be beneficial for our region.' As for the name, the American plan has come under no small amount of criticism since Iron Dome refers to a layer of Israel's overall system that would not be practical for many US air defense needs. Asked whether Steel Dome was a better fit for Turkey's needs, even if it echoed the Israeli original, Akyol said, 'The name is not important the concept is important,' adding the name was chosen by the government not the firm. Akyol's mention of the potential to deliver air defense systems to partners in the region will likely be welcome news to Gulf militaries. Other defense firm executives told Breaking Defense during IDEX 2025 that the region is eager for air defenses following the rash of missile and drone threats in recent years. 'Especially after drone and kamikaze attack attacks in the region, [in] Yemen and other conflicts, there is a huge demand for air defense systems and also guidance kits,' he said. More broadly Aselsan is making a push into the Gulf, to deepen ties here. 'We are opening new entities in this region. Just last week, I was in Oman and opened a new entity in Oman. And also we have got some production facilities like in Jordan,' he said. 'So in this region, the trend and the demand is to increase local contribution.' Akyol said that Aselsan is open for technology transfer. He added that the firm will convert its office in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to an excellence center. 'We will have design capabilities in house, in these offices. And also we have got some discussions [for] new joint ventures. Saudi Arabia is one of the key countries for our activities. And day by day, we are increasing activities in Saudi Arabia,' he told Breaking Defense. After mending ties between Riyadh and Ankara, Turkish firms started to have increased cooperation opportunities in the Saudi market, the largest importer of defense platforms in the Gulf region. That included another Turkish firm, Baykar, selling its AKINCI drones to the Kingdom in 2023. Akyol added that with Abu Dhabi there are 'some technology of transfer and production opportunities are also on the table.' He saw increased regional demand in the following areas: radars, air defense systems, electro-optics and naval platforms. But Aseslan is also eyeing expansion far from the Gulf, including further into Western Europe, the Far East and Latin America. 'We will have additional capacities and new partnerships, and we will have a more presence in these regions in 2025, and other upcoming years,' he said.

DoD reviewing ‘non-essential’ consultancy contracts for termination	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department has ordered all acquisition shops to review consulting service contracts to determine whether they are essential to Trump administration priorities, and terminate those deemed not to fit that bill. 'To ensure we are accountable for every dollar we spend and that we are aligned with the President of the United States’ America First priorities and Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth’s direction, Component heads will conduct a comprehensive review and validation of existing contracts for consulting services,' states the Feb. 18 memo [PDF] memo signed by Steven Morani, who is performing the duties of DoD's undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment. The memo mandates an assessment of 'the essentiality of contracts &#8230; for the purpose of terminating or descoping contracts for activities that are not essential for the Department to fulfill its statutory purposes.' Components are organizations within the Pentagon that have acquisition authority. Morani's memo, first reported by DefenseScoop, is addressed to 'senior Pentagon leadership, defense agencies and DoD field activities directors.' The DoD review is taking place in two parts: first looking at contracts let under the General Services Administration vehicle, then other types of contracts. Component heads have until March 19 to submit to the results of the first review and until April 19 for the second. The memo doesn't define 'consulting services,' so it is unclear what exactly will fall under the review and how much money is currently being spent on these types of contracts. However, according to a 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, DoD spent between $184 billion to $226 billion from 2017 to 2022 on all types of 'service contracts,' including administrative and technical support. That said, the report noted that data is hard to collect as the various offices within the DoD do not use the same criteria to keep track of such spending. Morani explains that if certain consultancy contracts are found to be 'essential,' then a 'short justification' including a validation of the requirement by 'a General Officer/Senior Executive Service member' should be provided. The memo comes against the backdrop of Hegseth ordering Pentagon leaders to redirect roughly $50 billion planned for the fiscal 2026 budget request towards a set of priorities that better align with Trump's goals for the department, as well as the arrival of Elon Musk's DOGE team at the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-reviewing-non-essential-consultancy-contracts-for-termination/	2025-02-20T15:31:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/hegseth-confirmation-scaled-e1736870161374.jpg
GE, Pratt clear key design milestone, begin building next-gen engine prototypes	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — Engine makers GE Aerospace and RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney have both formally passed a key design milestone for the Air Force’s Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, paving the way for the two companies to begin building their respective prototypes. GE Aerospace said in a statement Wednesday that its prototype design, dubbed the XA102, cleared what’s known as Detailed Design Review (DDR), the final step before work to construct the engine can commence. In a statement today, Pratt similarly announced that its NGAP offering, called the XA103, has also cleared the DDR milestone. 'GE Aerospace is making great strides with model-based engineering, which has been instrumental in the success of the XA102 engine design,' Steve Russell, vice president and general manager of Edison Works at GE Aerospace, said in the company’s press release. 'As we transition into the procurement and build phase, we will continue to incorporate this innovative approach while working closely with our supply chain partners to advance the engine toward a full-scale demonstration.' In its announcement, Pratt asserted that the company completed the 'first fully digital' DDR for its NGAP candidate, emphasizing the growing importance of digital design tools that support weapon systems development for the Pentagon. 'For decades, propulsion has been a key differentiator for the United States, and we are working with the US Air Force to make sure it stays that way,' Chris Flynn, Pratt vice president of Military Development Programs, said in a statement. 'Collaborating with the US Air Force, we have supported every generation of jet engine development since World War II. XA103, our adaptive engine for the future, will continue to advance our digital and agile design and development capabilities while advancing the propulsion capability for the warfighter.' The announcements follow a new round of contracts issued by the Air Force in January for the NGAP program, which raised the total award ceiling for each vendor to $3.5 billion each. The Air Force is expected to assess the performance of each prototype once they begin testing later this decade, and make a down-select decision from there. The 'adaptive' engine technologies underpinning the NGAP program could herald a leap in military propulsion, Air Force officials have said, because they can change the characteristics of a jet engine in flight to enable features like more fuel efficient cruising or increased thrust. The designs for both companies draw heavily from work previously conducted under the Air Force’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program, which constructed a new, prototype engine for the F-35 but was ultimately passed over due to budgetary constraints and other logistical concerns. The NGAP engines have principally been intended to power the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, though the sixth-gen jet is currently in limbo after being paused by the Biden administration and awaits a review by the new Trump team. NGAD is now the only publicly known potential recipient of adaptive engine technologies for the US military, following a disclosure last year by the Navy to Aviation Week that its own next-gen fighter in the works, called F/A-XX, will instead rely on more traditional propulsion designs. The exquisite NGAP powerplant has also been identified by former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as a potential source of cost savings for the NGAD fighter, whose projected price of several hundred million dollars per copy could prove prohibitive. Among other changes that could be made to the fighter, reducing the complexity of its engine could be one option to make the aircraft more affordable, Kendall said. Internal Air Force analysis recently validated the requirement for a manned, sixth-gen fighter, Breaking Defense previously reported. It’s not clear what the Trump administration may decide, though the fighter was notably not exempt from an order by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to pare back about 8 percent of projected spending for the next five fiscal years, which will free up money to shift toward the administration’s priorities. A project to field a fleet of drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft, however, was expressly put off limits, according to a memo from Hegseth and obtained by Breaking Defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/ge-pratt-clear-key-design-milestone-begin-building-next-gen-engine-prototypes/	2025-02-20T12:38:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
Denmark to pass 3 percent GDP on defense over fear of Russian rearmament	Danish officials address media regarding an increased defense spending plan (Danish MoD) BELFAST — Based on a strategic assessment that Russia could rearm faster than NATO should the war in Ukraine end or turn into a frozen conflict, Denmark says it plans on injecting an additional 50 billion DKK ($7 billion) to its defense budget over 2025-2026. The uplift will see the Nordic nation exceed 3 percent GDP on military spending. In a translated statement from Wednesday, the government said the extra money will speed up the 'building of the Armed Forces' combat power,' and be drawn from an 'Acceleration Fund.' Copenhagen did not specify which weapon systems the new fund will be used to acquire, but laid out its security fears in clear terms. The Danish Ministry of Defence 'assesses that when the war in Ukraine stops or freezes and NATO does not arm itself at the same pace, Russia will be able to free up significant military resources and, within about 2 years, pose a credible threat to one or more NATO countries in the Baltic Sea region, if the US does not get involved,' it said. The warning that Russia could rearm within two years is not out of step with comments from other regional officials. During a recent trip to Washington, Lt. General Carl-Johan Edström, Sweden's Chief of Defense Staff, told Breaking Defense that it will take only a few years for Russia to rearm itself if the Ukraine conflict freezes. RELATED: Ticking clock: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing ‘window’ to prepare for Russia 'If you're a country with the border to Russia, then you say two to three years. And if you're really far away, then you say maybe five to 10 years,' he said. 'You have to look at that perspective, maybe five years, maybe less. Not more.' European powers are still struggling to come to terms with the reality of urgently having to do more to protect the continent without relying on the US for renewed support. US President Donald Trump labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and speculating that 'he is not going to have a country left' have only heightened concerns in the region that Washington is prepared to negotiate a peace deal along pro-Russian lines and without any involvement from Kyiv or NATO allies. 'The current security situation demands political action from European allies,' Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said during a Wednesday press conference, according to a post on X. Washington also continues to test bilateral relations with Copenhagen through its push to buy Greenland, which has included hints from Trump that he would be open to military action to take it over. The island is a self-governing territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark. In January, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen quashed the US military takeover idea, telling local broadcaster TV 2 'I don’t have the imagination to imagine us getting there.' Copenhagen's latest spending pledge comes after it also committed last month to spend $2.04 billion on new naval vessels, long-range drones and improved space capabilities in a bid to strengthen Arctic security.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/denmark-to-pass-3-percent-gdp-on-defense-over-fear-of-russian-rearmament/	2025-02-20T12:03:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/pressemode-stm-2025-artikel-e1740080003703.jpg
Trump administration weighing C-UAS role in Iron Dome for America, two-star general explains	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. (US Army/ Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — Pentagon officials are crafting a plan to expand the United States’s missile defense system under the 'Iron Dome for America' initiative, and grappling with whether new tech to down aerial drones should also be included, according to a two-star Army general. 'There's talk about does that involve counter-UAS [unmanned aerial systems] or will counter-UAS be established [separately],' Maj. Gen. David Stewart told Breaking Defense earlier this month. Stewart — dual hatted as the director for the Joint Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and Army fires — said he and his team are working with Pentagon leaders and other agencies to determine just what route to take. In late January, President Donald Trump issued the Iron Dome for America executive order calling for greater investments for a multilayered homeland air defense system, including a requirement for the development of space-based interceptors. That order started a 60-day clock for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a plan to defend the homeland against 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.' 'What do we have right now that gets out [to] the cutting edge [and] is that the right capability, versus what do we need to invest in,' Stewart later added. The proliferation of aerial drones on the battlefield has been pushing the services to focus on new counter-drone weapons for years to varying degrees of success. More recently, though, there have been a plethora of reports of drone sightings and incursions on military installations throughout the US. 'I have no doubt that there’s significantly more incursions that we don’t see, either with a system or with our eyeballs,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told reporters in October 2024. At the time, the four-star general speculated that those events are gaining more attention due to the spread of systems that are able to detect and track UAS with greater 'fidelity.' And while drone sightings at locations with highly classified programs have prompted questions of if adversary nations are behind the operations, Guillot said that he has not yet seen evidence of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus' and that the 'overwhelming majority of them are probably local hobbyists that are just flying too close to the base.' Regardless of if many of those incidents are from hobbyists or not, Stewart said the new administration is taking the potential threat 'very seriously' and pushing the DoD and other entities like the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and local law enforcement to work together. But red tape abound. US regulations and policy, for example, limit just which C-UAS systems can be used on the homeland. While there are expectations depending on the location, by and large, only 'low-collateral effectors' are used to down drones inside the continental US — think jamming or spoofing the radio frequency link between the controller and the drone, a net to capture the drone or using one drone to ram the other drone. This has meant that the military services have had to find innovative ways to test out new C-UAS against real threats. When the Army wanted soldier feedback on its new Stryker-mounted 50-kilowatt laser weapons against drones last year, it sent the four prototypes into the Middle East. In a similar vein, the service is also planning to test new high-powered microwave C-UASs over there. 'The full breadth of capability is not authorized to be used in the United States, in the homeland,' Stewart said. Ultimately, though, that may need to change under a more comprehensive C-UAS plan that is either part of the Iron Dome for America umbrella or a standalone. 'There is no single silver bullet,' Stewart added. 'We have to look at is a layered approach that we look at both really exquisite capability to get after a threat, but also trying to get after more affordable capability, and just trying to make sure that we use the right tool and provide the warfighter the right tools to get after this mission.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-administration-weighing-c-uas-role-in-iron-dome-for-america-two-star-general-explains/	2025-02-20T11:15:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/5356116-scaled-e1738101657589.jpg
Navy relieves captain of carrier that hit merchant vessel	Exterior damage of USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) viewed from a ship’s rigid-hull inflatable boat following a collision with merchant vessel Besiktas-M, Feb. 12. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Cody Beam) WASHINGTON — The captain in command of the US Navy aircraft carrier that collided with a merchant vessel near an Egyptian port last week has been relieved by the head of his carrier strike group, the service announced today. Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of Carrier Strike Group 8, relieved Capt. Dave Snowden on Feb. 20 due to a 'loss of confidence in his ability to command,' according to the statement. The Navy rarely divulges specific reasons why commanders are relieved, opting instead to use the phrase 'loss of confidence' as a catchall explanation. But in this instance, the service directly attributed Snowden's firing to last week's collision. 'The relief occurred after Truman was involved in a collision with the merchant vessel Besiktas-M on Feb. 12, while operating in the Mediterranean Sea in the vicinity of Port Said, Egypt,' according to the statement. 'The U.S. Navy holds commanding officers to the highest standard and takes action to hold them accountable when those standards are not met. Naval leaders are entrusted with significant responsibilities to their Sailors and their ships.' Snowden will be temporarily re-assigned to Naval Air Forces Atlantic. Capt. Christopher Hill, commander of the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, will temporarily serve as Truman's commander, according to the statement. The Truman reportedly pulled into port for repairs associated with the collision, and the Navy said Snowden's relief will have no impact on the ship's schedule.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/navy-relieves-captain-of-carrier-that-hit-merchant-vessel/	2025-02-20T10:38:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8871530-scaled-e1740076408529.jpg
Trump ‘clearly not happy’ with delivery schedule for new Air Force One jets, Boeing CEO says	US President Donald Trump gestures with a saber after cutting into a cake representation of the new Air Force One design during the Commander-In-Chief inaugural ball at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025. (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Lengthy delays with the delivery of two Boeing 747 jumbo jets outfitted to serve as flying White Houses has drawn the ire of President Donald Trump, who is 'clearly not happy' with the lagging schedule to deliver the planes, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said today. 'I think he’s made that well-known,' Ortberg said during the Barclays Industrial Select Conference, referring to the commander-in-chief’s widely publicized dissatisfaction with Boeing’s management of the Air Force One program. The two jets, dubbed VC-25B, are set to replace older 747 models currently in service that regularly shuttle the US president around the globe. Trump personally intervened in the contract negotiations for the deal in 2018, and the ensuing work to modify the planes with features like a secure communications suite and the ability to survive a nuclear detonation has proven difficult for the beleaguered aerospace giant. Amid other woes like workforce disruptions and a fixed-price development contract that has forced Boeing to lose billions of dollars on the Air Force One program, delays have piled up, and now the first of the two planes may not deliver until 2029 or even later, Breaking Defense previously reported. The first jet was originally expected to be handed over in 2024. An updated schedule assessment from Boeing is anticipated in the spring. To help speed things up, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) chief Elon Musk has now been tapped to intervene, a move Ortberg said he welcomed. 'Elon Musk is actually helping us a lot in working through the requirements on VC-25 to try to help us get the things that are non-value added constraints out of the way, so that we can move faster and get the president those airplanes delivered,' Ortberg said. 'He's a brilliant guy, so he's able to pretty quickly ascertain the difference between technical requirements and things that we can move out of the way, and he's helping us in a big way,' he continued. 'So I'm embracing that, working with the DOGE team to help us improve the delivery.' Noting that an accelerated schedule can help reduce the risk of further cost overruns, Ortberg concluded that he is 'all in on trying to pull these airplanes up and get the president his airplanes delivered to him, which is what he wants.' Vexed by the schedule setbacks, Trump has openly mused about finding alternatives, telling reporters flying aboard Air Force One on Wednesday that he was considering buying other used Boeing aircraft from a foreign seller. It’s not clear how that plan might work to potentially save time, as any other jets will need to be acquired and retrofitted similar to the work Boeing is doing. But other companies could theoretically compete for such a deal: In April 2024, the Air Force awarded the mid-size firm SNC a contract worth $13 billion to convert used 747s into the service’s next fleet of 'Doomsday' planes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-clearly-not-happy-with-delivery-schedule-for-new-air-force-one-jets-boeing-ceo-says/	2025-02-20T09:34:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2194465096-scaled-e1740070941499.jpg
Air Force awards Pratt $1.5 billion to keep F-22s flying	An F-22 Raptor takes off from Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 21, 2022. The F-22s were rapidly deployed to the base earlier in the month on order from the U.S. Secretary of Defense in coordination with the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and join a range of joint, coalition and allied and partner combat airpower capabilities already based in the region. (U.S. Air Force (photo by Master Sgt. Dan Heaton) WASHINGTON — The Air Force has awarded RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney a contract worth up to $1.5 billion to continue sustaining the F119 engine that powers the service’s F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, the company announced today. The sustainment contract for Pratt’s F119 spans three years, according to the company, covering more than 400 powerplants. The single-seat F-22 flies with two engines and is often hailed for its ability to 'supercruise,' or soar at supersonic speeds without using afterburners. 'The F119’s readiness and reliability rates have never been more important, and we are improving both while lowering lifecycle costs,' Jill Albertelli, president of Pratt’s military engines business, said in a statement. 'We are committed to helping our U.S. Air Force customer maintain the F-22’s combat edge.' In a briefing with reporters ahead of the announcement, Caroline Cooper, Pratt’s executive director for the F119 program, reiterated past projections that the company’s Usage Based Lifing effort launched in 2022 — which essentially leverages flight data and engineering algorithms so that maintenance isn’t performed until it’s actually necessary — will save over $800 million across the engine’s lifespan. Asked about assumptions underpinning that forecast, such as fresh uncertainties concerning the longevity of the F-22 fleet given questions about its planned replacement, Pratt said in a statement that the 'constant flow of data' collected from ongoing flight operations 'is continuously re-analyzed and allows the customer to take advantage of the full life of the engine parts while reducing risk to the fleet.' (Company executives have previously explained that the $800 million prediction means that the Air Force can continue operating the fighter the same as it has in the past, but save money by running parts longer, or harness the greater durability of parts to squeeze more performance out of the engine.) Additionally, according to Cooper, Pratt is exploring how to incorporate additively manufactured, or 3D printed, parts into the F119, but deferred on specifics until an announcement is ready at a later date. 'I can say with certainty that we're looking at leveraging additive across Pratt,' she said. RELATED: Turbine ‘fatigue’ issue forced F-22 engine retrofit, Air Force says The Raptor’s development began near the end of the Cold War and continued through the 1990s, though the cessation of superpower competition drove a decision to limit production to 187 copies of the fighter. The airframe itself is built by Lockheed Martin. The Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter was originally envisioned as a direct replacement of the F-22, though the sixth-gen jet is currently in limbo pending a decision by the Trump administration. While NGAD was planned as an air superiority fighter like the F-22 that precedes it, former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in January that as officials weigh alternatives for the platform, one option could be developing it as a multirole fighter tasked with quarterbacking a forthcoming fleet of drone wingmen. '[T]o keep the industrial base going, to get the right concept, the right mix of capability into the Air Force, and do it as efficiently as possible, I think there are a couple of really reasonable options on the table that the next administration is going to want to have to take a look at,' Kendall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/air-force-awards-pratt-1-5-billion-to-keep-f-22s-flying/	2025-02-20T06:00:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/7063324-scaled-e1660672633444.jpg
What’s new in naval tech? Highlights from WEST 2025	Every year, luminaries from the naval community gather in San Diego for the annual WEST conference. Yes, San Diego in February. Never let it be said the sea service isn’t clever. This year’s show was a little different, however. Because the Trump administration is only a few weeks old and no civilians have been confirmed to top navy roles, there was a bit of a leadership vacuum.

Papua New Guinea, Australia begin hammering out first defense treaty	Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles with Papua New Guinea Defense Minister, Billy Joseph, in Brisbane on Feb. 20, 2025 where they announced the two countries hope to draft and sign a defense treaty. (ADF) TOKYO — A half-century after gaining independence from Australia, the Pacific island state of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and its giant neighbor are negotiating what the two sides hope will become a defense treaty, elevating their security relationship at a tense time in the region. 'This will be a treaty with ambition. It will be the most significant defense agreement between our two countries since Papua New Guinean independence,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters in Brisbane today. It will be 'really fitting' if this country signs a defense treaty with Australia, 'because we got independence from Australia, and, at the same time, we are very close to each other,' PNG's defense minister, Billy Joseph, said at the press conference. Australia created the first Papuan defense force in 1943 to help drive the Japanese out of the Pacific islands during the Second World War and now regularly trains with their forces. Marles said the pending agreement would be 'a pathway of increasing integration and increasing interoperability' with its neighbor just three kilometers to the north. The two countries came close to signing a treaty in December last year but it foundered due to criticism from some PNG politicians. 'The Bilateral Security Agreement that came into effect last December was originally intended to be a treaty-level document, but the PNG side pushed back on that because of perceived legal hurdles with respect to the PNG Constitution,' noted Mihai Sora, a Pacific Islands expert at Sydney's Lowy Institute, international think tank. The treaty is likely to focus on the 'traditional and non-traditional security cooperation where Australia is already a key partner for PNG: military, police, cyber, climate, and so on,' Sora said. But there will probably be more, if not quite a NATO-style pledge that all will come to the aid of any state attacked (Article 5), he said. Sora expected it to likely be an exclusionary pact, one focused on PNG not entering a defense or security agreement with a country, like, say, China. Australia has already forged such agreements with the tiny island states of Nauru and Tuvalu. They allow Australia to veto agreements the islands might try to make with any other country. Australia isn't alone in its focus on PNG. The United States signed an agreement with PNG in May last year. Perhaps the biggest benefit of the deal in the long run for the United States is that it gives US forces access to the joint Australian-PNG facility on Manus Island, where the US built facilities during World War II. Australia is spending at least $175 million AUD ($112 million US) to improve the port. That signing was followed by the first visit to the island state by a US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. But there are questions about whether these bilateral agreements are the best approach to take with the Pacific Islands. 'Australian governments have been quick to claim these bilateral arrangements as diplomatic wins. But they are the diplomatic equivalent of a Mars Bar: the government gets the sugar-rush of making an announcement, but there is no guarantee that these arrangements will deliver long-term outcomes,' argued Joanne Wallis, a professor in Pacific studies at the University of Adelaide, and her colleague, Salote Tagivakatini, a former Fijian diplomat, in a recent paper for the Australian Institute of International Affairs. They point to the decision by the minuscule Cook Islands, whose residents are citizens of New Zealand, to sign a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' with China as proof this bilateral approach might not be as effective as hoped. The Cook Islands leadership, which is supposed to consult with New Zealand on security and defense issues, failed to do so recently when deciding to sign a strategic pact with China, according to the New Zealand news outlet RNZ. Wallis and Tagivakatini argue the unique culture of the Pacific islands, where governments regard themselves as a 'family' and try to work together on the basis of consensus, runs counter to the spirit of what they call 'transactional' bilateral agreements. The authors say this approach 'risks undermining the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional agencies. Pacific leaders have made clear their desire for Pacific-led regionalism.' But John Blaxland, an Indo-Pacific expert at the Australian National University, said he believes that 'great power competition is more acute today than it has been for generations.' Papua New Guinea is now as important to Australia as it has ever been, and he stressed competition for access and influence has intensified in recent months and years. 'Consolidating and formalizing a defense treaty makes sense in view of the shifting security and defense dynamics,' Blaxland told Breaking Defense. This treaty, should it be signed, 'can't be taken for granted,' he wrote in an email. 'This is a time of what can be described as unrestricted competition in the legal, media, psychological and economic domains. Australia cannot afford to rest on its laurels about maintaining deep, trusted and effectively collaborative relations between Australia and PNG.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/papua-new-guinea-australia-begin-hammering-out-first-defense-treaty/	2025-02-20T04:03:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250220adf8671822_6893-scaled-e1740052603340.jpeg
Hanwha’s new global defense chief eyes aggressive expansion in every direction	A Hanwha K9 howitzer on display at IDEX 2025. (Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — On the job for less than two months, the new head of global defense business for Hanwha Aerospace has his sights set on helping to make the South Korean defense firm a major industrial player worldwide. Just don't ask him to prioritize one market over another. 'So to be a global leader we need position in the largest defense markets in the world &#8230; [the] United States, Europe, Middle East, Asia. So I would say you have to be focused on all of them,' Michael Coulter, who was appointed to the role in December, told Breaking Defense in an interview from Hanwha's expansive floor space at IDEX 2025 here in Abu Dhabi. Encouraged in recent years by a more defense export-friendly government in Seoul, Coulter said Hanwha made significant strides before his tenure to go global, including major contract wins in Australia, Poland, Romania and Egypt. But he said the company now aims to use each as a springboard to more business in each region. 'We've been doing export for 15, 20 years, but it's just been in recent years that we've really been reaching out to create [a] global defense industrial base, creating global partnerships, partnerships in local countries,' he said. Coulter, who was at Leonardo DRS before joining Hanwha, described the US as a key market, but acknowledged the firm has a 'modest' presence there so far. A 2023 rejection for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, he said, has not stopped the company's 'commitment' to the American military market, and there are discussions with the US Army about 'various capabilities.' (Coulter did not identify any specifically, but Breaking Defense has reported that Hanwha's howitzer was among those recently observed when Army officials went on a global evaluation tour.) Michael Coulter, head of global defense at Hanwha Aerospace, speaks to Breaking Defense at IDEX 2025. (Courtesy Hanwha) Naval systems could also be a significant opportunity for Hanwha in the US, as Coulter said there have been discussions with the Navy about leveraging Hanwha's recent takeover of Philly Shipyard to eventually bolster the service's fleet. Coulter said Hanwha is keeping an especially close eye on Europe, where Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the expected shift of US military support away from the continent under the Trump administration have spurred European nations to race to shore up their own capabilities. 'As European defense budgets increase, its important for us bring the strength of Korea but also to be European,' Coulter said. 'So we are investing in partnerships and facilities and workforce in Europe.' The deal with Romania in which Hanwha will build a facility to be a 'production house for land force capability' is also meant to give the firm 'really a domestic industrial base in Europe,' Coulter said. 'We're having similar conversations in Poland and in other countries in Europe as well.' As for the Middle East, Hanwha took the opportunity at IDEX to bring in a full-sized K9 howitzer, showing publicly for the first time a version of the platform that used a Korean-built engine. The first Korean-made K9s are expected to go operational with the Egyptian military later this year, a Hanwha spokesperson told Breaking Defense, with locally produced versions expected in 2026. Beyond Egypt, Coulter said there are 'very active' conversations in the Gulf with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Regionally, he said, there's 'sincere' concern about the threat of ballistic missiles and therefore there's an appetite for defenses against them — another investment area for Hanwha. Finally in the Indo-Pacific region, Coulter highlighted Hanwha's expected outsized presence in South Korea, but also its victories in Australia in competitive infantry fighting vehicle and howitzer programs. The Lucky Country could be, Coulter said, another springboard to larger markets. 'We're producing those in Australia for use by the Australian military, but with an eye to being a global supplier out of a domestic presence in Australia,' he said. 'So, very strong support from the Commonwealth for not just further capabilities in Australia, but then to using that hub in Australia as a global supply chain platform.' But with all that said, Coulter said Hanwha is interested in expanding not just in a geographical sense, but a 'functional' one too. 'And that means building up partnerships around the world, be those partnerships with militaries and governments, to partnerships with technology companies, to partnerships with industrial partners to grow capacity around the world,' he said. That kind of 'functional growth,' Hanwha is 'very focused on.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/hanwhas-new-global-defense-chief-eyes-aggressive-expansion-in-every-direction/	2025-02-20T00:35:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250218_104955-scaled-e1739970691806.jpg
Saab unveils UAE-developed Coast Control Radar at IDEX 2025	Saab's UAE arm showcases a new radar at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Sweden's Saab unveiled a new radar at the Abu Dhabi defense show IDEX, this one developed in the United Arab Emirates through the government-affiliated Tawazun Industrial Park. The next-generation Coast Control Radar, which was on display at IDEX 2025, is a static, non-rotating system that uses phased-array software. 'It's crucial to have this kind of new technique, [with] low maintenance [requirement], as it's a non-rotating radar. That is kind of the key features that takes this radar into the kind of next generation,' Saab’s UAE managing director Heléne Bittmann told Breaking Defense in an interview at the show. The new radar is designed to safeguard territorial waters and to detect smaller vessels at a time when maritime security poses a big concern in the Middle East region, especially in light of continuous attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. 'I think for the UAE, it's really important to be indigenous, having their own kind of securing and defense capabilities, making sure their people and society are kept safe,' Bittmann said. She added that Saab UAE is in continuous discussion with Tawazun, the governmental entity charged with procurement and development, to align with the country’s vision. 'Designed for easy integration into infrastructure such as buildings, towers, and waterway bridges, the Coast Control Radar ensures flexible installation and can offer comprehensive 360-degree coverage. Its modular design minimises installation challenges while also offering routine software upgrades for continued exceptional detection and performance,' the company said in a statement. The coast guard radar is the second system developed by Saab UAE and uses Emirati intellectual property. The other was DeployNet, a portable 5G network provider column that the company says can be easily deployed to provide network services in rural or remote environments. DeployNet was also on display at the firm’s exhibition display. 'We see that there is a global need for this [radar]. The [need] for this kind of radars for the Coast Guard, and even more so now securing waterways will become more and more important. So we do see a genuine interest,' Bittmann said. She expected that Saab UAE 'will have the opportunity to grow even more. That's my ambition. And they have invested a lot in the UAE, and we're here to stay and to continue to drive that.' Bittmann concluded that the firm’s next five-year plan is to continue to focus on the sensor software and radar capabilities.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-unveils-uae-developed-coast-control-radar-at-idex-2025/	2025-02-19T22:51:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250220_IDEX_saab_radar_AGNES-e1740032823193.jpg
Pentagon seeks to shift $50B in planned funding to new priorities in FY26	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is greeted by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr. at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Jan. 27, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of the department's fiscal 2026 budget plans in order to shift funds from legacy programs towards President Donald Trump's priorities, including border security and the Iron Dome for America. The goal: Find roughly $50 billion, or 8 percent of the FY26 plan, and reprioritize it. 'Secretary Hegseth has directed a review to identify offsets from the Biden Administration’s FY26 budget that could be realigned from low-impact and low-priority Biden-legacy programs to align with President Trump’s America First priorities for our national defense,' acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses said in a Wednesday night statement. 'The Department will develop a list of potential offsets that could be used to fund these priorities, as well as to refocus the Department on its core mission of deterring and winning wars. The offsets are targeted at 8% of the Biden Administration’s FY26 budget, totaling around $50 billion, which will then be spent on programs aligned with President Trump’s priorities.' While not noted in the Salesses statement, the Washington Post earlier today reported that the 8 percent shift would not just be for FY26, but for each year of the five-year long Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that accompanies the annual budget request. After the statement was released, Breaking Defense obtained a portion of Hegseth's memo, which lists 17 'offsets' which 'may not be included by services and component in their eight percent decrease' recommendations. Those are: It's unclear what kind of programs will be targeted outside this list, although Salesses in his statement said the department will target 'unnecessary spending' like 'so-called &#8216;climate change' and other woke programs, as well as excessive bureaucracy.' It's also unclear if the decision not to exempt support for EUCOM, AFRICOM, CENTCOM or SOUTHCOM is a sign that those regions may be downplayed as priorities. It's not unusual for a new administration to take a look at the previous administration's planned budget, though the statement tonight would seem to indicate a greater shift than previous teams go for in their first budget request. This effort would seem to be a parallel but different one from the cuts expected to be pushed by the Elon Musk-led DOGE office, which arrived this week at the Pentagon. Those in defense circles are bracing for a wave of personnel cuts, perhaps as soon as this week, as probationary employees in the civilian workforce have been early targets of DOGE during their other stops. How the idea of cuts lines up with proposals in Congress to increase the department's budget by either $100 billion or $150 billion through the reconciliation process is unclear, nor is it clear how members of Congress will react to having programs — potentially major ones — in their districts impacted. It's also uncertain when the FY26 budget might actually be delivered to Congress.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-seeks-to-shift-50b-in-planned-funding-to-new-priorities-in-fy26/	2025-02-19T15:38:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/hegseth-brown-scaled-e1740007139471.jpg
Pentagon 14% of the way to zero trust compliance, faces challenges with ICAM, data tagging	The Network Enterprise Technology Command (NETCOM) &#8211; Army Department of Defense Information Networks (DoDIN-A) Cybersecurity Strategy uses Zero-Trust principles to protect critical Data, Applications, Assets, and Services (DAAS). (Photo by U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense is 14 percent of the way on its goal of having all enterprise networks zero trust compliant by the end of fiscal year 2027, a key official said Wednesday. 'Fourteen percent is a good start, but far from being done,' Col. Gary Kipe, chief of staff of the DoD’s zero trust portfolio management office, said during a panel at a CyberScoop event. He added that the 14 percent constitutes areas specifically where 'we could stop adversarial lateral movement within our network.' Kipe said there are two major deficiencies in the DoD’s zero trust capabilities keeping it from achieving that 100 percent readiness. The first is the lack of identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) tools — which perform constant checks to ensure that users are allowed to access the information they are trying to access. The second is the lack of automated data tagging that helps label and categorize data based on sensitivity, importance and other standards to facilitate better data management and protect the data from unauthorized users. 'We do have an optimistic but reasonable anticipation that we're going to have both of those by the end of this FY, which is critical,' Kipel said of the deficiencies. 'Then we'll be able to plan around it, resource it, proof of concept it and develop it further until we get to [20]27.' Kipe particularly harped on the important role data tagging plays in creating data centricity, which ultimately allows the DoD to share information on threats with the broader intelligence community, allies and partners, he explained. RELATED: Katie Arrington to head back into Pentagon as new CISO 'It's got to be interoperable between the DoD, [civilians in the federal government], the IC [intelligence community] and Five Eyes and other mission partner environments. We're not the only target that damn communists are trying to overcome,' Kipe said. 'They're trying to overcome freedom loving people around the world, and all of us are using the same data.' If such data tagging standards are not implemented, Kipe said 'it won’t matter because we will have lost the broader fight, and that is defending liberty around the world.' John Sahlin, the vice president of cyber solutions at General Dynamics Information Technology, echoed Kipe’s statements on the importance of data tagging leading to data centricity during the panel. 'Zero trust is about enabling a mission, and ultimately, we need to use that data collectively to pursue mission objectives, and those mission objectives include dangerous stuff,' Sahlin said, referencing Kipe’s anecdotes about the risk adversaries poses to democracy. He added that once the DoD can implement the 'basics' of data tagging and implementing zero trust at the enterprise level, it can start to more widely implement zero trust at the tactical edge — something the company demonstrated back in 2023. 'We need to be able to enable the mission commanders with the ability to make changes on the fly under what conditions and with whom we're sharing data, so that we can execute the mission,' Sahlin said. 'That's where it gets really interesting. If we get the basics right, then we could really do some cool stuff at the tactical edge.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-14-of-the-way-to-zero-trust-compliance-faces-challenges-with-icam-data-tagging/	2025-02-19T13:54:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/7974050-scaled.jpg
DoD needs to clarify Space Force roles and missions: Mitchell workshop	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon urgently needs to clarify the roles and missions of the Space Forceand how it relates to US Space Command, the Intelligence Community and the other military services,according to a new report from the Mitchell Institute. Only then will the newest military service be able to successfully articulate and advocate for its long-term needs to deter China with the US Congress, the executive branch and the American public, the report concludes. Those needs, the report stressed, include an explicit mandate and funding to develop and deploy 'offensive' weapons, as well as increased resources across the board. The report — 'Ensuring a Spacepower Advantage in Prolonged Competition: Findings and Recommendations from the Space Endurance Workshop' released today [PDF] — was the result of a two-day workshop involving 55 space experts from diverse backgrounds 'to examine how the United States, its allies, and partners can maintain an enduring spacepower advantage,' according to institute's website. The workshop also focused on a review of the 'theory of competitive endurance' put forward by Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman in 2023 to guide Space Force operations against six futuristic scenarios where US space power was challenged, and found it somewhat wanting. Charles Galbreath, one of the two Mitchell authors along with Jennifer Reeves, explained today that the problem with Saltzman's theory, identified during the workshop, is its focus on 'enduring' — resisting attacks via deterrence and resilience — rather than on 'winning.' 'The tenets of competitive endurance — responsible counterspace campaigning, domain awareness, resiliency in the architecture — those are solid lines of effort. It's kind of the wrapping, though, of competitive endurance, as opposed to a war winning concept, a war fighting strategy, that we think needs to change,' Galbreath said in response to a question from Breaking Defense during Mitchell's online rollout of the report. Key findings of the workshop included: The US Space Force Must Clearly Explain Its Roles and Missions. 'Failure to establish and convey these roles and missions could lead to confusion among the services, reduced funding from Congress, and a deterioration of national will to maintain leadership in space,' the report says. Thus, it adds, 'the Department of Defense needs to clearly define the roles and missions of the Space Force. Once defined, Space Force must pursue an aggressive and persistent campaign to communicate them.' Space Must Be Normalized as a Warfighting Domain. 'Normalizing space as a warfighting domain necessitates changes to policy, funding, understanding, and operational capabilities,' the report says. 'While some fear such developments could drive a destabilizing arms race in space, it is important to recognize that credible deterrence is the only viable path given adversary decisions. Peace through strength needs to become the new mantra for twenty-first century spacepower.' An Overreliance on Commercial Space May Be Detrimental. 'On one side, commercial space greatly expands access to rapid innovation and an increasing set of services available for integration. On the other, an overemphasis on the capabilities commercial entities can ostensibly provide detracts from the critical roles of the Space Force, which is dedicated to national space security in ways private entities are not,' the report explains. Guardians Must Adopt a Space Warfighting Mindset. 'The lack of defined and clearly articulated roles and missions, the lingering view of space as a benign domain, and the encroachment of commercial entities in space security roles have a compounding effect' on the way Guardians perceive themselves and their missions that undercut their ability to advocate the Space Force's criticality to future warfighting, the report finds. Improved Space Domain Awareness Is Critical. The report notes that each of the scenarios ran during the workshop 'underscored the importance' of space domain awareness, as well as the need to lower classification barriers to sharing space data with allies and partners. Allied and Partner Cooperation &amp; Integration Are Essential. 'Like the discussion on commercial space capabilities, workshop participants asserted that the Space Force needed to take a proactive leadership role in defining what effects and necessary contributions each ally and partner could provide,' the report says. Further, it recommends that the service expand force integration beyond the current 5 Eyes partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), up the number of Guardians working on partnerships, increase combined force exercises and 'enable' more space-related foreign military sales. Improved Space Warfighting Training Infrastructure is a Critical Enabler. Not only do the Space Force and SPACECOM need improved training capabilities and infrastructure, including 'advanced simulators,' for their own use, but also require the ability to allow allies and partners to train in tandem with Guardians. International Norms Are Key to Responsible Space Behaviors. 'By proactively defining which actions in space are acceptable and which will lead to the escalation of tensions, the United States will be positioned to rally international support to counter hostilities,' the report asserts. Reeves told Mitchell's online audience today that the institute will follow-up with another workshop in the October timeframe focusing specifically on what conflict in space might look like. Galbreath elaborated that the workshop will be held at the unclassified level, even though that will 'create some some tension for many people.' Doing so, he said, will allow 'thorough discussions' about, &#8216;What does space conflict mean? Where do we draw the line between competition and conflict? &#8230; Is there a tripwire for space'?' The goal, he added, is 'expanding the the field of thinking in that area, and looking at how if we ever do go to conflict, can we end it as quickly as possible on terms that are favor favorable to United States and our allies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-needs-to-clarify-space-force-roles-and-missions-mitchell-workshop/	2025-02-19T13:00:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240717_DVIDS_saltzman_speech_8238081-scaled-e1721238990255.jpg
Securing data at rest on Edge devices with layered protection	Keeping sensitive and classified mission data safe isn’t optional—it’s essential. Cyber threats are more sophisticated, compliance requirements are stricter than ever, and organizations must secure data across a growing mix of traditional and unconventional devices. From endpoint systems, including PCs and servers, to industrial control systems and unmanned vehicles, every device that collects, processes, and stores sensitive information is a potential target. Without a multi-layered approach to security, organizations risk unauthorized data access, potentially exposing critical mission information. To meet compliance requirements effectively, organizations must adopt an integrated security framework that protects data at rest while the device is in operation and at end of life. The White House, NSA, NIAP, and DISA have implemented requirements for encryption and secure authentication and access controls to meet compliance requirements, including CSfC for DAR, FIPs and EO 14028. However, compliance is only part of the equation—security measures also need to be practical, ensuring personnel can work efficiently while keeping data protected. Unfortunately, many traditional security methods fall short against today’s evolving threats. Risks include: To address these challenges, agencies must ensure data security at every layer, leveraging software and hardware-based solutions. The first line of defense in securing data at rest is ensuring that encryption and authentication mechanisms are robust and tamper-proof. Other data security products’ protection ceases once a device is activated. But mission data needs to be protected when a device is operational with capabilities to mitigate risks, including unauthorized data extraction, data tampering and malicious insiders. The development of quantum-computing capabilities makes effective data sanitization a necessity Cigent offers a comprehensive solution that secures data at rest throughout its entire lifecycle.

In response to Viasat suit, SDA will recompete 10-satellite award to Tyvak	Space Development Agency graphic WASHINGTON — As a result of a lawsuit by Viasat, the Department of the Air Force has agreed to revoke a Space Development Agency award to Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems worth $254 million for 10 experimental fire-control satellites, and reopen bidding. Documents filed on Feb. 14 in the US Court of Federal Claims by the Air Force, first reported by Aviation Week, further state that SDA's companion contract to York Space Systems — worth $170 million for 10 Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) Gamma variant prototype space vehicles — will not be affected. The court filings do not provide a proposed schedule for the new bid process, but do reveal that it will be managed by officials who were not involved in overseeing the original contract awards. Neither the Space Development Agency nor the Air Force responded by press time to inquiries about the proposed resolution of the protest. As first reported by Breaking Defense, the Viasat bid protest filed in September was the trigger for the Air Force's Jan. 16 decision to place SDA Director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. The Feb. 14 court documents state that an internal Air Force evaluation determined that an unnamed 'SDA employee,' in advance of the Gamma contract award, revealed to Tyvak that its bid price 'was the second highest and would not be selected for award.' This action was determined by the senior Air Force official in charge of the review, Maj. Gen. Alice Trevino, to be a violation of the Procurement Integrity Act that regulates government contracting practices. The documents note that the rebidding process was deemed necessary by SDA because the requirement for the 10 Gamma vehicles awarded to Tyvak, now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, remains crucial to the success of its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture of low Earth orbit satellites — but with the caveat that a substantial delay in the process and/or increased costs could cause a reevaluation of that requirement and the need for a new competition. While SDA has explained that the Gamma satellites will not be part of the operational Transport Layer of data relay satellites, the agency has said that they instead are part of its efforts to develop fire control capabilities for missile defense and the experimental FOO Fighter program. Further, such fire control capabilities could be a key part of SDA's contribution to the Trump administration's newly planned Iron Dome for America missile defense shield. Attorneys for Tyvak and York have accepted the Air Force's plan, the Air Force court filings state. However, the documents add that Viasat had not responded to the proposal as of the time of their filing. 'Viasat does not comment on ongoing filings and litigation as matter of policy,' a spokesperson for the company told Breaking Defense today. 'York is a strong supporter of transparency and the integrity of the USG’s selection process. We are glad the investigation made public some of its findings that clearly show York was not involved in any wrongdoing, and support the integrity of our award on merits,' a spokesperson for the company said today. Lockheed Martin did not respond by press time to a request for comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/in-response-to-viasat-suit-sda-will-recompete-10-satellite-award-to-tyvak/	2025-02-19T11:17:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-07-at-1.42.29-PM.png
Katie Arrington to head back into Pentagon as new CISO	Chief Information Security Officer for Acquisitions Katie Arrington delivers a keynote speech during the Military Satellite Communications Digital Week, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Dec. 8, 2020. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — Former chief information security officer (CISO) for acquisition and sustainment at the Department of Defense is headed back to the Pentagon — this time as DoD's CISO — following her previous suspension from the department for allegedly disclosing classified data. Katie Arrington served as a state lawmaker for South Carolina and had an unsuccessful bid for Congress before taking her post in 2019 as the chief information officer for A&amp;S during President Donald Trump’s first administration. She played an active role in standing up the department’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program before she was put on administrative leave in May 2021 after the National Security Agency suspended her security clearance for allegedly sharing top secret information to a defense contractor. Arrington announced her new role on Tuesday night with a LinkedIn post. Following Arrington’s suspension, she resigned in February 2022 because of the DoD’s decision to move the CMMC program from the office of acquisition and sustainment to its Chief Information Office, according to a resignation letter obtained by SC Media. She contended in the letter that her suspension was 'politically influenced' and maintained that such claims of disclosing classified information were false. The day after Arrington resigned from the Pentagon, she announced a second bid for Congress which she subsequently lost to Republican South Carolina House lawmaker Nancy Mace. The DoD did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the status of Arrington’s ability to obtain a security clearance or the status of the investigation into the accusations that she shared classified information. The department also did not respond to comment on Arrington’s claims that the investigation was 'politically influenced.' The NSA deferred to the DoD for comment. According to a 2022 report from Federal News Network, Arrington’s attorney, Mark Zaid, said Arrington was, as of then, still challenging the government’s decision to suspend her security clearance and the following effort to permanently revoke it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/katie-arrington-to-head-back-into-pentagon-as-new-ciso/	2025-02-19T09:55:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/6447505-scaled-e1739982663234.jpg
DARPA plans ‘major expansion’ of quantum computing push next month	A graphic concept of quantum technology depicts two ships at sea in the background and a large, stylized molecule in the foreground. (U.S. Navy illustration by NIWC Pacific/Released.) WASHINGTON — The self-proclaimed 'quantum skeptic' heading DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) tells Breaking Defense he is 'pleasantly surprised' by how many companies’ quantum computing plans look feasible — and as a result, he’s weeks away from announcing a slew of new awards. The point of the QBI program is not to pay the private sector to develop the tech, which they’re already doing on their own, according to program manager Joe Altepeter. Instead, in essence, a company that wins a QBI award gets access to DARPA’s interagency team of expert testers and devil’s advocates, serving as an independent outside check to make sure that they’re on a practical path. Tech titan Microsoft and specialist startup PsiQuantum have already won contracts for the initial, pilot-project version of the program, known clunkily as Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing or US2QC. ('You can tell why we changed it to ‘QBI,’' Altepeter said). Two other companies, Atom Computing and QC82, also won preliminary, short-term grants in 2023, but their proposals didn’t survive subsequent rounds of more intensive scrutiny. So only two of four competing firms made it all the way through the three-phase process to win one of the long-term 'Stage C' contracts announced Feb. 6. That 50 percent success rate is actually much better than Altepeter expected. 'That was definitely surprising,' he told Breaking Defense. 'I didn't think anybody was going to make it to Stage C. But that's why we do this, to get surprised.' So a 'major expansion' to 'bring in many more companies' is now underway, Altepeter said. 'We've gotten finished with source selection [and] sent out letters inviting all the companies who've made it into stage A to negotiate a contract…. My best guess is late March, we're going to have the vast majority of those contracts signed.' RELATED: Pentagon info officer’s top priority: Upgrading cryptography ahead of quantum-enabled hackers In this new round of competition, once again, Altepeter said many competitors exceeded his expectations for how far along their tech is and how feasible their plans are to build reliable, practical, and usefully powerful quantum computers. As a result, 'we'll have the chance to kick the tires on a lot more companies,' he said. 'A year from now, we’ll know a lot more about if this industry is for real or not.' How does that timeline work? The process is meant to be flexible, with the schedule accommodating what companies think is required, and companies that fail at one stage of the evaluation — like Atom and QC82 — are welcome to come back for a second shot. But overall, Altepeter said, QBI goes like this: At each stage, the size and cost of the DARPA team roughly doubles, Altepeter said. Currently, it consists of roughly 200 quantum experts from across the government — including Energy Department labs like Los Alamos as well as Defense Department labs like the Air Force Research Laboratory — and government-funded research centers, such as Johns Hopkins. (These personnel will remain with their home organization but spend roughly 60 to 70 percent of their time on DARPA quantum work). The idea, he said, is to get independent, expert feedback from professionals with no financial stake in the outcome either way. With new technologies, it’s all too easy to get sucked in by hype cycles and impressive statistics, Altepeter said, so it’s critical, and difficult, to figure out the right way to measure progress. Track the wrong metrics, he warned, and you end up with the equivalent of assessing a space-launch program by highest altitude achieved to date, a superficially reasonable approach that ends up grading grifters who can climb a ladder over professionals conducting static rocket-motor tests. 'We are building by far the best, largest test and evaluation team for quantum computing on the planet,' Altepeter summed up. '[We’re] planning for this to be a $1 billion-plus program.' This kind of careful evaluation isn’t cheap, he acknowledged, and if too many companies prove qualified, he may not have enough funding to give all of them awards. 'It’s a double-edged sword,' Altepeter said. 'I'm pleasantly surprised that these companies were doing so well. I also worry that we couldn't eliminate as many companies, because we're definitely trying to eliminate companies.' Could the Trump Administration's controversial ongoing cuts to government agencies, spearheaded by Elon Musk's DOGE, cramp or cripple the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative just as it's trying to grow? Altepeter demurred on those 'bigger-scope&#8230;budget issues.' That said, when it comes to federal funding, 'it's always a danger that there are other priorities that take precedence,' he said. 'But my marching orders are the same as they have been since we started this&#8230;which is to sprint as fast as possible and get ready for a world-changing program.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/darpa-plans-major-expansion-of-quantum-computing-push-next-month/	2025-02-19T09:01:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/quantumn-navy-e1739907798420.jpg
