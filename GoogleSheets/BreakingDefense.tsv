Emirati consortium to launch first satellite of Sirb constellation by late 2026, early 2027: Exec	A rendering of the view of the Middle East from Space. (NASA via Getty) BEIRUT — An industry team tasked with launching a small satellite constellation for the United Arab Emirates wants to get its first bird into low Earth orbit (LEO) as early as the end of next year or early 2027, according to a key industry executive. The industry consortium is in the 'last stages' of selecting a launch partner from the three finalists out of an original 10 international entities that had been under consideration, Waleid Al Mesmari, president of the space and cyber tech division of the sprawling Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group, told Breaking Defense last month. EDGE's new space-focused subsidiary FADA is the leader of the consortium, which also includes national entities Space 42, the National Space Science and Technology Center and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. The goal of the project, called Sirb in a reference to the Arabic term for flock of birds, is to eventually put three UAE-made synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites into LEO to 'address the critical need for better environmental and land usage monitoring, data collection and analysis to meet today’s global challenges,' according to the UAE Space Agency. 'The planned satellites will be able to create highly detailed and complex radar ‘images’ of land use, ice cover, surface changes and characterization, with a wide range of scientific, civil and commercial applications,' the agency says in an online fact sheet. But Al Mesmari said the information acquired through the constellation will have have 'defense and national security applications' as well. FADA, which means space in Arabic, was only established in September 2024 as the first endeavor into space by EDGE, a conglomerate of nearly 30 subsidiaries with interests in everything from small arms to unmanned systems to armored vehicles. 'When it comes to establishment of FADA, [it is] to have a sovereign capability that can protect and preserve the prosperous future [of UAE] that has been built over the last 50 years,' Al Mesmari told Breaking Defense. He said that FADA aims to have 'a national capacity building program that can translate, and lead the space technological stack, enabling us to have a sovereign capability at the end.' He added that FADA is one of the companies that will contribute to UAE’s space strategy 2030, focused on localizing technology in UAE. During the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) 2025, during which Breaking Defense spoke to Al Mesmari, FADA said it had launched a 'hyper-smart platform' dubbed TACTICA, which is an AI-based software that 'processes multi-source intelligence- including satellite imagery, signals intelligence, sensor data, and open-source information.' Al Mesmari expected that FADA 'will be a global player [in the space sector] and that's our focus.' He concluded that FADA is 'a vertically integrated company, which means that we will focus on building capabilities across the three streams: space platforms [including] space payloads [and] manufacturing capabilities, remote sensing, [which include] capabilities on the ground with the different applications, [and] space situational awareness or space domain awareness.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/emirati-consortium-to-launch-first-satellite-of-sirb-constellation-by-late-2026-early-2027-exec/	2025-03-10T08:32:47-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250228_earth_from_space_generic_GettyImages-2170815486-e1740757787949.jpg
Amid US-European strain, Lithuanian defense minister cements ties with US industry ‘giants’	Lithuanian Minister of Defense, Dovile Sakaliene, speaks to the press on Jan. 22, 2025 in Vilnius. (Photo by Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As Europe rushes to reasses its reliance on American security guarantees and to dramatically boost military spending, Lithuania's defense minister personally worked to cement ties not only with US policymakers but with another key constituency: US defense contractors. Armed with a red folder containing a veritable shopping list of defense systems and billions of dollars to pay for them, Dovilė Šakalienė said she recently met with executives from major firms, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, RTX and AM General. The meetings, she said, were part of a broader effort to speedily boost Lithuania's defense capability in the face of an ever-increasing threat from Russia — and to draw the influential firms closer to Vilnius. Further Russian aggression beyond Ukraine, including potentially in Lithuania, 'worries us,' Šakalienė told reporters in a roundtable at the Lithuanian embassy Friday. 'That's why we are really pushing forward with our military capability plans, with our defense capacity-building, infrastructure and personnel and acquisitions, from weapons to ammo, building factories, defense industries &#8230; 'And actually all the good talks that I had with defense industry giants in the United States is something that, in my opinion, is a very positive element in our preparation,' she said. 'I'm very happy about it, these meetings. &#8230; We require a lot from them.' Šakalienė said Lithuania has done $2 billion-worth of business with American defense firms in the past three years and has 'need' for 'at least $8 billion' more in 'coming years' — a consequence of Vilnius's decision in January to boost defense spending to 5 to 6 percent of its GDP beginning in 2026. 'And we are happy to build factories together. We are happy to [be] part of [the] supply chain. And that's what we discussed,' she said, adding that the companies have been invited to come to Lithuania to explore on-the-ground opportunities there. 'Actually I feel like the United States defense industry feels that partnership with European countries and specifically with Lithuania is something that is mutually beneficial. We are a market and we are a partner in defense, so I hope it works.'

(U.S Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Kanoa Thomas) The push to forging deeper ties with US industry also builds off Lithuania's Memorandum of Understanding with Northrop Grumman last year, which involves the manufacturer supporting local suppliers in the production of medium-caliber ammunition for Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). Sakaliene noted that Lithuania already has Europe's largest fleet of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, those made by Oshkosh Defense. Later in the discussion when asked by Breaking Defense exactly what Lithuania planned to spend the money on, Šakalienė held up a red manila folder. 'We want to develop a full-fledged capacity and capability to be able to work very well with the joint NATO forces, with our sister divisions, with capabilities that the United States will be providing, according to regional defense plans,' she said. 'So we are developing our land forces, our air defense, our engineering capabilities, and it's from rockets and air defense systems, artillery systems, helicopters, radars, drones &#8230; and additional enablers.' Sitting beside Šakalienė, Ministry of Defense spokesperson Ignas Grinevičius added, 'And we're paying in advance to get it quicker, as soon as possible.' Lithuania's strategic approach to strengthening business with the US comes amid a decisive shift by the European Union to rearm the continent at pace by investing more in the region's defense industry and while member states and other NATO allies rethink equipment planning decisions in light of Washington's pivot to Russia. In Lithuania, a country of 2.9 million that has been occupied by Russian forces twice in modern times, to even question the idea of US security protection is 'extremely sensitive,' Šakalienė said elsewhere in the talk. She said 'everyone' takes US security guarantees, or aid in the 'worst case scenario' as 'vital,' as a 'life-or-death issue.' Speaking days after the disastrous White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, US President Donald Trump and his top officials and the subsequent freezing of US military aid and intelligence sharing to Kyiv, Šakalienė said there are 'different interpretations' of America's current stance towards European security. She acknowledged that it was all 'quite stressful' for her countrymen, but she at least has been heartened by two factors: the developments have shocked Europe into a keen understanding that they must do more for their own security — for which Šakalienė said Lithuania has been long ahead of the curve — and that at least in his term so far as president, Trump has not said he would not honor America's commitments to the Baltic states. Trump did say last week that if NATO members 'don't pay,' the US would not come to their defense. But the Baltic nations are among NATO members who spend the most on defense by GDP and would presumably be safe from such a threat. As for a potential ceasefire deal for the Ukraine conflict, Šakalienė floated the idea that the West should seize $200 billion in frozen Russian assets (elsewhere reported as €200 billion or $216.7 billion) to use as a 'safeguard' for any agreement. Added Larger European nations are divided over the issue. The UK has consistently said the assets should be unlocked by the West but France and Germany have raised objections, with Paris stressing that any such decision risks breaching sovereign asset immunity and curb EU investments from other foreign powers. Holding those assets in the balance 'could be a very viable and sensible thing to do,' said Šakalienė. 'Putin has not yet tried the method of keeping the agreement, of not violating treaties. So maybe that would be a good safeguard to keep his word for the first time.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-us-european-strain-lithuanian-defense-minister-cements-ties-with-us-industry-giants/	2025-03-10T07:02:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250309_lithuanian_defmin_bigger_GettyImages-2194656497-scaled-e1741537479453.jpg
Deputy defense secretary nominee has ‘clear conflict of interest’ with Ligado lawsuit: Sen. Warren	Nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen A. Feinberg listens to the opening remarks of a Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C., Feb. 25, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is raising concerns with deputy defense secretary nominee Stephen Feinberg’s ties to Ligado Networks, arguing that Feinberg’s family or the private equity firm he founded could financially benefit from the ongoing lawsuit between the communications company and the US government. Feinberg’s Cerberus Capital Management owns about 14 percent of the communications company’s debt and 24 percent of its preferred stock, according to court documents cited by Warren in a March 9 letter to Feinberg, exclusively obtained by Breaking Defense. Ligado, now going through bankruptcy proceedings, is engaged in a $39 billion lawsuit against the US government over claims that officials at the Departments of Defense and Commerce took 'unlawful actions' to, in effect, improperly seize without compensation the firm’s L-band spectrum. That situation could create a 'huge conflict of interest' should Feinberg become the department’s No. 2 official, wrote Warren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'As the second-in-command at the Pentagon, you would have the power to influence the DoD’s posture towards the Ligado lawsuit. If the government loses or settles the case, Cerberus could profit as it ‘would most likely receive some portion of the settlement proceeds,’ according to your responses to my questions for the record,' she stated. Feinberg’s family could also potentially make money from the outcome of the Ligado lawsuit, Warren said, as Feinberg has indicated he could divest his interest in Cerberus through a gift to one or more irrevocable trusts established for his adult children. 'This is a clear conflict of interest, as you could deal your former company — and your adult children — a multi-billion-dollar windfall at the expense of American taxpayers,' she wrote. Warren states that Feinberg can address this issue by amending his ethics agreement to recuse himself from matters related to Ligado and its lawsuit with the Defense Department. She also requests that Feinberg answer a series of questions by March 24 about his financial interests in Ligado, including whether he will divest any holdings in the company and how big a settlement is required for Cerberus to break even on its investment in Ligado. RELATED: Not on the same wavelength: Trump inherits spectrum fight between DoD, commercial industry Feinberg’s nomination could be confirmed by the Senate as early as this week, following a Feb. 25 confirmation hearing where SASC Democrats pressed him on the Trump administration’s planned cuts to the Pentagon’s civilian workforce. He was also asked about ongoing debate over whether the Defense Department be forced to vacate or share the lower 3 GigaHertz band and the 7-8 GHz band with commercial communications companies, responding that the Defense Department’s spectrum position must be protected. 'We need spectrum to defend our country. We also need commercial use of it to develop the technologies that will defend our country,' he said. 'The best solution is sharing, but we have to get it right and make sure sharing can be done without risk.' In an earlier Feb. 17 letter, Warren laid out concerns about Feinberg’s financial interests, stating that his holdings in Cerberus — which owns and invests in a number of defense-related companies, such as Stratolaunch and Navistar Defense — could pose a conflict of interest if not properly divested. In ethics documents submitted on Feb. 18, Feinberg said he would 'divest all of my interests in Cerberus including, but not limited to, my equity interest, carried interest, incentive fees/allocations, and capital commitments' prior to assuming the role of the deputy secretary of defense. He also said 'neither my wife nor I have any financial interest' in the trusts of his adult children and that he would not be the trustee for any of those trusts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/deputy-defense-secretary-nominee-has-clear-conflict-of-interest-with-ligado-lawsuit-sen-warren/	2025-03-10T03:00:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/8885252-1-scaled-e1741566340510.jpg
SDA again postpones launch of first ‘operational’ data relay, missile warning satellites	SDA's Tranche 1 launches are now anticipated to begin in summer 2025, starting with satellites for the Transport Layer. (Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Space Development Agency (SDA) today announced it is again postponing launch of its first-generation 'operational' satellites designed to provide data relay and missile warning/tracking, with a first lift-off now planned for 'late summer.' The launch setback — which represents yet another piece of bad news for the embattled agency — was recently decided by SDA's current leadership, 'in conjunction with' that of the Space Force, an SDA official told reporters today. William Blauser, former deputy head of the department’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), currently is the acting head of SDA, following the Jan. 16 suspension of Director Derek Tournear over alleged mismanagement of a contract award. SDA originally had hoped to begin launching the Tranche 1 Transport and Tracking Layer constellations for its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) stationed in low Earth orbit (LEO) in September 2024. That date was subsequently pushed back a few months to either very late 2024 or early 2025. Tranche 1 will include a total of 158 satellites, according to an SDA fact sheet [PDF]: 126 satellites in the data relay Transport Layer, 28 missile warning/tracking satellites in the Tracking Layer, and 4 'missile defense demonstration' satellites. The first launch will involve Transport Layer birds, an SDA official told reporters today, but the agency is not yet sure how many satellites will go up and whether satellites from all of the three current vendors will be included. Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and start-up York Space Systems all won shares of a $1.8 billion contract award in February 2022. The plan, according to the SDA announcement, is to then undertake one launch per month until the all the Transport and Tracking Layer satellites are on-orbit. 'SDA continues to aggressively work toward the first Tranche 1 launch; however, as we progress through a normal assembly, integration, and testing campaign, with the added challenge of late supplier deliveries, it has become clear additional time is required for system readiness to meet the Tranche 1 minimum viable capability,' the agency said. The SDA official acknowledged that one of the problems pushing back the Tranche 1 launch has been the development of optical communications terminals (OCTs) — an issue highlighted in a recent report from the Government Accountability Office. Laser links are foundational to the workings of the PWSA, which is being designed as a 'mesh' network that uses laser links to rapidly transfer data among themselves — and eventually to ground stations. 'OCT terminals is definitely a challenge,' the official said. 'We're working to continue to help scale that and address any hang ups there.' Other problems have included supplies of propulsion units and vendor difficulties in getting 'approvals' for 'encryption devices,' the SDA official noted. (While the SDA official declined to elaborate on the latter issue, the National Security Agency is charged with approving encryption devices used by the Defense Department and other national security agencies.) Despite the launch delays, the SDA announcement stressed that the agency still intends to be able to provide region-by-region coverage for users in the field early in 2027. 'SDA is committed to completing on-orbit test and checkout of the initial satellites by mid-2026 and delivering the entire initial warfighting capability of the PWSA in early calendar year 2027, consistent with warfighter expectations,' the announcement said. 'SDA’s top priority is to quickly deliver capabilities promised to the warfighter. Launch is a major milestone but one in a much larger path to delivering viable capabilities. Our goal remains to rapidly deliver functional capabilities with a high degree of operational confidence,' it added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/sda-again-postpones-launch-of-first-operational-data-relay-missile-warning-satellites/	2025-03-07T13:18:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Northrop-Grummans-participation-in-SDAs-Tranche-1-Transport-Layer-program-went-from-award-to-passing-Critical-Design-Review-in-13-months.-1-e1741380771871.jpg
NGA suspends Ukraine’s access to commercial satellite imagery	Analysts at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Photo: NGA) WASHINGTON — The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has cut off Ukraine's access to commercial satellite imagery collected by the US government, in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to 'pause' the flow of US intelligence and military aid to Kyiv. 'In accordance with the Administration’s directive on support to Ukraine, NGA has temporarily suspended access to GEGD, which is the agency’s primary portal for accessing commercial imagery purchased by the U.S. government,' an agency spokesperson told Breaking Defense today. The NGA shares access to 'map-ready, unclassified imagery' for more than 55 foreign partner nations, as well as with the Defense Department and other US federal agencies via the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery (GEGD) system. However, several industry sources said that their companies have not been blocked by NRO from taking pictures over Ukraine. Nor, these sources point out, historically has the NRO ever used its so-called 'shutter control' power to block sales of commercial imagery abroad. In other words, while GEGD information will no longer flow to Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is still able to purchase information direct from commercial providers — at least for the moment. Satellite imagery company Maxar is the prime contractor for GEGD, and a spokesperson for the company confirmed Ukraine's suspension today in an email to Breaking Defense. 'Maxar has contracts with the U.S. government and dozens of allied and partner nations around the world to provide satellite imagery and other geospatial data. Each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data. 'One of those contracts is GEGD (the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery program), a U.S. government program that provides access to commercial satellite imagery that has been tasked and collected by the U.S. government. The U.S. government has decided to temporarily suspend Ukrainian accounts in GEGD,' the spokesperson said. G-EGD has been running since 2011, and ingests unclassified geospatial intelligence from a wide variety of sources for more than 400,000 users domestically and abroad — including from US and foreign commercial satellite imagery providers, through contracts with the National Reconnaissance Office's Electro-Optical Commercial Layer program. 'GEGD is hosted by Maxar, but it ingests data from a variety of sources,' the NGA spokesperson said. NGA is the US Intelligence Community's 'functional manager' for geospatial intelligence, responsible for gathering data from a variety of sensors, fusing that data and providing products such as maps to the US military, POTUS, US civil agencies, and allied/partner nations. NRO is responsible for the US government's fleet of spy satellites, and also for buying commercial satellite imagery for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. 'We take our contractual commitments very seriously, and there is no change to other Maxar customer programs,' the Maxar spokesperson stressed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/nga-suspends-ukraines-access-to-commercial-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-07T10:09:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/NGA-analysts-e1741370246953.jpeg
Hegseth signs memo pushing forward Software Acquisition Pathway expansion	President Donald Trump, Pete Hegseth, US secretary of defense, and Howard Lutnick, US commerce secretary, during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Pentagon officials are launching forward with plans to expand the use of the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) and throw additional work towards the Defense Innovation Unit, now that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has officially issued new guidance. 'Right now, the way the Pentagon buys software is slow, outdated and filled with bureaucracy. Meanwhile, our adversaries are moving fast' one defense official told reporters today on a phone call. 'This memo is the beginning to fix that [by] cutting red tape, working more with private industry, getting cutting edge software into the hands of our warfighters quickly before the enemy can adapt.' Breaking Defense first reported on the draft memo late last month and the version with Hegseth’s signature, dated March 6, is nearly identical. In it, the newly minted secretary calls on the department to adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway, a practice created in 2020 to accelerate software development by implementing best practices from the private sector. At its core, SWP is a streamlined method for procuring software programs bespoke to DoD requirements. Through the SWP, organizations can deploy capabilities into platforms within six months or less. DoD has previously stated that the goal is to speed this process up into hours or days. Hegseth also directs the use of Commercial Solutions Openings (CSOs) and Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs) as the 'default solicitation' and award avenue for acquiring capabilities. The undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, alongside the DIU director, he adds, now has 30 days to develop and submit an implementation plan on how to best utilize those practices. 'One of the biggest changes is using flexible contracting tools, CSOs and OTAs, to speed up innovation and acquisition and the reason this works better — instead of spending years writing detailed requirements and going through a rigid &#8230; one-size-fits-all process — we can tap into the best tech available right now, prototype it fast and get it to the field quickly, if it works,' the defense official added. 'So bottom line, [we are] cutting out middlemen. Software companies make software, we're going to buy software from software companies.' A second defense official noted that the middleman in that situation isn’t the big defense primes but the 'bureaucratic red tape' that gets in the way of capability development to be accessible to a program of record. That second defense official also noted that there are currently 82 programs in the SWP that range from command and control and decision support to cyber and embedded weapon systems. As the Pentagon crafts the implementation plan, that figure is expected to soar, but the official noted that any change will likely be applied to new programs or ones where there is a 'natural transition point.' 'The implementation plan is going to navigate and clarify these use cases of how to move into the software acquisition pathway,' the second official added. As for how it will impact the service officials tasked with buying weapons, a third defense official said the vision is for them to lean more heavily on DIU going forward. For example, the Army could ask DIU to partner up and let DIU move out on a CSO or OTA. 'We expect an uptick in sort of a demand for DIU projects,' the third official explained. 'The more important way in which this will impact DIU is that we think the real path to scale is to train and educate other acquisition professionals so that they can also use … the model, rather than just relying on DIU to do it for them,' the third official added. One Army leader that viewed a draft version of the memo said his service is always looking for better ways to acquire software. However, he said it is not yet clear how the change will trickle down. 'What I don't want to do is over the constraining on anything,' the Army official told Breaking Defense last month.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/hegseth-signs-memo-pushing-forward-software-acquisition-pathway-expansion/	2025-03-07T10:00:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/hegseth-trump-scaled-e1740762854609.jpg

New Australian submarine industrial base strategy calls for $30 billion AUD investment	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023. A US Navy Virginia-class submarine arrived at HMAS Stirling for a scheduled port visit as part of routine patrols in the Indo-Pacific region. (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Australian government this week released a new strategy document calling for $30 billion AUD ($19 billion USD) in investment to prepare its domestic industrial base to support future nuclear-powered submarines built through the trilateral security pact AUKUS. 'Developing the ability to build, sustain and operate conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines is also one of the most significant industrial undertakings in Australia’s history,' according to the document. 'We plan to achieve an ambitious uplift of Australia’s military and industrial capability, which has never been done under the timeframes of the optimal pathway announced in March 2023.' The strategy seeks to address four 'major hurdles' that the government says it has identified through consultations with industry: uncertainty of demand for goods and services; issues with attracting industrial base investment; regulatory complexity; and workforce shortages. The Australian government will aim to create 20,000 jobs over 30 years through what the document characterizes as a 'whole-of-nation undertaking.' 'The scale, complexity and technology requirements of the program also mean the Australian Submarine Industrial Base will need to work with trusted United Kingdom and United States partners to deliver products and services across the life of the [nuclear-powered submarine] program,' according to the document. As part of the government’s new strategy, it is also launching a pilot program that will have American submarine builder HII work with Australian companies to qualify those companies and their products for incorporation into the Virginia-class submarine program's supply chain. 'HII Australia has been awarded a contract to deliver the pilot program over the next two years, with an initial value of $9.6 million and the option to extend based on achievement,' Australia’s Department of Defence said in a March 6 statement. The pilot will be executed in partnership with H&amp;B Defence, a joint venture between HII and the UK aerospace and defense firm Babcock. 'This contract represents a significant milestone in building a resilient and globally integrated supply chain for nuclear-powered submarines,' said HII President and CEO Chris Kastner said in a statement this week. 'HII has a long history of working with suppliers to ensure they meet the highest standards in safety, security, and performance. We welcome Australian partners to help build out this critical nuclear shipbuilding capability and ensure the long-term success of AUKUS.' In addition to building what has been dubbed 'SSN-AUKUS,' Australia is also expected to purchase, maintain and operate either three or five Virginia-class submarines as part of AUKUS.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/new-australian-submarine-industrial-base-strategy-calls-for-30-billion-aud-investment/	2025-03-07T08:58:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/virginia-australia-scaled-e1723223982442.jpg
Army taps Textron’s Ripsaw M3 for Robotic Combat Vehicle program, sources say	An image of Textron's Ripsaw M3 tech demonstrator. (Textron) WASHINGTON — Textron Systems’s Ripsaw 3 has won the US Army’s latest Robotic Combat Vehicle competition, according to a trio of sources familiar with the program. The service isn’t expected to formally announce that decision until later this month, but vendors have been notified. However, sources inside industry and the Army told Breaking Defense that Textron is the victor. When asked about the decision, an Army spokesperson declined to comment on whether a selection had been made said it is still an 'ongoing competition until awards are finalized.' Textron did not immediately respond to questions about the contract decision, but the company has previously touted its offering. 'The Ripsaw M3 leverages a modular open systems architecture (MOSA) design and common chassis to support a variety of interchangeable payloads from a basic flat-top deck configuration,' the company wrote in a press release last year. 'A rugged and reliable RCV platform, the vehicle is designed to meet Army requirements while preserving transportability and mission versatility.' Under an earlier RCV iteration with three vehicle sizes — light, medium and heavy — Textron’s Ripsaw M5 secured the medium prototyping contract. However, the service changed course and relaunched a new competition for just one RCV size. It then selected Textron, along with McQ, General Dynamics Land Systems and Oshkosh Defense, to proceed and awarded them with a combined total of $24.7 million for the first phase of the project. Each team was then tasked with delivering two RCV prototypes by August 2024 for mobility testing and soldier touchpoints. Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems, told Breaking Defense last year that the service would then use those findings to help select a single company to proceed with Phase II this year, which would mean the winner would be finalizing designs and delivering up to nine prototypes by fiscal 2026. Service leaders would then be set up to decide how to proceed with the program in FY27, according to budget justification documents and previous Army statements. If it’s greenlit to proceed, soldiers could be using the unmanned vehicles the following year. It’s not clear if this timeline still holds today given budgeting plans and a new administration. New Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's call to reallocate billions in defense spending does have a carveout for 'autonomous systems,' but doesn't specifically mention ground vehicles. Also, the vehicle itself is only half the challenge when it comes to the RCV program. Leaders are grappling with just how much autonomy early vehicles will have, the number of soldiers required to remotely control them and what payloads they will carry first. The service is poised to continue working through some of those question marks over the coming years including at Fort Irwin, Calif., this month when RCVs and other autonomous weapons take centerstage at the Project Convergence Capstone 5 event. Alex Miller, the Army Chief’s Chief Technology Officer, also told reporters last month that these new autonomous prototypes will play a significant role in the service’s plans for 'transformation in contact' 2.0 this year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/army-taps-textrons-ripsaw-m3-for-robotic-combat-vehicle-program-sources-say/	2025-03-07T07:30:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/Land-M3-Ripsaw-R-Tech-Demonstrator-scaled-e1695315350508.jpg
Army to soldiers: Get small drones back in the air, don’t worry about the red tape (as much)	A soldier flies a Red Cat quadcopter in this artist's rendering. (Red Cat) WASHINGTON — The US Army is preparing a new memo to clarify the rules for flying — and losing — smaller drones in hopes of convincing soldiers and commanders that they need not fear paperwork so much that they leave the surveillance and weapons systems on shelves, officials told Breaking Defense. In October Breaking Defense reported that in the middle of a drone-dominated revolution in ground combat, some US servicemembers were hesitant to power up smaller unmanned aerial system (UAS), fearful of the seemingly inevitable 'non-expendable property' investigation that would come if a break in communications, dead battery, gust of wind or sturdy tree limb took the UAS out of commission down range. 'If you lose [a drone] or crash it or break it, you have to do this full-on investigation, an investigating officer has to be appointed,' Col. Nick Ryan, director of the Army Capability Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, said in the original report. 'They do a full investigation [and] a report, to determine if the soldier is liable, and if the soldier … has to get docked pay.' One drone, Ryan said then, was known as 'the flying FLIPL and they never wanted to fly it.' FLIPL stands for Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss. To avoid such a fate, soldiers may put themselves at risk in combat zones to recover the platforms, Ryan said. Moreover, the formal investigation can cost more than the drone itself. Greg Besaw, a senior logistics staff officer, told Breaking Defense recently that the service can spend between $8,000 and $9,000 for a sergeant first class to devote their time to each investigation — presumably even for drones that cost a fraction of that. 'Is it worth the cost of the loss to spend this much administrative time, people’s salaries, simply to document a six-step financial liability investigation?' he asked. Today unmanned aerial systems are deemed 'nonexpendable property' and the Department of Defense at large requires property books accounting for everything over $5,000 (that is included in DoDI 5000.64). That's even though the Army says that only UAS in its arsenal without 'sensitive items' that falls under that threshold and has asked the Office of the Secretary of Defense to reexamine that price point. And now Army officials are also clarifying that those property loss investigations, while ubiquitous, aren’t actually always mandatory, and that commanders have more leeway than they might think for simply writing the loss off and saving everyone the hassle. The officials told Breaking Defense they are inking a new All Army Activities (ALARACT) memo, expected within the month, that will make clear there are already other options for 'unretrievable UAS and equipment.' 'That will lay out essentially the requirements for each of these [UAS] and give some examples' for when to just write off the loss in an abandonment memo and when to pursue a formal investigation, according to Sydney Smith, the director of supply policy and programs inside Army headquarters. Smith told Breaking Defense that in cases where it’s clear that negligence or misconduct was not the cause of the UAS loss, the memo will detail each drone’s dollar figure and any sensitive items it contains to help commanders make better decisions on how to proceed. It will also reaffirm details about the rank needed to make such a decision. For example, when a done below $10,000 with non-sensitive items crashes into the woods, then a GS-14 (lieutenant colonel) can sign the abandonment memo instead of launching a FLIPL investigation. If that UAS is below $250,000, then a GS-15 (colonel) can make the call. But anything above $250,000 or with a 'controlled item code,' means a general officer will be called in. 'We’ve had tools for a long, long time that have allowed commanders to not have to go through the onerous process, but when you look at our main regulation on the AR 735- 5 [Army property accountability manual], it puts the liability chapters first,' Smith said. 'It makes people think, ‘Oh, I must do the FLIPL for these things’ … when, in reality, they could do the abandonment order because they’re not able to retrieve [the UAS] because it was lost in a field environment.' Another reason the investigations have become so common in the first place, Smith added, is a cautious culture that has not kept up with the times. 'When we first got the Shadows [UASs], and so forth, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were occasional cases where something would fly over into other territories and they were exploited,' she said. 'I think that’s where so much of the reticence to just saying, ‘I want to write off a UAS’ came from. And that’s sort of built up over the years. … Our culture [is] almost a presumption of guilt, &#8216;now prove that it's not.’' Beyond the memo, Besaw and Smith are now helping usher in a new edition of that accountability policy manual to be released later this fall. In it, the initial chapters will layout all of the non-liability actions that can be taken, before later sections progress towards that FLIPL investigation. With the memo and the revised manual, both officials said soldiers should feel better about putting drones in the air, as modern combat is increasingly demanding. '[The] problem set of UAS is very different now than it was then' in Iraq and Afghanistan, Smith said. 'The technology is not unusual anymore. 'When you think about the way Ukraine is using UAS &#8230; if we were in that scenario, even if they were expensive, we would be writing a memorandum to say, &#8216;You know, I launched 100 UAS, and 15 came back, and I watched them on a combat mission, and they didn't return.' That would be my relief statement,' she added. 'We have got to get the muscle memory going on that, so that people understand it will be acceptable in the future to do that.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/army-to-soldiers-get-small-drones-back-in-the-air-dont-worry-about-the-red-tape-as-much/	2025-03-07T05:20:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_red_cat_drone_HANDOUT-e1732136676896.jpg
EU space monitoring program moves toward ‘strategic autonomy’	Artist's rendering showing two of the potential dangers of low-Earth orbit. (Getty graphic) AUSTIN, Texas — The European Union is expanding its space situational awareness (SSA) program and pushing toward greater use of commercial capabilities, the latest move in a longterm push for 'strategic autonomy' that could free the continent from much of its dependency on American space tracking capabilities. 'We decided to foster and really accelerate innovation and foster competitiveness of the European industry and startups in the SSA domain, to consolidate a commercial ecosystem,' said Pascal Faucher, Chairman of the European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking Partnership (EU SST). The 15 EU member states whose facilities make up the EU SST network of radars and telescopes 'believe that this commercial ecosystem will contribute, will complement, military sensors from the member states to reinforce our strategic autonomy,' he told the 11th Annual Space Traffic Management Conference sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin on Tuesday. 'And then we have a priority related to synergies — how to best exploit synergies between civil and defense — because we need to be realistic and pragmatic. Our budget are limited,' Faucher added. He explained that while the EU SST currently is funded by the European Commission and the European Union Agency for the Space Program under the EU's collective 'civil program.' 'It means nothing here in the US, but in Europe, it means secure funding,' Faucher said. However, many of the sensors contributed by the EU SST participants are military assets, and the European Defence Fund also is being tapped to help foster commercial SSA innovation within the 27-nation European Union. (Graphic: EU SST) 'We need to, of course, be smart and join forces, avoid unnecessary duplications and maximize our investment in those capabilities for civil and defense,' Faucher said. The EU SST now is being used by 67 different spacecraft operators, he said, most from within Europe but also by some from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Djibouti, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. All totaled, the network is keeping a protective eye on 543 civil, military and commercial satellites, Faucher said. Faucher further noted that three more countries are expected to soon begin contributing sensors and funding to the project, although he did not name them. The current EU SST member states are: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden. As the program is now entering its eighth year of operations, it is in some ways behind US capabilities — but more advanced in others. The US Space Force at the moment operates the largest network of space sensors, called the Space Surveillance Network. That network is used to provide operators in the US and around the world with warnings about potential on-orbit crashes between satellites and between satellites and dangerous space debris. Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce, via the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is working to develop a similar civil network and collision avoidance service in order to relieve the ever-growing burden of providing non-military operators with satellite tracking information and warnings. That effort, called the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS), is in its infancy, however. Further, unlike the EU SST program, TraCCS at the moment is envisioned as a voluntary program, with the Commerce Department eschewing any plans to require companies to participate or impose any regulatory measures to require operators provide data on their satellites' whereabouts, or take any sort of precautions to enable them to better ensure their satellites don't endanger others. In contrast, Faucher said the EU SST program requires that users not only 'share their satellites' attributes,' but also plans for any maneuvers. 'We have a case of legacy in SSA data sharing between nations on a daily basis, or upon request through European database. So this is pretty unique,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/eu-space-monitoring-program-moves-toward-strategic-autonomy/	2025-03-06T13:05:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250306_satellites_debris_GettyImages-1359390880-e1741290678844.jpg
Budget impasse risks ‘Doomsday’ plane delay, SNC says	A U.S. Air Force E-4B assigned to the 595th Command &amp; Control Group, Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., flies on a training sortie over the Midwest, May, 15, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Codie Trimble) AFA WARFARE 2025 — A failure by lawmakers to pass a budget for fiscal year 2025 risks delaying the Air Force’s effort to field a new fleet of jumbo jets that can survive nuclear war, according to a company executive involved with the project. Jon Piatt, SNC’s executive vice president for ISR, aviation and security, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the AFA Warfare Symposium on Tuesday that the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) program is 'fenced off' from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s budget drill, falling into the exempt category of nuclear command, control and communications. However, he said the aircraft conversion effort will be set back if Congress cannot agree on FY25 appropriations and instead opt for a stopgap funding patch known as a continuing resolution (CR) that would freeze funding at FY24 levels for the remainder of the fiscal year. 'I'm ramping up my work. I'm adding new facilities, I'm adding infrastructure, I'm adding cost. That cost has to be carried by someone,' Piatt said. The company is underway with large-scale expansions of efforts to militarize Boeing 747 jumbo jets that serve as a flying command center capable of surviving a nuclear blast, earning the 'Doomsday' moniker for the fleet. The jets SNC is converting will replace older 747 aircraft, dubbed E-4B or 'Nightwatch,' that also regularly transport top military officials like the defense secretary. 'It’s kind of hard to predict' exactly how much the program could be delayed 'until we actually know if we’re going to realize the CR impact,' Piatt said. 'What I will say is it indeed has a ripple effect.' Congress ultimately provided roughly $700 million for the SAOC program in the FY24 budget, but the Air Force is seeking roughly a billion dollars more in FY25 as work gets underway following SNC’s contract win in April 2024. But whether those additional funds will be delivered in FY25 appears increasingly unlikely, as President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson now both back a plan for a full-year CR. The Air Force's request is seeking 'about $1.7 billion in programmed funding for 2025. That’s a lot of people, it’s a lot of subcontractors,' Piatt said, pointing to other complications like a possible disruption in negotiations to procure more 747s, which could raise costs in turn. 'I’m gonna have to put a halt to my hiring, which might impact some of the work we perform.' According to Piatt, SNC is currently constructing a 'baseline digital design' for the firm’s conversion work, which he characterized as the 'foundation' for planned modifications. The efforts will also result in an 'integrated digital environment' that will provide the data models the Air Force needs to carry out sustainment efforts, he said. SNC has a lot to learn about the 747, as Piatt said the company will be 'going through the digital design and discovery phase for at least four-to-five years.' Still, he said, the company is building in the required schedule margin to carry out the work to keep things on track — so long as necessary funding comes through. 'Even though they look similar, every aircraft can be slightly unique to the other. So we're doing all of our scans internally and externally on all aircraft as a baseline configuration, making sure that we're building that comparative database,' Piatt said. 'When we get into the configuration management, there could be minor variations. We're going to discover some differences, and we're building that expectation into our primary schedule. We're not expecting anything that's going to be a major impact on the schedule,' he added. SNC’s work on the SAOC program is somewhat similar to Boeing’s efforts to deliver new Air Force One planes, whose years of setbacks have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump — and the reported threat of cancellation under the Biden administration. Piatt acknowledged that though the SAOC and Air Force One programs have two different sets of requirements, they have 'a lot of commonality.' Nevertheless, SNC has 'not been asked to do anything specific' on the Air Force One program, Piatt said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/budget-impasse-risks-doomsday-plane-delay-snc-says/	2025-03-06T12:12:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/E-4B-scaled-e1741285516879.jpg
It’s time to ditch Virginia subs for AUKUS and go to Plan B	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023. A US Navy Virginia-class submarine arrived at HMAS Stirling for a scheduled port visit as part of routine patrols in the Indo-Pacific region. (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) Earlier this month, the Australian government made its first payment of $500 million toward eventually obtaining US nuclear-powered submarines under the 2021 AUKUS agreement. Because the submarine deal is unlikely to overcome budgetary, organizational, and personnel hurdles, that payment should be Australia’s last. Rather than sacrificing much of its defense program to buy nuclear submarines, Canberra should instead adopt an AUKUS Plan B that would field new defense technologies such as uncrewed systems and hypersonic weapons that would enhance Australia’s security faster, and for far less. Most experts believe funding AUKUS’s nuclear submarine plans will be challenging. Australia’s defense budget this year is almost $35 billion USD, and is planned to rise to almost $63 billion annually by the end of this decade when Australia would begin buying US nuclear submarines. At more than $3 billion per boat, each Virginia sub will eat up five to ten percent of the Australia defense budget that year, assuming Australia can double its defense spending in five years. Already, a former top officer has warned that the submarine pact will 'cannibalize' other priorities and require deferring future surface warships or eliminating some ground units. Another potential stumbling block is what’s needed to manage a nuclear propulsion program. More than 8,000 people work for the US Naval Nuclear Propulsion program. Today only about 680 people work at the Australian Submarine Agency. If Australia wants a sovereign submarine force that isn’t dependent on Washington’s oversight, it will need thousands of additional skilled civilian workers. Military personnel is also a challenge. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) includes about 16,000 sailors today. Each Virginia-class submarine has a crew of about 130 people, and about 400 sailors per ship to account for training, shore duty, and maintenance. With retention already difficult for the Australian Defence Force, the RAN may be hard-pressed to find and keep the thousand-plus highly-qualified personnel it needs to crew the nuclear sub fleet. Does that mean that the AUKUS deal is dead in the water? Not at all, if leaders take a new approach. As four years of private Nonproliferation Policy Education Center-Hudson Institute AUKUS workshops revealed, the allies can assemble a Plan B. This plan would consist of parts of the agreement’s Pillar One, which is centered on nuclear submarines, and AUKUS Pillar Two, which is focused on emerging defense technologies. The next phase of AUKUS Pillar One would have the United States or the United Kingdom sell Australia nuclear submarines in the early 2030s to bolster Australia’s deterrence. Plan B would cancel this phase in light of Australia’s budget, organizational, and personnel shortfalls. Instead, US and UK subs operating from Australia with RAN sailors and maintained by Australian workers would serve as a sufficient deterrent. The first element of a Plan B is already underway, with US and UK nuclear submarines regularly visiting HMAS Stirling near Perth, including conducting maintenance with a visiting US Navy tender. These visits will become near-continuous as the allies establish the Submarine Rotational Force-West and a permanent maintenance facility during the next two years. Rather than spend more than $13 billion on US Virginia-class submarines, under Plan B, Australia would maintain its current fleet of aging Collins-class subs while investing in, and eventually fielding, other advanced defense technologies through Pillar Two. These innovative projects, which include uncrewed systems, AI, quantum computer science, and hypersonic weapons, could deliver technologies that provide most of what the Virginia-class subs would offer for Australia. For example, Chinese fighters can barely reach Australia and Beijing’s bombers cannot risk unescorted missions. Without an air threat, Australian surface warships, uncrewed vessels, and long-endurance drones like the MQ-9 Reaper could patrol the waters around Australia for Chinese subs and ships (which operated last week off Australia’s eastern waters) at a fraction of the price of Virginia-class boats. Autonomous undersea vehicles like the Ghost Shark or Speartooth could perform some of the offensive missions nuclear submarines would otherwise provide by deploying mines or torpedoes — or weaponizing the vehicle itself. The threat of an unwarned attack on Chinese artificial islands or naval forces in the South China Sea could deter Beijing from armed aggression, especially if China is also confronting US and Japanese forces to the north. Investing in these projects rather than the Virginia-class nuclear submarines would also benefit US and Australian industry. Numerous startup companies in both countries have emerged to exploit the potential of new technologies. These firms could sell to each AUKUS ally as well as to Japan’s government, which plans to double its defense spending but lacks a domestic startup ecosystem. Potentially, the Pillar Two country list could expand to include South Korea, New Zealand and Canada, creating wider markets and greater demand, which in turn would drive the per unit cost down. Of course, uncrewed systems cannot do all the missions of a crewed nuclear submarine, and in the long-term Australia might still benefit from pursuing its own nuclear sub program, SSN-AUKUS. But in the near to mid-term, Canberra should pursue a Plan B that would affordably deliver needed offensive capability, alliance interoperability, and industrial capacity to keep the AUKUS meaningful and vital. Hopefully, this will be on the table during the next discussions between Australia’s government and the new Trump administration.

White House’s OMB skeptical of Navy plan to boost shipyard wages, SASC chairman says	USS Massachusetts (SSN-798), the 25th Virginia-class fast attack submarine. under construction at Newport News Shipyard in Virginia in 2022. (photo courtesy Huntington Ingalls Industries) WASHINGTON — The White House’s Office of Management and Budget has yet to be convinced of the viability of a Navy plan that would boost shipyard wages and accelerate submarine production, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman said. During a fireside chat at the Reagan Institute’s National Security Innovation Base Summit on Wednesday, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he is engaged with the White House on the Shipyard Accountability and Workforce Support (SAWS) proposal, which he sees as a viable path to getting the shipbuilding industry the money it needs to raise salaries and make it more competitive for talent. However, President Donald Trump’s OMB has not yet been sold on the idea, he said, adding that he believes OMB's concerns are rooted in how the proposal stacks up in the office's 'scoring' process, which weighs a proposal's cost against its benefits. 'To take on OMB, they really are the most powerful office in the government, and I learned that long ago,' Wicker said. 'They're very frustrating.' In response, an OMB spokesperson told Breaking Defense of SAWS, 'We agree with the big pay raise, and the money has already been sent. What we are not going to do is pay two or three times for the same thing. We are not going to turn the Gerald Ford carrier into a cost-plus contract.' SAWS, proposed by the Navy last year, would rework certain contract mechanisms for how the Navy pays for submarine and aircraft carrier shipbuilders by essentially allowing prime contractors HII's Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat to shift long-term funding earlier in order to invest in raising wages in the short term. The ebb and flow of labor is always a challenge for the Navy’s prime shipyards, but the commitments the United States has made to the United Kingdom and Australia through the trilateral security pact AUKUS have intensified those pressures for Newport News and Electric Boat in particular. However, the proposal previously came under fire from lawmakers in the fiscal 2025 defense policy bill, approved in December, which criticized the Navy for brokering the plan with industry and without input from either Congress or OMB. Wicker, who took the SASC gavel in January, is supportive of the plan. He said the shipbuilding industry will not be able to meet the Navy’s demand for Virginia-class submarines unless it is willing to pay competitive wages to workers doing a 'very difficult, physical job.' 'In Pascagoula, Mississippi, you can leave the shipyard and work at the Buc-ees 10 miles away and make as much money,' Wicker said. 'It’s a lot easier to work at Buc-ees than welding or being an experienced 15- or 20-year expert in building ship after ship.' Prior to Trump taking office, some shipbuilding companies were cautiously optimistic about how the new administration would receive SAWS, given the first Trump administration’s focus on shipbuilding. '[SAWS] is an innovative approach that increase wages, accelerates submarine production [and] reduces the cost through the [future years],' HII CEO Chris Kastner told reporters in early January. 'It really checks all the boxes relative to how you’d want to get boats under contract. So I think there is some — there could potentially be some more receptivity, because it’s a very innovative approach, and it solves a lot of challenges that we have right now.' During an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump announced the establishment of a new shipbuilding office inside the White House, which the president said would 'offer special tax incentives' to industry with the intent of bolstering the shipbuilding industrial base. 'This is a president who is finally putting his mouth and his and his advocacy of spending behind a 355 ship Navy,' Wicker said of the new office, adding that he had not been informed of its creation ahead of Trump’s speech. Although Wicker expressed optimism overall for Trump's willingness to back a defense spending hike through the reconciliation process, Congress stares down a March 14 deadline when government spending is set to expire, potentially complicating funding for the Pentagon. Some top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, are backing a full year continuing resolution (CR) that would keep funding at FY24 levels for the entirety of this fiscal year. Trump signed off on the a year-long stopgap during a meeting with Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune last week, and the GOP intends to release the bill text this weekend, Politico reported Monday. Wicker said he was 'very pessimistic' about the prospect of a full year CR, stating it would lock the Trump administration into funding levels decided during the Biden administration and negatively impact new defense programs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/white-houses-omb-skeptical-of-navy-plan-to-boost-shipyard-wages-sasc-chairman-says/	2025-03-06T09:10:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Massachusetts-SSN-798-scaled-1-e1732049923370.png
Trained on classified battlefield data, AI multiplies effectiveness of Ukraine’s drones: Report	Ukrainian soldiers, nicknamed &#8216;Doc' and &#8216;Dean', work together on piloting a FPV as 112th brigade of 244th battalion from Ukrainian army operates surveillance and FPV drone attacks against Russians defending their positions in the horizon in Chasiv Yar, Ukraine on January 17, 2025. (Photo by Andre Luis Alves/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Ukraine has taken publicly available AI models, retrained them on its own extensive real-world data from frontline combat, and deployed them on a variety of drones — increasing their odds of hitting Russian targets 'three- or four-fold,' according to a new thinktank report. 'By removing the need for constant manual control and stable communications &#8230; drones enabled with autonomous navigation raise the target engagement success rate from 10 to 20 percent to around 70 to 80 percent,' writes Ukrainian-American scholar Kateryna Bondar, a former advisor to Kyiv, in a new report released today by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'These systems can often achieve objectives using just one or two drones per target rather than eight or nine.' To be clear, Ukraine has not built the Terminator. 'We’re very far from killer robots,' Bondar told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview. But in contrast to the more cautious bureaucracy of the West, she said, 'the Ukrainians are more open to testing and trying anything and everything that can kill more Russians.' The AI in question, Bondar explains, relies on the human to select a target; only then can the AI make the final approach on its own, autonomously flying the last 100 to 1,000 meters. While very limited, this autonomous final approach is still a huge improvement over most drones on both sides of the war, which require a human hand on the controls to guide them all the way to impact. If that human hand is too tired, shaking with fear, or just poorly trained, or if the control signal is disrupted by increasingly omnipresent frontline radio jamming, the remote-controlled drone will crash uselessly into the countryside. For now, Bondar found the vast majority of Ukrainian drones still require human control all the way to the target. Of nearly 2 million put on contract by Kyiv in 2024 — 96 percent of which, incidentally, were built in Ukraine — the report says only 10,000 that definitely used AI guidance, less than half of one percent. (The actual total may be much higher, she cautioned). While 10,000 may seem a lot by the standards of anemic Western peacetime procurement, by some estimates it’s merely the number of drones Ukraine expends in the average month. However, that relative handful of autonomous-final-approach drones has proved so effective in combat that Kyiv now plans to ramp up production drastically. While there’s no publicized target, Bondar estimates that the Ukrainian military wants at least half the drones it buys in 2025 to have AI guidance — an increase from 0.5 percent to 50. If realized, that ambition means deploying about a million AI-assisted drones, each three or four times as likely to hit its target as current remote-controlled models — easily a twelve-fold increase in killing power. In a war of grinding attrition, where drones have replaced artillery, the traditional 'king of battle,' as the main cause of casualties, those numbers could be decisive. Just 13 months ago, this kind of autonomous-final-approach AI was still unworkable on the small, cheap drones that have dominated fighting in Ukraine. Russia had rolled out and then apparently abandoned such a feature on its widely used Lancet, while Ukrainian counterparts were promised products rather than practical weapons. But starting this fall, reports of AI-guided drones began popping up again, this time on the Ukrainian side. How did a country under constant bombardment, with a GDP comparable to Iraq, an arms industry inherited from the Soviet Union, and erratic support from Western allies, manage such a feat? To start with, most of the algorithms guiding Ukraine’s autonomous-final-approach drones are derived from free, internationally available open-source models, Bondar found. That allowed Ukrainians to skip some of the most expensive and time-consuming parts of AI development. From that open-source baseline, Bondar explained, the Ukrainians intensively retrained the models on Kyiv’s own classified, real-world battle data — using datasets tailored not just to current combat conditions but, often, to a specific sector of the front and specific types of drone. 'The frontline is very long &#8230; and the situation is very different on different parts of the front,' Bondar explained. For instance, she said, the infamous Bakhmut sector is now stable and static, with both sides dug in to avoid artillery and drones. In other areas, however, the Russians continue to advance, sending 'wave after wave' of expendable 'Storm Z' troops in small squads across dangerously open terrain. The kind of drone the algorithm is meant for also matters, Bondar noted. High-altitude reconnaissance drones see the battlefield and targets from a different angle and greater distances than the low-flying First Person View (FPV) drones that do most of the actual strikes, for example, so imagery collected by one may not be suitable for training the other. Even the specific type of camera matters. All these factors go to show that in Ukraine, as in machine learning development generally, the right training data is critical to making machine-learning actually learn something useful. In Ukraine, getting the data right required a combination of bottom-up innovation by private sector techies and top-down organization by government officials. The initial outpouring of international aid and domestic innovation after February 2022 had left Ukraine with a bewildering variety of equipment, including information technology. 'They call it a ‘zoo’ of technologies,' Bondar said. 'One warfighter can have 10 different software systems on his tablet or phone.' Some intelligence data comes through official channels from military-operated recon drones, but much of the information is still cobbled together by volunteers combing social media apps like Telegram for reports, photos, and videos of Russian vehicles. 'Now the government is trying to increase interoperability among these systems and integrate them,' Bondar explained. 'They started to address this issue by creating, basically, one universal military dataset.' While much of the data is still uploaded and even labeled by volunteers, they now have to conform to government standards for tags and categories. That better-organized data is then housed on a volunteer-developed but government-run military intelligence system known as Delta. To protect the data, Bondar went on, 'they have created a secure training environment.' Private companies can access the information and create custom datasets tailored to their specific training needs, but the data itself remains on government computers, and it’s on those computers that the algorithms are actually trained. Only the final product, the guidance algorithms themselves, are exported and installed on drones, and even then only in encrypted form so the Russians can’t easily copy captured tech. All of this only works because the Ukrainians limited their appetites for AI, Bondar emphasized, developing lots of small, specialized systems instead of a few mega-projects — a lesson the US defense sector is starting to learn. 'They also started with this idea of creating a huge mega-platform which would cover everything and do everything,' she said. 'They slowly realized &#8230; the current level of AI development allows you to train models on very small datasets.' 'These small models are easier to train, easier to update,' Bondar said. 'They’re way cheaper.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/trained-on-classified-battlefield-data-ai-multiplies-effectiveness-of-ukraines-drones-report/	2025-03-06T08:00:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250305_ukraine_fpv_drone_pilots_GettyImages-2195601382-e1741213707203.jpg
Italy’s Leonardo and Turkey’s Baykar ink agreement for UAV joint venture	Italy's Leonardo and Turkey's Baykar have signed a MoU ahead of developing a UAV joint venture (Leonardo) BELFAST — Italian manufacturer Leonardo and Turkish prime Baykar signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) today in advance of establishing an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies joint venture (JV) together, bidding to take advantage of increasing European market demand. The JV will leverage manufacturing capabilities of both companies across design, development, maintenance and production of drones, with Leonardo’s contribution predominately focused on payloads and mission systems, complemented by Baykar’s wide ranging aircraft portfolio which includes TB2, Akinci, and Kizilelma types, according to a Leonardo statement. The JV is looking to tap into growing demand from the European drone market, valued in excess of $100 billion over the next decade, and will include production out of Italy and Turkey, Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani told media in Rome. He suggested that despite those involved in the Italian, Japanese and UK-led Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) sixth-generation fighter effort still to decide on an adjunct or loyal wingman aircraft, putting forward a wingman 'could be an opportunity' long term for the JV. Baykar’s Kizilelma unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) sits as an obvious candidate for consideration. Cingolani added, 'The three members of GCAP are committed to develop the [multinational] platform, and we are all looking around to see what is the best choice for the software, for the AI, for the adjunct, so we are exploring. We'll see what happens in the market.' Baykar announced flight tests of a third production representative Kizilelma aircraft in September 2024, and it has since completed an aerodynamic system identification test. The self-funded aircraft program was first launched by the manufacturer in 2021, and according to company literature, will become a 'force to be reckoned with, specifically given its aggressive maneuvering capability and stealthiness against radar.' Cingolani said that Akinci will be the first aircraft to be developed by the JV, and 'prototyping' will take shape 'one year from now,' strengthening existing collaboration with Baykar that has already seen Leonardo integrate company payloads on the aircraft. The long endurance UCAV was developed as a successor to the TB2 tactical UAV, which saw success in the early stages of the Ukraine war. In service with the Turkish armed forces, Baykar has signed 11 Akinci export agreements, according to the company. 'I hope the Italian defense system will buy drones coming from the joint venture' but to only rely on that prospect alone would be 'very short sighted,' said Cingolani. He added that the projected $100-billion European drone market, 'clearly goes beyond the national interest.' For Baykar, the JV represents an additional push into the European market and comes on the heels of its acquisition of Italy's Piaggio Aerospace.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/italys-leonardo-and-turkeys-baykar-ink-agreement-for-uav-joint-venture/	2025-03-06T07:36:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/DAN5561-scaled-e1741275412804.jpg
Space-based capabilities are critical to enabling a missile shield for America	Image: Courtesy of L3Harris Technologies. A long-feared threat became a grim reality in April of last year when Iran attacked Israel directly for the first time in history. According to the Israeli Defense Forces, Iran launched hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles into the heart of the Jewish State. Yet, in a miraculous achievement of modern technology, nearly all of the incoming barrage was detected and intercepted by Israeli and allied forces. Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump took note of the extraordinary performance of the air and missile defense systems that defended Israel on that day. On the campaign trail, he began articulating a vision for a similar system to protect the American homeland. And now that he’s taken office, President Trump has taken a bold step to achieve his vision and deliver on his campaign promise, signing an executive order directing the building of the Golden Dome Missile Defense Shield for America. Our company supports President Trump in setting this important goal for our nation. As the Trusted Disruptor in the defense industry, and with a portfolio of proven capabilities in countering air and missile threats, we’re ready to assist his administration in achieving this goal. We understand what it will take to build a layered missile defense architecture to detect, track and defeat incoming threats. We also recognize the regulatory and bureaucratic roadblocks that must be overcome in order to deliver this crucial new capability for our nation at the speed of relevance. To keep our homeland safe, we need a fundamentally new approach to missile defense – one that leverages commercial business models in defense acquisition; a layered system of space-based sensors; and a robust and resilient defense industrial base with increased capacity. America’s government, defense, science and technology leaders must embrace this new approach to deliver on this national priority. Leveraging Commercial Business Models Ken Bedingfield, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for L3Harris Technologies and President of Aerojet Rocketdyne. First, we must dramatically accelerate the process to acquire and field new defense technologies. Our adversaries are moving at breakneck speed to develop hypersonic missiles and other advanced weapons designed to overcome our current defenses. Our traditional defense development cycle, often spanning many years, no longer serves us. In a November 2024 op-ed, our CEO made the case for fully embracing commerciality in our defense acquisition system by streamlining regulations and eliminating arbitrary distinctions between commercial and non-commercial products as well as traditional and non-traditional contractors. By making commerciality the rule rather than the exception in DOD contracting, our nation will be better able to innovate and rapidly acquire the emerging technologies that are essential for building an American Golden Dome. Industry is already showing what's possible by adopting commercial technologies and agile development practices. At L3Harris, we provide a significant portion of our products to the U.S. military on a commercial basis, and we urge the DOD to broaden its definition of commercial products to continue enhancing the industry’s ability to deliver technology faster and at lower costs. A Layered System of Space-based Sensors Second, we need to reimagine space's role in missile defense. Space-based capabilities are now central to detecting and tracking threats. The Space Force's Low Earth Orbit Constellation exemplifies this, creating a layered defense system that can track hypersonic threats globally and provide integrated deterrence against China and Russia. The DOD should invest in low-risk and proven next-generation technology currently on-orbit, as industry has hot production lines primed to deliver. At the same time, industry must lead the way in advancing engineering technologies that deliver both kinetic and non-kinetic effects from space, adding to our existing ability to intercept missiles with air- and ground-based assets. Hypersonic threats can travel thousands of miles in minutes. A software-based approach across existing and future missile warning and tracking systems creates a more responsive missile defense network. By integrating our own and third-party AI capabilities with our advanced, space-based sensor systems, we're helping military operators make faster, more informed decisions across the entire kill chain. Scaling Manufacturing Capacity Ed Zoiss, President of Space &amp; Airborne Systems for L3Harris Technologies. Third, we must scale American manufacturing capacity. This means not just expanding existing facilities, but also building robust supplier networks and investing in advanced manufacturing capabilities. The goal is to match commercial production speeds while maintaining our capacity to meet the reliability demands of national defense programs. We must be ready to surge production when needed, to include satellites for space-based missile warning and tracking; propulsion for interceptor missiles; and targets for testing new sensors and interceptor capabilities. These changes require significant investment and commitment from all stakeholders in the defense industrial base. At L3Harris, we've already begun this transformation, exemplified by our significant investments and scaling of our Aerojet Rocketdyne business, including new solid rocket motor production facilities we’re building in Arkansas and Virginia in partnership with the DOD. In an age where threats to the homeland are evolving at an unprecedented pace, the United States faces a critical inflection point in our national security. President Trump's recent executive order to accelerate the development of a Golden Dome for America isn't just another defense initiative – it's a proportionate response to a catastrophic threat. No single entity can do this alone. This urgent national challenge demands collaboration across the defense industrial base, national laboratories and government agencies. Whether it’s advanced sensors, satellites, space launch, interceptor missiles or AI-based software to fuse threat data from different platforms and systems, every part of the national defense ecosystem – from new entrants to traditional primes – has unique capabilities that are essential to our collective success. This is about more than modernizing our legacy defense infrastructure. It’s about protecting American citizens and our way of life. Ken Bedingfield is Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for L3Harris Technologies and President of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Ed Zoiss is President of Space &amp; Airborne Systems at L3Harris Technologies. Both have decades of combined experience in the national defense technology ecosystem.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/space-based-capabilities-are-critical-to-enabling-a-missile-shield-for-america/	2025-03-06T05:24:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/600x300Golden_Dome_Graphic.png
Secret Space Force payloads monitor China’s satellite surveillance network, official says	Communications satellite orbiting above Earth (Getty Images/ Adastra) AFA WARFARE 2025 — For several years, the Space Force has had a secretive, orbital tool that can gather information on China’s own network of sensors that monitor American satellites, according to a key service official. Calling the project a 'quasi-operational success,' Kelly Hammett, director of the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (SRCO), said in a briefing with reporters today at the AFA Warfare Symposium that 'situational awareness indications and warning payloads' have been 'collecting all kinds of very interesting data on the Chinese SOSI [Space Observation Surveillance and Identification System] network' — Beijing’s rough equivalent to Washington’s Space Surveillance Network. The space-based monitoring technology was launched as payloads aboard Northrop Grumman’s LDPE-3A spacecraft in 2023, Hammett disclosed. The project was the first from the SRCO to enter orbit, and the Space Force said at the time [PDF] that the payloads would provide 'enhanced situational awareness.' 'These are sensors that can tell whether you're being observed, tracked, targeted, those types of things,' Hammett said. 'And that's a capability that we're trying to drive into the larger Space Force. We've done the prototypes, and it's working.' Although the Space Force has several ways to monitor Beijing’s orbital activities — from the current Space Surveillance Network to the forthcoming SILENTBARKER constellation — many American satellites themselves aren’t able to tell when they’re similarly being watched, Hammett explained. The secretive payloads launched aboard the LDPE-3A aim to fix that problem. However, as a small organization with roughly 50 civilian and 20 military employees, some in at-risk categories like probationary workers, Hammett warned his office could be disproportionately affected by labor cuts that are underway by the Trump administration. 'I’m losing people,' he said, referring to employees who took the administration’s deferred resignation offer and others who left on their own volition. 'And I cannot hire people back because we’re under a hiring freeze, and we’re having to figure out a hiring plan. We can try to hire contractors and FFRDCs [Federally Funded Research and Development Centers], and that’s the vast majority of my workforce because we’ve never been given any additional government employees since the organization was stood up in 2018.' Hammett added the SRCO has about 200 contractors and FFRDC employees that 'supplement' the office’s workforce. 'I have … billion-dollar programs that are run by seven people. If you go to the rest of the DoD, you’ll have a program office of 500 people to run one of those programs,' Hammett said. 'So we're very lean, and we are, therefore, inordinately impacted when we lose one, two, three people' who aren’t able to be replaced.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/secret-space-force-payloads-monitor-chinas-satellite-surveillance-network-official-says/	2025-03-05T13:25:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-AB23479-scaled-e1727101217129.jpg
AST, Kayhan, LeoLabs team to demo capability to reduce Space Force satellite tracking times	LeoLab's space monitoring radar facility in Collie, Western Australia. (LeoLabs) AUSTIN — Three commercial firms have demonstrated a collective capability to help the Space Force more quickly detect and track satellites launched simultaneously into low Earth orbit (LEO) — a growing launch practice that is challenging the service's abilities to spot potential on-orbit crashes. AST SpaceMobile, Kayhan Space and LeoLabs provided space situational awareness data for the five satellites launched Sept. 12, 2024, on SpaceX's Bluebird Block 1 mission to the 18th Space Defense Squadron (SDS), CEO of Kayhan Siamak Hesar told the 11th Annual Space Traffic Management Conference here sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin. AST is a satellite company collaborating with cellular telecommunications firms to create an on-orbit constellation to provide internet services. LeoLabs uses radars around the globe to detect and track satellites. Kayhan has created highly precise software designed to help satellite operators keep tabs on where their birds are in juxtaposition to those of other operators, as well as dangerous space junk. The goal of the collaborative effort was to show that commercial data can help close the time lag between when a satellite is released into orbit from a rocket to when the Space Force can reliably track it and put the trajectory coordinates into the military's catalog of space objects, he explained. That catalog currently is used by the 18th SDS to provide satellite operators with warnings of potential collisions with other satellites and space junk — although the Defense Department is working with Department of Commerce to offload that warning mission to a civilian system run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That time lag, known as the 'COLA gap,' for collision avoidance gap, is a growing problem for the Space Force as more and more satellite operators are utilizing 'ride share launches' to LEO where multiple birds are lofted together on a single rocket, Hesar explained. Once the rocket makes it safely to space, these satellites, sometimes as many as 100, are released simultaneously. This means that their radar signatures overlap, making it extremely difficult for the radar systems used by the 18th SDS to either identify them or track their trajectories until much later when they have moved farther apart, he told Breaking Defense following his presentation. Thus, it often takes the 18th SDS 'months' to be able to put their tracking data into the public database and/or provide any warnings of potential collisions. 'So basically, those operators are flying blindly, even though they are able to track their own satellites — well, potentially, some of them are not, some of the are,' he told the conference. 'But other operators don't know they exist, and that causes that creates a big risk.' The three space monitoring firms used the 'deployment parameters' about the satellites being carried on the Bluebird mission provided to them by SpaceX, whose Falcon 9 is the rocket most widely used by US satellite operators for ride shares. They then pooled data from the GPS receivers on board the satellites tracked by AST, radar observations from LeoLabs' global network, and ran Kayhan's software to distinguish individual satellites as they broke away from the rocket. LeoLabs' observations also were used to track the five 'spacecraft structure release mechanisms,' which are the devices that decouple the satellites from the launcher, that did not have GPS on board. Hesar told Breaking Defense that the demo was able to reduce the COLA gap from an average of about two months down to a week. The experiment demonstrated the 'great things' commercial space firms 'can do when we collaborate together, and the capabilities that we can bring to the table and also to help the government,' he summed up.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ast-kayhan-leolabs-team-to-demo-capability-to-reduce-space-force-satellite-tracking-times/	2025-03-05T12:55:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Western-Australia-Space-Radar-opt.jpg
Cutting-edge GPS technology	BAE Systems photo. An all-out sprint is underway between the United States and near-peer adversaries to develop and advance . The most innovative of these systems prevent the jamming or spoofing of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals used to provide positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) to U.S. armed forces in contested environments. Admittedly, it is a race with hurdles, including a growing misconception about the reliability of GPS and whether the military’s highly encrypted signal known as M-code is 'ready for prime time.' Work has been underway for more than two decades to modernize GPS with the more secure, jam-resistant, M-code. However, a recent U.S. Government Accountability Office report suggests technical and manufacturing challenges have delayed the deployment of M-Code. BAE Systems is actively developing and fielding a comprehensive family of M-Code GPS receiver solutions. The company has created security-certified Common GPS Modules (CGMs) that leverage the robust M-Code signal across an all-inclusive GPS receiver portfolio. The portfolio scales from the world’s smallest and lowest-power M-Code GPS for size, weight, and power (SWaP)-challenged applications, to highly robust receivers with integrated anti-jam antenna electronics for exceptionally challenging environments. In addition, ongoing efforts for DIGAR™ production is ensuring the reliability of military GPS systems for aircraft and other platforms operating in challenging signal environments. DIGAR uses advanced antenna electronics, high-performance signal processing, and digital beamforming for better GPS signal reception and superior jamming immunity with both the powerful M-Code and legacy Y-Code GPS signal. The diverse line of M-Code receivers includes the MPE™-M, MicroGRAM™-M, NavGuide™, NavStrike™-M, NavStorm™-M, and SABR™-M. The NavGuide™ handheld is anticipated to begin customer deliveries this year To date, BAE Systems has delivered selective availability anti-spoofing module products to more than 45 countries and has begun delivering M-Code GPS receivers in multiple form factors and levels of capability to the U.S. armed forces and its allies through foreign military sales. Additional M-Code capable receiver form factors are also on the horizon. Customers who have integrated these products into their platforms are at a competitive advantage, as the open-architecture capability can be tailored to solve their most pressing battlefield problems at an affordable price with a short timeline. So, while recent scrutiny of the operational efficiencies of M-Code products provided by defense technology companies is important and necessary, it has underestimated the success and advancements that are rapidly underway. BAE Systems is not only dedicated to maintaining a supply of cutting-edge GPS solutions today, but also proactively overcoming the challenges of a rapidly changing defense landscape for the foreseeable future.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/cutting-edge-gps-technology/	2025-03-05T12:40:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/21-A39-02_GPS_600x300px_Fuller.jpg
Ex-NSA cyber chief warns of ‘devastating impact’ of potential DOGE-inspired firings	NSA cybersecurity Rob Joyce testifies to Congress in 2021 (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — The former leader of the National Security Agency's unit dedicated to cracking foreign computer systems warned lawmakers today that the potential mass firings of probationary federal employees would have bleak consequences for the country’s cybersecurity posture, especially when contending with malicious cyber activity from the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 'I want to raise my grave concerns that the aggressive threats to cut US government probationary employees will have a devastating impact on [US] cybersecurity and our national security,' Rob Joyce, former director of cybersecurity at the NSA and ex-chief of the agency's elite Tailored Access Operations unit, told the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. 'At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive, unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,' Joyce said. 'Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent essential for hunting and eradicating PRC threats.' In line with efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), overseen by billionaire Elon Musk, the Trump administration previously ordered a vast swath of probationary employees across several federal government agencies be let go, before apparently pulling back on that directive Monday after a federal judge froze the original order. While the National Security Agency and its military counterpart, US Cyber Command, did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment on the status of probationary employees at their respective organizations, the firings already hit another cybersecurity entity, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Department of Homeland Security, where 130 employees were let go, according to CBS News. The White House National Security Council also did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this report. At today's hearing, Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, echoed Joyce’s animosity toward the mass firings, saying that 'the recent efforts by the Trump administration and DOGE to reduce the number of government employees actively working on our cyber security defenses are not just misguided, they are dangerous.' Also testifying was Laura Galante, the former director of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. She specifically emphasized the vitality of CISA’s work in protecting the US cyber missions. 'The work that CISA does and the [cybersecurity] advisories that go out with numerous agency seals on them as a voice from the US government about what needs to be protected, have a powerful message to our allies and to other entities looking for advice on what they need to patch and do in their systems. It's a critical function, and it's something that CISA has made real strides in over the last several years,' she said. 'This will be a significant blow to the people who have come in over the last several years or who have waited on clearances sometimes upwards of a year or more to come in for technically important roles where training is limited on the outside and they’re doing core work to secure US networks,' she added. Apart from the immediate national security concerns the firings pose, Joyce said they will have lasting effects on the national security community’s ability to recruit talent. 'Even if the positions are not eliminated, the pervasive uncertainty and doubt in the current environment is forcing them to seek secure opportunities for families outside national security — we need this talent to win in competition and conflict,' he said. Today's hearing coincided with an announcement by the Justice Department that the US government had charged 12 Chinese 'contract hackers' with allegedly working at the behest of the Chinese government to break into several international targets including 'foreign ministries of multiple governments in Asia, and U.S. federal and state government agencies, including the US Department of Treasury ... in late 2024.' (The Chinese government has consistently denied that it conducts hacking operations.)	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ex-nsa-cyber-chief-warns-of-devastating-impact-of-potential-doge-inspired-firings/	2025-03-05T12:15:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230411_rob_joyce_testifies_GettyImages-1232310976-scaled-e1681235017394.jpg
AI for war plans: Pentagon innovation shop taps Scale AI to build ‘Thunderforge’ prototype	Many operations during US Space Command's March 8-12, 2021 Global Lightning exercise were based in the command's joint operations center. (US Space Command photo: Lewis Carlyle) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s outreach arm to Silicon Valley, the Defense Innovation Unit, has selected San Francisco-based Scale AI to lead what it calls Thunderforge, a prototype project to build AI to speed up large-scale military planning, the company and DIU announced this morning. Scale AI will work with fellow defense tech upstart Anduril, IT giant Microsoft, and other as-yet undisclosed 'global' subcontractors, the company and DIU said. The new AI toolkit will combine Anduril’s Lattice data-sharing system with Large Language Models (LLMs) developed by both Microsoft and Scale AI itself. The first prototype tools will go to the four-star headquarters tasked to deter America’s most powerful adversaries: Indo-Pacific Command, which the Trump administration has identified as its top priority in a new Cold War with China; and European Command, whose decades-long focus on Moscow has been complicated by Trump’s reversal of previous anti-Russian policies. The Thunderforge project is just one piece of a much larger multi-front effort to use AI algorithms, big data, and long-range communications to coordinate US and allied forces across the military 'domains' of land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace. The jaw-breaking official jargon for this mega-project is Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (CJADC2). All the armed services and many defense agencies have been building their own, hopefully compatible pieces of this AI-powered global meta-network, coordinated by Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Officer. (However, the Trump administration is reportedly considering major changes to the role of CDAO, a Biden-era creation). Working closely with CDAO, DIU has played a major role in linking all these efforts to cutting-edge companies in the commercial sector, whose latest and greatest AI tools the military wants to adopt and adapt for its own purposes. RELATED: Tech bros to the rescue? Reagan Institute 2025 scorecard dings Pentagon on ‘scaling’ innovation Those military applications can be remarkably mundane, in stark contrast to the killer-robot apocalypses of pop culture. Planning a major combat operation, or even a peacetime redeployment, requires going through vast amounts of data: latest locations of potential targets, unit readiness reports, transport routes and timetables, the load-carrying capacities of road bridges and seaports, stockpiles of everything from ammunition to spare parts, and on and on and on. Today, much of that data is scattered across multiple, incompatible, and increasingly geriatric computer systems, which means human staff officers have to labor for hundreds of hours to pull it all together, let alone analyze it and calculate an optimal course of action. So the Pentagon is intensely interested in any kind of AI that can accelerate this laborious data-crunching and give everyone at headquarters more time to actually think. 'Today’s military planning processes rely on decades-old technology and methodologies, creating a fundamental mismatch between the speed of modern warfare and our ability to respond,' DIU’s Thunderforge program lead, Bryce Goodman, said on the agency’s blog. 'Thunderforge brings AI-powered analysis and automation to operational and strategic planning, allowing decision-makers to operate at the pace required for emerging conflicts.' Specifically, DIU and Scale told Breaking Defense, Thunderforge will automate many traditional staff processes, assist in drafting plans, and even run AI wargames of alternative courses of action. It will also handle classified information at multiple levels. While today’s announcements didn’t disclose many details, including the amount of funding the government will provide, recent military experiments suggest that the Large Language Models provided by Scale AI and Microsoft will serve two major functions: extracting key details from masses of written reports and other documents — so-called 'unstructured' data, which is notoriously hard for older forms of AI to make sense of — and generating draft planning documents for staff officers to review. But, as Scale emphasized in its announcement, these AI tools will be 'always under human oversight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ai-for-war-plans-pentagon-innovation-shop-taps-scale-ai-to-build-thunderforge-prototype/	2025-03-05T11:38:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Global-Lightniing-Test.jpeg
Combat engineering evolves with autonomy and robotics	(Pearson Engineering photo). Pearson Engineering’s latest developments include solutions that incorporate tele-operation, automation, and autonomy for front-end equipment and engineering mission packs designed specifically for robotic platforms. We discuss autonomous combat engineering with Amish Patel, senior engineer for robotics solutions at Pearson Engineering. Pearson Engineering focuses on the medium tier of RCVs that are in a weight class suitable for combat engineering roles. Which RCVs are we talking about, to execute what combat engineering tasks? What are the combat engineering challenges for this tier of robot? Amish Patel is senior engineer, Robotic Solutions Engineering, Pearson Engineering. The medium tier of RCVs, or the RCV-M variant tier, per the U.S. DoD’s classification, encompasses robotic vehicles that fall within the 10-20 ton weight category. Having a greater vehicle mass is favoured for combat engineering tasks requiring ground engaging front-end equipment. The medium tier of RCV’s is lighter than traditional armoured engineering vehicles. Ground engaging combat engineering equipment for use with these RCV’s will need to be designed to fully utilise the available tractive effort from the host RCV. Example combat engineering tasks could include route proving and clearance, gap crossing, minefield breaching and urban obstacle creation and reduction. Tell us about your enabling technologies and solutions for these robotic platforms – the front-end equipment and tools that help the Army complete a task. Our latest developments include solutions that incorporate tele-operation, automation and autonomous capabilities to front-end equipment and engineering tools designed specifically for robotic platforms. Such developments have been designed to be modular and scalable, allowing them to be mounted onto RCV-Ms from multiple OEMs. Through the use of integrated sensor technologies and digital tools, augmented operator aids can be implemented to simplify tele-operation of front-end equipment and engineering tools. For example, graphical overlays can be used to aid depth perception when teleoperating manipulator arms, increasing operational tempo and reducing mission completion times. Integration with battlefield management systems BMS systems could provide the networking backbone to enable autonomous control of multiple RCV platforms to simultaneously complete combat engineering tasks and missions at pace. Other sensor payloads integrated in the same BMS could also provide RCVs with increased situational awareness to execute tasks with greater precision and momentum. Describe your RCV-Pioneer concept, which involves developing modular, swappable payloads for RCV platforms rather than building the vehicles themselves. How does this capability reduce the time it takes to reduce an obstacle or breach a minefield? RCV-Pioneer provides uncrewed ground vehicles with robotic engineering capability, paving the way for modern combat engineering CONOPS. Leveraging the power of mature artificial intelligence and autonomy will allow for robotic engineering assets to work together as a force multiplier, increasing survivability and freedom of movement. Such technologies will enable UGVs to rapidly interchange modular mission payloads in a matter of minutes, providing vast flexibility for dynamic mission profiles. This increase in the quantity and diversity of robotic combat engineering units in warfare will enable simultaneous execution of engineering operations across the battlefield, creating an unprecedented pace of advancement for friendly forces to counter the adversary with minimal risk to personnel. The use of autonomous systems will allow for advanced analysis of the mission profile, including the ability to rapidly simulate outcomes with a given RCV and MMP combination when applied in different ways. The optimal set of steps to reduce the obstacle or breach a minefield can then be identified and the RCV and MMP subsequently deployed to execute at pace. Describe your views on the need for CONOPS around the employment of autonomous engineering vehicles for combat engineering. Employing robotic engineering vehicles will require a new set of CONOPS to be developed to fully utilise the benefits that robotic platforms can provide. For example, robotic assets could be deployed in an autonomous manner to jointly undertake combat engineering tasks, however a human-in-the-loop may still be required to tele-operate platforms when faced with a scenario that the autonomous system cannot overcome. The C2 networking backbone would also need to be optimised to account for the bandwidth of all robotic assets that are deployed; integrated autonomy would inherently reduce this burden. CONOPS will need to factor in a means by which the humans operating in partnership with the autonomous engineering vehicles are able to understand how the vehicles are executing the mission. This will be important to build operator trust in autonomous systems and limit unnecessary intervention that may hinder progress. CONOPS will need to take account of how the autonomous engineering vehicle behaves if comms to the command centre are lost or the platform is immobilised, temporarily or permanently. What is your perspective on the potential for upgrading existing crewed engineering vehicles to provide autonomous capabilities, such as the M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle? Pearson Engineering has successfully developed and tested tele-operation kits which can be retrofitted onto existing engineering vehicles, such as the M1150 ABV. One of the main capabilities of the system is that the vehicle can be switched between remote and manual control at the flick of a switch, allowing for fast changeover when used for dynamic mission profiles. Our retrofittable tele-operation kits reduce the burden of operator training through familiarity of existing platforms and provide a safe path to deploy teleoperated assets and remove soldiers from harm’s way sooner. Retrofitting existing crewed engineering vehicles to provide teleoperated or autonomous combat engineering capabilities could be a cost-effective alternative to developing robotic platforms from the ground up. It is an approach that enables combat engineering tasks to be automated and soldiers removed from harm’s way in the nearer term, ahead of advanced RCV’s coming into service. Final thoughts? As technology advances and ground vehicles evolve, we are keeping pace by offering a modern approach to engineering capability in what is quickly becoming a remote and autonomous world. The development of RCV-Pioneer follows the core principles of Pearson Engineering’s approach, providing high levels of equipment flexibility to support mission adaptability. Whilst best known for providing a suite of tools for vehicles such as the Assault Breacher Vehicle, Pearson Engineering’s investment in research and development is seeing us deliver a new generation of capability that will ultimately take soldiers away from the most hazardous tasks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/combat-engineering-evolves-with-autonomy-and-robotics/	2025-03-05T11:11:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Pearson-PXL_20220815_193310994-scaled.jpg
‘This acquisition is no longer required:’ Defense Health Agency cancels $96M wearable solicitation	Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune recently hosted the Director for Defense Health Agency, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Ronald Place and Senior Enlisted Leader for the Defense Health Agency, U.S. Army Command Sergeant Major Michael L. Gragg.(Photo by Michelle Cornell, Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune) WASHINGTON — The Defense Health Agency has cancelled its effort to buy $96 million worth of biometric ring trackers, according to documentation obtained by Breaking Defense. The DHA did not provide details on why the solicitation, which would gather biometric data on DHA medical professionals, was being terminated, saying only 'This acquisition is no longer required,' per the documentation. The DHA did not respond to requests for comment by press time. However, this appears to put an end to a disputed contract that saw two of the giants in the wearable technology sphere launching protests and accusations at each other over a lucrative department contract. Last August, the DHA put up a notice on the government contracting site Sam.gov, announcing it was going to sole-source a $96 million contract for wearable devices and a 'wellbeing platform' to Ouraring, the US subsidiary of Finnish firm Oura Health. The wellbeing platform refers to a system that takes data from a user’s wearable device, for example a ring, watch or band, and creates a custom plan based on what the user’s biometrics indicate needs improvement. While $96 million isn’t major by Pentagon standards it was a big win for Oura; for comparison, its December series D round of fundraising was $200 million. Related: Pentagon’s $96M wearable contract sparks protest, accusations of vendor preference But it didn't take long for the deal to take a turn. Wearable company WHOOP protested the award to the Government Accountability Office, saying the intent to sole source lacked sufficient information. Shortly after, the DHA wrote to GAO that they were going to cancel the sole source contract and requested that the WHOOP protest be dismissed. (Breaking Defense obtained a copy and verified the protest documents.) After the initial contract was cancelled, another request for information and subsequent request for proposal were posted to Sam.gov by the DHA in November and December respectively, specifying that the wearable must be a ring. There are a handful of alternative wearable ring companies, but the DHA has acknowledged to lawmakers that Oura is the only wearable ring company that is cleared by DoD for use in secure facilities, according to documents reviewed by Breaking Defense. In January, WHOOP issued a second protest. An Oura executive confirmed with Breaking Defense that the company received word from the DHA that the solicitation was cancelled. 'This contract was meant to be an efficiency initiative, and we believe that the DHA had a clear business case for how this would have reduced costs and operational inefficiencies from burnout,' the Oura executive told Breaking Defense. 'If the insights gained from a successful wearable-led initiative at DHA led to even just a 1% reduction in burnout and turnover, then the contract would have achieved a positive return on investment for an agency that spends billions of dollars on staffing.' Notably, the change comes during a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Pentagon’s fiscal 2026 budget plans aimed at shifting funds from legacy programs toward President Donald Trump’s priorities. It also comes following last week's exit of DHA head Gen. Telita Crossland, whom Reuters reported was 'forced' into retirement after her 32-year military career. Related: Pentagon seeks to shift $50B in planned funding to new priorities in FY26 The goal of Hegseth's review is to find roughly $50 billion, or 8 percent of the FY26 plan, and reprioritize it. That effort seems to be a parallel but different one from the cuts expected to be pushed by the Elon Musk-led DOGE office, which arrived in the Pentagon a few weeks ago.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/this-acquisition-is-no-longer-required-defense-health-agency-cancels-96m-wearable-solicitation/	2025-03-05T10:45:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/6515897-e1741114926471.jpg
It’s a time to buy: M&A for the national interest	Large pile of one hundred dollar bills. (Jackal Pan/Getty Images) From business schools to boardrooms, Venture Capital has been on a tear over the last decade. Buoyed by near-zero interest rates, the asset class grew in the United States from $33.1 billion in 2013 to its peak of $329.9 billion by 2021, a roughly 896 percent growth rate that fueled the creation of around 1,000 unicorn companies, driven by promise and potential rather than profitability. Some of these truly generational companies, such as AirBnB, Palantir and Uber, touch the way many of us live, work and play. But for every successful VC-backed startup, there are legions of technically talented builders who paddle hard to catch the perfect wave, but rarely make it work: According to HBS’s Shikhar Ghosh, 75 percent of all venture-backed startups that raise more than $1 million ultimately fail. Patriotic defense and national security entrepreneurs are not immune. Defense-focused venture capital has grown substantially since 2019. In 2022, $35.8 billion was deployed across 800 deals, and despite a minor decline in 2023 ($34.9 billion across 627 deals), at the midway point of 2024, $9.1 billion had been invested across 228 deals in the face of a broader market slowdown. In sum, over the last 5 years, over 2,000 companies have raised almost $100B in venture capital across 14 Defense Department Critical Technology Areas. Yet since 2019, just 20 companies have received more than $25 million in government funding last fiscal year — highlighted in the Wall Street Journal in July. This is all occurring in the highest interest rate environment seen in a generation, which has already hit the venture sector hard, with venture funding contracting and companies shutting down at record rates. In addition, slower-sale-cycle public sector-focused tech companies now have to compete with capital-hungry AI companies that can show viability at much quicker rates. Thankfully, during the interest rate spikes of the 1970s, playbooks emerged on how we can turn high-interest rate challenges into impactful opportunities. Post-WWII, America was booming, driving new public policies that created massive influxes of capital into Wall Street. However, these large pools of capital remained risk-averse and mainly invested in highly stable investment-grade bonds. Then came the Iranian hostage crisis and the corresponding oil shock. Energy prices spiked, inflation skyrocketed, and interest rates followed. Otherwise, strong companies found themselves downgraded, by no fault of their own but simply due to the macroeconomic conditions. These once-strong companies became known as 'fallen angels.' Due to their downgrading, these companies found it more difficult to raise capital, and in some cases, they were shunned out of the capital markets. Where many saw distress, few saw an opportunity. Some players in the financial markets realized these companies were being penalized due to factors that had little to do with the quality of their products and the prudence of their management. Once these external factors subsided, the companies would be fine. Non-investment-grade debt was discovered to have very good risk-adjusted returns, and profit-driven bankers and investors jumped on board to facilitate and issue high-yield debt packages to these fallen angels. Non-investment-grade debt was used to help finance these fallen angels and also to support other financial activities such as leveraged buyouts. The parallels to today’s defense tech companies are startling. Many were born of the zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) era of deep tech resurgence, which provided investors with abundant capital, resulting in inflated valuations attempting to emulate Palantir and SpaceX. Inflation in the wake of COVID (another global black swan event) and the resultant interest rate increases isolated even very good product companies, creating an opportunity not too dissimilar from the fallen angels of the 1970s and 1980s. Saddled with ZIRP-era valuations, very good companies, perhaps even those nearing the elusive 'product-market fit,' are currently at the whims of market forces that have left them unable to get off the cheap-cash treadmill and adjust to a new cost of capital environment. These critical companies and their deep R&amp;D investments, paired with expensive operational requirements ranging from security clearance to compliance standards, cannot adapt as quickly as commercial sales and marketing-heavy enterprise software companies. The result is an enticing pool of 'venture fallen angels' — companies with some evidence of product-market fit and near-term commercialization potential, but not quite enough potential for venture capitalists to put more money in. Who are these venture fallen angels? Well, we put our theory to the test, and here is what we found. Our principles are to consider companies that 1) have raised venture capital, 2) have not finalized product-market fit, and 3) have seen financial headwinds that might make them viable targets. We used Pitchbook data to select a list of companies with an enterprise value of less than $50 million that had raised funding before 2022 (so not companies with fresh runway) in aerospace, defense, and/or deep tech. We manually confirmed that their product(s) fit the defense thesis and vetted them to ensure they are properly American entities. That yielded 385 companies. Next, we enriched this database with government revenue data from the most comprehensive publicly available set of resources, including USAspending.gov, FPDS.gov, SAM.gov, and SBIR.gov. We found that 119 of the 385 had received some form of federal obligation. Next, we looked at whether a company was healthy and growing. This includes looking at overall headcount (year-over-year, and six-month growth) — both in aggregate, and just the product team. We found that the average company in the cohort was 8.5 years old with 100 employees. On average 29 percent of their staff was engineering or technical, and their rate of headcount growth was slowing. In fact, over the past six months, headcount at these companies was flat: It averaged about 1 percent growth. Some saw declines of up to 85 percent and growth reaching a high of 80 percent. On a 12-month basis, the average growth rate stands at just 4 percent. Unsurprisingly, revenue is also disproportionately concentrated among a few high performing companies. The top five companies account for nearly 40 percent of the total obligations, while the top 10 represent over 50 percent of the total. What surprised us most is that some of these companies were high fliers. They are not limited to any single product or segment, instead cutting across cybersecurity, AI, additive manufacturing, UAS, and more. Additionally, while federal revenue is stagnant or shrinking, they may have pivoted to commercial use cases. As such, the acquirers may need to be creative in how they structure the deal, and be open to carveouts and atypical capital structures. Beyond this, any successful 'venture fallen angels' deal will have — at a minimum — three key hurdles to overcome: Strategic M&amp;A in the defense industry is notoriously difficult, with most participants holding a lower risk appetite than their purely commercial cousins. That said, the upside — for country, and profit — is immense. In the government-driven market, we must beware the 'false fail' — where the inability to gain traction in the time allotted (before the money runs out) is conflated with building 'bad tech' or a product no one wants. Historically, distribution in the national security sector has been the greatest moat; the mammoth legacy providers, borne out of World War II consolidation, have massive capture teams who spend every waking moment shaping future acquisitions and ensuring they are well-positioned to win. But like any industry, the convergence of the innovation-forward Trump administration, competition with China, and the most significant technology paradigm shift in the 21st century have created an unprecedented opportunity for disruption. So it is the time to buy and build, consolidate and create for the national interest. A different approach is sorely needed, lest these companies begin to fail, entrepreneurs chase other dreams, and investors pack away their checkbooks to chase AI, crypto, or whatever new wave emerges.

Anduril and Zone 5 Technologies advance for Air Force, DIU Enterprise Test Vehicle	Anduril's Barracuda 500. (Anduril) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit have selected Anduril Industries and Zone 5 Technologies to advance in a program to develop a modular, low-cost air vehicle that can help pave the way for a new generation of weapons. The two companies will now proceed under the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, which was originally envisioned to field an affordable testbed for subsystems and is now poised to serve as a foundation for a new weapon. The Defense Innovation Unit confirmed to Breaking Defense Tuesday that Anduril and Zone 5 Technologies have been selected to continue, meaning competitors from the program’s previous round, Leidos Dynetics and Integrated Solutions for Systems, have been axed. Anduril touted its recently unveiled Barracuda-500 cruise missile in a press release Tuesday announcing the company’s selection to continue, which states that '[o]ver the next several months, Anduril will produce a number of ETV Barracuda-500 units using manufacturing processes and equipment that are representative of future full rate production techniques, continuing development towards a production variant capable of rapidly scalable manufacture in 2026.' The company declined to comment on how much funding it has received under the ETV effort. Zone 5 Technologies confirmed to Breaking Defense that the company has been selected to advance. The vendors who were not picked to proceed did not respond to a request for comment. In a briefing with reporters Monday on the sidelines of the AFA Warfare Symposium, Anduril Senior Director of Advanced Effects Steve Milano explained that while the previous ETV phase demonstrated the ability to manufacture a platform with open systems architecture, integrate subsystems and fly it, the next phase aims to 'iterate' on the platform’s design. Additionally, the next ETV phase is anticipated to incorporate autonomous networking and last about six months. Barracuda is designed to launch from a range of platforms, and an early application of ETV is for a missile that can be dropped out the back of a cargo plane. After the next phase of the ETV program concludes, the effort can transition into the Franklin Affordable Mass Missile (FAMM) program for palletized munitions, Milano explained. Following an earlier phase that proved it was possible to integrate mission systems without extensive redesign activities and fly a vehicle, 'the next instantiation is a formalized requirement to go after a capability set, and that capability set is answered by a program of record called FAMM,' Milano said. A parallel effort called Extended Range Attack Munition has been formed to develop an ETV vehicle for foreign military sales, primarily to aid Ukraine — though military assistance for Kyiv has now been paused. In a separate briefing with reporters Monday morning, Lockheed Martin revealed its own cruise missile news. After previously teasing the concept, the company unveiled its Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT), pronounced 'comet,' that aims to answer the Pentagon’s call for cheaper and easily produced weapons. According to Mike Rothstein, Lockheed’s vice president of strategy and requirements for air weapons and sensors, the CMMT is designed to be an 'upper subsonic' air vehicle with a range of 'multiple hundreds of miles,' adding that larger variants can travel 'upwards to 1,000-ish miles.' Besides features like scalability, the platform was also designed to more easily incorporate different payloads like warheads or sensors. Rothstein said the CMMT 'fits very well inside [FAMM]' effort, and that the company was aiming to meet unit cost goals under the program of $150,000 per round. According to a Lockheed press release, the weapon comes in two air-launched variants: one configuration can deploy from airlifters, fighters and bombers, while a smaller version can act as a launched effect from rotary aircraft. 'Part of our concept is to make the manufacturing easily deployable, easily repeatable, whether it's different places in the United States, whether it's with international partners, whether it's in theaters closer to war,' Rothstein said. 'These are all things we get from listening to our customer.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/anduril-and-zone-5-technologies-advance-for-air-force-diu-enterprise-test-vehicle/	2025-03-05T09:08:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250305_Anduril_barracuda_500.jpg
US unfreezes $95M in military aid to Lebanese Armed Forces	A Lebanese army officer shows to Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam an Israeli military positon on the horizon, in the southern village of Khiam near the border with Israel, on February 28, 2025, after the withdrawal last December of Israeli forces from the area under a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. (RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The US State Department has unfrozen $95 million in military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), granting a waiver to a halt on military aid that occurred shortly after the Trump administration arrived in January. 'The Department approved an exception to expend the $95 million of FMF [Foreign Military Financing] recently reprogrammed to Lebanon. We are working with our DoD colleagues to move forward with the implementation of these funds,' a State Department Spokesperson told Breaking Defense Tuesday. This decision to greenlight the military aid to LAF comes at a time when the military has been charged with implementing a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, which includes the first major deployment to the south of Lebanon in decades. The $95 million FMF sum was originally a part of military funding for Egypt, and was reprogrammed to Lebanon as the Biden administration exited the White House. Days later, FMF agreements were halted by the Trump administration, pending a review. News of the money being unfrozen was first reported by Axios. 'These funds will directly support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) as they work to implement the Lebanon-Israel Cessation of Hostilities. The LAF’s deployment into southern Lebanon – and Hizballah’s withdrawal – will represent the most significant steps towards implementation of UNSCR 1701 since the resolution was passed in 2006,' a State Department official told Breaking Defense on Jan. 7 when the initial announcement was made. The official added that 'supporting the LAF to exert sovereignty across all of Lebanon will constrain the malign activities of Hizballah and their Iranian backers both in Lebanon and their destabilizing activities across the globe.' 'Additional FMF will further enable the LAF to secure the South Litani area, implement UNSCR 1701, and signal strong U.S. commitment to advancing the U.S.-brokered agreement to partners who may be considering increasing assistance to the LAF,' the official added earlier. Israel completed its withdrawal in February 2025 but held on to five supervising positions in the South. And as the Lebanese armed forces are deploying in the South, there is also an increased burden on their shoulders to secure the Northern and Eastern borders with Syria, especially after the fall of the Assad regime. Hence, getting the US aid in could prove extremely well timed for the LAF. The Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, which saw a number of Hezbollah leaders killed and their power base inside Lebanon degraded, has led to a resurgence for the LAF. On Jan. 9, the Lebanese parliament elected the LAF chief Joseph Aoun as president of the country and during the same month the head of the International Court of Justice, Nawaf Salam, was appointed as prime minister, changing the internal dynamics of the country and bringing new non- Hezbollah allied figures to power. In his speech to the parliament, Aoun stressed the state’s exclusive right of carrying arms, a notable statement hinting at ending armed groups outside of the military — a move aimed at the Lebanese armed group, allied with Iran, Hezbollah. As a sign of how things have changed, the delayed funeral of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, took place on Feb. 23 with little incident.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/us-unfreezes-95m-in-military-aid-to-lebanese-armed-forces/	2025-03-05T08:15:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/lebanese-prime-minister-scaled-e1741189003840.jpg
As industry frets licensing bottlenecks, NOAA reinstates top commercial space officials	A graphic image of satellites and debris in space, produced by the Center for Strategic and International Security, the Secure World Foundation, and the University of Texas at Austin. (Satellite Dashboard) AUSTIN, Texas — The Trump administration has reinstated the top official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) charged with licensing commercial remote sensing satellite operations who was fired last week, following a reported revision in the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) instructions to federal agencies requiring the firing of all 'probationary' employees. Sarah Brothers, the head of NOAA's Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA), is back on her job, a spokesperson for NOAA told Breaking Defense Tuesday. Nonetheless, representatives of US remote sensing companies have expressed to Breaking Defense that they remain extremely nervous about possible roadblocks to future plans that require either new licenses or license modifications due to the personnel downsizing resulting from the efforts of Elon Musk's DOGE team to chop the size of the federal bureaucracy. CRSRA is the division within NOAA’s Office of Space Commerce responsible for regulating space-based commercial remote sensing, including work involving companies such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky that provide imagery to the National Reconnaissance Office for use by the Defense Department for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. NOAA, in turn, is under the Department of Commerce. Several industry sources said that the Office of Space Commerce has lost between 25 to 30 percent of its total workforce of some 60 employees. Tahara Dawkins, director of policy at Astroscale U.S. and former chief of staff of the National Space Council, emphasized the critical nature of CRSRA’s role, based on her own firsthand experience leading the office. 'Commercial remote sensing, including non-Earth imaging, plays a critical role in maintaining American space leadership. We look forward to CRSRA’s continued facilitation of private sector innovation in space,' she said. Dawkins comments were echoed by several representatives of remote sensing companies, who noted that CRSRA has been instrumental in helping them navigate what is a bit of a murky regulatory arena as industry races to bring new capabilities to bear. They also pointed out that CRSRA's 'light touch' approach to regulation was crafted during the first Trump administration, and subsequently embraced by the Biden administration. Meanwhile, there were many small sighs of relief from experts here at the annual Space Traffic Management conference at the University of Texas at Austin in response to the news, also confirmed by the NOAA spokesperson, that Dmitry Poisik, the head of the Office of Space Commerce's program to create a civil space traffic management regime, too has been reinstated. That program, called the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS), was designed under the 2018 Space Policy Directive-3 to take the burden of warning non-military satellite operators of potential on-orbit crashes off DoD’s shoulders. Poisik was scheduled to speak at the conference, but withdrew after his termination due to the original Feb. 13 OPM memo ordering the mass firing of 'probationary' employees. In most federal agencies, personnel who have yet to complete one full year in their job are given 'probationary' status.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/as-industry-frets-licensing-bottlenecks-noaa-reinstates-top-commercial-space-officials-sources/	2025-03-05T07:27:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220126_csis_space_dashboard.png
No sailors in sight: DARPA launches warship designed ‘from the ground up’ to be truly unmanned	DARPA’s NOMARS is a 180-footlong warship designed from the ground up to not have humans aboard. (Photo courtesy of DARPA) WASHINGTON — A key Pentagon research and development agency said it has successfully launched and will soon begin sea trials for a vessel dubbed 'NOMARS,' a warship built from the ground up to sail without any humans aboard. 'The No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program has built a ship designed to operate autonomously for long durations at sea,' according to a statement from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on Tuesday. 'Construction of the prototype, unmanned surface vessel (USV) was completed in February 2025.' Sea trials for the ship, dubbed Defiant (USX-1) and which does not have any mission or combat systems installed onboard, are scheduled for spring 2025, the statement added. DARPA in August 2022 selected tech and engineering firm SERCO to design and build NOMARS, a USV measuring 180 feet long and weighing 240 metric tons. While the Pentagon’s interest in unmanned surface vessels is well documented — and industry’s supply of options is vast — NOMARS aims to fulfill a somewhat surprising gap given the technology's name: An operational ship with no people aboard. The majority of USVs the Pentagon uses are either small drones that could not physically carry a human (i.e. Saildrone) or they have been modified to operate autonomously but still have all the relevant spaces to sustain life (i.e. Mariner). The US Navy has taken to calling the ladder 'optionally manned ships.' Proponents of the technology argue that allowing for 'optional manning' defeats the purpose of unmanned ships from the start. The spaces required for human life — bunks, food storage, bathrooms, life preservation equipment — are costly. Cue the NOMARS program. 'The NOMARS program aims to challenge the traditional naval architecture model, designing a seaframe (the ship without mission systems) from the ground up with no provision, allowance, or expectation for humans on board,' according to DARPA. 'By removing the human element from all ship design considerations, the program intends to demonstrate significant advantages, to include: size, cost, at-sea reliability, greater hydrodynamic efficiency, survivability to sea-state, and survivability to adversary actions through stealth considerations and tampering resistance.' Doing as much presents its own sets of challenges, but also a new world of potential solutions. For example, what happens if a fire breaks out aboard Defiant? The answer, Navy officials and others have previously told Breaking Defense, is that the ship can be equipped with a special gas that floods its internal spaces. That gas, which would have health repercussions if humans inhaled it, can deprive the compartment of oxygen, snuffing out a fire.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/no-sailors-in-sight-darpa-launches-warship-designed-from-the-ground-up-to-be-truly-unmanned/	2025-03-05T05:10:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250304_defiant_ship_DARPA_cropped.png
Trump announces new White House shipbuilding office	The world's largest aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) transits the Mediterranean Sea, Aug. 21, 2023. Gerald R. Ford is the U.S. Navy's newest and most advanced aircraft carrier, representing a generational leap in the U.S. Navy's capacity to project power on a global scale. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jackson Adkins) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump today announced the creation of a shipbuilding office in the White House centered on revitalizing the nation’s commercial and naval shipbuilding industry. 'To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,' Trump said during a presidential address to a joint session of Congress, to applause from Republican lawmakers. 'And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs. 'We used to make so many ships,' the president added. 'We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon, it will have a huge impact.' Trump did not specify what kind of financial incentives the office could provide to industry, nor did he provide other details about the role the new office will play in bolstering naval shipbuilding. The Navy’s shipbuilding industrial base has faced supply chain constraints and workforce shortages after years of consolidation and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the mass retirements of skilled laborers. Over the past couple of years, Congress has provided billions in additional funds to shore up the submarine industrial base, which has been especially impacted by supply chain challenges.

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Alex Millar/Released) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Lockheed Martin is out of the running for the Navy’s sixth-generation fighter jet program, known as Next Generation Air Dominance or F/A-XX, Breaking Defense has learned. A source with knowledge of the program told Breaking Defense that Lockheed submitted a bid to the Navy, but the proposal did not satisfy the service’s criteria. The company is now no longer proceeding with the bid. The Navy previously told Breaking Defense in November that the service was evaluating proposals, but it is unclear when Lockheed was knocked out of the competition. The outcome leaves a horse race between Northrop Grumman and Boeing to replace the venerable F/A-18 and E/A-18 with a new air superiority fighter. At stake for Northrop is its first fighter contract since the F-14 Tomcat, famed for its appearance in the original Top Gun movie; at stake for Boeing is the future of its fighter arm, which has seen a massive investment in its St. Louis facility on a gamble that the company will win a sixth-gen contract from the US military. Lockheed referred a request for comment to the Navy. The Navy did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Lockheed, which cornered the market on fifth-generation fighters through its ubiquitous F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor, still has a shot to build a sixth-generation jet through the Air Force’s separate fighter competition, also known as Next Generation Air Dominance, where the company is facing off against Boeing. The F/A-XX program is the highest-profile aircraft competition in the Navy in two decades, but the service has kept the effort highly secretive. Little is known about the capabilities or requirements of the aircraft, aside from the fact that it will be built to complement the F-35 aboard the service’s warships and will have a different airframe and engine than the Air Force’s sixth-gen fighter effort. John Phelan, the Trump administration’s pick to become the next Navy secretary, characterized F/A-XX as a 'next-generation aircraft, offering significant advancements in operational reach and capacity within contested environments' in written answers to questions from lawmakers published last week. The program 'is intended to enable Carrier Strike Groups to outpace adversaries while maintaining naval air dominance,' and will involve collaboration with the Air Force and Marine Corps on autonomy, mission systems, communication architectures, and autonomous combat drones, he wrote [PDF]. In its fiscal 2025 budget request, the Navy delayed about $1 billion of research and development funding that had been slated for F/A-XX in order to fund other readiness priorities while keeping the service’s budget within the constraints of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. 'We’re absolutely committed to the capacity and lethality of the carrier wing,' Rear Adm. Ben Reynolds, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for budget, told reporters in March 2024. 'The capacity [and] the firepower of the air wing is orders of magnitude above anything else that [the Defense Department] has.' Navy officials have publicly remained committed to awarding an F/A-XX contract this year, a contrast with the Air Force, which put its NGAD program on hold last year as it assessed the program. The Air Force conducted an internal analysis last year, which supported the development and fielding of a manned sixth generation fighter, but officials punted a decision on whether to continue the program to the Trump administration. Stephen Feinberg, the nominee for deputy defense secretary, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the decision on the Air Force program could be made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or President Donald Trump. Justin Katz in Washington contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/exclusive-lockheed-out-of-navys-f-a-xx-future-fighter-program/	2025-03-04T14:03:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/220617_f18_aircraft_carrier_1638656-scaled-e1655486661613.jpg
Air Force fields FMS inquiries for MH-139 Grey Wolf helo as test campaign progresses	An MH-139 Grey Wolf flies in formation with UH-1N Hueys as part of an initial operational test and evaluation campaign. (US Air Force photo by Senior Airman Mary Bowers) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Ahead of potential orders, the Air Force has begun gathering interest in foreign military sales (FMS) for the service’s MH-139 Grey Wolf helicopter, another signal of confidence in the platform that has now entered a key evaluation phase. Supplied by Boeing as a replacement for the Air Force’s aging UH-1N Huey, the Grey Wolf as envisioned will be primarily tasked with supporting nuclear security, as well as ferrying VIPs in the Washington, DC-area. And, in an interview with Breaking Defense on Feb. 26, Boeing's Manager for Utility Helicopter Programs Azeem Khan said the helo has already sparked international interest. 'As we look at the program moving forward, we’re also excited [about] the interest and the demand signal that we’re seeing, both domestically and from potential customers around the world,' he said, noting that the attention spurred the Air Force to open an FMS office. 'We’re not far enough along to talk specifics at this moment, but the versatility of the platform [for] military customers is generating interest, and we’re continuing to take a look at those and see where we take this program on its next chapter.' Asked to comment on an FMS office for the program, an Air Force official told Breaking Defense that the service 'is fielding FMS inquiries for the MH-139. However, nothing has been formalized at this time.' Foreign sales would be a boon for Boeing as well as the Italian firm Leonardo, whose commercial AW139 serves as the Grey Wolf’s baseline. It may also help restore some helicopters the companies were originally expecting to manufacture following the Air Force’s apparent move to cut the Grey Wolf’s program of record. Former Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter previously explained the cuts would likely affect some of the helo's secondary roles, like VIP flights and search-and-rescue assistance. However, a Pentagon report last year revealed the service may be looking to add back in some aircraft for the Grey Wolf program, meaning that some roles may be on the table once again. Still, Khan said that though Boeing officials are aware of talks of trimming the MH-139 buy, a decision to change the program of record has not been finalized. 'As of today, we have not been formally notified that our program of record has been cut. We execute on what we have in front of us, and it's focusing on our requirements and our contractual deliverables,' he said, adding that a contract award for the program’s next production lot is expected sometime this year. As the evaluation campaign has proceeded, users have identified some needed changes to the platform, which the Pentagon’s top weapons tester said in a recent report [PDF] range from altering cabin seating to redesigning the aircraft’s gun mount and accompanying bag to catch spent shells. 'What we're delivering, from a configuration perspective, is what we are on contract for, and what the aircraft is being tested through is that configuration,' Khan said. Since the helicopter’s contract was awarded in 2018, 'needs and desires have also changed, but we're maintaining the contracted configuration, and we’re always open to opportunities to continue to enhance and improve that where it makes sense. And that's just part of the journey of this product life cycle, and we’re in close coordination with the Air Force.' Meanwhile, the platform itself continues to progress through its test campaign. According to an Air Force press release, on Jan. 28 an MH-139 embarked on its first initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) flight at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana by escorting a missile convoy, kicking off assessments of the helicopter’s effectiveness in operational scenarios. The IOT&amp;E stage is expected to continue through June of this year, the Air Force press release says. Khan said the aircraft’s initial operational capability, or the milestone that indicates when a system has been fielded in sufficient quantities and can be maintained to support real-world operations, is expected 'toward the back end of the year.' Sometime after that, the program is expected to enter full rate production, he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/air-force-fields-fms-inquiries-for-mh-139-grey-wolf-helo-as-test-campaign-progresses/	2025-03-04T11:43:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/grey-wolf-mh-139.jpeg
Nominee for top DoD policy job sidesteps questions on Russian invasion of Ukraine	Elbridge Colby, then the Robert M. Gates senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, asks U.S. Air Force Gen. Paul J. Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a question during a National Defense University Center conference in Washington, Jan. 19, 2016. (DoD photo by Army Staff Sgt. Sean K. Harp) WASHINGTON — Less than a day after President Donald Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, his pick for the top Pentagon policy job frustrated Democrats by refusing to state outright that Russia invaded Ukraine. Elbridge Colby, who Trump nominated for the Defense Department’s undersecretary for policy in December, has previously stated that the invasion of Ukraine was 'an evil act by the Russians.' However, during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee today, Colby repeatedly sidestepped questions on the topic, citing the sensitivity of ongoing peace negotiations led by Trump. 'I stand by my record, but at this point, I think there's a very delicate diplomatic process going on where the president is rightfully trying to resuscitate the peace process,' he said in response to questions by SASC top Democrat Sen. Jack Reed. He later dodged similar questions from other senators, including Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Angus King, Ind.-Maine, Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. 'It's important to be discreet and say things at the appropriate time and place,' Colby told King. 'The problem is, you tell us you're going to tell truth to power,' King said. 'The most obvious truth is that Russia invaded Ukraine. Everybody in the world knows that, and you won't say it here today, because it appears that you don't want to offend the president.' Duckworth said Colby’s refusal to state 'a known fact' was tantamount to 'saying you don't know whether or not Hitler invaded Poland.' Colby’s testimony comes days after a disastrous meeting between Trump, Vice President JD Vance — who introduced Colby during the hearing — and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last week. The meeting was set for the parties to agree to a mineral-rights deal, but devolved into a public argument in which Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being insufficiently thankful to the United States for billions of dollars in military aid. Numerous news outlets reported on Monday, citing White House sources, that Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine as a result. Colby, whose longtime tenure in government includes positions such as the Pentagon’s deputy assistant secretary for strategy and force development, is best known as one of the authors of the Trump administration’s 2018 National Defense Strategy, which centered on great power competition with China and Russia over counterterrorism. Known within Washington circles as a foreign policy 'realist,' Colby has advocated that the United States pare back its involvement in the Middle East and Europe — including its aid for Ukraine — to focus its resources against the Chinese threat. In his opening comments, Reed said that Trump’s decision to cut military aid to Ukraine damages US relationship with its allies and could embolden China. 'The administration’s actions are doing great harm to America’s standing in the world, showing anyone who is paying attention that the United States can no longer be trusted,' he said. 'President Xi will take note.' However, Colby stood by his past statements that the US must prioritize a potential fight in the Asia-Pacific theater over its support of Ukraine. 'I don't contest the fact that the Chinese are looking at what we're doing in Ukraine at all,' Colby said. 'But fundamentally, Senator, my view — and I think it should be of particular interest to this committee, sir — is that we have to have the military capabilities in Asia, or relevant to Asia, to be able to conduct a local defense of Taiwan at a cost and level of risk that the American people are prepared to tolerate, and that has been my main focus.' 'A longer term top priority for me would be, if confirmed, would be to revivify our defense industrial base, so that we are no longer in a position where our defense industrial base cannot produce at levels, where we can resource in multiple theaters at the level that we need,' he added. Later in the hearing, Colby defended Trump’s actions on Ukraine, stating that the president is a 'deal maker' whose unpredictability gives him leverage during negotiations. 'With President Trump, you have a very different dynamic. You don't know what he's going to do, but you can get a deal with him,' he said. While Colby is likely to be confirmed, his nomination has come under scrutiny from some Republicans who have quietly questioned his noninterventionist stance on the Middle East, resulting in GOP heavy hitters like Vance and Elon Musk stepping in to defend his record, Politico reported last month. However, only Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Dan Sullivan of Alaska asked pointed questions regarding Colby’s position in the Middle East, with both lawmakers interrogating the nominee on his position on Iran. Colby responded that a nuclear armed Iran — particularly one with access to intercontinental ballistic missiles — would be an existential threat to the United States, and that he would provide military options to the president to stop Iran from gaining access to nuclear weapons. Multiple times throughout the hearing, Colby stated he would help support defense acquisition reform efforts, with Vance characterizing Colby as a 'good guy' that would be willing to work with Democrats on such policy objectives. 'That means not just buying more weapons,' Vance said. 'That means being smart about how we buy weapons in a way that enhances our technological edge and ensures that upstarts, not just the big five incumbents, but upstarts, can participate in the process of procurement and of giving our troops the weapons systems that they need.' Colby’s reticence to assign blame for the Russia-Ukraine conflict echoed statements made by Stephen Feinberg, Trump’s nominee for deputy secretary of defense, during his nomination hearing last week. Elsewhere on Capitol Hill this morning, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a confirmation hearing for two State Department nominees and the representative to NATO, where Democrats pressed nominees with similar questions about whether Russia invaded Ukraine. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., asked Christopher Landau, who has been nominated to be the State Department’s deputy secretary, 'Do you think that Putin and Russia were the aggressors in Ukraine?' 'Senator, at this point, there are peace negotiations taking place across the world —' Landau responded before Van Hollen cut him off, and posed the same question to Matthew Whitaker, who is nominated to be the US representative to NATO. 'I’m not here to assign labels, but I would say that JD Vance on Friday said that Russia invaded Ukraine,' he responded. 'Ok, so you don’t know if they’re the aggressor,' the senator shot back.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/nominee-for-top-dod-policy-job-sidesteps-questions-on-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/	2025-03-04T11:26:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/2363052-scaled-e1741112606915.jpg
‘Europe’s moment:’ EU unveils $843B ‘ReArm Europe’ spending plan, as US-Ukraine relations flail	Ursula von der Leyen delivers an announcement on a new $843 billion EU defense package (European Commission) BELFAST — As allies brace for the US to cut military funding for Ukraine, the European Union announced today a new €800 billion ($843 billion) package to 'rearm' the continent, dubbed &#8216;ReArm Europe.' Unveiling the plan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, was blunt, saying, 'We are in an era of rearmament. And Europe is ready to massively boost its defense spending.' 'This is Europe's moment, and we must live up to it,' she added. Coincidentally or not, the announcement comes on a day when President Donald Trump will address the US congress, and as multiple reports say Washington has decided to cut off military aid and may stop the transfer of weapons to Ukraine following an explosive meeting in the Oval Office between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ReArm Europe funding will be dependent on securing €650 billion over four years by triggering a 'national escape clause' that suspends budget rules, allows national governments greater flexibility over public funding and could produce, on average, a 1.5 percent defense spending increase per member state. A 'new instrument' offering €150 billion of loans to member states would be responsible for delivering the remainder of the funding. Additionally, member states will be able to redirect funding from other EU projects to increase defense related efforts. Von der Leyen stressed that the rearmament project rests on 'spending better – and spending together,' while at the same time will focus on developing 'pan-European capability domains.' She referred specifically to ammunition, air and missile defense, artillery systems, drones and missiles as weapons that Europe needs to invest in. 'Of course, with this equipment, Member States can massively step up their support to Ukraine,' she added. We are living in dangerous times. Europe‘s security is threatened in a very real way. Today I present ReArm Europe. A plan for a safer and more resilient Europe ↓ https://t.co/CYTytB5ZMk &mdash; Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) March 4, 2025 The rearmament plan also signals a stronger joint procurement push by the EU, which von der Leyen said will 'reduce costs, reduce fragmentation increase interoperability and strengthen our defense industrial base.' European officials voiced strong support for von der Leyen’s rearmament plan. On X, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis labelled it a 'significant step toward strengthening our collective European security.' He added, 'We must now work out the details to ensure that all member states benefit—regardless of their current defense spending.' Similarly, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s outgoing foreign minister, said the initiative was an 'important first step' in strengthening Europe defense. More broadly, the level of spending proposed under ReArm Europe is directly in line with calls from industry to urgently move the needle. Last month, Saab CEO Micael Johansson, told Breaking Defense that if the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP) could not go beyond a proposed budget of €1.5 billion and reach 'hundreds of billions' then a 'coalition of the willing' should be formed to fund major equipment projects and scale up production. Von der Leyen's announcement comes two days before European leaders gather for a 'special' European Council meeting in Brussels to discuss additional support for Kyiv and 'exchange views on European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine,' according to an EU statement. Since Friday's explosive meeting in the Oval Office, Europe has been scrambling to come to grips with the reality that it may be alone in challenging Russia. That means any strategy needs to not only involve improving individual state defenses, but also helping to support Ukraine going forward. Whether Europe can step up and fill that void is very much a question, one on display Tuesday morning at a a UK defence committee hearing on European security. Julian David, CEO at TechUK, said that even outside of obvious heavy equipment like ATACMS, Patriot and HIMARS, the MoD would be unable to replace US communications and 'information, surveillance and reconnaissance' capabilities. He added, 'Everybody talks about Starlink, but it's a broader problem than that, and that really does need thinking about, even at the level of GPS.' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, said that production of ammunition across Europe would effectively need to double in order to make up for the absence of US stocks. 'That’s a big ask,' he explained.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/europes-moment-eu-unveils-843b-rearm-europe-spending-plan-as-us-ukraine-relations-flail/	2025-03-04T11:05:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/P065815-187142-scaled-e1741108794189.jpg
Mach announces deal with Army lab for vertical takeoff ‘Strategic Strike’ cruise missile	California-based defense firm Mach announced on March 4, 2025 it was working with a US Army lab to develop a new vertically launched cruise missile dubbed Strategic Strike. (Mach) WASHINGTON — Mach Industries has announced a recent deal with an Army research lab to work on a vertical takeoff (VTO) cruise missile called Strategic Strike. Based in Huntington Beach, Calif., the company said today that the Army Applications Laboratory awarded it with an undisclosed amount of funding last year to work on a new weapon for soldiers at the company- through brigade-level formations. The weapon, according to Mach, is being designed to hit targets up to 290 km (180 miles) away and host a 10-plus kg (22-lbs) warhead. 'The primary objective for Strategic Strike is to launch from beyond enemy radar range, reducing the probability of detection, and increasing launch team survivability,' Mach said in the press release. 'Tactical maneuver units will be able to engage and prosecute high-payoff targets, such as radar arrays and artillery pieces, well beyond the forward line of troops.' The company said it locked down the weapon’s design in September 2024 before 'successfully' testing out its vertical take-off during a full-performance, wing-borne flight in mid-January. It is now integrating 'artificial intelligence visual' and radio frequency sensing techniques into the cruise missile to enable it to hit a target when GPS and communication is severed — a growing requirement as strategists watch the electronic warfare-saturated combat environment in Ukraine. 'The combination of VTO, high speed and range/payload is radically novel for the current fighting force,' Mach said in the press release. 'At the culmination of the contract, Mach will provide the warfighter with a VTO asset that has HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] range, cruise missile speed, and Hellfire effects.' As novel as it is, Mach is not the only company working on a new class of such vertical takeoff weapons. While not a cruise missile, Anduril Industries has been working on a subsonic, vertical takeoff and landing drone dubbed Roadrunner-Munition (Roadrunner-M) that the company says can be reused on surveillance missions or in a kamikaze-like fashion to strike moving aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/mach-announces-deal-with-army-lab-for-vertical-takeoff-strategic-strike-cruise-missile/	2025-03-04T10:48:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250304_strategic_strike_MACH.png
New thinking needed to safeguard our spectrum	U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Geoffery Smith, 20th Communications Squadron installation spectrum manager, views the display on a radio spectrum analyzer at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., Jan. 13, 2017. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Kathryn R.C. Reaves) If the Pentagon was asked to relocate its air bases, radar stations, missile silos, and other facilities to make room for wind farm developers, Congress would reject the idea out of hand. Such a massive disruption would threaten our national security and cost taxpayers untold billions of dollars — all to benefit a few. Yet effectively the same debate is taking place over another kind of real estate: the radio spectrum bands set aside to carry the military’s wireless transmissions, including the frequencies needed and used today and in the future for radar, targeting, and command-and-control systems, and potentially for envisioned systems like hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. Some in industry are again seeking to gain exclusive control over additional portions of the spectrum, including those used by the military, through spectrum auctions. Some in Congress are taking the proposal seriously. At the center of the debate is a slice of spectrum the military cannot plausibly replace: the mid-band frequencies between 3.1 and 3.5 GHz that offer the ideal mix of range and capacity for defense applications. For example, the Navy’s Aegis AN/SPY radar operates in this band. That is one reason defense champions in Congress have repeatedly raised concerns about the security threat posed by efforts to sell off these critically important segments of military spectrum. Former Pentagon CIO John Sherman explained that vacating the band would be 'absolutely untenable,' taking decades to complete. It would also cost more than taxpayers could ever hope to gain from auction revenues. Moving the Navy’s Aegis radar system alone comes with a price tag of $120 billion. What many fail to consider is that Congress doesn’t need to eject the military from these frequencies in order to free up spectrum for private use and gain the appropriate economic benefits for the American people. Reframing the discussion from one or the other, to one with the other is not only possible but necessary. Proven spectrum sharing models, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), demonstrate that the military can retain priority access to key spectrum while safely and securely opening the band to factories, warehouses, rural internet providers, schools, airports, and other innovative users. As a result, consumers gain the benefits from new wireless technologies, improved connectivity, and more competitive prices — without forcing massive costs and dangerous disruptions on our armed services. We should continue to aggressively pursue proven sharing technologies, innovate new ones, and scale to multiple geographic areas and spectrum ranges. This approach affirms US global leadership in spectrum innovation. Bureaucratic inertia may tempt Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to fall back on an exclusive, full-power licensing model rooted in the cell phone technologies of the 80s and 90s. That playbook assumes a false choice between national security and commercial innovation. In fact, spectrum sharing models support dual-use innovative technologies, maintain national security needs, and allow commercial use of the contested frequency bands. It’s time for new thinking. Military leaders have made it clear they are prepared to share key spectrum with a diverse array of users — so long as these commercial systems don’t interfere with operations or force the Pentagon to vacate vital frequencies. Now it’s up to Congress, the FCC, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to embrace spectrum sharing as the only reasonable solution to the country’s current spectrum stalemate. By setting aside dangerous and costly proposals for relocating military spectrum, we can clear the way for innovative sharing technologies that will reinforce US wireless leadership, boost competition, and create jobs. National leaders don’t need to accept the false choice between exclusive, full-power licensing and military readiness. It’s a recipe for failure. Instead, we should build on proven models for shared spectrum that can preserve our national security while still maximizing the use of a scarce national resource, increase taxpayer revenue, and advance American businesses and technologies around the world.

Space Systems Command chief backs ‘important’ work of Space Development Agency	Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant speaks during a Department of the Air Force worship service at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., Sept. 10, 2023. (U.S. Air Force/Eric Dietrich) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The head of the Space Force’s main acquisition arm expressed full confidence in the Space Development Agency (SDA) on Monday, offering support for both the entity’s work as well as its independent status within the service. 'I think it's fantastic work. It's continuing. It's important,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander of the Space Force's Space Systems Command (SSC), said in a Monday roundtable with reporters at the AFA Warfare conference in Aurora, Colo. 'And I think the Space Development Agency will continue to be an incredibly important part of the Space Force, independent and completely separate from SSC.' Originally established outside the Space Force by reporting directly to the Pentagon’s research and development office, SDA was required by Congress to transfer into the Space Force in 2022, but has maintained its quasi-independent status. However, as Breaking Defense first reported, the Trump administration is reviewing whether SDA should be more fully rolled into the Space Force acquisition system. SDA also finds itself at an awkward place, as its leader, Derek Tournear, is currently suspended while being investigated over whether he improperly steered a contract to a preferred company — something that led to Garrant briefly serving as SDA's acting head before being replaced. Despite all that, Garrant was clear he has been impressed with the work SDA has done. 'They have demonstrated, I'll call them inter- and intra-constellation crosslinks, which is pretty amazing when you think about how quickly they did that,' he said. SDA is currently developing a low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation that can transport data around the world, using a so-called 'mesh' network that relies on laser communications links between satellites. And the agency's approach has drawn concerns from the Government Accountability Office, which found in a February watchdog report that SDA has yet to prove the technology is viable. Asked about the report’s findings, Garrant said making sure the laser links — otherwise known as optical communications — work will be critical for the Space Force’s orbital architecture to function. 'Optical crosslinks are important to all of our constellations, not just in LEO but between orbital regimes as well. When you contemplate moving data at operationally relevant speeds, we're going to need to be able to do that. We're going to have to be able to do it between constellations as well,' he said. 'So it's a critical area that will get the attention that the GAO is pointing out.' The Elon Musk led DOGE effort to cut the federal workforce has been hitting agencies across the government, and Garrant said SSC has not been spared of large workforce cuts. 'A considerable number of SSC employees' took the deferred resignation plan offered to federal workers, according to the general, who added that there are a 'number' of probationary employees at the command whose easier-to-fire status has made them a favorite target of DOGE’s workforce cuts. Garrant said officials are working to quickly off-ramp employees, as well as ensure essential work remains covered. Garrant additionally said SSC will play its part to contribute to a budget drill ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that seeks to shift roughly eight percent of DoD funding to new priorities. In a separate roundtable with reporters Monday, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said the Space Force’s options for the budget drill essentially amounted to time and capacity, meaning that projects could be delayed or fewer systems could be fielded for the same mission in order to save money. 'I think that there is a recognition that we have a new mission, and the new mission comes with new resources. It's just about how much of those resources you get, how fast you get it,' Saltzman replied when asked what areas the Space Force may have to pull back in. 'I haven't really seen a push to give up anything. It's more about capacity and timeliness' for certain programs, he added. And as the Space Force jostles for funds under Hegseth’s new approach, Saltzman made his priority clear in a keynote address to the AFA conference on Monday. The Space Force, Saltzman said, must establish 'space superiority,' including by exercising 'space control' — protection of friendly space assets and denying adversaries the ability to use their own space capabilities — by degrading, disrupting or even destroying enemy satellite systems if necessary. 'Space control is a new function for our fledgling service and it's my No. 1 priority whenever I speak to executive and legislative leaders, because we currently don't have the resources to perform it as effectively as the Joint Force requires,' Saltzman said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/space-systems-command-chief-backs-important-work-of-space-development-agency/	2025-03-04T09:05:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/garrant-scaled-e1741094779597.jpg

Tech bros to the rescue? Reagan Institute 2025 scorecard dings Pentagon on ‘scaling’ innovation	SpaceX Transporter-5 launch, 25th May 2022, carrying 5 ICEYE radar imaging satellites. (Photo: SpaceX) WASHINGTON — As Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes dramatic changes at the Pentagon, the thinktank named for the icon of old-school conservatism urged President Donald Trump to hit the gas on high-tech weapons built by non-traditional industry players. The Ronald Reagan Institute determined its recommendations before Sec. Hegseth's order to reallocate $50 billion in funding, said the institute's director, former Pentagon official Roger Zakheim, in a breakfast briefing with reporters, but they're 'highly complementary' to what the new administration is trying to do. The Pentagon has made real progress in reaching beyond its typical contractors to 'maturing defense startups' the institute's report said, with Zakheim specifically calling out Anduril, Palantir, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX as 'trailblazers.' But, it goes on, a sclerotic defense bureaucracy and a rusting US industrial base make it hard to scale up production to the levels required for major war. Meanwhile, China not only dominates heavy-metal manufacturing — with twice America’s manufacturing capability output and 230 times the capacity for building ships — but is investing heavily in cutting-edge R&amp;D to catch up to America in AI, quantum technology and hypersonics. Those are the principal takeaways from the Reagan Institute’s latest 'report card' on what it calls the 'national security innovation base' — a clunky but carefully chosen term for something much larger and more complex than the traditional 'defense industrial base.' First issued in 2023, the annual report looks not only at Pentagon procurement and R&amp;D, but across the US economy at metrics like most-cited scientific papers and amount of 5G spectrum. This broad view catches some strong positives that traditional military metrics miss. '[The] US leads with 61 notable machine learning models,' the report says, 'followed by China with 15 and France with eight.' And venture capital investment in defense-related fields, it says, has risen from $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to a whopping $14.7 billion in Q4, 'four consecutive quarters of growth' driven almost entirely by rising interest in AI. 'There's plenty of capital in the system,' said McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant Dale Swartz, an advisor on the report. 'You increasingly have very large rounds being being raised — on both sides of the Atlantic, by the way. At this point &#8230; some of the largest VC-backed companies, both in the US and Europe, are in the defense and space arena, which is actually a pretty novel development over the past couple of years.' It’s private-sector innovators like those funded by venture capitalists that the Reagan Institute sees as driving much-needed change and preserving America’s high-tech edge. That said, not all the good guys in the report are Silicon Valley upstarts: It notes the leading role played by 'corporate venture capital' investments by long-established defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon/RTX. Even the Pentagon bureaucracy has made progress, according to this report, especially compared to the Reagan Institute’s first scorecard in 2023. There’s money moving through streamlined acquisition pipelines that were under-used in 2022, for example a 22 percent increase in Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards. There are also new channels for faster funding of non-traditional contractors, like over $4 billion provided by the Small Business Investment Company Critical Technologies Initiative (SBICCT, a joint initiative of the Small Business Administration and the Department of Defense). But, the report laments, these streamlined processes and innovative technologies remain a relatively small part of the massive Pentagon budget. (Since the Reagan study looks back at 2024, it doesn’t comment on the recent announcement that Trump’s new Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has ambitious plans to reallocate $50 billion from 'legacy' programs to new priorities). And while American tech has kept its cutting edge, mass production remains anemic. In fact, to emphasize this issue, the 2025 report adds a new category for 'Manufacturing Capacity and Industrial Base' — for which it gives the United States a 'D.' Meanwhile, the US defense industry — upstarts and established players alike — has been thrown into uncertainty by Trump's suspension of aid to Ukraine. Also Congress has yet to pass regular appropriations for the fiscal year which began Oct. 1st, forcing the Pentagon to operate on (slightly modified) funding lines from 2024. But Zakheim insisted there was light at the end of the budgetary tunnel, in the form of proposed 'reconciliation' bills that could add up to $200 billion to defense. 'Reconciliation is something that is not dependent on president's budget request,' he told reporters. 'It's Congress generating it, and doesn't require the 60-vote threshold [in the Senate]. And of course, why it's so critical.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/tech-bros-to-the-rescue-reagan-institute-2025-scorecard-dings-pentagon-on-scaling-innovation/	2025-03-04T07:36:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/SpaceX__Transporter-5.jpg
Navy contractor KEEL to open new $70M facilities for submarine fabrication	Metal Trades' Yonges Isand facility in South Carolina. (Photo courtesy of KEEL) WASHINGTON — South Carolina-based Navy contractor KEEL is planning to invest $70 million in three new facilities totaling 60,000 square feet focused on submarine and aircraft carrier component manufacturing in Charleston, the company’s chief executive told Breaking Defense. 'We’re purpose building KEEL to help solve the capacity challenges in nuclear Navy shipbuilding,' said Brian Carter. 'This is a critical step in us adding capacity to the industry that will directly impact the and improve the schedule for building both Virginia [and] Columbia [class submarines] and future' aircraft carriers. The company, which took its current shape in January 2024, was formed through a merger of two South Carolina companies — fabricator Pegasus Steel and shipyard Metal Trades — along with the Michigan-based Merrill Technologies Group. Its current work for the Navy is focused on building the Columbia-class submarine superstructures that are ultimately delivered — by truck or barge — to prime contractors General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII Newport News. KEEL also fabricates numerous components to be used on future Ford-class aircraft carriers. Carter said the expansion will include three facilities that will all start construction in 2025 or 2026 and be completed by or in 2027: a preparation and paint building; a facility for Columbia-class superstructure fabrication; and a building for employees. KEEL’s announcement comes on the heels of numerous other Navy contractors announcing expansions in the region. HII earlier this year closed on its acquisition of metal fabricator W International. Meanwhile, Leonardo DRS last week also announced a facilities expansion in South Carolina focused on manufacturing space for naval propulsion technologies. Carter said South Carolina's proximity from HII and General Dynamics Electric Boat is likely a key factor in why numerous other Navy contractors are opening up shop in the region. 'It's critical that it's an easy voyage, if you will, for both truckable and bargeable components to both Newport News and Electric Boat,' he said. 'But it's far enough away where it's a different labor market, and we can tap into some really great infrastructure here for training and developing our trades workforce. 'If you look at the growth of Charleston last 10-15, years, it is becoming more of a manufacturing hub, and there is quite a population growth that's occurred along with that,' Carter continued. 'And so it &#8230; should grow into more of its own shipbuilding ecosystem, if you will, to support these priority Navy programs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/navy-contractor-keel-to-open-new-70m-facilities-for-submarine-fabrication/	2025-03-04T05:45:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Keel-MetalTrades-157_Full-Aerial-with-Water_BB-scaled.jpg
Empty seats as Air Force limits AFA attendance, in line with ‘spirit’ of DOGE orders	Sparse attendance at AFA's Warfare Symposium following a Trump executive order. (Michael Marrow / Breaking Defense) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air &amp; Space Forces Association (AFA) Warfare Symposium held each spring is typically a packed affair, as thousands of airmen and Guardians crowd the halls of the three-day event standing shoulder-to-shoulder with industry and other attendees. But this year’s conference, held on the outskirts of Denver, Colo., at the Gaylord Hotel in Aurora, is a stark departure from past iterations. The halls are largely empty compared to years' past, as orders from above have barred many members of the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes the Air Force and Space Force, from showing up. Perhaps the clearest example of a drop in attendance came during keynote addresses from Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, where a number of audience members gathered near the stage but dozens of other chairs were noticeably empty. Most years when either top officer speak at this conference, it's a standing-room-only event. A full house for a panel at AFA's 2024 Warfare Symposium. (AFA Flickr) While a representative for AFA did not respond to Breaking Defense's request for attendance figures, the relatively empty conference rooms and hallways were accompanied by other, smaller indications of a drop in visitors. For example, it's often hard to establish cell signal due to the sheer number of other phones in the vicinity. This year, that's not a problem. The DAF recently made the decision to limit attendance 'to comply with the spirit of' President Donald Trump’s Feb. 26 executive order that implements the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk, according to a DAF spokesperson. 'Attendance has been limited to individuals with a direct role in the conference such as speakers, moderators, panel members, award winners and their supervisors, senior leaders with previously scheduled industry engagements, and local participants that attend at no cost,' the spokesperson said, adding that a virtual option is available for other registrees. AFA is the first large trade show held since the Feb. 26 order, and could raise questions about how future industry events may go. Vendors pay a hefty price to host booths in an exhibition hall that can serve as a meeting place for government customers and other officials — a primary driver of corporate attendance. If the severe drop in foot traffic here is a window into the future, it’s not clear how industry may be prompted to change its approach, particularly if fellow military services make similar moves to scale back their presence at major conferences. One industry source told Breaking Defense that they had seen roughly a 10 percent drop in meetings with senior service leadership following the Feb. 26 order. However, they said other senior leader engagements are largely continuing as planned, meaning there's still value for companies in showing up. 'We don't have this kind of interaction' except at shows like AFA, 'so it's very good from a company to really feel the pulse where the whole Air Force organization is headed and how we can support them,' the official said, who was granted anonymity to share internal planning details. 'So if that went away, yeah, that would be bad.' Another consideration, the source said, is that young airmen and Guardians who operate industry equipment may not have as many opportunities to interact and share feedback with suppliers. Whether the Pentagon's pullback from the AFA show should be taken as an omen may be too soon to tell, some industry sources said, particularly as Trump administration initiatives change by the day. 'I think the question is whether this is a temporary thing, or whether it becomes permanent,' a second industry official told Breaking Defense from the show floor.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/empty-seats-as-air-force-limits-afa-attendance-in-line-with-spirit-of-doge-orders/	2025-03-03T15:58:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250303_afa_colorado_empty_MARROW-scaled-e1741045601409.jpg
Air Force pauses deliveries of Boeing’s KC-46 tanker	A KC-46A Pegasus arrives at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., Dec. 21, 2021. (US Air Force photo) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air Force has instructed Boeing to halt deliveries of the KC-46 tanker after cracks were found on two production aircraft awaiting their handoff to the Air Force. The decision to pause deliveries was made on Feb. 27 by the service’s KC-46A program office 'due to the identification of in the ‘outboard fixed-trailing-edge support structure’' of the two planes, an Air Force spokesperson said. 'The damage does not pose a safety-of-flight concern; however, identified cracks must be repaired before returning an aircraft to service,' The spokesperson said. 'Boeing, the Program Office, and Air Mobility Command are working to quickly identify the root cause and develop both a near and long-term way ahead.' A source with knowledge of the program told Breaking Defense that the issue revolves around cracks found on the aileron hinges of two aircraft yet to be delivered to the Air Force. The service and Boeing have been aware since 2018 that the KC-46 — like its parent aircraft, the commercial 767 — could develop cracks to the aileron hinges over time, but the discovery of cracking on brand new aircraft led the service to stop deliveries. 'We are working closely with the customer to assess a potential issue on KC-46 aircraft and to mitigate any potential impact to the fleet and in-production airplanes,' a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. The War Zone was first to report news of the pause. The KC-46 has experienced numerous technical issues and schedule delays during its development and fielding, chiefly the redesign of the aircraft’s Remote Vision System — a collection of sensors that allow the boom operator to refuel a receiver airplane without visually looking out a window — which is expected to be fielded in 2026. Those issues and others have resulted in billions of dollars in cost overruns for Boeing, which is locked into a fixed-price contract that holds it responsible for paying costs above a certain threshold. Losses on the KC-46 amounted to $2 billion in 2024, Boeing stated in regulatory filings released in January. The Air Force last paused KC-46A deliveries for a two month period beginning in March 2024, which occurred so that the service could inspect production and fielded aircraft for a broken component on the aircraft’s boom. The service recorded a new 'category 1' technical deficiency for the program a couple months later after discovering that vibrations from a fuel pump that were damaging bleed air ducts, Air Force officials told reporters in July.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/air-force-pauses-deliveries-of-boeings-kc-46-tanker/	2025-03-03T12:05:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/6990563-scaled-e1741031493269.jpg
After JAG firings, a difficult truth about military legal independence	The Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, Lt. Gen. Stuart W. Risch, visited Puerto Rico on Feb. 8 as part of his ongoing efforts to spread awareness about the Judge Advocate General program. (Photo by Sgt. Marcuss Moyett) The recent decision by the secretary of defense to fire all three service Judge Advocates General (JAGs) sent shockwaves through the military legal community. Being a military lawyer myself, this decision went beyond a mere headline: It was deeply personal, as one of the JAGs who was dismissed was my boss. Like many in the JAG Corps, my initial reaction was frustration. The prevailing wisdom holds that JAGs are neutral arbiters of the law, advising commanders without political influence. Their role is ensuring legal soundness of policies, not shaping them based on partisan considerations. The idea that they were removed for being 'roadblocks' to policy seemed like an attack on that very principle. But as I sat with this, I realized that history tells a more complicated story. This event, as shocking as it is, may not be an aberration. Instead, it reveals a truth about military legal advice, a truth I was reluctant to acknowledge but now feel compelled to explore. For those of us who have spent our careers in the JAG Corps, there is a comforting belief that our role is fundamentally different from that of civilian political appointees. We do not serve at the pleasure of the president like the attorney general, and our function is often described as purely legal, not political. But if that were entirely true, why has history repeatedly placed military lawyers at the center of political battles? Take, for example, the John Yoo torture memos from the early 2000s. Yoo, a lawyer in the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), authored memos that provided legal justification for enhanced interrogation techniques, a policy deeply intertwined with the Bush administration’s political objectives. When Congress sought clarity on these policies, they did not call military commanders to testify. They called upon the expertise of lawyers from both the civilian and military sectors. Yoo and other administration-aligned lawyers provided testimony to Congress defending the policy decisions as legally justified. JAG officers, including the Judge Advocates General at the time, testified as well, voicing legal concerns about interrogation policies. The military testimony stood in stark contrast to the administration’s position, and it contributed to the eventual rollback of some policies. This historical example illustrates a difficult reality: Legal advice in government is never purely neutral. It is always part of the policy process. JAGs, whether we want to admit it or not, play a role in shaping and legitimizing military policies. Our legal opinions do not just exist in a vacuum; they influence what the Department of Defense is able to do, and as a result, they inherently intersect with politics. Unlike the attorney general, who is publicly nominated, confirmed by the Senate, and explicitly recognized as a political appointee, the selection of the Judge Advocates General is a closed process that takes place within the JAG Corps itself. This insularity has long been seen as a safeguard against political pressure, ensuring that military legal advice remains independent. But it also means that when legal interpretations do not align with an administration’s policy goals, there is no mechanism for resolving that conflict — except for the kind of sweeping firings we just witnessed. The secretary’s decision, whether intentional or not, highlights an uncomfortable pair of questions: If JAGs function in a manner similar to civilian legal advisors who help implement executive policy, should their selection process be more transparent? And if we acknowledge that military legal advice plays a role in legitimizing or obstructing policy, can we still assume that JAG selection should be insulated from the administration? None of this is to say that the secretary’s decision was the right approach. Blanket firings based on perceived policy misalignment, rather than demonstrated misconduct or incompetence, create serious risks. First, such a move weakens confidence in military legal integrity. If JAGs can be dismissed purely because they provide legal interpretations that do not align with policy objectives, future legal advisors may feel pressured to offer guidance that is politically expedient rather than legally sound. It could also politicize military legal advice even further. If the standard for removal becomes disagreement with an administration’s preferred policy direction, future JAG appointments may shift toward those who are perceived as more politically agreeable rather than legally rigorous. And finally, it sets a precedent for instability. The role of JAGs should not be about political loyalty. While legal interpretation is an inherently political process, there must be room for good faith legal disagreement without fear of dismissal. This moment calls for a serious discussion about the role of JAGs in military policy and whether the selection process should be reformed to better balance legal independence with accountability. In summation, the three key questions to consider are: These are not easy questions, and there are no simple answers. But ignoring them will not make the problem go away. The secretary’s decision may have been controversial, but it has forced us to confront a reality we can no longer dismiss: Military legal advice is not separate from politics, and our system does not fully account for that truth. One potential solution, which would require Congress to get involved, would be to adjust the timeline of the JAG selection process to align with a new presidential administration. A selection process that begins after election confirmation and ends sometime within the first 100 days of the new presidential term would provide two layers of protection: If the process were to remain untouched by political influence, the timing would make it appear it was underwritten by the administration protecting the JAG Corps, and on the other hand, if political influence is inserted into the process there is time to adjust and make it an acceptable selection within the normal administration confirmation time. As a military lawyer, I want to believe that our role remains one of principled legal guidance, unaffected by political shifts. But history suggests otherwise. If we do not grapple with this challenge now, we risk future administrations making similar moves, potentially with even more direct political motivations. The JAG Corps must decide whether to engage in this debate proactively or risk being reshaped by it. MAJ Trent Kubasiak is a judge advocate with Eighth Army in the Republic of Korea.

How to stop American AI from becoming the next Myspace	Image courtesy of RAFT. Recently, Vice President JD Vance delivered some hard truths to our European friends at the Paris Artificial Intelligence Summit. In short, he broke down the inevitable results of excessively regulating AI: it would hurt small, innovative startups the most; it would discourage American R&amp;D investments; and, last but certainly not least, it will drive nations around the world into the arms of the Chinese Communist Party. The Vice President’s message should be well received following last month’s DeepSeek panic. The Chinese company’s apparent breakthrough sent markets into a frenzy, and President Trump said it 'should be a wake-up call' for American tech companies. I can’t imagine many of America’s innovators slept through this alarm – we have ground to make up. DeepSeek sparked such a reaction largely because it’s performed so well in tests compared with rival American AI models like OpenAI, DeepMind or Llama. Remember when Facebook first came onto the scene and destroyed Myspace? Or when Apple wiped the floor with Motorola and Nokia? It’s our job to ensure that American AI models don’t become the next Myspace, and that requires more innovation and less regulation – our national security, as well as the national security of our friends and allies around the world, depends on it. First, just as the vice president did with our allies in Paris, we need to look ourselves in the mirror and accept some hard truths. There’s no denying that we’re at an institutional disadvantage to the CCP when it comes to developing these new technologies. I’m not referring to the fact that China has roughly nine times as many engineers as the U.S., or that they have as many as 15 times more science and technology graduates. I’m referring to the fact that American tech companies rightly abide by the principles of responsible AI – the consideration of societal impact, legal standards, and ethical values. The Chinese Communist Party simply does not share these concerns. That’s why the risk of losing this race is so high – it would mean nations around the world adopting and deploying Chinese AI models that can be used for malign purposes. We know that DeepSeek gathers data on its users – very similar to the way TikTok collects data – and censors responses to comply with the CCP’s speech controls. Vice President Vance was right to warn our allies that 'partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in, and seize your information infrastructure.' America’s responsible, ethical AI technology standards are the very reason our partners and allies are right to follow U.S. leadership in this space. We need to be responsible, but we also need to recognize that unnecessary regulation will slow innovation and make it harder for U.S. companies to compete with China. If the U.S. and our allies can accept this reality – that innovation and responsibility are not mutually exclusive – and then translate it into policy that encourages competition, then we’ll have appropriately responded to China’s wake-up call. If you ask DeepSeek what happened in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, it’ll respond, 'I am sorry, I cannot answer that question.' We need to ask ourselves, 'How are we going to outpace China and ensure U.S. leadership in AI?' Fortunately, and unlike DeepSeek, we have an answer: American competition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/how-to-stop-american-ai-from-becoming-the-next-myspace/	2025-03-03T11:12:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-28-at-10.06.11 AM.png
Poland signs $300M lease for Apache attack helicopters	The AH-64D leasing ceremony occurred at Latkowo, home of the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade. (Lance Cpl. Wojciech Król/CO MON) WARSAW — Poland has formally signed a $300 million leasing agreement for eight AH-64D Apache attack helicopters, a bridge to when the Polish Land Forces will receive their full order of Apaches. The deal was signed Feb. 27 by Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s deputy prime minister and minister of national defense, at Latkowo, home of the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade. The agreement covers not only the leasing of the rotorcraft themselves, but support for training and operations. The leasing decision was made 'so that our soldiers can gain skills and be fully prepared for the arrival' of the future Apaches, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'We are spending $300 million on it, so that our pilots, ground support personnel can get to know and learn all the skills, can take control of this equipment.' Poland in August signed its Letter of Acceptance on a $10 billion order of 96 Boeing-made AH-64Es, procured through a Foreign Military Sale case. Under that agreement, Poland will become the second largest Apache operator in the world, behind only the US Army. Deliveries are expected to run between 2028 and 2032, with 15 helicopters to be delivered in that first year. Once the Apaches are fully procured, they will be subordinated to the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade (1 BLWL), a tactical unit consisting of the 49th Air Base in Pruszcz Gdański, the 56th Air Base in Inowrocław and the Central Group of Tactical Air Area Control Teams. The AH-64s will be based at Inowrocław, Malbork and Świdnik. But the Polish government did not want to wait that long to be able to begin training and operations. Hence, the decision to go for the leasing agreement. 'Because of to this [leasing], we will be ready to accept these helicopters faster,' Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'We will have trained crews who will be able to operate this equipment. […] In addition, spare parts, a logistics package, simulators, armament, i.e. all the elements that are needed for this agreement to be fully valuable' will be met, he said. Last year the first Polish airmen completed the AH-64E Aviation Qualification Course and Instructor Pilot course as well as the AH-64E helicopter repairer and the American Language Course-General English at Fort Novosel in Alabama. Deputy Minister of National Defense Paweł Bejda, who was also at the signing, emphasized the domestic economic benefit of the deal, thanks to commercial offsets for Boeing that were required by the government. Thanks to those offsets, 'the Military Aviation Plant No. 1 in Łódź and Dęblin will be able to service both the composite structures of helicopters and their [T-700-701D, CT7-2E1 and CT7-8E] engines. Importantly, the same engines are also used in Leonardo [AW101 and AW149] and Black Hawk helicopters,' Bejda said. 'At the same time, the Military University of Technology will be able to train students, technicians and engineers for service and repair of composite components and engines. 'In this way, we are fulfilling the commitment that at least 50 percent of [any] expenditure on arms will remain in Polish defense companies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/poland-signs-300m-lease-for-apache-attack-helicopters/	2025-03-03T11:09:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Poland-AH-64D-leasing-1bd5cc49-b7a9-49de-a2bf-eab6813e891a.jpg
Amid US rift with Ukraine, UK proposes peace plan with ‘coalition of the willing’ boots on the ground	A UK Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon conducts a NATO air policing mission (UK MoD) BELFAST — In the event of a peace agreement for the conflict in Ukraine, the UK has vowed to establish a European 'coalition of the willing' to protect Kyiv from Moscow, by deploying 'boots on the ground, and planes in the air.' British Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced the move on Sunday during a meeting of 18 European leaders in London, set against a disastrous breakdown in relations between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a recent heated argument at the White House. The proposed coalition is the key point at the heart of a four point plan launched by the UK, in collaboration with France, Ukraine and others. The other three points are to: 'Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can’t mean we sit back,' Starmer said of the coalition pledge — a sign that European nations are split over the idea as it could potentially draw them into armed conflict with Russia. 'Instead, those willing will intensify planning now — with real urgency,' explained Starmer. 'The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground, and planes in the air. Together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting.' RELATED: Estonia &#8216;seriously' discussing sending troops to &#8216;rear' jobs in Ukraine, official says During questions with lawmakers today however, Starmer said that the government is 'nowhere near' the phase of holding a parliamentary vote on British troops deploying to Ukraine. Also, success of the coalition is dependent on 'strong US backing,' according to Starmer's remarks Sunday, despite a clear gulf between the Trump administration and similar UK calls for Washington to act as a security guarantor overseeing a peace settlement. Trump has excluded Europe and Ukraine from peace negotiations, initially demanded Kyiv sign over a $500 billion share of raw earth minerals in return for continued US military aid and balked at deploying US forces to support a peace deal. 'We have agreed that the UK, France and others will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting,' said Starmer. 'Then we’ll discuss that plan with the United States and take it forward together. The purpose of today’s meeting was to unite our partners around this effort to strengthen Ukraine and to support a just and enduring peace for the good of all of us.' He ruled out accepting any 'weak deal,' but it remains to be seen how outstanding differences between Europe and the US over Ukraine will be reconciled. Russia has previously pushed back on UK- and French-backed plans for a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Meanwhile, London also announced on Sunday that it had approved a £1.6 billion ($2 billion) deal for Ukraine to acquire over 5,000 Thales made lightweight-multirole missiles (LMM). The contract is funded by a British export finance loan, and the French manufacturer's UK arm will produce the air defense weapons from Belfast, Northern Ireland. As noted by London, it marks the largest contract signed by the UK MoD and Thales in Belfast to date and builds off a similar LMM contract signed last year for 650 missiles. To support the latest contract, a Ukrainian industry partner will manufacture launchers and command and control vehicles for the 29-pound weapon, which is designed to target armored patrol carriers, inshore attack craft and drones, according to Thales. 'This large deal and its timing underline the gap between the UK and Washington DC on support for Ukraine,' said Trevor Taylor, director of the Defence, Industries and Society Programme at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), in a statement to media. 'It also stresses the value of the UK’s industrial capabilities as a critical enabler of UK foreign and security policy. The production arrangements for the launchers and command and control vehicles for Ukraine mark a deepening of the cooperation of Western European firms with Ukrainian industry,' he said. The UK's LMM contract comes on the heels of Starmer committing to increase national defense spending to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-us-rift-with-ukraine-uk-proposes-peace-plan-with-coalition-of-the-willing-boots-on-the-ground/	2025-03-03T09:54:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Eurofighter-Typhoon-e1732642769504.jpg
How Metrea hopes to grow the private air refueling market	Metrea refueled German Typhoons during the Pacific Skies exercise in 2024. (Metrea) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Far away from home and flying high above the seas for an event called 'Pacific Skies' last year, a small group of three German Eurofighters made several pitstops behind KC-135 Stratotankers, helping the jet fighter notch its longest-ever flight of roughly 10 and a half hours. It was a refueling mission like any other, except for one detail: Stratotankers supporting the flight were privately operated by the aerospace company Metrea, underscoring the growing role that commercial air refueling services can play to meet soaring demand among militaries for tanking. 'Pacific Skies was our largest and most complex deployment ever,' the German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, wrote in response to questions from Breaking Defense. Through the event, the service says it was able to 'demonstrate that our Luftwaffe is able to deploy around the world.' Founded in 2016, the American-based Metrea has quickly risen as an aerospace player, with three business groups that span air and space, electromagnetic and cyber, and digital and synthetics. Besides air refueling, Metrea’s air and space division offers other services such as supporting contractor-operated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions in far-flung locations like West Africa. Air refueling is a growing focus for Metrea, particularly after the company agreed last year to buy a fleet of 14 KC-135s set to be retired by the French Air and Space Forces, growing the firm’s tanker inventory to a total of 18 on top of four previously acquired KC-135s from the Singaporean government. (Five planes in Metrea’s fleet of 18 are operational now and one is undergoing heavy maintenance, with additional tankers entering service 'based on customer demand,' the company said). According to Metrea, the French deal means the privately-held business now boasts the world’s fifth-largest refueling fleet, behind four countries. 'As many [KC-135s] as we can get in service in ‘25, we're going to put them to work,' Jon 'Ty' Thomas, the head of the company’s air and space group and a retired Air Force lieutenant general, said in an interview with Breaking Defense. Globally, air forces’ 'demand for air refueling is growing,' Thomas said, whether through buying more aircraft or running more sorties for an existing fleet. And having commercial tankers available could help supplement military planes thirsty for gas, Tim Walton, an air refueling expert at the Hudson Institute, said in an interview. 'Commercial aerial refueling tankers could support training, testing and evaluation and coordinate fighter movements in peacetime, which could help meet the high demand for aerial refueling services across the globe,' Walton said. While a range of factors from budget constraints to mission needs will ultimately shape future demand for private air refueling, Walton noted that 'ideally, it will increase if the government can take new approaches to aggregate different demands for training, deployment of aircraft and foreign military or direct commercial sales in support of foreign aircraft.' Metrea’s highest-profile international refueling to date with the Luftwaffe for the Pacific Skies event started out at the 2023 Royal International Air Tattoo in the United Kingdom. Metrea brought along its own KC-135 fresh out of heavy maintenance, catching the eye of several potential customers, including the Germans. Officials kept Metrea in mind, and ahead of Pacific Skies, they reached out to see 'if support for our deployment would be possible,' the Luftwaffe said. While the service operates refueling assets like the Airbus A330 MRTT and A400M, as well as the Lockheed Martin KC-130 — with the A330 providing a 'majority' of refueling missions for the deployment — like many nations, German armed forces are 'always slightly short when it comes to bigger deployments or exercises,' the service said. Pacific Skies is essentially a catch-all term to describe the overarching deployment of German forces to the region for a series of exercises. For the record-setting Eurofighter flight, the jets were ferried from one exercise in Japan called Nippon Skies to Hawaii for the biennial Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, exercise. Ahead of the journey, Metrea staged one of its KC-135s at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo and another at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, paving the way to support the trans-Pacific flight to Hawaii, according to Rory Cattelan, a former KC-135 instructor pilot who helped plan the event for the company. After rendezvousing with the Germans outside Tokyo, 'we dragged them [the Eurofighters] pretty much around the Pacific Rim, staying within 600 miles of a suitable alternate the whole time,' Cattelan said. A few hours later, the first aircraft passed the last of its gas and peeled off for Wake Island, dropping into a 'lovely thunderstorm,' while the aircraft from Guam carried the German jets the remaining way to Hawaii. Und wer wissen will, wie das mit dem Tanken in der Luft an einer KC135 der Firma @MetreaAero ist, der Boss zeigt es höchst persönlich in diesem Video.Dank an Metrea für die Unterstützung bei unserem #Weltrekordflug. Ohne Euch wäre das nicht möglich gewesen. #Pacificskies24 pic.twitter.com/xMIbZARRm4 &mdash; Team Luftwaffe (@Team_Luftwaffe) July 26, 2024 'We were just nervous this wasn't going to happen because it was really tight on gas as far as how much they needed and what we could support, and definitely didn't want them to fail their world record flight,' Cattelan said. 'In the end, it went off pretty good.' Metrea also helped the Luftwaffe get back to Europe, the service said, providing gas between Hawaii and Guam, Guam and Malaysia, then Malaysia to the UAE. In total, Metrea says it offloaded roughly 475,000 pounds of fuel over the course of 25 sorties spanning 160 flight hours. 'I think what we proved as a company is the complexity of the mission set that we're able to handle as a commercial entity,' said Joe Parker, a career boom operator and Metrea employee who helped execute the event. 'So I think what we proved as a company could be taken as a lesson learned, but really it was more, ‘We got this,’ and we kind of put our best foot forward in that regard.' From the Luftwaffe’s end, the experience of refueling with a commercial air refueling operator is 'pretty similar' to a traditional military run, particularly since air refueling is standardized in NATO. The service was even able to hire Metrea by tapping into the company’s active contract with the US Navy, easing some of the 'bureaucratic workload.' And what did the Luftwaffe learn from the endeavor? 'That commercial AAR [air-to-air refueling] is also a valid option for future deployments,' the service said. Describing Metrea’s business model of providing 'effects-as-a-service,' Thomas explained the company helps fill gaps that occur as part of militaries’ 'daily competition,' or day-to-day activities in lower-intensity scenarios. Much of the Air Force’s tanker force structure lies in the Guard and Reserve, whose assets and personnel are not always available for daily refueling taskings. Similar problems affect other militaries as well, Thomas said, noting that’s where Metrea comes in. 'It's not a choice of like, ‘Oh well, I could do that, or I could have a USAF tanker,' he said. 'It's, ‘I can have a commercial tanker, or I can have nothing. And so that's how we've grown the market.' Many of Metrea’s approximately 1,000 employees are either former military or a member of the Guard or Reserve. That depth of experience helps smooth operations for Metrea when serving military customers, but also provides a natural limit on what the company could provide under an all-out-war scenario. 'Probably a good fraction of our crews aren't wearing the Metrea blue flight suit' in that event, Thomas said. 'They're wearing the United States of America and US Air Force green flight suit, because they’re Guardsmen or Reservists and they've been mobilized,' he added. 'So our capacity is going to be constrained by the dynamics of that day.' 'We're not going to be able to have the luxury or be willing to take the risk of, on America's worst day, 20 of those tankers are coming out of a commercial company,' he added. 'That's not our place.' Walton, too, expressed skepticism that commercial refueling could shape what’s ultimately required by US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), which tasks air refueling missions and sets requirements for the fleet. 'Although it’s possible that private aerial refueling could exert downward pressure on the size of the government aerial refueling fleet, I think it’s unlikely, given that the US Transportation Command’s mobility requirements study has established a pretty high floor for the number of tankers required for the fleet in potential contingencies.' The minimum air refueling fleet number is mandated by Congress and is currently set at 466 tankers. At the direction of Congress, TRANSCOM has also studied the issue of incorporating more commercial tanking services. The command’s analysis previously found that the current air refueling fleet is sufficient to support global operations, but that 'the Air Force has and continues to explore the potential use of commercial tankers for training and other non-combat missions to help ease the pressure on the organic tanker fleet,' according to a statement from TRANSCOM. A day will come, however, when Metrea’s fleet of Eisenhower-era KC-135s will be tough to operate, particularly as the plane becomes increasingly difficult to maintain due to diminishing sources for parts as the Air Force retires the fleet. At that point, the firm may have to pivot, Thomas acknowledged. 'The [KC-]135 ecosystem does exist. And actually, let's be honest, the only way that it works for us is that there's a larger ecosystem in which we operate,' he said. 'If there's a day when the USAF isn't operating KC-135s in quantity, we'll have a hard choice to make as to what we're going to do,' he continued. 'But that day is like at least two decades away.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/how-metrea-hopes-to-grow-the-private-air-refueling-market/	2025-03-03T07:48:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250303_metrea_refueling_METREA_jpeg.jpg
The F-22 is having a modernization moment	A 1st Fighter Wing's F-22 Raptor from Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va. pulls into position to accept fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker with the 756th Air Refueling Squadron, Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, Md. off the east coast. It was 2 a.m. when the blast of the Klaxon rattled the halls of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, outside Anchorage, Alaska. Unidentified aircraft had approached U.S. airspace over the North Pole, and U.S. Air Force pilot John 'Schlem' Rogers – unsure whether it was real or a drill – had minutes to suit up, jump in his F-22 Raptor and investigate. Rogers can’t divulge exactly what happened that night years ago, but he did say the F-22’s low observability, high maneuverability and superior situational awareness gave him the advantage. 'Gear matters, engineering matters, quality matters,' said Rogers, director of business development in Avionics for Collins Aerospace, an RTX business. 'Knowing that the systems onboard that F-22 were going to work allowed me to take the aircraft over the most extreme parts of our planet to keep our airspace safe.' Rogers’ story shows the power of the F-22 Raptor. At times overlooked, this combat-proven, fifth-generation fighter jet is taking on new importance as the U.S. Air Force considers enhancements that could keep it ready and relevant for years to come. A Raptor renaissance Why the renewed interest? In short, the U.S. Air Force needs to supplement its F-35 fleet while plans for a new generation of fighter jet take shape. And the F-22’s capabilities – many of which come by way of RTX products and services – can meet that need. 'The Air Force and government see the F-22 as its primary stealth fighter,' said Jake Ullrich, senior program director for Advanced Products and Solutions at Raytheon, an RTX business. 'All systems on the F-22 are meant to complement each other – to maximize both the intel coming in and the actions being taken.' And better data coming in means pilots will need more sophisticated ways to see, process and act on that information. It’s why teams across RTX continue to advance cockpit technologies for the F-22 to help pilots stay ahead of the threat when a mission is changing rapidly and unfolding across several domains. Here’s a look at some of the RTX advancements that are helping the F-22 stay future-ready. The definition of air dominance Achieving air dominance means controlling the skies against enemy threats. In this role, the F-22 is often in a support position, carrying the right munitions to meet the needs of the particular mission. One of the most powerful weapons onboard is the Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. John 'Clyde' Thayer is a 22-year U.S. Air Force veteran and former F-15C pilot who now serves as director of Air Dominance Requirements &amp; Capabilities for Raytheon. He explained why the weapons delivery capability of the F-22, along with its ability to fly fast and high, has helped earn the AMRAAM missile a reputation as the premier air dominance weapon around the world for nearly 30 years. 'When the pilot fires a missile, it is a very quick timeline for the doors to open, the missile to eject from the aircraft and the rocket motor to fire,' he said. 'At that point, the aircraft can immediately maneuver as needed to defend itself – without being detected.' The AMRAAM missile, equipped with its own guidance system, takes over from there. Thayer said recent upgrades, as part of the U.S. Air Force’s F3R (Form, Fit, Function Refresh), will bring even more processing power to the air-to-air AMRAAM guidance sections. This, in turn, will enable software improvements to take performance even higher. In particular, it will allow operators to extend the missile’s time of flight. 'We know the missile flies a lot farther than it was originally designed to,' Thayer added. 'The F3R improvements – perfectly fitted to the F-22 platform – will help us get the most out of the AMRAAM missile in the air dominance role.' The Raytheon team is ramping up production to 1,200 AMRAAM missiles a year, which will ensure the F-22 stays mission-ready. In air-to-air missions, the F-22 carries: Unlocking engine potential 'The F-22, when it starts up, has been described as a big muscle car,' said former F-22 pilot Rogers. 'It’s loud, it vibrates. As it gets into the air, it turns into a bit of a Ferrari. It’s smoother, it kind of growls. It has its own personality.' A lot of that personality comes from the two Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engines that power the F-22, each packing 35,000 pounds of thrust. Caroline Cooper, who oversees the F119 program at Pratt &amp; Whitney, an RTX business, said the engine’s unique thrust-vectoring capability, and its capacity to fly at supersonic speeds without turning on the afterburners, have contributed to the F-22’s superior maneuverability. The F119 is the original fifth-generation fighter jet engine, and the direct predecessor of the P&amp;W F135, which powers the F-35 – another fifth-generation fighter. Cooper credits data gathered over Pratt’s long history supporting these fifth-gen platforms for driving the engine control software update that’s expected to unlock more performance potential for the F-22. The fleet software update is scheduled to begin in 2025. 'A more modern F-22 will need additional mission capacity,' said Cooper. 'That's going to require more thrust in certain parts of the design envelope, and this software update provides it.' Years of F-22 operation have also given Cooper’s team an advantage in predicting maintenance for engine parts: They can use actual, full-flight data to pinpoint when it's time for replacements. 'When we run this data through our advanced engineering algorithms, it gives us insight we can then use to extend the life of our parts,' she said. 'This means more time on wing and more cost savings for our customers.' Designed to win And more time on wing for customers translates to more mission time. This will be increasingly important, as the F-22 readies for tomorrow’s fight. Rogers, recalling his time in the cockpit, has every confidence the aircraft is up for the challenge. 'The F-22 was not designed to win 51-49,' he added. 'It was designed to win 100 to zero.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/the-f-22-is-having-a-modernization-moment/	2025-03-03T05:24:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AFA-AWS-Air-Warfare-lead-image_600x300.jpg
Firings sap NOAA office responsible for licensing remote sensing satellite firms	Planet satellite imagery shows widespread destruction in central Kahramanmaras, Turkey following the devastating 2023 earthquake. (Image courtesy of Planet Labs PBC.) WASHINGTON — Mass firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have resulted in what is essentially a shut down of the unit responsible for licensing US remote sensing satellites, according to multiple sources, with license holders receiving emails notifying them all correspondence would now be handled by NOAA's Office of General Counsel. 'This is a temporary arrangement to address continuity of operations as no senior personnel remain in the office due to reductions in force,' reads a copy of the email from the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA) division seen by Breaking Defense. 'CRSRA is unable to state when this arrangement might end.' CRSRA is the division within NOAA's Office of Space Commerce responsible for regulating space-based commercial remote sensing, including work involving companies such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky that provide imagery to the National Reconnaissance Office for use by the Defense Department for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. NOAA, in turn, is under the Department of Commerce. 'The email is correct, the Office of General Counsel will be supporting the continuity of license applications and processing for companies involved in the process,' a spokesperson for the Office of Space Commerce told Breaking Defense in an email. While it is too soon to judge the impact of the situation, if extenuated the likely outcome would be a slow down in the approval of new licenses for aspiring satellite imagery firms and of any pending license modification requests from current operators. The Trump administration began firings Thursday at NOAA, with some 800 personnel out of a total staff of some 13,000 terminated, the New York Times reported today. Among those was the head of CRSRA Sarah Brothers, sources who deal with CRSRA told Breaking Defense. 'Per our long-standing practice, we do not discuss internal personnel and management matters. NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation’s environmental and economic resilience,' the Office of Space Commerce spokesperson said. NOAA operates US weather satellites also used by the military, and has been central to research on climate change. In addition, the Office of Space Commerce sent out a notice today that it has cancelled a planned March 5 meeting of the NOAA Advisory Committee on Excellence in Space (ACES). The industry group has been active in helping the Office of Space Commerce on a number of key issues, including how to best provide oversight and management of on-orbit activities that fall between the cracks of current federal regulatory regimes. The notice, also reviewed by Breaking Defense, does not indicate whether the planned meeting would be rescheduled. However, the space-focused news outlet Payload today reported that ACES has been swept up in the cull of advisory committees mandated in a Feb. 19 Trump administration executive order seeking to slash the federal bureaucracy. Further, the head of the Office of Space Commerce's program to create a civil space traffic management regime designed to take the burden of warning non-military satellite operators of potential on-orbit crashes off DoD's shoulders, Dmitry Poisik, also has been fired, the same sources told Breaking Defense. Poisik was hired in July 2024 as the first director of the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS) program, and thus fell under the Office of Personnel Management's order for termination of all federal agency 'probationary' employees. In most federal agencies, personnel who have yet to complete one full year in their job are given 'probationary' status. Nonetheless, work under the TraCCS program appears to be continuing, with the Office of Space Commerce today issuing a call for industry comment on its proposal for a new 'pathfinder' project. 'The pathfinder would investigate commercially available capabilities for the identification and cataloging of space objects immediately after their launch and deployment,' the notice explains.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/firings-sap-noaa-office-responsible-for-licensing-remote-sensing-satellite-firms/	2025-02-28T13:23:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Turkey-Earthquake-Damage-e1711045037612.jpg
The US Air Force lacks imagination, and that’s a dangerous thing	A US Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon assigned to the 480th Fighter Squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany (left), flies alongside a German air force Eurofighter Typhoon assigned to the 74th Tactical Air Wing over Germany, Feb. 16, 2023. (US Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Allison Payne) Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin has called his service to action, warning it faces a 'time of consequence' when 'the decisions we make, the actions we take' will determine if the Air Force is ready for the future fight. Deciding today what weapons, concepts and capabilities Airmen will need 10 or 20 years from now is no easy task, especially with war’s character changing rapidly. Despite what some would say, the fundamental problem is not the size of the service’s budget, but a culture that is reluctant to embrace the risks that come with innovation. This leaves the service vulnerable to technological and doctrinal surprise — something we’ve seen before, from the shock of Pearl Harbor to the aerial attacks on September 11. To meet the moment, the Air Force will need to hedge against a failure of imagination. And that means knowingly opening the service up to risk in several areas — especially around programs being allowed to fail and dollars sometimes being burned on new ideas. The Air Force, like any organization that has enjoyed enormous success, prefers to hold fast to what worked in the past, pursuing a procurement strategy that revolves around a small number of advanced, expensive platforms with long development cycles. But adding new technology to try to sustain this old way of fighting is unimaginative. The Air Force’s reluctance to embrace the near-term risks that come with innovation creates strategic risks. With Russia adapting to the battlefield in Ukraine, Iran pursuing a cost-imbalance strategy, and China pursuing the same or similar technologies as the United States, adversaries need only employ a little imagination to take the Air Force by surprise. The Air Force’s caution is understandable: If you are building something designed to last for many decades, you better get it right. Consider the venerable B-52 bomber, a platform still flying after more than 60 years, or the F-16, which remains a workhorse as it approaches its sixth decade in service. This hardware-centered mindset emphasizes perfecting a platform design before it ever reaches full production, much less the warfighter — a process that works well when change is slow and incremental — like moving from 4th to 5th generation fighters. In an age of rapid technological leaps, however, this process rewards the status quo and stifles real innovation. New capabilities or operational concepts are too easily rejected as unproven, and unprovable, ways of fighting. The Air Force — like the other services — is too often more concerned with near-term risks to budget and procurement programs than long-term strategic and operational upsides. If the United States and China ever got into a shooting war, Chinese military planners would expect the US Air Force to follow a familiar script, seeking to generate overwhelming precision effects from a smaller number of traditional fighters and bombers, supported by reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers. After studying US military operations extensively for the last thirty years, China has honed its anti-access/area-denial playbook to counter it. Predictability is a vulnerability. And the solution lies in spreading risk. Instead of building a small number of super-expensive platforms made by a few large defense firms, the US Air Force should diversify its approach, developing a wider variety of systems in smaller numbers, with the flexibility to scale up when needed, add technology as available, and discontinue procurement of certain platforms when technology negates their benefits or capabilities. The service should also adjust and refine requirements for different mission needs and different adversary strategies. The Air Force currently upgrades platforms in blocks, periodically and incrementally adding new technology and capabilities while keeping the basic platform the same. While this approach is supposed to reduce training and sustainment costs, it prevents revolutionary change while driving up costs of sustaining an aging force. To implement this hedge strategy, the US Air Force needs to rethink its approach to procurement before it’s too late. First and foremost, adopt a shorter and less bureaucratic requirements process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation, which sets the policies and procedures governing acquisition with a focus on protecting taxpayer dollars, applies whether procurement is of a multi-million-dollar system built to last decades, or an expendable platform expected to become quickly obsolete. The upshot is that the marginal costs per unit of compliance is very high for low number, low-cost platforms, effectively discouraging innovation. The Air Force should therefore work with Congress to expand rapid and flexible acquisition authorities for lower-cost platforms, which would allow the Air Force to pursue a wider range of systems, and, after testing and evaluating them, decide whether to field them or change course. Second, the Air Force should work with Congress to allow more budget flexibility for emerging concepts and capabilities. The current process attempts to predict the future several years in advance, including what companies will be producing, what adversaries will do, and what capabilities will be available. Services have to program and plan their budgets for the Program Objective Memorandum more than two years before funds would become available, assuming the budget is approved and passed. This means a new company with an emerging capability has to wait over three years after developing it and convincing the Air Force of its value before potentially profiting. This is an eternity for new entrants, but something larger and more established companies can price into their contracts. Third, the Air Force should promote a development and procurement culture for most capabilities which encourages risk-taking over risk avoidance, signaling the value it places on innovation through promotions and budget priorities. Incentives today reward caution and punish creativity. The object is to preserve what has won fights in the past. But no one wins when high-priced legacy systems with dubious long-term advantages continue to win out over new capabilities that deliver the same or better effects at lower cost. Finally, the defense industry itself needs to change. Washington should cultivate an environment where many companies contribute to the development of airpower — not just a handful of defense giants who have an inside track because they know the rules of the game and lobby to keep those rules in place. A broader, more innovative defense market will better prepare the Air Force to create, rather than react to, the next wave of aerial surprises. A more agile, less predictable US Air Force, particularly one built around massive numbers of mobile, dispersed and lower-cost sensing, decoy, and weaponized drones (of varying capability), would simultaneously complicate both Russian and Chinese military planning. These platforms would seem similar but do different things, making it hard for the People’s Liberation Army to know which blips on the radar screen are the ones that can sink ships, which are the ones that are sensing the ships, and which are the ones — like decoys — just there for the confusion. Such surprise threatens to disrupt Chinese military plans and unbalance the PLA, giving the United States the initiative. Such diversity would also complicate Moscow’s calculus in rebuilding its military and give the United States and its NATO allies more options for deterring or defending against Russian aggression. The US Air Force has gotten comfortable with its predictability. That has to change if it is to succeed in future conflicts. Col. Maximilian K.

Warren, Duckworth probe Air Force secretary nominee on dealings with Elon Musk	Dr. Troy E. Meink, deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space, answers questions during a space budget briefing March 5, 2014, at the Pentagon. (U.S. Air Force photo/Scott M. Ash) WASHINGTON—Two Democratic senators are raising alarms about Troy Meink, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Air Force, following reports that Elon Musk recommended Meink for the job after he pushed a lucrative satellite contract towards Musk’s SpaceX. In a Feb. 27 letter to Meink, Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asked Meink to disclose information about his relationship to Musk and whether Meink, in his role of principal deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office, arranged a multibillion-dollar contract solicitation to favor SpaceX above other companies competing for the award, as reported by Reuters earlier this month. 'These reports raise concerns about your ability, if confirmed as Secretary, to treat contractors fairly and prioritize the Air Force’s mission over Elon Musk’s business interests,' wrote Duckworth and Warren, who as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee will have a role in evaluating Meink’s fitness for the Air Force secretary job. Citing seven people familiar with the contract, Reuters reported that the NRO inspector general began an investigation into Meink's role in a classified contract awarded to SpaceX in 2021 after noting changes to the program's requirements. It is unclear whether the probe is still ongoing. Duckworth and Warren said the Reuters report contained 'incredibly serious allegations of misconduct and favoritism,' noting that as Air Force secretary, Meink would be involved in key contracting decisions that involve Musk and SpaceX directly, as well as determining whether the service will move forward with a crewed sixth-generation fighter, which Musk has criticized. The senators requested answers by March 6 to a list of questions probing Meink’s dealings with Musk and SpaceX ahead of his nomination, whether Meink has ever been under investigation for his role in contracting decisions, and allegations from the Reuters report, including if he steered contracts toward SpaceX and threatened to withhold future contracts from L3Harris if it filed a protest. Warren and Duckworth's letter is the first sign of turbulence for Meink's nomination, which initially appeared set to cruise through the confirmation process before the publication of the Reuters report. Unlike Trump’s other service secretary picks, who have been relatively unknown in the national security realm, Meink is a familiar presence in the defense world, having served as deputy under secretary of the Air Force for space in the Obama administration before being tapped for the NRO job in 2020. Meink met with SASC Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., last week. Wicker's statement on the engagement makes no note of the allegations against Meink, with the senator saying that Meink 'understands that air and space power are essential to America’s military rebuild under President Trump.' SASC has not yet set a date for Meink’s confirmation hearing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/warren-duckworth-probe-air-force-secretary-nominee-on-dealings-with-elon-musk/	2025-02-28T08:19:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Meink-e1737049777778.jpg

Cao has been tapped to be the Navy's number two civilian by President Donald Trump. (Photo by ALLISON JOYCE/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced late Thursday night that he would nominate Hung Cao, a former Navy diver and immigrant from Vietnam, to be the next under secretary of the Navy. 'I am pleased to announce that Hung Cao will be our next United States Under Secretary of the Navy,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Hung is the embodiment of the American Dream. As a refugee to our Great Nation, Hung worked tirelessly to make proud the Country that gave his family a home.' Cao previously deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia as well as serving in positions at the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the FBI. In 2022, he unsuccessfully ran for a Virginia's 10th congressional seat — losing to Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton — and unsuccessfully challenged Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine in 2024. Trump's first under secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly, served as the Navy's No. 2 civilian from December 2017 through November 2019 and then as acting SECNAV until April 2020. Cao's nomination came hours after John Phelan, Trump's nominee for Navy secretary, was on Capitol Hill for his own confirmation hearing. Phelan's hearing largely lacked any fireworks with most senators — Democrats included — focusing on the standard array of Navy topics, from improving the Navy's shipbuilding record to addressing the Pentagon's dwindling munitions stockpile. 'I think what is missing from what I can see is a sense of urgency,' Phelan said of the Navy’s shipbuilding record. 'We’re just going along and everybody — it’s Kumbaya. It’s almost as if you’re waiting for a crisis to happen to ignite things. And I think in the business of warfare, that’s a dangerous place to be. So I think why the president selected me is I will bring a sense of urgency to this. I will bring a sense of accountability to this.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-taps-former-navy-diver-hung-cao-for-services-no-2-civilian-job/	2025-02-28T05:58:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/cao-scaled-e1740749286984.jpg

In the past 3 weeks more then 130 rockets where reportedly fired from Gaza into Israel. (Photo by Ilia Yefimovich/Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Rafael, the Israeli company that makes Iron Dome, is creating a joint venture with US firm Kratos to produce solid rocket motors (SRMs). The new venture, called Prometheus Energetics, seeks to cash in on the growing demand for SRMs, which help power munitions of all sizes, including the Iron Dome interceptors. The companies said in a Feb. 26 statement that they have selected a 500-acre site 'near the United States Navy and Army facility in Crane, Indiana.' Kratos and Rafael said Prometheus will be controlled in an 'approximate 50/50 partnership.' The firms are investing $175 million in the new joint venture along with 'required property, plant, equipment and personnel needed for the new, state-of-the-art energetics manufacturing campus and facilities.' Production is expected to begin in 2027 after Rafael completes a technology transfer to Prometheus, with Eric DeMarco, Kratos president and CEO, saying in the statement that the company expects to provide 'tens of thousands of SRMs and casted warheads' for both the US and Israel. 'We believe Prometheus, once up and running at full rate production, will be a step function catalyst in value creation for Kratos’ stakeholders and the U.S. defense industrial base,' added DeMarco. Yoav Tourgeman, the president and CEO of Rafael, described the new investment as a 'strategic leap forward' for Rafael and its 'commitment to strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base while ensuring our allies and partners have access to the most advanced, combat-proven energetics solutions.' Learn More: Who else is getting into the SRM business? He said the initiative taps business opportunities in the American market with 'with the increasing demand for energetic products, while significantly enhancing our ability to deliver resilient and reliable supply solutions to our customers.' It will strengthen supply chain independence and bolster 'critical capabilities needed to address evolving national security challenges,' he added. This is the second joint venture of this type in the US for Rafael, after it established R2S with Raytheon to produce Tamir missile interceptors in East Camden, Arkansas. It fits into a broader effort by Israel to secure its supply chains for various weapons systems that were heavily used in the recent war, both by investing domestically and looking for partners abroad. Both the Iron Dome interceptor and Rafael’s David’s Sling interceptor use solid rocket motors. David’s Sling has been sold to Finland and the US Marines have conducted live fire training integrating Tamir into the Medium Range Intercept Capability.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/rafael-kratos-team-to-produce-solid-rocket-motors-as-prometheus-energetics/	2025-02-28T05:25:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221018_iron_dome_launch_2_GettyImages-451830874-scaled-e1666112637899.jpg
Pentagon needs further industry collaboration on O-RAN development for 5G interoperability	US Marines with Tactical Training and Exercise Control Group (TTECG), familiarize themselves with 5G-enabled devices at Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center (MCAGCC), Twentynine Palms, Aug 16, 2022. (US Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Isaiah Brummett) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense needs industry partners to become more involved in the process of making open radio access network (O-RAN) capabilities a reality, Pentagon leaders and warfighters said Thursday. O-RAN architectures allow users to mix and match different hardware and software components from various vendors when creating 5G networks. The goal is to provide more flexibility, cost efficiency and seamless interoperability, all while ensuring the network is as secure as possible. O-RAN has been a hot topic within 5G circles in recent years, but official direction on the principle wasn’t released until last October in the DoD’s most recent 5G guidance. Now the Pentagon wants more help from industry to make O-RAN become a reality at a faster pace, Director of the DoD CIO’s 5G Cross Function Team Juan Ramírez said during a Potomac Officer’s Club event today. 'We've actually developed an open RAN strategy that, God willing, we get our money and we don't get cut, we will actually start to see more deployment of open RAN. Yes, the department has been at the forefront of it, but we can’t be the only ones,' Ramírez said. 'This is something that we are working with industry on, and we are getting support from industry, but we want to see it push faster. From that perspective, I would say the DoD is leading it [O-RAN], but it shouldn't be the only one. We're a small player when we look at the overall amount of money that is out there for network modernization.' When asked during a panel what needed to change to make 5G more applicable for military use, Johnson Wu, the commercial and technical lead of the Defense Innovation Unit’s cyber and telecom portfolio, replied 'cross vendor interoperability.' 'We are still doubtful whether all this cycling stuff and 5G relays are actually interoperable,' he added. Coming from experience in the tactical domain, Zachary Taylor, senior communications officer in the Army’s special operations 75th Ranger Regiment, admitted that he tends to be skeptical of 5G capabilities because of their lack of interoperability and the lack of education on how they can become interoperable. If industry learns how to work together to be able to plug one device from one vendor into another device from another and teaches the warfighters how the process works, he said, the possibilities of 5G are more promising. 'It is not a silver bullet, right? It doesn’t solve everything,' Taylor said of 5G. 'What I need industry to do is work with other industry partners and be willing to take that critical feedback from the warfighter. 'Most of the warfighters don't understand how to implement some of these different technologies. So what we need from industry is an education piece. We're not subject matter experts. There's a lot of technology. The rapid evolution of technology is just going to outpace our knowledge.' Capt. Lucas Vancina, 5G technical lead at the Marine Corps Tactical Systems Support Activity, said the most helpful component of 5G is when it can operate in an O-RAN fashion. 'Definitely the extensibility of the open architecture aspect is probably the biggest advantage from my perspective, like the backwards compatibility,' Vancina said, explaining the capability of a 5G network component being able to work with a legacy system. 'It can be both backwards compatible using the non-3GPP inner working functions [which are responsible for connecting networks like Wi-Fi, fixed-line and code division multiple access to 5G networks] and but also having that built in capability and plan roadmap for future use cases like 6G, is one of the biggest things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-needs-further-industry-collaboration-on-o-ran-development-for-5g-interoperability/	2025-02-27T13:42:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/230316_DVIDS_5G_phone_test_7423737-scaled-e1678992887468.jpg
SECNAV nominee says he’ll bring ‘urgency’ to Navy’s shipbuilding	President Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of the Navy John Phelan listens during a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on February 27, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The nominee for Navy secretary pledged to lawmakers he'd be focused on correcting the course of problematic shipbuilding programs as well as replenishing dwindling munitions stockpiles, while largely avoiding any significant controversy. John Phelan, a prominent financier and GOP campaign donor who was tapped to become Navy secretary a few weeks after President Donald Trump won the election, testified today before the Senate Armed Services Committee and appeared poised for an easy confirmation. 'I think what is missing from what I can see is a sense of urgency,' Phelan said of the Navy's shipbuilding record. 'We're just going along and everybody — it's Kumbaya. It's almost as if you're waiting for a crisis to happen to ignite things. And I think in the business of warfare, that's a dangerous place to be. So I think why the president selected me is I will bring a sense of urgency to this. I will bring a sense of accountability to this.' Asked about the Constellation-class frigate — one of the most delayed shipbuilding programs, according to a review by the previous administration — Phelan called the program a 'mess' and said the service is producing a frigate that 'looks more like a carrier, or a battleship or a destroyer.' RELATED: Trump slams Navy's frigate program over cost increases At one point, Phelan said Trump has texted him multiple times complaining about the state of the Navy's ships and shipbuilding, and asked what he was doing to fix it. The nominee said he responded by reminding Trump that he had not yet been confirmed. Phelan's hearing was largely uneventful in the sense that most questions focused on the standard cast of Navy-oriented topics, from investment in the service's Nuclear-Armed Sea-Launcher Cruise Missile (SLCM-N) to the dwindling stockpile of munitions the Defense Department has been facing since the start of the war in Ukraine. As for SLCM-N, a weapons program the Biden administration had advocated canceling, Phelan said it is a 'critical component' to the nation's defense. On the subject of dwindling munitions, the nominee said the stockpiles were 'dangerously low' and pledged to focus on the issue 'very quickly.' One of the few contentious moments of the hearing came when Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., repeatedly asked Phelan about what the senator characterized as a broad, topline cut to the Pentagon's budget ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth. (The Defense Department has denied Hegseth is cutting the budget and has said it intends to shift monies towards the new administration's priorities.) Phelan responded by saying he was not privy to discussions around that choice and therefore couldn't comment on its efficacy. Following the hearing, Blumenthal told reporters Phelan 'clearly dodged' the senator's questions. That 'should leave all of us wondering whether he has the guts and grit to lead the greatest Navy in the history of the world in a time of greater challenges than ever before,' the senator said. Unlike most service secretaries, Phelan, whose career has centered on private investment, does not have experience serving in uniform or as a civilian at the Pentagon, a fact he briefly addressed in his opening remarks. 'I understand that some may question why a businessman who did not wear the uniform should lead the Navy. I respect that concern,' he said. 'The Navy and the Marine Corps already possess extraordinary operational expertise within their ranks. My role is to utilize that expertise and strengthen it to step outside the status quo and take decisive action with a results-oriented approach.' Trump's first confirmed Navy secretary, Richard Spencer, also came from a business and financial background prior to being tapped to lead the Navy and Marine Corps. However, Spencer did serve as a Marine Corps aviator in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Kenneth Braithwaite, Trump's second confirmed Navy secretary, was a career naval officer in both the active service and reserves, but only served as its chief civilian for several months at the end of Trump's first term in office.

RoQS for a hard place: DARPA seeks radically more ‘robust’ quantum sensors for ‘inhospitable’ fieldwork	Researchers at Sandia National Laboratories are developing a small vacuum chamber that could aid in non-GPS navigation. (Credit: Sandia National Laboratories) WASHINGTON — The latest atomic clocks use quantum science to measure time to a trillionth of a second. In a lab setting, quantum sensors allow ultra-precise measurements. But the Pentagon wants to take this new technology to the field, to navigate warzones without needing GPS or hunt submarines without using sonar, to put it on helicopters and jets and satellites, with all the vibration and radiation that entails. In those harsh environments, the same exquisite sensitivity that makes quantum tech such a good sensor also makes it extraordinarily vulnerable to interference, drowning the desired signal in irrelevant noise. Past efforts to ruggedize quantum sensors have focused on taking today’s finicky lab tech and shielding it from interference: One might wrap a sensor in metal to shield it from electromagnetic radiation, for instance, or install it on a vibration-cancelling boom instead of in the body of an aircraft. But in a new interview with Breaking Defense, Jonathan Hoffman, a program manager at the fringe-science-loving Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), argued that those kinds of Rube Goldberg fixes don’t address the underlying problem. Hoffman's team is in the midst of a project, dubbed Robust Quantum Sensors or RoQs, that he hopes will discover a fundamentally new approach. 'We’re looking for ideas that don’t require what I call these ‘band-aid’ solutions,' Hoffman said. 'Our hope is this is a philosophical, foundational change in how we build we quantum sensors. &#8230; Rather than saying ‘I’m going to shield away the problem,’ how do I, at the very beginning of my sensor design, think about all those interferences and figure out a way around [them]?' That’s an extremely difficult problem, and the potential solutions can get esoteric. Some of the ones Hoffman described sound similar to the latest developments in quantum computers, which suffer a similar hyper-sensitivity to outside influences and are also looking for alternatives to brute-force shielding of a fundamentally fragile core. They might require using different types of subatomic particles or finding new ways to 'superimpose' quantum states of particles. But Hoffman made a point of not endorsing any specific method. 'We didn’t pick one or the other,' he emphasized in the interview. 'Any quantum sensor that can do the job … is on the table for us.' The RoQS program had its public briefing for interested parties — from tech startups to government-funded labs — at the end of January, with initial abstracts due last week and full proposals by the end of March. Evaluating these complex scientific ideas will take a while, so Hoffman said he doesn’t expect to announce a list of winners or any specific dollar values until the end of summer. The award announcements, expected in August, will kick off a 30-month initial phase. Each competitor will have to take their quantum sensor and get it to work on a helicopter. That’s not targeted at any particular Pentagon aircraft program, Hoffman emphasized. He picked that challenge because a helicopter in flight is one of the most inhospitable environments for any sensor, with vibration, noise, heat, and all sorts of other interference to test the technology. 'There’s nowhere to hide,' he said. Meanwhile, in parallel, Hoffman and his team will work with Pentagon programs that are interested in quantum sensing to see what technical requirements and constraints they have. Once the 30-month initial phase is over, he said, competitors who got their tech to work on the test helicopter will then have 12 months to work with one (or more) of those partner programs to tailor it to work on their specific weapons system. 'All this would be done in close partnership with various government entities to make sure we can bring this onto the right platform, integrate it there, and demonstrate the significant advantage these quantum sensors can bring,' Hoffman said. This is not just a science experiment but an experiment in defense procurement as well, he said. 'Can we bridge the valley of death' between R&amp;D and actual fielding, he asked. 'If we can prove that the worst-case platform interference experience you can experience doesn’t matter to our sensors, then we’ve collapsed the TRL [Technological Readiness Level] chain.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/roqs-for-a-hard-place-darpa-seeks-radically-more-robust-quantum-sensors-for-inhospitable-fieldwork/	2025-02-27T09:48:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/211101_sandia_avocado_handout-e1635776824520.jpg
Preparing the defense industrial base to surge, collaborate, and deliver	Across the defense industrial base, the Defense Department is urging prime contractors and suppliers alike to deliver systems faster – everything from missiles, artillery, and air defense, to electronic warfare, drones, and maneuver vehicles. In this Breaking Defense webinar, we examine how DoD supply chain leadership is helping industry meet delivery requirements and targets by addressing strategies to surge production, improve supply chain visibility, and develop alternate sources of vital materials that can constrain and bottle up the supply chain, in addition to prioritizing demand signals that focus industrial-base efforts — as well as potential partnerships with international companies to meet domestic demand. AGENDA Webinar Panel: We will discuss the following: Tech Perspective: Amber Lao, Digital Strategy Analyst, Adobe, will discuss digital transformation and modernization of processes within the defense industrial base.

Dennis Blair: Pentagon purge a sign of dangerous times ahead	Former commander in chief of the US Pacific Command, Dennis Blair, delivers a speech at a conference of the Japan Atomic Industrial Forum (JAIF) in Tokyo on April 13, 2015. (YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP via Getty Images) The Trump administration’s recent Department of Defense leadership changes are unprecedented in their scale and riskiness. Far from bringing fresh and smart perspectives to national security, they are most likely to weaken the combat effectiveness of the armed forces at a dangerous time for the United States. A diverse officer corps at all ranks produces higher combat effectiveness because it is drawn from a wider and deeper talent pool. The armed forces have learned over the years that not all the best military leaders are white males, and that we need to draw from the best leadership talent in the 35 percent of Americans who are not white and the 50 percent who are not male. The armed forces bring in the best people they can attract at the start of the very competitive merit-based 'up or out' promotion system. The larger the talent pool from which the entrants are drawn at the bottom, the better will be the leaders at all levels through the very top four-star positions. Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps colonels and Navy captains have been tested and judged, and the best of them promoted through a dozen jobs over twenty-five-year careers. Only 3 percent of them are selected for general and admiral. Further promotion only gets more selective as the jobs become tougher: The roughly 300 one-star flag and general officers ultimately are winnowed down to just 38 four-star generals and admirals at the highest levels of command. Gen. CQ Brown, the most senior African-American military officer in the armed forces and Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the most senior female officer in the Navy, had worked their way through this grueling obstacle course of the military promotion system with top performance at every level of command. They were the only current members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who were not white and male, and they were doing a fine job in their very difficult assignments. Senior officers have been and should be dismissed for poor performance and for insubordination. However, the decision to dismiss Brown and Franchetti without performance-based justification will weaken the faith of all current and potential officers in the fairness of the officer promotion system and shrink the talent pool of future military leaders. Arbitrary personnel decisions in the senior officer corps do damage beyond reducing the officer talent pool, at a time when the armed forces are fighting for talent. They also move less competent leaders into the top jobs. The basis for promotion up the officer ranks has been superior performance, especially in operational assignments, and leadership growth potential. What has not been a factor has been connection with or sponsorship from civilian politicians or political parties. The traditions of the American military profession are operational competence, political neutrality and institutional loyalty, not political or personal loyalty or connections. Politicization of the officer corps will move the wrong people to the top military positions, where they will provide incompetent and sycophantic military advice to political leaders and poor leadership to the troops. The experience gained in a merit-based promotion system is crucial. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and the new nominee for Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Dan Caine, will be the least seasoned defense leadership team in modern history. Whatever their personal qualities and success early in their careers, they have not been tested in high-stakes national security leadership roles — positions where wisdom is forged under pressure, where failure carries real consequences. History provides sobering examples of the cost of inexperience at the top. General Ambrose Burnside, General George Custer, Admiral Ralph Ghormley, General Ricardo Sanchez all had admirable personal characteristics and early careers but were not ready for the higher commands to which they were assigned. The challenges of inexperienced leaders at the top will be compounded by removing the civilian experts. The combination of forced early retirement for senior officials and a hiring freeze of new civil servants is a shortsighted move that will save little money but likely hobble the Pentagon. Yes, reform is needed to modernize the department. However, the problem is not the size of the civil service, but its outdated personnel system that makes it difficult to remove poor performers and reward top talent. Instead of reforming this system, the administration is choosing indiscriminate cuts that hollow out expertise when it is needed most. Make no mistake, a weaker civilian workforce means a weaker Department of Defense — just as threats from China, Russia and rogue states demand sharper strategic thinking. The current administration claims to support a strong military. You could have fooled me. Choosing inexperience at the highest levels, cutting without improving civilian staff, dismissing respected leaders without cause, and politicizing military promotions all point to a weakened force, not a stronger one. These are mistakes with lasting consequences that will endanger national security and, if history is any guide, they will take blood and treasure to correct. Admiral (ret.) Dennis Blair is the former Commander in Chief of the US Pacific Command and Director of National Intelligence.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dennis-blair-pentagon-purge-a-sign-of-dangerous-times-ahead/	2025-02-27T08:12:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-469552254-scaled-e1740665696871.jpg
US defense industry could struggle to sell to new German government: Analysts	Soldiers participate in Saber Junction in Hohenfels, Germany, Sept. 13, 2024. The exercise is designed to assess readiness to execute unified land operations in a joint, combined environment (US Army) BELFAST — Germany’s conservative CDU/CSU-led government in waiting, and Europe’s urgent plan to rebuild its military capabilities through self-reliance, puts US industry and future orders from Berlin on shaky ground long term, a trio of analysts tell Breaking Defense. Notably, those concerns include whether Germany will stay the course on an $8.8 billion order for Lockheed Martin F-35A fifth generation fighter jets. Though he has still to formally take up office, Friedrich Merz, the CDU’s choice for chancellor, has proposed securing 'independence' from the US, criticized President Donald Trump's 'America first' doctrine and said he is prepared for the 'worst case scenario,' implying a future where the US would no longer be considered a trusted ally. Additionally, he has publicly called for Ukraine to be part of peace negotiations with Russia, pushing back on the White House decision to exclude Kyiv and European nations from proceedings. On Sunday, Merz told German television, 'After Donald Trump’s remarks last week, it is clear that the Americans, at any case the Americans in this administration, do not care much about the fate of Europe,' adding, 'This is really five minutes to midnight for Europe.' The US has since opposed a UN resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine and sided with Moscow a second time by drafting another resolution, passed by members, which called for an immediate end to the conflict but without any criticism of Russia. Merz on the other hand has kickstarted German armed forces modernization plans by opening up discussions with the Social Democrats around a €200 billion emergency defense fund, Bloomberg reported on Monday. Amid such moves, posturing and strategic thinking rests the F-35 order, comprising 35 aircraft, and a collection of other highly lucrative US contracts, including Boeing P-8A Poseidon Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA), CH-47F Chinook heavy-lift helicopters and RTX Patriot air defense systems. Assessing the level of cancellation risk tied to the four major orders, JJ Gertler, a senior analyst at the Teal Group, told Breaking Defense, 'The most significant existing contract in which there may be buyer’s remorse and an attempt to go a different direction is the German commitment to F-35.' He put the stealth jet at the top of the list as it demands 'an ongoing relationship with the United States, because of their presumed access to all of the data going to and from the airplane,' and added 'it is not a one-time purchase decision like some of these other systems, and the US’ reliability as a partner has to be considered more seriously.' Similarly, Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy firm, said that 'the most survivable US export programs are the ones that need the least care and feeding from the US, and can be sustained with in-country resources. The F-35 is incredibly dependent on a constant stream of upgrades and parts.' Offering an opposing view, Jim Townsend, adjunct senior fellow in the transatlantic security program at the Center for a New American Security thinktank, said that the F-35 order is 'safe,' largely because Germany has 'no other option' but to acquire the aircraft to replace retiring Panavia Tornados. 🇩🇪#F35 Milestone achieved! Lt. Gen. Ingo Gerhartz, Inspector of @Team_Luftwaffe has signed the bulkhead for the first German F-35 at Lockheed Martin&#39;s Marietta, GA plant🇺🇸 A major step forward as Germany strengthens its defense capabilities with this 5th-gen fighter! pic.twitter.com/R3rVCVueHW &mdash; Lockheed Martin Europe (@LMEuropeNews) December 6, 2024 Political objections previously troubled Lockheed’s attempt to sell the aircraft to Berlin, when it was ruled out of consideration in 2019, only to be selected three years later and ahead of European fourth generation fighters. The German F-35 fleet is also set to be equipped with US B61-12 bombs to undertake NATO nuclear deterrence missions, with first deliveries expected in 2026. A spokesperson for Lockheed Martin told Breaking Defense in a statement, 'Questions regarding German politics are best addressed by the German government. Questions relating to Germany’s procurement of F-35, through a government-to-government contract, are best addressed by the governments involved.' At the other end of the spectrum is the contract to procure 60 CH-47F helicopters, which the analysts said is likely to continue forward, in part because the only competition was between two US firms — Boeing and Lockheed, which was offering its CH-53K King Stallion design. (Boeing declined to comment.) The 'odds of [CH-47F] cancellation are probably lower than in a case where the runner-up was European (or where a viable European counterpart might exist, like Airbus’s intent to develop a P-8 equivalent based on their airliners)' explained Gertler. The Chinook case is also helped because the aircraft can be supported by 'in-country depots,' as opposed to over reliance on the transfer of supply chain goods from the US, according to Aboulafia. In 2024, Tim Flood, Boeing's vice president of international business development, told Breaking Defense that the company plans on making first CH-47F deliveries to Germany in 2027, while the first of eight P-8’s is due for handover this year. A CH-47F Chinook assigned to B Company, 101st Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault) perches on a mountain in the Alps in Germany (US Army National Guard) Air defense is another major investment for Germany, as over the course of 2024 alone, Berlin inked two Patriot air and missile defense system orders worth $2.4 billion and received approval from the US State Department to acquire up to 600 Lockheed Martin Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile Segment Enhancement munitions and related equipment, valued at approximately $5 billion. Additionally, Germany is one of four European countries involved in a $5.5 billion acquisition of up to 1,000 Patriot Guidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T). The deal is contracted to COMLOG, a joint venture between RTX and European missile house MBDA, through the NATO Support and Procurement Agency. RTX deferred questions on Patriot to the German government for this report. Like Europe as a whole, Germany is acutely focused on replenishing air defense stocks to replace systems gifted to Ukraine. Berlin has supplied Kyiv with an undisclosed number of Patriot missiles as well as three complete systems, including spare parts and four launchers, according to a military support factsheet. Patriot has been credited with shooting down Russian Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missiles and Su-34 fighter jets during the war, though delivery delays have been a point of tension. Townsend voiced confidence that Patriot orders for Berlin will go through as planned, noting the weapon system 'is too important for German air defense to be left behind and the delivery schedule is too long to delay the purchase.' Aboulafia added that a lack of alternative options could keep missile defense deals with the US on track. 'Conceivably, Eurofighter could replace the F-35, with enough time/money to qualify it for the nuclear mission,' he said. 'By contrast, Patriot might just be in a class by itself.' Currently signed agreements may be one thing, but there seems to be agreement among the analysts that future US sales to Germany will face longer odds. Gertler, for example, forecast that Merz’s push for 'independence' will likely lead to a situation where 'the US will lose its position as the default answer to every hardware requirement.' He added, 'Going forward, there will be no preference for US equipment stemming from a regard for their role as a guarantor of European security – at least so long as that commitment remains vague.' As Germany becomes more 'protectionist' in a bid to deliver weapons programs and rearmament at pace, US market entry restrictions or complete loss of market access could take hold, suggested Townsend, especially if the European Union decides to take more of a leading role over major projects. Earlier this week, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen launched plans related to a new 'designated European instrument' that she said would let the bloc deliver 'targeted and efficient defense spending' and that would specifically support European integrated air defense, deep strike capabilities, UAVs, ammunition and missiles, per Politico. 'I think in the short to medium term, the US will have the upper hand' over Europe, said Townsend. 'But in the long term, if European industry is able to rise to the challenge, they'll have competition, particularly in terms of price.

Turkey’s KAAN fighter program attracts Gulf interest, exec says	The second flight of the national combat aircraft KAAN, which was initiated by the Turkish Defence Industries Presidency (SSB) in order to meet the combat aircraft requirement of the Turkish Air Forces Command and developed by Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), is carried out successfully in Ankara, Turkiye on May 06, 2024. (Photo by TUR Defence Industries Presidency/Anadolu via Getty Images) IDEX 2025 — Turkey has seen 'lots of interest' from foreign nations in potentially joining its next-generation fighter jet project, including from an unnamed Gulf country that is 'seriously considering' joining development, a senior Turkish industry official told Breaking Defense. As of now, Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) General Manager Mehmet Demiroglu said that the jet, known as KAAN, is under development only by Turkish companies as 'there is no official [outside] participation yet. 'There are lots of interest [from a] number of countries, but these things are taking a lot of time and high-level decisions,' he said in an interview last week at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi. 'It will be a joint program.' Turkish media claimed in 2024 that Saudi Arabia was in talks to procure 100 KAAN fighter jets, but those reports were never confirmed by Ankara or Riyadh. (The Gulf kingdom has also expressed interest in joining competing fighter programs.) RELATED: Why Saudi Arabia is interested in GCAP — and whether it should be After the first KAAN prototype flew in 2024, Demiroglu said he expected the second and third prototypes to 'be flying by the end of the year and early next year, and we'll be heavily testing these prototypes. ' Demiroglu said that the firm plans to 'shorten the testing period, because we need to do lots of testing and to be able to deliver our first production to [the] Turkish air force in 2028-2029 time frame.' In May 2024, TAI announced that the firm will deliver 20 aircraft by 2028. Demirogu clarified that the delivery of the KAAN jets will start that year. 'I can tell [you] we didn't change our target, but we will see. No one can guarantee that this is going to happen at [a] specified time, because the world is in a different place compared to 10 years ago,' he said. Demiroglu added that for the firm to be able to deliver KAAN with the needed qualifications, it 'need[s] to do lots of homework, and with the latest developments in computing area, testing and experience building with the Hurkus, Hurjet and other [Turkish air] platforms, we are confident that we'll do much shorter time than normally expected,' he said comparing the KAAN development timeline to the lengthy development of the American-made F-35. KAAN, which is described as a 5th-generation fighter jet will have 6th-generation features, Demiroglu said, adding that that the firm is working on manned-unmanned teaming concept between KAAN and Turkish UAV maker Baykar. During IDEX, TAI displayed a model of the KAAN fighter jet alongside the Hurkus 2 trainer and light attack turboprop aircraft. Without going into any specific initiatives, Demiroglu said that Turkish industry more broadly is having 'very, very, very advanced discussions' with Saudi Arabia related to a number of projects. 'We are in discussion to find out the best collaboration model,' he said. A model of the KAAN fighter jet on display at Turkish Aerospace Industries stand at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) He said he was confident that during 2025 Turkish firms 'will announce at least a couple of big projects' with the Kingdom. About interest in Hurkus 2 that was on display at the show, Demiroglu said that 'there are interests, but that interest will grow, because if Turkish air force is accepting a platform, that means it's a good platform.' He added that TAI is discussing export deals of Hurkus trainer and light attack version, not only in Gulf countries but also with countries from Africa, Central Asia and the Far East. More broadly, Demigroglu said that in the next five years TAI will focus on 'how fast we can deliver [and] how cost competitive these platforms will be without sacrificing any bit from the quality.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/a-joint-project-turkeys-kaan-fighter-program-attracts-gulf-interest-exec-says/	2025-02-27T02:22:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/kaan-e1715707472727.jpg
Japan targets weapons sales through Indo-Pacific, as industrial ties lag strategic ones	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches fourth of Mogami-class frigates, Mikuma. Credit Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force TOKYO — Japan is in talks with Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines and other countries as part of a push to export weapons and subsdystems throughout the Indo-Pacific, according to a senior defense official here, part of a campaign to increase defense industrial ties regionally. The US ally's main thrust is the high-profile effort to sell Australia the Mogami-class frigate, which has attracted unprecedented support from the highest reaches of the Japanese government and industry. The official, who spoke to Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity, also pointed to a long-simmering attempt to provide technology to Indonesia for what had been described as a destroyer program. The official said Friday there were talks with other countries but declined to name them. As for the Philippines, the Japanese defense minister publicly pledged closer defense cooperation on Feb. 24 in the wake of the persistent and aggressive pressure from China on Manila to give up some of its internationally recognized waters in the South China Sea. Defense Minister Gen. Nakatani said during his first visit to the Philippines that the two countries believe they must 'further enhance defense cooperation and collaboration in order to maintain peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific' because of the difficult security situation. That cooperation will include increased sharing of technology and the provision of weapons like the radar systems Japan recently has gifted to the Philippines. The air defense radar were installed at Wallace Air Station on the island of Luzon. Nakatani said nothing specific about weapon systems marked for eventual sale or transfer. Taken together, Tokyo's moves appear to be indicative of a lag between defense policy — where relations with Australia, South Korea, the Philippines and other regional players have grown substantially closer in the last two years — and weapons exports, perhaps the most concrete proof of closer cooperation between two countries. 'The defense relationship is not catching up with other areas of defense cooperation between the two nations [Australia and Japan],' the senior defense official said. 'The defense cooperation has been pushed up so much, but equipment cooperation — we've done some joint research projects — but not this big deal yet.' To catch up, Japan has moved swiftly to make good on its policy to begin exports. In the last year it moved from making its first appearance at an international air show, the 2024 Singapore event, to providing radars to the Philippines and engaging in a full court press to sell the Mogami to Australia, in what could be a turning point for Japan-Australia defense industry relations specifically. The Japanese government also created a joint board of senior government officials and of industry leaders late last year to coordinate policy and actions and ensure Australia, in particular, is as well informed about Japanese intentions and capabilities as possible. Japan has proposed a $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) sale to Australia of the Mogami frigate to answer Australia's request for bids for surface vessels to supplement the Hunter class, which are most focused on anti-submarine warfare. The Mogami, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, is competing against a German offering from ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (KTMS), builder of Australia’s current Anzac-class frigates. KTMS is offering the Meko A-200, an upgraded version of the 30-year-old Anzacs. Selling the Mogami to Australia could 'open up the doors to other industrial cooperation, which is attracting more and more Japanese industries interested in the Australian market,' the official said. Closer cooperation could include the Lucky Country's guided weapons enterprise known as GWEO (Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance). Japan has invested heavily in missile systems and has 'much industrial expertise,' the senior defense official told Breaking Defense. Outside Australia, the nascent discussions with Indonesia about supplying technology — some reports from Indonesia said the Mogami frigate was discussed — are clearly in the early stages after years of on and off talks with the previous government. With the election last year of Prabowo Subianto, the former defense minister, those discussions have restarted, the official said. But they are less focused on a destroyer than on what the official called 'maritime security.' As Prabowo's team reviews its acquisition plans, Indonesia's plans will come into clearer focus. 'We'll discuss maritime security with them and we'll find out what capabilities they want and what capabilities we could provide to them,' the senior defense official averred.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/japan-targets-weapons-sales-through-indo-pacific-as-industrial-ties-lag-strategic-ones/	2025-02-26T12:55:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
‘Let’s be frank’: Hegseth’s budget shakeup will be ‘painful’ but there’s ‘hope,’ Air Force official says	U.S. Air Force and Massachusetts Air National Guard pilot Capt. Martin 'Heklr' Clark, climbs into the cockpit of an F-15C Eagle aircraft prior to flight, April 20, 2016, as part of the Frisian Flag 2016 exercise, Leeuwarden Air Base, Netherlands. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by 1st Lt. Bonnie Harper/Released) WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s direction for the military services to collectively free up roughly $50 billion for fiscal 2026 will be 'painful,' a top Air Force official said today, though he predicted the process will benefit the service in the long run. 'Let's be frank,' Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, a chief architect of the service’s new force design concept, said in a conversation hosted by the Hudson Institute. 'The Air Force has gotten smaller. The Air Force has gotten older. And as you look at where the Air Force has gone, we've protected core [missions], which is homeland defense, strategic deterrence and power projection. So there's not many places where we can go for these things.' Those limited opportunities for paring back, Kunkel reasoned, means 'it's going to look really, really bad' once Hegseth’s budget drill gets underway. Nevertheless, the general found reason for 'hope.' The process is not anticipated to change the service’s overall topline and is instead shifting dollars toward the Trump administration’s new priorities — including in the out-years under the Pentagon’s five year budget planning cycle. 'When you look at it from that perspective, the Air Force is going to do really well in the future,' Kunkel said, adding that the service’s newly minted force design will provide options for leadership to invest in. 'When you look at the secretary's priorities and you look at our force design, you're like, ‘There's a match, there's a match, there's a match.'' A leading hot-button issue for the service is a futuristic stealth fighter known as Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD), whose fate has still not been formally decided by the Trump administration after being paused last year. Without providing too much detail, Kunkel stated that 'the fight looks much better when NGAD is in it' as opposed to having to operate without it. 'NGAD remains an important part of our force design, and it fundamentally changes the character of the fight in a really, really good way for the joint force,' he said, such as by ensuring 'less operational risk' as the service pursues air superiority. If the fighter is not fielded, 'that fight is just gonna look a little bit different, and we may not be able to pursue or achieve all of our policy objectives.' Kunkel additionally observed that for the NGAD concept to be viable, the platform will need support from survivable bases it can launch from and tankers that can gas it up. Concerning base defense, elsewhere in the conversation Kunkel echoed comments from other officials that the Air Force may need to have its own indigenous base defense capabilities instead of traditional reliance on the Army to provide them. And on tanking, the general said that a next-gen tanker also currently in limbo 'might be part of the solution,' but there are other operational approaches that can achieve a similar outcome without it. Asked about reforms to the requirements process, including the at-times-cumbersome Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System, Kunkel said a key lesson from the war in Ukraine has been the value of rapidly iterating systems that are then quickly delivered to the field. That necessity, in turn, will likely require a different way of doing business. OP ED: The Pentagon's joint requirements process must go 'We've got to make changes in our processes, which is going to require some changes to the law to get ourselves to be more adaptable,' Kunkel said. He declined to comment on specifics.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/lets-be-frank-hegseths-budget-shakeup-will-be-painful-but-theres-hope-air-force-official-says/	2025-02-26T10:44:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240213_pilot_cockpit_2550991-scaled-e1707844904759.jpg
The Pentagon’s joint requirements process must go	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) A wave of efficiency talk has arrived in Washington, epitomized by the Department of Government Efficiency now roaming the halls of the Pentagon. But as policymakers examine how government actually functions, it's becoming clear that the goal shouldn’t merely be cost savings, but higher competence. One glaring example stands ready for immediate action: the Pentagon's sclerotic joint requirements process. In a new Hudson Institute report, 'Required to Fail,' we outline the need to immediately put this process out of its misery. For over two decades, the Defense Department has labored under a bureaucratic ritual known as JCIDS — the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System. Created with noble intentions, this process has devolved into a crushing administrative burden that actively impedes America's military modernization. Far from ensuring strategic alignment or joint warfighting capabilities, JCIDS has become a bureaucratic priesthood fixated on formatting, enthralled by committees, and divorced from tangible warfighting needs. The numbers tell a damning story. It takes over two years just to get a military requirement approved through this system. During that time, technology evolves, threats advance, and opportunities evaporate. While China rapidly fields new capabilities, and commercial technology cycles span mere months, America's military remains trapped in endless document reviews and formatting refinements. Consider this absurdity: When engineers once discovered that the F-35’s combat radius fell short of its validated key performance requirement by just six nautical miles — about one percent — it triggered nearly a year of bureaucratic wrangling. Instead of acknowledging that 584 nautical miles might be perfectly adequate, or rethinking the entire approach, the system doubled down on its initial, arbitrary decree. Hours of senior leader time, including that of the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, evaporated in the pursuit of percentage points that had no inherent strategic significance. This isn't just inefficiency — it's institutional madness. The fundamental flaw lies in JCIDS's delusion of perfect planning. The system imagines an immaculate cascade from high-level needs to engineering specifications, all knowable years in advance. But reality intrudes: Technical constraints, shifting threats, and budget realities collide with these neat theoretical cascades. When they do, instead of adapting, the system demands costly acrobatics to preserve the illusion of perfection. But here's the cruel irony: After climbing this bureaucratic mountain, these documents accomplish nothing. They don't align money. They don't identify program managers for urgent joint needs. They simply accumulate in an ever-expanding pile of validated requirements that don't get published, don't get culled, just accumulate. An unprecedented wave of decorated senior military leaders has promised to fix this system. From General Cartwright's blunt calls for elimination through Admiral Winnefeld's streamlined forums, General Selva's accelerated timelines, General Hyten's software-era rhetoric, and Admiral Grady's top-down pronouncements — each inherited the same unwieldy machine and promised to fix it. Each has been absorbed into its inertia. Congress has finally lost patience. The latest defense bill mandates a clean-sheet redesign of military requirements. But tinkering won't solve this. The entire apparatus needs to go. Remarkably, this is relatively straightforward: One minor revision to Title 10, removing the legal requirement for document validation, coupled with an internal Defense Department memo scaling back the joint requirements oversight council, would suffice. What the Joint Staff calls progress just indicts the system for its futility — broad capstone documents you can drive a truck through and that don't track accountability, alongside a capability portfolio review model that dominates calendars but doesn't move money. Over more than 30 years and twenty major revisions to the joint requirements system — calling it top-down and bottoms-up, changing document names and approval authorities — the Pentagon has failed to ever question whether the idea of rubber-stamping documents could lead to desired its outcomes. The solution isn't more paperwork — it's understanding warfighting outcomes. Rather than prescribing solutions years in advance, the Pentagon should start with clear problem statements of warfighting need, then move to campaigns of experimentation where service systems and new prototypes can be linked together to see what solutions work best. Our recent report explores what this new approach might look like and how it could function. But to make things better, we don’t need to wait for a new system, we can start today. This isn't about making government smaller for its own sake. It's about recognizing that sometimes less really is more. By removing this bureaucratic albatross, we could free up America's brightest officers in joint roles to focus on actual warfighting innovation rather than debating section headers while our adversaries field new capabilities. Abolishing JCIDS can be the first needed step in streamlining Pentagon processes — picking off the low hanging fruit in the monstrosity that is defense acquisition. If Congressional and Pentagon reformers can’t do what it takes to kill such a non-value-added process, they will have no chance in tackling more difficult choices. Let's give JCIDS the funeral it deserves. Our military's future depends on it. William C. Greenwalt is a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and a former deputy undersecretary of defense for industrial policy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/the-pentagons-joint-requirements-process-must-go/	2025-02-26T10:02:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
Too soon? GAO questions tech readiness of satellite laser links	SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) will depend on laser links between satellites and to ground stations to provide high-speed data transport and missile warning, tracking and fire control. (Illustration: Government Accountability Office) WASHINGTON — While the Defense Department is counting on laser links to enable new satellite constellations for rapid communications and missile tracking, the Space Development Agency has yet to prove that the technology is viable, according to a new report by Congress's watchdog agency. SDA 'has taken steps to develop laser communications technology but has not yet fully demonstrated it in space,' finds the GAO report, 'Laser Communications: Space Development Agency Should Create Links Between Development Phases' released today. Thus, GAO recommends that DoD 'fully demonstrate the technology's capabilities before investing further, among other things' — which would require slowing SDA's two-year acquisition cycle to ensure workable laser links can be integrated. The SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) is a 'mesh network' — defined by the GAO as 'a decentralized type of network that automatically configures and adapts itself to route data most efficiently' — of large constellations of small satellites in low Earth orbit. The two main constellations will provide data transport and missile warning/tracking. Not only is the PWSA the planned backbone of DoD's Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept, but it also now has been tagged as a foundational element of President Donald Trump's Iron Dome for America concept of a homeland defense missile shield. Laser communications links between satellites, and then from satellites to ground stations, are the linchpin of the PWSA's mesh network concept. In addition, the Space Force is planning to use optical inter-satellite links for future satellites in medium Earth orbit designed to track hypersonic missiles and vehicles. 'Laser communications could improve capabilities beyond traditional radio frequency communications that DOD has traditionally used, in part, because data can be transmitted faster,' GAO explains. Advantages include 'the ability to transmit at much higher data rates through significantly narrower transmission beams, which enables more secure communication between users.' At the same time, senior SDA officials long have acknowledged that optical inter-satellite links are the long pole in the tent for the PWSA. The GAO report stresses that 'this technology is much more complex' that traditional radio-frequency satellite communications. Obstacles include: stabilizing the laser beam to eliminate 'jitter' that disrupts the signal; pointing, acquisition and tracking with enough precision so that terminals on each end of the communication link can reliable 'speak' to each other; and minimizing atmospheric disturbances in transmitting laser signals from satellites to user platforms on the ground or in the air, according to the report. Due to the technology's complexity, 'the Space Force is working with multiple vendors to develop it,' GAO notes. 'Nevertheless, the number of vendors involved adds further complexity to the overall effort. Among other things, the Space Force will need to ensure that different vendors’ satellite optical communications terminals (OCT), devices used to establish laser data transmission links, are able to communicate with each other,' the report states. And so far, GAO says, SDA's development program has not made discernable progress to demonstrate that these problems can be overcome. 'SDA's demonstration tranche—referred to as Tranche 0 or T0—has faced development challenges and delays and has not fully demonstrated the capabilities expected from it. For example, SDA planned to launch the first T0 satellites in 2022 but launched them in 2023 and 2024. Further, this initial group of satellites has not yet fully demonstrated laser communications technology in space,' the report elaborates. 'Specifically, as of December 2024, SDA reported that one of its four prime contractors in T0 had demonstrated three of the eight planned laser communications capabilities while another contractor had demonstrated one of the eight capabilities. The remaining two contractors have not yet achieved any planned capabilities.' GAO's Feb. 26, 2025 report finds little progress made by SDA vendors on development of optical communications terminals. (Government Accountability Office) Further, GAO asserts, 'SDA has lowered its expectations for T0 but has still faced challenges.' For example, the report said that as of December 2024, SDA contractors have demonstrated two of the planned optical communication terminal capabilities that were planned for Tranche 0 satellites. 'SDA officials said contractors have also achieved a laser link between two satellite vendors, York Space Systems and SpaceX, but both of those companies are using the same OCT developer. This means SDA has yet to demonstrate a link between two OCT vendors in space as originally planned,' the report adds. GAO goes on to criticize SDA for using a development approach 'thus far is inconsistent with the leading practices,' in particular the fact the agency 'is proceeding through tranches and increasing the complexity of its development based on designs that have not yet met initial capabilities. As a result, SDA is at risk of unnecessarily investing in new efforts without yet delivering on promised capabilities intended to support critical missions.' DoD this month provided formal responses to GAO's findings and recommendations, the report says, and 'concurred with our recommendations.' However, 'DOD notes that it believes it is already implementing our recommendations,' GAO says. 'We disagree. The evidence presented throughout our draft and final report supports our view that SDA is not already taking the actions we recommend. We continue to believe SDA would benefit from taking steps aimed at implementing our recommendations.' The GAO report is yet another blow to SDA, which has been embattled by a bid protest by Viasat that, as first reported by Breaking Defense, was the trigger for the Air Force’s Jan. 16 decision to place SDA Director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. That protest has resulted in a requirement for the agency to recompete one of the contracts awarded under that bidding process. Meanwhile, DoD has launched a review of the agency's semi-independent status as an acquisition unit under the Space Force — a move that has resulted in pushback from some members of Congress.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/too-soon-gao-questions-tech-readiness-of-satellite-laser-links/	2025-02-26T09:30:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-26-at-12.01.23 PM-e1740589957405.png
Army picks Carnegie, Forterra for autonomous logistics truck prototyping	Oshkosh PLS (Palletized Loader System) trucks equipped with Leader-Follower autonomy systems. (Oshkosh Defense) WASHINGTON — The US Army has quietly selected two companies to develop and test autonomous logistics trucks, with officials hoping to get them into the fleet as soon as 2027 — if budgets allow. Officials from the Army and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) told Breaking Defense Tuesday that both Carnegie Robotics and Forterra have been selected to move forward with prototyping work on the Autonomous Transport Vehicle System (ATV-S) ahead of a mid-fiscal 2026 decision point that could narrow the field to a single winner. The Army and DIU did not disclose how much funding each team received under the new deals or when those contracts were awarded. In fact, no official announcement was ever made, with the revelation that a downselect was complete only coming to light Tuesday during comments from Army officials, including Maj. Gen Michelle Donahue, the commanding general for the Army’s Combined Arms Support Command/Sustainment Center of Excellence. 'We must optimize the combinations of humans and machines to increase lethality, survivability and agility, while streamlining and reducing and anticipating those logistics burdens,' Donahue said at the National Defense Industrial Association’s tactical wheeled vehicles conference. 'The integration of autonomous systems for resupply, maintenance and energy distribution will be a game changer.' 'We will capitalize on ATV-S autonomous replenishment of critical commodities to extend the division commander's operational reach and his endurance, or her endurance,' Donahue later added. 'We expect our divisional composite truck companies to increase sustained throughput by 50 percent while autonomously navigating varied and unpredictable routes while maintaining continuous movement.' RELATED: Frustrations mount over Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle autonomy, acquisition approach Getting to this point hasn’t been a direct line for the service. After plowing ahead developing the Expedient Leader Follower (ExLF) for several years — an effort to outfit Oshkosh Defense’s Palletized Load System trucks with autonomy software — in 2023 the service began sunsetting work on that developmental initiative and returning the vehicles back to the fleet without the autonomy packages. The new aim was to find commercial solutions under an acquisition pathway dubbed ATV-S. DIU began supporting that work, in part by standing up the Ground Expeditionary Autonomous Retrofit System (GEARS) project. Then in 2023, DIU selected three teams — Carnegie Robotics, Forterra and Neya Systems — to spend a year developing and testing viable prototypes that could eventually be scaled for mass production. 'We made a lot of headway on this program, really, in the last approximately 18 months, we went from…experimentation, to let's get it onto a program timeline to field to multiple units over time,' Kyle Bruner, the project manager for force projection under Donahue’s command, said on Tuesday. Now with the downselect to two teams, the initiative is officially in phase two with the goal of eventually having PLA A2 heavy expanded mobility tactical trucks (HEMTTs) roll off the production line with a 'digital backbone' ready for the autonomy suites. As for picking a winner to provide that autonomy solution, the Army wants to begin phase two testing later this summer. However, Bruner and Donahue said the stalled FY25 defense bill on Capitol Hill could derail that plan. Since Congress has not yet passed a defense spending bill for this year, the department is operating under a continuing resolution that maintains FY24 spending levels, and that’s a problem for the ATV-S. 'I said 12 to 18 months [for fielding]. It could even be 24 months…if we can't go forth with the final source selection for that capability,' Donahue said. Such a decision would be delayed if the service and DIU do not have funds to test out ATV-S prototypes as planned. That testing roadmap, the duo separately explained, involves using some form of the autonomous trucks at the upcoming Project Convergence capstone event at Ft. Irwin, Calif. next month. Soldiers inside the 3rd Infantry Division at Ft. Stewart in Georgia, will also take their turn with the ATV-S prototypes as part of the upcoming transformation in contact 2.0 push.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-picks-carnegie-forterra-for-autonomous-logistics-truck-prototyping/	2025-02-26T08:25:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/08/PLS-Autonomy-scaled.jpg
Smaller polygons and cell alerts: How Israel’s Home Front Command honed its civilian alert system	People take cover as sirens sound to warn of incoming rockets, during a funeral ceremony in the northern town of Mitzpe Netofa on November 3, 2024. (Photo by JALAA MAREY/AFP via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Israel’s warfighting in Gaza and Lebanon may have spawned some technological leaps when it comes to combat operations, but according to an Israeli security official, advances weren’t constrained only to the fighting itself. Israel’s Home Front Command, which is charged with protecting Israeli civilians, also evolved over the course of the year-plus conflicts, honing existing technology and developing new communication techniques to alert the populace to any threats — mostly coming in the form of rocket or drone attacks. 'Our motto is to get the early warning to every citizen in any place in Israel in any time,' the official, who requested their name not be used for security reasons, told Breaking Defense. 'Because of the threats Israel has, it’s the most advanced system in the world.' RELATED: As &#8216;dome' air defense discussions rage, Turkey's Aselsan sees an opening, CEO says The Hamas attack on Oct. 7 and subsequent attacks by that group, as well as by Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and directly from Iran, tested the alert system to its limits. Six months into the war, the Israel Defense Forces estimated around 12,200 rockets had been fired at Israel from Gaza, Lebanon and other fronts. To better alert civilians to the threats, some of the Home Front Command’s adaptations were a refining of current systems. Israel has relied on a siren alert system in which sirens have been placed throughout the country. The country itself is digitally divided into different polygons. When a projectile appears to be heading towards any particular polygon — after likely being spotted by the same radar system that supports Israel’s multi-layered air defense shield — all the sirens in that polygon are commanded to sound the alarm. But in previous decades the polygons could be quite large, meaning a solitary rocket could send the people of a whole city running for shelters, when the threat was really much more localized. Over time, Home Front Command has managed to be more precise in its predictions, and in its geographical alerts — essentially shrinking the polygons, and therefore the number of civilians who really need to be alerted. Home Front Command also worked to alert individual citizens directly through their cell phones. The first method was with an app developed by the military in recent years that civilians could download that would receive alerts based on the cell phone’s geographical position. But during this war, the command also added a new tactic: issuing alerts directly to relevant phones using cell broadcasts. That system uses existing cell technology but doesn’t have to rely on the user having downloaded the app or having GPS to locate the phone (a good thing, since Israel reportedly jammed some GPS signals near combat zones.) The direct cell broadcast alert was first used during Iran’s second ballistic missile and drone attack on Israel in October 2024, the official said. (Drones also provide a novel problem for an alert system that relies on threats having a predictable trajectory, though the official said vaguely the command has learned lessons from Ukraine's experience fighting Russia to better deal with those.) RELATED: What it was like on the ground during Iran's attack on Israel Beyond cell phones, the official said the Home Front Command has worked to beam alerts directly into Internet of Things devices, like Smart TVs, so that someone watching the TV at home would get a digital alert if they need to run for shelter. Each singular alert systems has its weaknesses — what if a civilian can’t hear the sirens, or doesn’t have the app, or isn’t near their phone, etc. — but the official suggested that the idea is to have a layered alert system that raises the odds of citizens getting at least one warning that they could be in danger. In the future, the official said, Home Front Command could try to beam alerts directly into smart cars, so drivers would be immediately made aware of threats. Cloud computing, the official added, is being evaluated to see if it could offer aid as the program gets more data heavy. 'We always look ahead for new technology and how they can be implemented in our systems and do it even better,' the official said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/smaller-polygons-and-cell-alerts-how-israels-home-front-command-honed-its-civilian-alert-system/	2025-02-26T07:30:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250225_israel_siren_GettyImages-2182009055-e1740508737549.jpg
Space Force: Vive la difference, advises a new AEI policy paper	Space Systems Command headquarters in Los Angeles, Calif., at sunset. (SSC) WASHINGTON — The Space Force should 'embrace its exceptionalism' and push Congress and the Trump administration to allow the service to forge new ways of doing business — from how it buys kit to how it trains Guardians to how it defines its missions, according to a new policy paper from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI). '[T]he Space Force is fundamentally different from the other services, and it should not settle for being bound by the same rules, processes, and constraints,' asserts author Todd Harrison, a senior AEI fellow and long-time military space policy guru. The paper, 'Embracing Space Force Exceptionalism,' is a chapter from AEI's 2025 book, Affording Defense: Investing in American Strength to Confront a More Dangerous World, edited by Mackenzie Eaglen. Urging the Space Force to 'be more aggressive' in breaking the mold set by its sister services, Harrison argues that the newest military service 'is better positioned to take on new missions in a multiple theater force-planning construct.' Such new missions include not only ones necessitated by adversary advances in space power, such as 'offensive and defensive counterspace,' but also 'existing missions that can be better performed from space than from other domains' in heavily contested environments, such as detecting, tracking and targeting enemy forces on the ground. Harrison also posits a fundamental reshaping of the Space Force's organizational structure that would group command units around mission-specific areas such as satellite communications or positioning, navigation and timing. AEI Senior Fellow Todd Harrison is recommending that the Space Force reorganize its command structure around mission areas. ('Embracing Space Force Exceptionalism,' American Enterprise Institute, Feb. 25, 2025) The paper makes seven major recommendations: 'Congress and the White House recognize that the Space Force is different, and the public assumes it is different, but the Space Force itself has not fully accepted its uniqueness. The Space Force is the exceptional service, and Space Force Exceptionalism should be the heart of its culture, values, and vision,' Harrison concludes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-vive-la-difference-advises-a-new-aei-policy-paper/	2025-02-26T05:52:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221020_SSC_hq_sunset.png
EXCLUSIVE: Hegseth draft memo lays out software acquisition reform push	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Joint Task Force North, US Northern Command, to see the efforts military men and women are undertaking in support of US Customs and Border Protection to secure the southern border at Fort Bliss, Texas, Feb. 12, 2025. (US Army/Sgt. 1st Class Andrew R. Sveen) WASHINGTON — Pentagon leaders are crafting a plan to shake up how they buy and field technology, with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starting things off by potentially directing that the department adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) as the preferred method for software development. In a draft memo obtained by Breaking Defense, Hegseth calls on the department to adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway, a practice created in 2020 to accelerate software development by implementing best practices from the private sector. At its core SWP is a streamlined method for procuring software programs bespoke to DoD requirements. Through the SWP organizations can deploy capabilities into platforms within six months or less, DoD has previously stated that the goal is to speed this process up into hours or days. The memo also directs the use of Commercial Solutions Openings and Other Transactions as the 'default solicitation' and award avenue for acquiring capabilities. 'Software is at the core of every weapon and supporting system we field to remain the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world. While commercial industry has rapidly adjusted to a software- defined product reality, DoD has struggled to reframe our acquisition process from a hardware- centric to a software-centric approach,' the memo reads. (As the memo has not been signed out, it is possible wording could change in the final version of the document.) 'When it comes to software acquisition, we are overdue in pivoting to a performance-based outcome and, as such, it is the Warfighter who pays the price.' Speaking on background, a defense official told Breaking Defense that the department will not comment 'on alleged unsigned draft memos' but did not push back on the contents. 'As a general matter, the department is committed to ensuring our warfighters have cutting-edge digital capabilities,' the official said. 'Through that lens, we are looking at the best methods to accelerate the delivery of scalable, secure digital solutions by leveraging commercial innovation, removing bureaucratic barriers, and prioritizing performance-based outcomes.' Commercial Solutions Openings is a solicitation process developed by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) that allows the DoD to work with nontraditional defense companies in a more flexible, faster, collaborative manner. Any contracts awarded as a result of this process are handed out as Other Transaction Agreements (OTA). 'This applies to any software pathway program in the planning phase prior to execution. Department Components are prohibited from implementing further guidance on this point that would set out restrictive measures, guidelines, frameworks, directives, or policies other than required by statute,' the memo states. Furthermore, the Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment, alongside the DIU director, have to develop and submit an implementation plan on how to best utilize these practices within 30 calendar days of the memo being signed. The memo is expected to kickstart a process aimed at getting new technologies and weapons into the field at a faster clip, which is emerging as a focus for the Trump Pentagon, as Breaking Defense previously reported. Related: DoD acquisition reform guidance expected soon, with focus on rapid prototyping There has also been speculation, including in a Defense One article earlier this month, on how the new Trump administration may restructure offices, to include possibly combining pieces of the Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office, DIU and Strategic Capabilities Office. (It may be notable that DIU is called out in the memo, potentially as a sign that the organization's approach and use of OTAs will have greater usage as the Pentagon seeks to increase ties to the commercial sector.) However, the defense official cautioned that it is still early days of 'pie in the sky brainstorming sessions' designed to explore a variety of options to make the Pentagon 'more effective and efficient.' 'I strongly caution against buying into one rumor of how this could go at this point,' the defense official previously told Breaking Defense. 'Each of the organizations, like DIU, have strengths that would only make sense to build on.' Earlier this month, one source that works closely with a broad swath of defense companies described this look at acquisition as par for the course anytime a new secretary enters the Pentagon. 'With all new administrations, there is a pretty much ‘stop, relook and clarify priorities period,’' the source said. 'And right now there is a sense of urgency with acquisition reform.' Many of the non-traditional tech companies, the source added, are ecstatic with the 'rumored frenzy' of acquisition change. That could potentially include revamping the DIU and funneling more work its way, with companies who focus on software, autonomous systems and capabilities that do not rely on GPS, given the ever-increasing threats from electronic warfare, hoping to cash in. 'They don’t need to recreate the wheel, [but they] need strong leadership with a determined focus,' the source added, referring to the DoD.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/exclusive-hegseth-draft-memo-lays-out-software-acquisition-reform-push/	2025-02-25T12:41:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8855959-e1740511956929.jpg
Nominee for Pentagon No. 2: ‘Plug’ shortages, kill legacy programs to ‘defeat’ China	Nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen A. Feinberg listens to the opening remarks of a Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C., Feb. 25, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump’s nominee for the Pentagon’s No. 2 job indicated his willingness to chop legacy programs and called for the department to more closely align itself with the private sector during his confirmation hearing today. If confirmed as deputy defense secretary, billionaire investor Stephen Feinberg said he would bring his private equity chops to work at the Pentagon, driving greater efficiency and financial accountability, improving the defense acquisition process by increasing competition, and working to ensure the US military has the cutting edge technology it needs. He listed shipbuilding, aircraft development, nuclear modernization, cyber defense, hypersonics, counterspace capabilities and counter-drone platforms as key technology 'shortages' needed to beat China, which he called the biggest and most challenging threat the United States. 'China is the first nation we’ve ever competed with that has both a great economy and a great military. China’s entire private sector is fully committed in supporting that military development and as such, they effectively have unlimited funding,' he said during his opening comments in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'Not meaning to be too negative, but we really need to plug these shortages, focus on our priorities, get rid of legacy programs, be very disciplined, and while at the same time focusing on the economics.' 'If we do that, given America’s great innovative capability and entrepreneurship, we will defeat China,' he said. Feinberg is the co-founder and CEO of Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm whose holdings have included defense companies such as hypersonic testing firm Stratolaunch and which has a 70 percent stake in tactical wheeled vehicle maker Navistar Defense, according to Cerberus's website and news reports. Feinberg has not previously held a position in government, but during Trump's last administration he headed the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives private citizens access to classified information so they can assess how the Intelligence Community goes about its normally cloistered business. Trump tapped Feinberg for the deputy defense secretary job in late December, calling him 'an extremely successful businessman.' Typically, the deputy is a largely managerial position, overseeing matters related to the Pentagon’s budget, workforce and its overall bureaucracy — thus leaving the defense secretary free to focus on overarching strategy, policy and political matters. 'There is great opportunity to improve our cost structure, our efficiency, our operations, to really save a lot of money that could be plowed into mission. We do not have great financial accountability, financial metrics or systems — [there's an] awful lot of low hanging fruit there,' Feinberg said. 'This is in my wheelhouse, hopefully. I spent a career helping organizations improve and after doing it so many years, I certainly made sincere mistakes, but … I think I can add some value there.' The Pentagon could improve its supply chain by 'working more closely with our private sector,' specifically by better understanding what drives their leadership boards or how they respond to shareholder pressure, Feinberg said. At a different point in the hearing, he said that the current acquisition system favors legacy defense contractors by incorporating 'gold-plated' technical requirements and rigid regulations that holds commercial companies and nontraditional vendors back. '[There’s] a lot we can do by getting into the program detail, line by line. My view is the deputy has to go program by program, line by line, not hand it off to somebody,' he said. Throughout the hearing, Democrats interrogated Feinberg about a recently announced 8 percent spending cut — which Feinberg said would be reinvested inside the Pentagon to fund top spending priorities — as well as plans to the reduce Pentagon’s workforce by at least 5 to 8 percent. 'Over the weekend, [Defense] Secretary [Pete Hegseth] announced that 5,400 probationary employees would be dismissed, and it apparently was not done with any analysis, it was just preemptive,' said Sen. Jack Reed, the committee’s top Democrat. 'You run companies. Have you ever walked in and fired thousands of people without any analysis for the costs or benefits?' To this question, and other similar ones from other lawmakers, Feinberg stated that layoffs were necessary when restructuring an organization to become more effective. 'Every person is significant, and these cuts are always hard. But I believe that most of the cuts that we will see will be from people that want to retire, people who would like to resign early,' he said. 'There’s obviously over 900,000 civilians in the in DoD so while you can never, you know, not take one person seriously in these kinds of reorganizations, there's always turnover. And without some turnover, you can't become an efficient organization.' Feinberg offered few specifics about any plans for individual weapons programs. After Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., pressed the nominee on whether the nuclear deterrent was the Defense Department’s 'highest priority mission,' Feinberg offered that 'it might be,' but added that he wanted to receive classified briefings before answering that more directly. He later said that 'there's nothing that could be more important than our nuclear modernization,' but noted that 'we also need hypersonics.' And when about whether the US Air Force needs a sixth-generation fighter by Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., Feinberg said it was a 'controversial issue' and that he would offer his best advice to Hegseth — or even Trump, should the president get involved in the potential acquisition. Last week, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., laid out concerns about Feinberg’s business dealings and financial interests in a 23-page letter sent on Feb. 17, which stated that his Cerberus holdings could pose a conflict of interest if not properly divested. (Warren did not ask Feinberg about this issue during the nomination hearing, instead pressing him on Cerberus’s ownership of several hospitals in her home state.) 'I have serious concerns about your qualifications and ability to take on the responsibilities of the role. You have serious conflicts of interest, with holdings in seven companies that do nearly $16 billion in business with the Defense Department,' she wrote in the letter. 'As the Deputy Secretary of Defense, you will have to look out for what is best for the Department and the nation, not private backers, shareholders, or companies in your portfolio,' Warren said later in the letter. In ethics documents submitted on Feb. 18, Feinberg said he would 'divest all of my interests in Cerberus including, but not limited to, my equity interest, carried interest, incentive fees/allocations, and capital commitments' prior to assuming the role of the deputy secretary of defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/nominee-for-pentagon-no-2-plug-shortages-kill-legacy-programs-to-defeat-china/	2025-02-25T11:23:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250225_feinberg_testimony_8885249-scaled-e1740510119294.jpg

Senate approves Daniel Driscoll as 26th Army secretary	Daniel Driscoll, U.S. President Donald Trump's nominee to be secretary of the U.S. Army, speaks during a Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on January 30, 2025 in Washington, DC. Driscoll was questioned on a range of topics including Army retention rate. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The US Army is poised to get a new civilian leader after the Senate today approved Daniel Driscoll as the service’s 26th secretary. Confirmed on a 66-28 vote, Driscoll’s nomination was publicly viewed as less controversial than others put forward by President Donald Trump. It wasn’t immediately clear today when Driscoll would be sworn into office and officially take over the role as Army secretary. He will be greeted, though, with a service in the throes of modernizing its weapon portfolio, ramping up the defense industrial base and grappling with recruiting. The entire Pentagon is also working through a variety of changes and exercises ranging from each service identifying 8 percent of planned fiscal 2026 funding that can be redirected for other priorities to looming civilian cuts. Driscoll — relatively unknown before his nomination, with a limited social media presence — previously served as an advisor to now-Vice President JD Vance, is a graduate of Yale Law School, a former Army soldier, and has spent time working in the private equity arena. During his Senate Armed Services Committee hearing late last month, he seemingly garnered support from both sides of the aisle. In a bit of a rarity for Washington, he received a bipartisan show of support with Sens Markwayne Mullen, R-Okla., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., both introducing him to the panel during the start of the hearing. 'I spoke to Dan a number of times in the course of his preparing for his appearance here today, and those conversations convinced me that he is willing to work on the basis of collegiality, to be transparent and open with this panel with the Congress and our colleagues,' Blumenthal said during his introduction. Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI., the committee's top Democrat, also seemingly threw his support behind Driscoll, saying he brings 'integrity, intelligence and the experience of the young officer leading soldiers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/senate-approves-daniel-driscoll-as-26th-army-secretary/	2025-02-25T10:02:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/daniel-driscoll-scaled-e1740506487433.jpg
President Trump must use every tool to speed up arms for Israel	Maj. Allyn Swavely, a participant in the Senior Officer Orientation course, helps guide the body of a MK-84 onto the Munitions Assembly Conveyor at Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 30, 2017. Bombs built by munitions Airmen can range in weight up to approximately 2,000 lbs and have multiple configurations depending on operational demands. (U.S. Air Force photo/Senior Airman Justin Parsons) A shipment of 1,800 MK-84 2,000-pound bombs arrived in Israel on Feb. 16, several weeks after President Donald Trump announced the end of a months-long freeze of critical US weapons deliveries to Israel. But there are still more weapons that Israel needs stuck in US bureaucratic processes. To fulfill his promise that these weapons 'are now on their way,' Trump should use his emergency authority to push past remaining roadblocks. Despite Trump removing the Biden administration’s ban on delivering MK-84 bombs, numerous other transfers remain stuck, including MK-83 1,000-pound bombs, MK-82 500-pound bombs, Hellfire missiles, and tank and mortar shells. JINSA’s Mike Makovsky and Blaise Misztal revealed in November that the Biden administration had been slow walking these weapons, as well as armored bulldozers that the Trump administration has now started to deliver. Such hindrances in arms deliveries, whatever their cause, only increase risk to Israel, the Middle East, and the United States. Now, with Iran accelerating its nuclear program and its proxies threatening to abandon the fragile ceasefires in Lebanon and Gaza, Tehran could see any further delays as opportunities to exploit. Conversely, rapidly arming Israel, by both providing vital capabilities and signaling US commitment, is critical to deterring and defeating Iran-backed aggression. Yet, beyond delays within the Biden administration, Congress has also put up roadblocks. In January, President Joe Biden alerted Congress that he planned to send $8 billion of weapons to Israel, including Small Diameter Bombs (SDB), Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) Guidance Kits, 500-pound bombs, AMRAAM and Hellfire missiles, and 155mm artillery rounds. However, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), the ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, put a hold on packages. His hold could have held up the weapons indefinitely because of the specific process the Biden administration used to notify Congress about the sale. The Arms Export Control Act (AECA) requires the State Department to publicly notify the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and House Foreign Affairs Committee before selling weapons to a foreign partner, at least 30 days for most countries or 15 days for close partners like Israel. But there is also another, informal process known as 'tiered review' that the State Department has been using since 2012. Under tiered review, State alerts the relevant committees that it plans to submit formal notification of a weapons sale within 40 days. It then waits to receive approval from all four of the committee leaders before actually making the notification. By withholding his approval, Meeks effectively put a hold on Biden’s January arm package, just as he had with other, similar shipments, some dating back to October of last year. While there is no legal requirement to honor such holds, the State Department usually does and did so in this case. To rectify this situation, the Trump administration notified Congress on February 7 that it will skip tiered review for new packages — avoiding any further holds — that advance $8.4 billion of weapons for Israel to formal review, starting the clock for Congress to take action. As part of the overall sale, the State Department approved a $6.75 billion foreign military sale (FMS) deal for thousands of SDBs, MK-82s, JDAMs, and fuzes. A separate FMS covers an estimated $660 million of Hellfire Missiles. In addition, the Pentagon announced a direct commercial sale of artillery shells. If legislators want to prevent these sales, they will have to pass a resolution blocking them. No such efforts have ever succeeded. A resolution from Rep. Meeks in January 2021 sought to block the transfer of SDBs to Saudi Arabia, and the Senate overwhelmingly rejected resolutions from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) in November 2024 that tried to block selling tank and mortar rounds and JDAM kits to Israel. There is an even faster way to move weapons to countries that urgently need them, as Israel currently does. The AECA also allows the president to waive the notification period if he verifies that 'an emergency exists,' allowing the immediate delivery of the weapons. Republican and Democratic presidents, including Trump, have used this authority. In May 2019, the Trump administration invoked the waiver to push through 22 pending arms transfers to Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. The Biden administration used waivers to send weapons quickly to Ukraine in April 2022, in April and May 2024, and to sell Israel artillery rounds and other equipment in December 2023. Israel is still waiting on multiple weapons, not just 2,000-pound bombs, delayed by the Biden administration. Trump should force his State and Defense departments to advance any remaining stuck items and submit an emergency waiver to immediately deliver backlogged weapons to Israel. After months of delays, the United States should provide Israel with the weapons it needs as soon as possible. Blaise Misztal and Ari Cicurel are the vice president for policy and associate director of foreign policy, respectively, at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA).	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/president-trump-must-use-every-tool-to-speed-up-arms-for-israel/	2025-02-25T09:51:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/3797111-scaled-e1740426693313.jpg
Russian ‘menace’ prompts UK defense spending uplift to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027	F-35B fighter jets from the UK Carrier Strike Group launch from the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier to undertake sorties under NATO command in the Atlantic (UK MoD) BELFAST — In a bid to counter Russia’s 'menace,' UK Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced today that British defense spending will be increased to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027. Addressing lawmakers, Starmer also pledged to raise the bar further by committing to a 3 percent GDP target by 2034. Britain currently spends around 2.3 percent GDP on its military. The new spending plan, funded by foreign aid cuts, marks the 'biggest sustained increase in defense spending since the end of the Cold War,' according to Starmer. In simple terms, London will spend an additional £13.4 billon ($17 billion) annually on defense from 2027. At a strategic level, Starmer said that 'we must stand with Ukraine' because if a 'lasting peace' is not secured, then economic problems and security threats 'will only grow.' He was also clear eyed about Russia's continued threat. 'Russia is a menace in our waters, in our airspace and on our streets,' Starmer commented. 'They have launched cyberattacks on our NHS [National Health Service]. Only seven years ago, [carried out] a chemical weapons attack on the streets of Salisbury [England].' Though he did not share how the new funding will be spent, the announcement comes just days before Starmer visits US President Donald Trump in Washington, and appears to be carefully timed to demonstrate the UK is leaning forward to meet Trump’s demand that Europe does more to protect its own security. Starmer had long planned to put forward a 'path' to spending 2.5 percent GDP on defense in the spring. The UK is the third European country to announce new modernization or spending increases, behind France and Denmark, since Trump pivoted toward Russia by labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky a 'dictator' and forecasting that 'he is not going to have a country left.' Amid transatlantic security relations plagued by disharmony, Starmer pleaded for differences to be set aside. 'We must reject any false choice between our allies, between one side of the Atlantic or the other,' he said. 'That is against our history, country and party, because it’s against our national interest. The US is our most important bilateral alliance. It straddles everything from nuclear technology to NATO to Five Eyes [intelligence sharing pact] AUKUS and beyond.' Such a resounding endorsement of the so-called UK-US 'special relationship' differs, however, with a political reality that has seen Washington exclude Europe and Ukraine from peace talks with Russia. At odds with the US position on peace negotiations, Starmer said 'we must ensure' Ukraine negotiates 'their future.' Other issues between the UK and the US remain outstanding. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said last week that a security 'backstop' linked to a peace settlement is required because 'only the US' is capable enough of stopping Russia from launching another attack on Europe. Starmer is expected to raise the backstop idea with Trump directly this week. The British leader has also said he is prepared to deploy UK troops to Ukraine as part of a peacekeeping force, should a peace agreement be struck. 'This week, when I meet President Trump, I will be clear I want this relationship to go from strength to strength, but … strength in this world also depends on a new alliance with Europe,' said Starmer. He added that European nations will 'find new ways to work together on our collective interests and threats, protecting our borders, bringing out companies together, seeking out new opportunities for growth.' Echoing Trump's messaging, Starmer said, 'European allies must step up and do more for our own defense.' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, a UK aerospace and defense trade body that represents over 1,400 prime manufacturers, subsystem suppliers and small- and medium-sized enterprises, told Breaking Defense in a statement that the 2.5 percent spending announcement 'does deliver on the long-term demand indication that allows us to do what we do best: deliver capabilities that are needed to uphold our security, in a way that delivers value for money to the citizens we are here to protect. This clear signal from Government today is very welcome.' The UK is expected to publish a strategic defense review in the coming months, which will focus on strategic priorities and equipment planning, but it faces financial difficulties arising from a £16.9 billion deficit between weapons requirements and its military budget, as revealed in a MoD 10 year equipment plan [PDF].	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/russian-menace-prompts-uk-defense-spending-uplift-to-2-5-percent-gdp-by-2027/	2025-02-25T09:19:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/FLEET-20231105-XN0184-136.jpg.iCexsZ_kMWATAA.lYYOVfIex0-e1719261083813.jpg
Space Force team mapping service’s contributions to Iron Dome missile shield	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Space Force has set up a 'technical integrated planning team,' or IPT, to put together a picture of its current and potential future contributions to the Trump administration's Iron Dome for America missile shield, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said today. 'I think we have a central role to play,' he told a small group of reporters. 'We are leaning forward establishing this technical IPT to try to pull together all of the systems and start thinking about it from an overarching perspective.' The Space Force already is responsible for missile warning and tracking, currently operating the Space Based Infrared System satellites, and developing their replacements under the multibillion-dollar Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) program. The service also has two new programs aimed specifically at tracking hypersonic missiles underway: the Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking — Medium Earth Orbit program being managed by Space Systems Command and the Space Development Agency's Tracking Layer constellation that is part of its overarching Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). Pursuit of the PWSA is specifically called for in President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 executive order laying out his priorities for the Iron Dome for America concept. Pentagon development and deployment of 'proliferated space-based interceptors capable of boost-phase intercept' also is mandated in Trump's executive order. That, however, has not been something on the Space Force's agenda until now. The order gave Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth 60 days to develop the plan to defend the homeland against 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-team-mapping-services-contributions-to-iron-dome-missile-shield/	2025-02-24T14:53:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240717_DVIDS_saltzman_speech_8238081-scaled-e1721238990255.jpg
Leonardo DRS to expand new sub facility with $45M investment from HII	USS Greeneville (SSN 772) enters Diego Garcia’s harbor Aug. 21, 2020. (US Navy Photos by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Michael T. Porterfield.) WASHINGTON — Leonardo DRS plans to expand its new South Carolina naval propulsion manufacturing facility through a $45 million infusion from HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding, Leonardo announced today. 'The investment is expected to expand the capabilities of DRS’s new, 140,000 square-foot naval propulsion manufacturing facility currently under-construction in Goose Creek, SC, and includes capital equipment and other infrastructure enhancements,' according to a company statement. 'The $45 million [submarine industrial base] investment will serve as a catalyst for a 40,000 square-foot expansion of the facility in support of capabilities critical to current and future U.S. Navy nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers.' The facility in Goose Creek, S.C., is also proximal to W International, a metal fabricator which was recently acquired by HII to bolster its own submarine manufacturing space. HII is one of two prime contractors for the US Navy’s submarine programs. 'This significant investment is the result of extensive collaboration between Leonardo DRS, the U.S. Navy, and our shipbuilding customers,' said Jon Miller, senior vice president and general manager of the Leonardo DRS Naval Power Systems. 'It signifies the depth of our combined resolve to address some of the most pressing challenges facing our nation’s submarine industrial base with respect to capacity needed to deliver critical capability on-time and on-budget for the warfighter.' Leonardo’s new facility is slated to open in 2026. The company is currently producing Columbia-class electric propulsion system components, including the main propulsion motor, the main propulsion drives and main propulsion controller. Separately, General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems announced today that General Dynamics Electric Boat, the Navy’s other submarine prime contractor, awarded it a contract to fabricate and deliver three shipsets of Virginia Payload Tubes for Block VI submarines. GA-EMS is scheduled to deliver the shipsets, each of which include two payload tubes, by the end of 2030. 'This contract follows a 2023 contract award for a single VPT shipset that qualified GA-EMS as a viable supplier with proven manufacturing capability to fabricate and deliver complex, safety-critical components for use on Navy submarines,' said Scott Forney, president of GA-EMS. 'We are excited to continue working with Electric Boat to apply our world-class fabrication and precision machining capabilities, experienced program management, and engineering and quality assurance expertise to help ensure the VPTs are available on time to support an aggressive Virginia-class build schedule.' A company statement did not disclose a dollar amount associated with the deal.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/leonardo-drs-to-expand-new-sub-facility-with-45m-investment-from-hii/	2025-02-24T13:00:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/6327059-Virginia-class-sub-scaled-e1631834346549.jpg
UAE’s defense giant EDGE Group inks $2.9B in deals at IDEX 2025	Emirate conglomerate EDGE Group had perhaps the largest exhibit of any company at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group wrapped up an Abu Dhabi defense expo with just under $3 billion in new deals, most signed with the United Arab Emirates. The firm said in a statement on Friday that it signed 16 contracts, launched 46 'solutions,' and inked 32 strategic international agreements at this edition of International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) 2025. Among the largest contracts, at $1.2 billion, was with the UAE's Ministry of Defense for aerial munitions. Another deal, worth $524 million, was signed between the UAE's navy and EDGE subsidiary Maestral for in service support. 'This has been a very busy week for EDGE, and the support of our main customer and solid commitments and interest from international customers and partners, highlights the tremendous success we continue to enjoy,' said Hamad Al Marar, EDGE Group Managing Director and CEO, in the statement. He added that the firm looks forward to the next edition of IDEX in 2027, 'where I am confident EDGE will once again surprise the industry with the huge achievements few considered possible five years ago' when EDGE was founded. During the show, EDGE displayed dozens of platforms in an expansive, central exhibit, from large armored vehicles to UAVs to unmanned ground vehicles, to aerial munitions and small arms. 'While EDGE signed business partnerships to consolidate domestic industrial capabilities in the naval, land, and air sectors, the largest volume of deals revolved around the automation domain,' Leonardo Jacopo Maria Mazzucco, an analyst at Gulf State Analytics, told Breaking Defense. For instance, EDGE has launched new armored and robotic vehicle at the show dubbed HAVOC RCV and also has signed a contract to integrate MILSAR radars from Turkish Meteksan Defence on its unmanned aerial system Garmoosha. The firm has also teamed up with US-based GM Defense and integrated its drone launcher on GM Defense's light tactical vehicle. American contractor GM Defense and Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group have announced a new agreement to explore 'light tactical vehicle'-focused projects, in a move that came as the two firms put on display what one such team-up could look like: a G ride boasting an EDGE drone launcher. He added that 'the significant number of agreements signed by EDGE with international weapon manufacturers speaks volumes about the Emirati company’s 360-degree business expansion strategy, securing a strong foothold in the West and Asian defense markets alike.' EDGE Group signed a large number of agreements to codevelop defense platforms including among others, a memorandum of understanding with Turkish FNSS to update UAE’s armed forces infantry fighting vehicles, a strategic partnership with German HENSOLDT to cooperate in naval technologies and with Brazilian SIATT to supply Brazilian Navy with MANSUP anti-ship missiles. 'For EDGE, the rapid operationalization of business partnerships is vital to the company’s quest to build human capital, strengthen domestic know-how, and generate revenues from sales,' Mazzucco said. ​In his opinion Albert Vidal, a research analyst for the London-based thinktank IISS, said that what really deserves attention are 'the products that EDGE unveiled, the partnerships announced, and the display of the work done by Advanced Concepts, the Electro-Optics Center of Excellence, and the Radar &amp; EW center.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/uaes-defense-giant-edge-group-inks-2-9b-in-deals-at-idex-2025/	2025-02-24T11:11:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/img_5477-scaled-e1739816889511.jpg
