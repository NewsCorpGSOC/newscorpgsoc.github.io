‘Huge implications’ as top Chinese military leader under investigation, joins 3rd defense minister	Chinese President Xi Jinping is applauded as he waves to senior members of the government upon arrival at the opening of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party at the Great Hall of People on October 16, 2022 in Beijing. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) SYDNEY — A public announcement that one of the most important figures in the Chinese military is under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline' — the latest in a string of moves against senior defense leadership — has 'huge implications' for Beijing, analysts told Breaking Defense. Last week, while much of the US defense establishment was enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday, Chinese state television announced Miao Hua, director of the Political Work Department at the Central Military Commission, had been suspended. The announcement marked a departure from Beijing's actions against two previous defense ministers, all of whom vanished from public view before it became clear they were being investigated for corruption. It's also a departure, according to expert Dean Cheng, because Miao can be considered more senior than the defense ministers. Miao Hua, a member of Central Military Commission (CMC) and director of CMC&#39;s Political Work Department, is suspended from his post due to suspected serious violations of discipline, CCTV reported. https://t.co/CTwFrTC8UZ pic.twitter.com/x77SY4OGlJ &mdash; Global Times (@globaltimesnews) November 28, 2024 'This would DIRECTLY concern the top CCP leadership, as the PLA is a party-army, the armed wing of the CCP. If there are problems in the PWD, the implication is that the PLA may not be seen as 100% reliable,' he said, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly given speeches about the importance of the military being subordinate to the will of the CCP civilian leadership. Exactly how this will all play out is unclear, Cheng and another analyst agreed. 'It's clear that the corruption investigations of the PLARF [People's Liberation Army Rocket Force] were not a one-off, but have led to a larger and more systematic investigation across the PLA,' Meia Nouwens, a China defense expert at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'I suspect two things matter here: Xi getting on top of corruption in service branches that are of vital importance to any PLA priority mission, and, secondly, personal connections between those investigated,' she said. But overall, it's the extraordinary prospect of three Chinese defense ministers being investigated for corruption, and now someone senior to the defense ministers being suspended. A day before the announcement about Miao, The Financial Times reported that China's current defense minister, Adm. Dong Jun, was also under investigation. (A spokesperson for the Chinese military reportedly called that allegation 'just shadow-chasing' without further explanation.) Prior to Dong, former Defense Minister Li Shangfu's removal from office was announced on Oct. 24 last year. He had not been seen in public since late August. The last Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang, vanished from sight for weeks and was formally removed in July that year. Before Li’s official departure, there were clear signs of turmoil in the Chinese military, with several top leaders of the Rocket Force having been ousted. 'Having three Defense Ministers investigated, and two publicly accused of corruption, does not give a sense of stability within the PLA. The reports of Miao Hua (on the CMC) also being investigated makes this more serious as his position makes him more senior,' Nouwens opined. 'It also raises questions' about contacts between foreign militaries and the PLA as they usually occur through defense ministers. Though Nouwens suggested Xi is genuinely attempting to root out corruption, Cheng said that the Chinese Communist Party has used 'corruption' charges liberally as a tool against those who have displeased the leadership — for whatever reason. 'This goes to the fundamental reality that Chinese officers (and officials more broadly) may be removed on charges of corruption, but that does not mean that they are, in fact, corrupt. &#8216;Anti-corruption' is a catch-all phrase that is convenient (given Xi's ongoing anti-corruption efforts), but is not necessarily the REAL reason for an officer or official being removed,' Cheng said. Opposition to Xi's policies can 'be a trigger for removal,' Cheng added. 'The PLA has been undergoing major changes throughout the Xi era. In 2015, the PLA underwent massive reforms, including a restructuring of the services and the CMC itself. So, Miao and Dong Jun's investigation should be examined in light of the removal of a number of PLA Rocket Force leaders including Wei Fenghe, and the removal of Li Shangfu (previous defense minister).' Though hard information is scant, Cheng hypothesizes that the removals may be reflective of attempts by the leaders 'to make changes to PLA doctrine and strategy that run counter to Xi's thoughts and preferences. Gaining more resources, but not necessarily gaining more missions and tasks (e.g., more theater command slots) might lead to resentment at the senior level, leading in turn to purging by Xi.' He added, 'The PLA is probably overdue for a new set of doctrine. Unlike the US military, the Chinese take doctrine VERY seriously, and changes in doctrine leads to changes in acquisitions and even changes in organization.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/huge-implications-as-top-chinese-military-leader-under-investigation-joins-3rd-defense-minister/	2024-12-04T05:32:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/xi_20th_congress-scaled-e1671476420682.jpg
NATO CIO: Alliance-wide classified cloud system is in the works	Solider monitors air and ground position location information (PLI) on the Windows Tactical Assault Kit (WINTAK) and Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) to get a common operating picture that enhances situational awareness and data sharing. (US Army photo by Justine Ruggio/Released) NATO EDGE 2024 — In an effort to move toward data centricity, NATO is in the process of creating a classified cloud system in which member nations can share secret information, NATO's chief information officer told Breaking Defense. 'It puts data together that right now is in different repositories,' Manfred Boudreaux-Dehmer said in an interview. 'The very fact of collocating the data in the same instance, or within the same environment or infrastructure, is very, very helpful. Moving into a common cloud environment also forces you to think about data differently and to prepare it for the move, which in itself will be conducive to analyzing the data later.' He said that the ultimate goal is to get all 32 member nations on the classified cloud, but the timeline of this depends on how quickly each country is capable of moving its data. 'It's not an easy process, because you've got subject matter experts coming in from nations, and there's a lot of concerns and technical considerations that the team has to work through. So it's moving fast, but I don't have a definite timeline,' he said. Currently, there is a group of about five to 10 nations who volunteered to draft an implementation directive which will serve as a framework for how the alliance can handle secret data in a cloud environment, Boudreaux-Dehmer said. He added that he did not know all of the countries on the drafting team, but confirmed that the United States and the United Kingdom are part of the group and that all the countries are 'experienced in the cloud journey.' After the drafted directive is completed, all 32 nations must agree on it before it is approved and nations can start working toward accreditation and pilot processes. Once one country is accredited, it makes it easier for other countries to follow suit, Stephen Lewis, who serves as the acting chief of the cloud portfolio at the NATO Communications and Information Agency, told Breaking Defense. However, 'this doesn't mean it's an easy bar for all of NATO' to be accredited, he said. Chief of Staff of the Allied Command Transformation at NATO Simon Asquith shared the CIO’s sentiment of needing a classified cloud during a panel discussion, saying that data centricity is vital in bolstering NATO’s technological innovation. 'Number one, focus on digital transformation and move to a classified cloud,' Asquith said when listing his priorities for digital innovation. 'Without that, we won't be able to [conduct] multi-domain operations. So we need a good digital backbone. We need a classified cloud as quickly as possible so we can integrate machine learning tools and deliver information at a speed of relevance and allow commands to make decisions. If we can't do that, I think we will fail.' Boudreaux-Dehmer explained that following suspicious Russian cyber activity right before the Kremlin invaded Ukraine, Ukraine moved its sensitive data out of data centers and into the cloud. He said this served as an 'inspiration' for NATO to move to move data to the cloud and eventually build a classified cloud system. 'Situations cannot be compared between NATO and the Ukraine, but it has been very, very inspirational whenever I had conversations with people in the Ukraine who were involved in the cloud migration. It's inspirational moving faster and giving it a good push for us, the cloud really is a prerequisite for a lot of things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-cio-alliance-wide-classified-cloud-system-is-in-the-works/	2024-12-03T13:32:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240405_DVIDS_atak_monitors_6369124-scaled-e1712349705569.jpg
Advances in radar are key to countering the modern drone warfare and missile threat	Raytheon recently entered into an agreement with NATO to provide Patriot PAC-2 GEM-T (Guidance Enhanced Missile) interceptors, and NATO can now collectively manage the distribution of the missiles. (Raytheon photo) The evolution of air and missile defense threats – including challenges posed by threats ranging from drone swarms to ballistic and hypersonic missiles – necessitates development of advanced radar and sensing systems that will allow air defense systems like Patriot to remain lethal for years ahead. Breaking Defense discussed this challenge with Tom Laliberty, president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems at Raytheon, an RTX business, and how they can be addressed with radar advancements like the U.S. Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), internationally through the GhostEye MR radar for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) developed jointly by Raytheon and Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace (KDA), and in the counter-UAS role with the KuRFS radar and Coyote kinetic and non-kinetic effectors for the Army’s integrated counter-UAS solution called LIDS (Low, slow, small UAS Integrated Defeat System). Breaking Defense: How have the threat scenarios evolved this decade given what we’ve seen in Europe and other AORs? Tom Laliberty is president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems at Raytheon, an RTX business. Tom Laliberty: What we're seeing today is massive raid sizes with hundreds of missiles launched by the adversary and arriving from every direction. The adversary is trying to overwhelm air defense systems with a huge number of threats that must be dealt with simultaneously. The strategy is that if you’re busy dealing with all these low-cost threats, then the high-value ones – the ballistic missile, the high-speed cruise missile – will find its target. For us, this means we have to build 360-degree systems that are robust enough to handle that complexity with sensors having the capability to manage that massive data set, ensuring that we're prosecuting threats in a way that prioritizes those that could potentially cause the highest level of damage. Tell us about Raytheon’s legacy in air defense systems that includes Patriot and NASAMS. In air and missile defense, Patriot is probably the most well-known system. It’s now the system chosen by 19 countries, the latest being Ukraine. What’s advantageous about Patriot is that with those 19 customers, the community of users can essentially coordinate with the Army to share threat information, which enables us to continuously upgrade the system and make sure it's operating at the highest level of maturity and at the cutting edge of dealing with any threat. NASAMS is now the chosen medium-range air defense system for 13 countries. That's a great system in terms of integrating capabilities from Raytheon’s Sentinel radar, to command and control from Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace, and missiles from the Air Force and Navy portfolios, which are also produced by Raytheon – AIM-9X, AMRAAM, and AMRAAM-ER. NASAMS’ capability will be improved with the new GhostEye MR radar that is now undergoing integration testing. NASAMS with GhostEye MR and its family of effectors can deal with different classes of threats in the most cost-effective way. For counter-UAS, we have the KuRFS radar and Coyote interceptor, providing the warfighter highly tuned radar capabilities paired with a cost-effective Coyote Block 2 effector to deal with low-cost threats. We also have a non-kinetic effector called Coyote Block 3 non-kinetic. Essentially, it flies out and performs a non-kinetic effect to disable a UAS, and then moves on to disable the next. We’ve done some recent testing, and it shows a strong capability against threatening drone swarms. Staying with Patriot and NASAMS, you probably didn’t imagine pre-Ukraine that they would play such an important role in air and missile defense? The two systems have been incredibly successful. While I can't give you the actual number, there have been hundreds of successful intercepts, which has saved countless lives. The Ukrainian air defenders I’ve talked to say that NASAMS and Patriot are really the backbone of their air defense architecture. There’s such amazing capability between the two systems. How is Patriot evolving to meet these threats, including eventual integration with LTAMDS? LTAMDS provides 360-degree coverage, whereas the Patriot is a sectored radar. LTAMDS provides about two and a half times the range and altitude than you have today for Patriot. We've produced six urgent material release prototypes for the Army that are going through a wide range of testing. The most recent being just a month ago, which was a flight test against a sophisticated ballistic missile surrogate. That's put us on a steady path to Milestone C, which is set to happen in the first quarter of next year. The LTAMDS Army radar from Raytheon provides 360-degree coverage and about two and a half times the range and altitude than today's Patriot. (Raytheon photo) Describe the missions that LTAMDS and GhostEye MR support, and how they’re able to address evolving threats. LTAMDS operates in the lower tier of air defense, which consists of a wide range of threats, both manned and unmanned aircraft, along with cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles – the most threatening of the emerging threats. GhostEye MR is a derivative of LTAMDS where we've scaled the LTAMDS radar down for NASAMS to address a wide range of air-breathing threats like cruise missiles, helicopters, aircraft, and UAS. Both the LTAMDS and GhostEye variants share common features like AESA (active electronic scanned array) technology, digital beam-forming technology, and substrate technology called GaN (Galium Nitride). When you bring all these technological innovations together, you have radars with a robust radio frequency that operates at a very wide bandwidth, which can be optimized for the integrated air and missile defense mission. Dealing with the high volume of threat objects in the air today, and being able to manage and guide the interceptors that you're launching, is what the GhostEye and LTAMDS technology has brought to the table. It has created a transformational capability for the warfighter. What’s the commonality/modularity between your Army radars like LTAMDS and the Navy’s SPY-6 radar? The GaN, AESA, and digital beam-forming capabilities that I mentioned are all from a common set of technologies that Raytheon has developed for our radars. In addition, we now have a common software product line to build software in one common source code base that’s usable on all these radars. This translates into faster fielding and more efficient support. Let’s move to counter-UAS and the combat-proven systems you have in that space, including both kinetic and non-kinetic solutions, especially for the LIDS program. As part of the LIDS program, we provide the sensor, which is the KuRFS radar. It’s a Ku-band, highly sensitive and precise radar that’s useful for a UAS mission because it can distinguish non-threatening objects like birds from small UAS. The Army discussed the program recently and said there have been about 170 successful engagements – primarily with the Coyote Block 2 kinetic interceptor, which is a low-cost missile that intercepts UAS Groups 1 through 3. The Block 3 effector has the ability to use a non-kinetic effector to go after multiple UAS. It then returns to the station, is recharged, and sent back up to continue the mission. It's essentially a reusable effector, which delivers the advantage of increased magazine depth. Then there’s our high-energy laser weapon system, HELWS, which has been integrated on Stryker vehicles as part of the U.S. Army’s DE M-SHORAD (Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense) program. Four units were deployed to CENTCOM for operational testing. The technology has performed well, and one of the things we continue to work with the Army on is the appropriate way to maintain those systems so that they can effectively operate in austere environments. Raytheon is competing for the next-generation short-range interceptor (NGSRI) to replace the Stinger missile, which Raytheon produces as the long-time prime for Stinger. Tell us about the program and what Raytheon brings to the table. The Army is looking for a next-generation MANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) to address evolving threats. I can't say too much about the program because it’s competitive, but we believe our offering will provide the Army with a transformational short-range air defense capability. We’ve been producing Stinger for decades, back to the Korean War, and with great success. This is going to be a revolutionary change in capability for a manageable, modular system that will serve the Army and Marine Corps well for decades to come. Integrated air and missile defense and C-UAS solutions are in high demand across the globe, and Patriot and NASAMS, as we’ve discussed, have a large international customer base. What’s your outlook on the international market for IAMD? Yes, there’s a widespread use of Patriot and NASAMS –19 countries for Patriot and 13 for NASAMS – and dozens that use Stinger. We service a wide range of customers for their air defense needs. Given all the conflicts going on around the world, there’s a tremendous demand for these capabilities, and one of the advantages of using a system like Patriot is that it provides the ability for coalition forces to interoperate far more easily and even go beyond interoperation. It gets them to the point of being interchangeable – where you can take one country's missiles and use them in the same air defense system, as well as sharing spare parts, soldiers, and specifics on tactics and ops for how to operate with the systems. For example, at the end of 2023, we entered into an agreement with NATO to provide Patriot PAC-2 GEM-T (Guidance Enhanced Missile) interceptors. NATO can now collectively manage the distribution of the missiles as they come off the production line, and multiple partners can essentially aggregate their demand and leverage economies of scale. With the investment from NATO, we can partner with additional suppliers in Europe and stand up a test and final assembly facility for these PAC-2 missiles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/advances-in-radar-are-key-to-countering-the-modern-drone-warfare-and-missile-threat/	2024-12-03T12:18:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Raytheon-In-Focus-lead.jpg
IAI targets US, Russian-built jets with upgraded Ehud ACMI pods	Israel Aerospace Industries' Ehud Next Generation pod on display at I/ITSEC. (Breaking Defense/Reuben Johnson) I/ITSEC 2024 — Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) used this year’s Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) to show off its newest Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod, as the company targets both Western and Russian-designed aircraft for potential markets. At present, 17 air forces are operating one or more versions of the company’s Ehud-series autonomous ACMI pods, which allow air forces to conduct air-to-air combat engagements without actually firing a missile. The ACMI pod, shaped like a missile, is loaded onto a jet, and pilots are able to engage in as-close-as-possible-to-real-world combat without the weapons being launched. The first Ehud ACMI pod was originally introduced over a decade ago, designed to go on a Raytheon infrared homing air-to-air AIM-9L Sidewinder. The company also worked with non-Russian users of the Sukhoi Su-30 and Mikoyan-29, in order to develop a version that works on any aircraft that is capable of firing the Russian-designed Vympel R-73 (AA-11), which was the mainstay infrared-homing air-to-air weapon for Russian aircraft for years. The newest version the company is showing off at I/ITSEC is the Ehud Next Generation pod, which is designed to work with fifth-generation Western jets. In essence, that gives IAI a chance to market at the three biggest military aviation user bases: older Western jets like the F-16, older Russian jets like the MiG-29, and modern Western fighters like the F-35. While ACMI pods have been around for years, IAI’s design gives extra oomph for the training customer, according to Ari Maman, head of business development for the company’s MLM modeling and simulation group and a former F-16 pilot with the Israeli Air Force. He called out three specific capabilities the company talks about when marketing their tech. 'The first is that the use of the Ehud pods creates real-time high-fidelity datalink training networks between groups of instrumented aircraft in an engagement of multiple platforms,' he said. 'Once you make a simulated launch [using the pod] it takes into account what the other targets are doing. 'Secondly, once the exercise is complete there is the ability to carry out a complete and comprehensive debriefing of the entire engagement and all other factors that are programmed into the simulation,' he continued. 'This can be done from a ground station that has recorded all of the simulated firings conducted by the pod or downloaded from the pod itself.' Like all modern weapon systems, the data is the driver, Maman emphasized: 'All of these recordings can then be used to build out a database with each successive exercise pairing up all of the elements that would be involved in an airland battle. The data can then be used to conduct an evaluation of large-scale exercises using database and incorporating all air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-based air defense firings into an integrated air data picture.' The third function that the Ehud pods are capable of is being a safety feature in those situations where there are multiple aircraft engaged in an exercise. The Ehud design 'has a unique ability to prevent midair collisions. The computerized system on board will send a signal to a pilot if it projects the aircraft flying into an unsafe situation by sending a signal to the pilot. 'There are other features that enhance safety outside of the training range. The system has an option where the pilot can be wearing a small tablet in place of the normal pilot’s clipboard attached to his thigh that gives the complete air date picture of all the aircraft participating in the exercise. This gives the pilot who is operating as the &#8216;Red' or opposing force the location of all the aircraft in his flight as well as all of those in the ‘Blue’ force.' But perhaps what makes the Ehud most unique goes back to that willingness to design a system that can work with both Western and Russian aircraft. It is not a simple task to be able to design the different connectors that the two types of aircraft utilize, have the correct programming and algorithms in order to design one model to work with a US or European MMC and another with the Russian on-board electronic infrastructure. 'IAI are the only company who has been both invited by different governments to develop these different pods in order cover all types of fighters. It is the company’s long-running strength of being able to work with both ‘worlds,’' Maman said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/iai-targets-us-russian-built-jets-with-upgraded-ehud-acmi-pods/	2024-12-03T11:17:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/IAI-ehud-Reuben-Johnson-IITSEC-scaled-e1733252568654.jpeg
Franco-German land systems firm KNDS appoints new CEO	The KNDS Enhanced Main Battle Tank (EMBT) technology demonstrator fitted with the new EMBT-ADT 140 uncrewed turret, on display at Eurosatory (Andrew White/Breaking Defense) BELFAST — The Franco-German land systems manufacturer KNDS has appointed Jean-Paul Alary as its new CEO, succeeding Frank Haun, who will step down from post later this month. Alary, who has worked in the defense industry since 1991, will formally take charge of the firm on April 1, 2025, according to a KNDS company statement. He is due to depart as France's Safran Aircraft Engines CEO at the end of December. 'With Jean-Paul Alary, KNDS could win an outstanding expert in technology and management,' said Philippe Petitcolin, KNDS Chair of the Board of Directors. 'He will further drive KNDS's innovational power and economic growth. We are pleased to welcome him to the KNDS leadership team.' Alary said, 'The defense industry is facing challenging yet opportunity-rich times. I look forward to actively shaping these developments as the CEO of KNDS. As a leading company in European land defense, KNDS plays a central role in security policy considerations and efforts.' Formed in 2015, KNDS is a joint venture between France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMV), two of Europe's largest land system manufacturers. The company makes the Leopard 2 main battle tank, Puma infantry fighting vehicle and PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer, among other vehicles. In 2023, it recorded turnover of €3.3 billion ($3.5 billion) and an order backlog of approximately €16 billion, according to company figures. Philippe Balducchi, Group Chief Financial Officer of KNDS, will take on CEO responsibilities on top of his current remit between Haun stepping down and Alary's succession commencing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/franco-german-land-systems-firm-knds-appoints-new-ceo/	2024-12-03T10:43:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/KNDS-e1718788745738.png
Army eyeing new PrSM Inc. 5 weapon to fire from autonomous launchers beyond 1000 km	The Army's PrSM weapon is seen during a test launch. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — The US Army is developing a fifth Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) that it could potentially launch from an autonomous launcher to hit targets beyond 1,000 km, according to two service leaders. At an Association of the US Army event today, the commanding general for the service’s Fires Center of Excellence Maj. Gen. Winston Brook showed a slide with a PrSM Increment 5 weapon listed as a future capability. The director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team, Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, separately explained that work on a fifth increment is in fact underway but is currently relegated to the science and technology arena. The idea, he explained, is to design a missile that can be fired from an autonomous vehicle. 'If you're familiar with an [M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System] MLRS pod, it's about 13-feet long,' the one-star general told the audience. 'If you have something without a cab, that's autonomous, you might be able to employ something longer than that.' 'We're in the science and technology phase of something that we'll maybe, eventually call Increment 5,' Crooks added. 'You might be able to employ something that's actually longer … and you might be able to achieve ranges that, right now, don't seem realistic.' While there are science and technology funds to examine this potential new weapon, Crooks said there is not yet a timeline to compete and formally develop it. Over the past several years, the Army has been developing four other PrSM rounds, broadly designed to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and be launched from both the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and the M270A2 MLRS. The service is currently in the process of fielding initial Increment 1 rounds from Lockheed Martin billed as a way to strike targets at least 500 km away. Future versions of the weapon also include an Increment 2 with a multimode seeker, known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and a PrSM Inc 3 which would seek to add in enhanced lethality payloads. The Army has also tapped a Lockheed Martin team and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team to work on competing PrSM Inc 4 designs that can fly more than 1,000 km, possibly double the range of the current version.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-eyeing-new-prsm-inc-5-weapon-to-fire-from-autonomous-launchers-beyond-1000-km/	2024-12-03T09:36:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/PrSM-2-scaled.jpg
Half of Navy’s amphibious fleet in ‘poor condition,’ some ships out for years, GAO warns	A joint light tactical vehicle attached to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is transferred from dock landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) to Landing Craft Utility 1661 during vehicle and equipment loading operations in the Arabian Gulf, July 16, 2021. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by 1st Lt. Mark Andries) 'Amphibious warfare ships are critical for Marine Corps missions, but the Navy has struggled to ensure they are available for operations and training,' reads a new report from the Government Accountability Report, published today. The Navy is required by law to maintain a fleet of at least 31 amphibious vessels; it currently counts 32. But the report found that as of March this year, nine of the Navy's 10 dock landing ships were in 'poor material condition,' as were five of the seven amphibious assault ships and two of the 13 amphibious transport docks. The Navy's two amphibious assault ships were both in 'satisfactory material condition.' GAO's rating of the Navy's 32 amphibious vessels as of March 2024. (GAO) The report notes several factors that contributed to the problem, including 'challenges with spare parts.' But a summary of the report also noted that in order to 'save money, the Navy proposed early retirement for some ships and cancelled critical maintenance on them. But the Navy is still relying on these ships — which haven't been well-maintained — while it waits for new ones to be built. As a result, it will be hard to continue meeting the 31-ship requirement.' Amphib readiness has been a topic of much discussion, as service leaders and lawmakers have scuffled over just how many of the ships the Marine Corps really needs, and how relevant they are to modern combat operations. OP ED: To cool the war over amphibs, the Navy and Marines need a clearer justification By this summer the Navy and Marine Corps leadership had 'locked shields' in defense of the fleet, and in July the heads of both organizations announced they had jointly signed off on new guidelines that were meant to 'ensure consistency and uniformity in Navy and Marine Corps amphibious force planning, assessment, and operational mission execution.' (The GAO report also pinged the services for disagreeing with each other 'on the number of ships that should be available at any given time to conduct operations and training.') As for the GAO report, in the end the oversight body makes four recommendations, three of which dealt with still better defining readiness terminology as well as establishing clear timelines and performance goals related to assessing and improving readiness. The Navy concurred with all of those. RELATED: Short on amphibs for Turkey and Sudan, the Marines grapple with crisis response ethos The Navy partially concurred with the GAO recommendation that the Navy update its amphibious ship depot maintenance policy 'to clarify that, absent operational needs, the Navy should not cancel depot maintenance for amphibious ships proposed for divestment that have yet to reach the end of their expected service life.' In that case, the Navy said it's currently 'prohibited by law' from modifying vessels destined for the boneyard, and waivers to do so have a narrow timeline. 'However, the statute permits normal Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&amp;E) work within the five-year window prior to a ship being removed from service. The Navy will schedule this work, including depot-level repair as necessary, to maintain the ship in operational condition.' It also noted the Navy Secretary may grant waivers for that statute in the 'national security interests' of the US.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/half-of-navys-amphibious-fleet-in-poor-condition-some-ships-out-for-years-gao-warns/	2024-12-03T09:11:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/6755223-scaled-e1679336812778.jpg
‘It’s not a war zone’: Pentagon ponders policy shifts to protect homeland bases from drones	Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command hosted distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak on Fort Carson, Colorado, Oct. 30, 2024. (U.S. Department of Defense photo by Josh Armstrong) FORT CARSON, Colo. — When industry representatives gathered with military officials in the Colorado mountains to test different counter-drone tactics, another enemy lurked in the background, threatening to hamstring efforts to take on the increasing threat of small drones: red tape. In some ways, officials said during the Falcon Peak event, the focus needs to be on figuring out the complex rules and regulations governing domestic airspace, which largely limit options military commanders have to respond to small unmanned aircraft systems, or sUAS. 'The threat, and the need to counter these threats, is growing faster than the policies and procedures that [are] in place can keep up with,' US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) chief Gen. Gregory Guillot told reporters during a visit to the exercises last month. Working in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NORTHCOM used Falcon Peak as an opportunity to get smart not only on the nets, streamers and cyberattacks meant to defeat sUAS, but on the regulatory side as well. Guillot, for instance, envisions his command acting as a homeland 'synchronizer' to coordinate interagency efforts and distribute defensive capabilities to installations. 'One of the key things about Falcon Peak is it offers not just the opportunity to look at the technology that's being tested, but also at our processes,' a senior DoD official who attended the demo said in a roundtable with reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 'A lot of the tasks we have in the homeland, it's a very sophisticated environment in that it's complicated from a regulatory perspective. It's a very civilianized environment. It's not a war zone,' they added. The DoD already has authority to conduct anti-drone missions on US soil, but the law 'restricts our ability to use counter-UAS to certain types of covered rules and missions, covered assets' like nuclear or special operations, the official explained. The statute also requires coordination with the Department of Transportation, mainly through the FAA. To help address the sUAS problem, the official said the Pentagon has pushed a legislative proposal that would help clarify what facilities are covered under the federal statute that allows DoD to enforce perimeter security. The Pentagon is also seeking changes that would improve interagency counter-UAS coordination, they added. The official stressed that if needed, the US government writ large has authorities to defend military bases domestically. But the challenge is in ensuring 'authorities knit together at the seams so that the whole homeland is protected.' Any policy changes likely would not be a one-off either, as the official noted drones themselves will change along with the technologies necessary to defeat them. New tech would then need to be coordinated with other domestic agencies to ensure any impacts are fully understood. 'As our counter-UAS abilities grow and change, we have a responsibility to make not just the FAA, but any civilian agency that we think could be adversely affected by the system that we're fielding aware [of it] and talk to them about how this could affect them,' the official said. Heeding domestic protections, traditional tools like guns and missiles were shunned at Falcon Peak in favor of low- and non-kinetic options, such as nets and signal interference. Those tactics appeared to successfully demonstrate a non-intrusive, low-collateral way to bring down an sUAS, but the senior defense official noted that even with seemingly non-threatening techniques like net capture, some kind of wider coordination would be required before it could be approved beyond ad hoc cases. 'And so there is a process, I think, that we need to continue to refine that will determine how we get those approvals and whether that approval can be a blanket approval,' the official said. Other options like jamming radio frequency links and denying navigation systems required extremely tight coordination with the FAA, as any spillover interference that affected civilian navigation systems could spell danger. 'That is probably one of the biggest hurdles that we have in the counter-UAS space,' Jason Mayes, counter-small unmanned aerial systems deputy test director for NORTHCOM told reporters regarding tools like signal interference. 'It is a very, very difficult capability to get permission to utilize.' NORTHCOM planners had a total of 90 days to plan and execute the Falcon Peak event, Mayes said, requiring a compressed process with the FAA to get the right approvals for the technology. The bureaucracy moved more quickly once the need to use signal interference tech was established as a one-off, 'but I think in real time, we would probably be able to do it very quickly,' Mayes said, pointing to Guillot’s envisioned role of NORTHCOM serving as a domestic synchronizer. 'There’s some areas where we’ve got one policy saying one [thing] and another policy saying another. And the parts where they cross over get a little blurry, you know, and just confusing,' Mayes. 'So I think we need to solidify all of that.' Working with the FAA could one day yield the possibility of approving 'kinetic-type' weapons, said another official, though such an agreement might not be reached in the near-term. 'The FAA and other authorities are looking at this capability and understanding the safety mechanisms that we're implementing into these systems. For example, directed energy: We're implementing things into the directed energy system where it has significant safety avoidance,' Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, commander of the Army’s Space and Missile Defense command and former director of the Pentagon office tasked with countering small drones, told reporters. 'We can mitigate a lot of the challenges of using kinetic-type of capabilities. So I think, over time, working closely as an enterprise … [and trying] to find out what are the best ways from a reduced risk mitigation, can we get there with some of these kinetic effectors, and what are the right kinetic effectors we actually want to employ,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/its-not-a-war-zone-pentagon-ponders-policy-shifts-to-protect-homeland-bases-from-drones/	2024-12-03T04:31:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Guillot-falcon-peak-scaled-e1733170045719.jpg
Global defense revenues grew in 2023 amid Ukraine, Middle East conflicts: SIPRI report	The 'separate' Russian pavilion at IDEX 2023 is actually situated on the NAVDEX grounds. (Lee Ferran / Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The world’s largest 100 defense contractors amassed $632 billion in combined revenue in 2023, a real-term annual growth of more than 4 percent that comes as conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to propel weapons demand, according to a new Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report released today. The latest figures show that revenues have 'bounced back after a dip in 2022,' as companies push to increase production capacity to meet a demand signal that shows no sign of subsiding in the near term, the report stated. 'There was a marked rise in arms revenues in 2023, and this is likely to continue in 2024,' said Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher with SIPRI’s military expenditure program. 'The arms revenues of the Top 100 arms producers still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales.' While US-based companies made up 41 companies in the top 100 — and half the total revenue recorded — Russian defense firms boasted the largest increase in revenues in 2023 by percentage, growing by 40 percent compared to 2022. The report attributed that gain to an intensified campaign by Russia’s Rostec defense conglomerate and United Shipbuilding Corporation to surge production capability for key weapon systems like missiles, aircraft and drones needed to replace equipment lost fighting against Ukraine. According to the report, 'this expansion was facilitated by several strategic adjustments, including increased state orders backed by a larger military budget, new administrative structures to manage production and ensure implementation of orders, and multi-shift working conditions at many arms manufacturing facilities.' Overall, US defense companies saw revenue go up 2.5 percent in 2023. But despite a growth in orders, the two largest contractors, Lockheed Martin and RTX, recorded a slight drop in real-term revenue due to continued supply chain constraints for specialized components and subsystems like solid rocket motors, which has caused headwinds for the companies’ plans to expand production on key aerospace and missile defense programs. RTX saw defense revenues fall by about 1.3 percent to $40.7 billion in 2023, while Lockheed’s revenues dipped by 1.6 percent to $60.8 billion, according to SIPRI. Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman, which SIPRI counts as the third largest defense contractor, registered a 5.8 percent increase to revenue on the back of increased sales of ammunition in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as more than 9 percent growth in its space unit. RELATED: Lockheed on &#8216;campaign-like' hunt for new solid rocket motor supplier While Russian defense contractors recorded a surge to their bottom lines, Chinese companies saw their year-over-year revenue growth stagnate, with a 0.7 percent increase that was its lowest rate since 2019, the report said. The slowdown of Chinese industrial growth was met by a huge increase of defense revenues by Japanese and South Korean companies, as two of the largest US allies in the region strive to increase the capacity and technological know-how of their respective defense industries. South Korea saw an increase of 39 percent to $11 billion in 2023, with Hanwha, the country’s largest defense contractor, recording an increase of 53 percent in defense revenue after finalizing the acquisition of the shipbuilder DSME and increasing exports of armored vehicles and artillery due to contracts with Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Japanese defense contractor revenues expanded by 35 percent to $10 billion in 2023, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries leading the way with a 24 percent increase and Kawasaki Heavy Industries netting 16 percent growth on defense. RELATED: Japan looks to revamp defense industry after years of downsizing After Russia, the Middle East was the region with the largest levels of revenue growth that year, with six Israeli and Turkish companies in the top 100 increasing a combined 18 percent to reach $19.6 billion. Notably, Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael netted increases of 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile Turkish Aerospace Industries reported 45 percent revenue growth, the largest for a Turkish company. Among the 27 European defense companies on the list, revenue was largely flat in 2023. The biggest gains were boasted by JSC Ukrainian Defense Industry, the Ukrainian conglomerate formerly known as Ukroboronprom, which saw arms revenues increase by 69 percent to $2.2 billion as it increased production of weapons needed for Ukraine’s military. The four German defense companies included in the top 100 recorded a 7.5 percent increase in revenue, while all seven UK-based defense companies also recorded revenue growth. However, SIPRI reported that combined revenues of five French companies went down by 8.5 percent, led by a 41 percent defense revenue decrease by Dassault Aviation Group as sales of its Rafale fighter decreased. Italy, which had Leonardo and Fincantieri in the top 100, saw defense revenue fall 10 percent between the two companies due to a decrease in aircraft sales by Leonardo and the conclusion of an export deal between Qatar and Fincantieri.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/global-defense-revenues-grew-in-2023-amid-ukraine-middle-east-conflicts-sipri-report/	2024-12-02T13:21:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/230223_IDEX_russia_pavilion_Ferran.png
Japan OKs potential sale of Mogami frigate to Australia, in first of its kind move	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches the fourth Mogami-class frigate, Mikuma. (Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force) SYDNEY — Japan has taken an important step forward in its burgeoning efforts to sell a major weapon system to another country, with its National Security Council formally approving the sale of Mogami-class warships to Australia for its General Purpose Frigate program. The Foreign Ministry released a statement Nov. 28 detailing the decision, noting how important is Japan's relationship with Australia. Japan has never sold a modern major weapon system to another country. 'As stated in the National Defense Strategy, Australia will establish a close cooperation relationship second only to Japan-US defense cooperation as a &#8216;special strategic partner' in the Indo-Pacific region,' the statement says. 'Based on such a policy, the joint development and production of this case will contribute to a significant improvement in interoperability and compatibility with Australia, as well as strengthening the shipbuilding and maintenance infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region and improving the capacity of our ships in the future, and is of great significance to the country's security.' The Mogami, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), is currently in service in the Maritime Self Defense Force. For the $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) competition, MHI is up against ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (KTMS), builder of Australia's current Anzac-class frigates, who is offering the Meko A-200, an upgraded version of the 30-year-old Anzacs. Michael Shoebridge, founder of Strategic Analysis Australia, told Breaking Defense in an email that should Australia decide to buy the Mogami-class instead of a German ship, 'It would fundamentally increase [Japan and Australia's] militaries' ability to operate together and strengthen the defense industrial bases of both nations.' 'Japan has an excellent chance of success in this program, particularly if the broader technological partnership it will enable is understood clearly at government level in both nations,' wrote Shoebridge, well-known as an acquisition expert here. The Germans do not have any formal defense ties with Canberra, while Japan has been strengthening its military ties to Australia through moves such as the Reciprocal Access Arrangement and new troop rotations announced just last month. 'The Australian navy's ageing ANZAC frigates are a German design, but that construction project is decades old, so any incumbency benefits have shrunk,' Shoebridge said. 'German companies are well-practiced at overseas defense sales, however, so if Australia runs the selection like a normal commercial activity, then Japan will be disadvantaged. It's important [Canberra] see this as a joint government and industry program.' Should Japan win the final selection, expected to occur by the middle of next year, 'it would catapult Japan into an AUKUS Pillar Two-like partnership on advanced military technology with Australia and open doors to broader cooperation in this Pillar Two area, where Japan has obvious strengths,' Shoebridge said. 'The fact that the Japanese Government and MHI are offering to build Mogami class frigates for and with Australia is a remarkable statement about the strategic and technological partnership they see as possible between our two countries, particularly after the setback from the submarine decision a decade ago. Australia should understand Japan's serious and positive purpose in making this offer at this time.' One interesting tidbit in the announcement is that Japan will, as America does, retain veto power over the transfer of the weapon to a third party — another sign it is serious about becoming more of a defense export player on the global market.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/japan-oks-potential-sale-of-mogami-frigate-to-australia-in-first-of-its-kind-move/	2024-12-02T12:13:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
EXCLUSIVE: 2 key senators urge Navy to change course on large USV program	The USV Mariner, a US Navy research and development vessel, is docked at the United States Naval Academy where it will be christened on Aug. 23, 2022. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The top two senators overseeing the Pentagon are urging the Navy’s leadership to rethink its plans for the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) over concerns the vessel’s size and complexity will rival that of a manned frigate, according to a letter obtained by Breaking Defense. The senators also say the Navy should work with lawmakers to 'repurpose LUSV funds' to support certain activities for the Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel program. The LUSV is one of the Navy’s exquisite, unmanned surface vehicle programs focused on anti-surface warfare and strike warfare missions. Its requirements include being able to employ up to 32 Mk-41 Vertical Launch Cells, which is evidently driving up anxiety on Capitol Hill. 'This requirement drives the LUSV size and complexity, potentially rivaling a frigate’s displacement at 4,000 tons,' according to a Nov. 14 letter signed by Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I. and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who also lead the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'Under current plans, the LUSV will be late to need and incur excessive concurrency, but the Navy will also have a shortfall in Mk-41 compatible missiles even to outfit all LUSVs.' By contrast, the MUSV, which is envisioned to carry a variety of unique payloads, is envisioned to be under 500 tons displacement and no longer than 200 feet in length. The LUSV has been a high-profile research and development program for the Navy since 2019 when it unveiled a bevy of new efforts around unmanned maritime technologies. But between congressional skepticism and other budget priorities, the vessel's original schedule to become a program of record was delayed from 2025 to 2027 — and the senators' letter says even the 2027 timeline may be in danger given the other challenges facing the program. The letter is addressed to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti and Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro. 'We still believe in the need for the high-low mix of vessels in the Navy’s fleet design and commend Admiral Franchetti’s focus on robotic vessels in NAVPLAN 2024,' the letter states. 'Part of the low-end of the mix is the set of autonomous and attritable capabilities being accelerated to meet INDOPACOM needs. These massed effects, however, do not solve the range of needs desired by the combatant commanders.' Reed and Wicker urge the Navy to 'repurpose' LUSV’s funding to support 'MUSV, procuring additional vessels in FY 2025 and FY 2026 to host already procured payloads, and creating a path to achieve a program of record in FY 2027 for the MUSV.' The letter is the latest bump in the road for the US Navy’s efforts to develop what it calls a future hybrid fleet, featuring both manned and unmanned warships. Programmatically, lawmakers have been skeptical of LUSV since its inception and have pressed Navy officials to explain with clarity how unmanned vessels fit into the service’s broader concepts of operation. MUSV, as evidenced in Reed and Wicker’s letter, has received a slightly better audience on Capitol Hill following successful operations in the Indo-Pacific using vessels often referred to as the 'Ghost Fleet.' 'The Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel should fill important gaps with mature technologies, validated mission needs, and producibility to deliver on expedited timelines' the senators wrote. 'In all, more than 267,000 total miles have been steamed with 70 percent in autonomous mode, proving out reliability of the hull, mechanical and electrical equipment as well as demonstrating the ability to carry several mission payloads.' Long-term changes the Navy makes to either program will likely not be seen by the public until next year when it is expected to unveil its FY26 budget request.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/exclusive-top-2-senators-urge-navy-to-change-course-on-large-usv-program/	2024-12-02T11:28:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Mariner-Side-View-scaled-e1661283313758.jpg
Why adding the Osprey to the Atlantic Naval Air Force matters	A CMV-22B Osprey, assigned to the 'Mighty Bison' of Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron (VRM) 40, approaches the flight deck of the world's largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), Sept. 19, 2024. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Maxwell Orlosky) This is the latest in a series of regular columns by Robbin Laird, where he will tackle current defense issues through the lens of more than 45 years of defense expertise in both the US and abroad. The goal of these columns: to look back at how questions and perspectives of the past should inform decisions being made today. Last month, I had the chance to visit Norfolk Naval Station to meet with Rear Adm. Doug 'V8' Verissimo and discuss with him how the first squadron of CMV-22Bs stationed at Norfolk plays into the evolution of Atlantic fleet, which now includes the Ford carrier. Both the CMV-22B and the USS Gerald R. Ford bring new capabilities to naval operations in the Atlantic region, which means a new challenge for Verissimo’s Naval Air Force Atlantic, the aviation Type Commander for the United States Naval aviation units operating primarily in the Atlantic under United States Fleet Forces Command. AIRLANT is responsible for the material readiness, administration, training, and inspection of units/squadrons under their command, and for providing operationally ready air squadrons and aircraft carriers to the fleet. At the time of our discussion, six CMV-22Bs had arrived; the expectation, dependent on final funding, is for 12-15 Ospreys for the squadron to be stationed as part of AIRLANT. One top-level takeaway is how the CMV-22B provides significant help with the challenge of contested logistics — a challenge that is only going to get worse with the Navy focused on distributed operations. Being able to hop from carrier to carrier will be key for the Navy under this concept. Take weapons transport, for example. The admiral underscored that 'the future will likely bring smaller, more agile weapons to complement the heavier more difficult weapons to transport like TLAMs.' He then argued that this shift to a different weapons stockpile would augment the utility of the CMV-22B supporting weapons re-supply in a contested combat environment. But Verissimo also noted that the CMV-22B is also going to be a vital capability for his command in an area that is logistics-related: a medical emergency. He put it this way: 'If I have a medical emergency, I'm not trapping and catapulting the human body that's already injured. I can softly land and softly take off so I can take care of my people in a medical emergency.' There are specific benefits when the CMV-22B is combined with the Ford. The island on the Ford has been moved towards the end of the deck, freeing up space to which an Osprey can move when it lands for offloading of weapons or supplies, so it doesn’t block the EMALS catapults — meaning a resupply can happen even as combat aircraft are being deployed. And there is a fuel capability in that area which can refuel the Osprey for its departure from the deck as well. Throughout much of our discussion, the admiral emphasized the evolution of the carrier for the new strategic situation and the flexibility it brings to the fight. The assets assigned to the Ford carrier will change as future payloads and platforms emerge. Verissimo also underscored the unique features of the Ford design, notably the significant enhanced power generation capabilities which enable the ability to use future payloads, weapons and platforms which leverage that enhanced electrical power generation capacity. He argued: 'The carrier and the carrier strike group are one of the only integrated forces which brings the core seven joint warfighting functions to the fight wherever it is operating. And with the Ford class, and its ability to generate electric power, it enhances those capabilities as well.' Prior to my meeting with the admiral, I met with Commander Mason Fox and his team. Fox is the Commander of Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron (VRM) 40, the 'Mighty Bison,' and I learned a quite interesting aspect of the challenge of standing up the first operational CMV-22B squadron on the East Coast. As they were getting ready to go from North Island (San Diego) to Norfolk on Dec. 6, 2023 with their first Ospreys, the DoD grounded the Osprey fleet DoD wide. Obviously, this was a shock but one which the squadron and its support community found a way to respond. According to Fox, the squadron had received their flight simulators so the pilots could train in the absence of flying real airplanes while waiting for the grounding to be lifted. And he indicated that the maintainers worked with prime manufacturer Bell in Fort Worth on training the maintainers. This meant that when the grounding was lifted in March 2024, the squadron was ready to re-commence their stand-up effort and the first squadron planes arrived the next month. 'We want to integrate as tightly as we can with the carriers and the air wings on the East Coast so that they fully understand our capabilities,' Fox added. They work with the Commander Air Group or CAG when onboard the carrier. What they have been focused on since the squadron has been activated is working with the carrier community on the logistics operations for East Coast based carriers, the Truman and the Ford. They worked with the Truman in June 2024 and the Ford in September 2024. They are planning to next continue their training with the Bush in the future. Fox concluded: 'Our version of the Osprey has a little bit more gas that we can carry, and we have a primary mission that is different than the Marine Corps and Air Force Ospreys. But I think that if we’re looking at a joint fight, we’re looking at the 450 plus Ospreys that are part of the program record. They will all be contributing to distributed maritime ops, because that’s the fight we are in.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/why-adding-the-osprey-to-the-atlantic-naval-air-force-matters/	2024-12-02T08:32:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8655887-scaled-e1732543950283.jpg
Rheinmetall closes Loc Performance acquisition, as it eyes US-market expansion	A conceptual design of Rheinmetall's Lynx XM30 for the US Army competition. (Rheinmetall artwork) WASHINGTON — Rheinmetall has officially acquired Michigan-based Loc Performance for just under $1 billion, a move company leaders say is central to plans for US footprint expansion. 'The purpose of the acquisition is to strengthen Rheinmetall's position in the US market, and we do that in many ways,' Matthew Warnick, American Rheinmetall Vehicles managing director, told Breaking Defense ahead of the closing. 'First and foremost, we pick up almost two million square feet of manufacturing space, but more importantly than that, is the… approximately 1,000 employees that we get to add to our bench that are used to manufacturing components and parts, all the way up to combat vehicles,' he added. With the $950 million purchase of Loc now closed, Rheinmetall plans to keep those 1,000 employees on staff and add additional jobs. Loc’s Chief Executive Officer Jason Atkinson noted that prior to the close, Loc already had about $3.6 billion worth of backlog work, including vehicle drivelines, suspensions, track systems, rubber products, armor products and fabricated structures. At the same time, the German-based Rheinmetall has sought to carve out a larger share of the US market is vying to win Army competitions like the coveted Bradley replacement program dubbed the XM30, the Common Tactical Truck, the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) Increment II and a revamped self-propelled howitzer initiative. For 2025, Warnick projects the new pairing will bring in close to $850 million in revenue and, depending on where things stand with new wins, that figure could hit 'north of' $1 billion by 2027. '[That target] is a mix of the existing backlog that we now create the opportunity for export coming out of Loc facilities, given the robust international footprint of Rheinmetall… and being able to provide material content into those programs, be it in the United Kingdom, be it in Australia, be it in Germany, but also winning new contracts as we go forward,' he added. Depending on just how much growth there is within the US market, Warnick said, will determine if the company can move ahead with plans to enlarge its production footprint and, potentially, build out a military vehicle center of excellence inside the United States.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rheinmetall-closes-loc-performance-acquisition-as-it-eyes-us-market-expansion/	2024-12-02T04:54:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/SHOT21a_v17Mud-scaled-e1684523151385.jpg
How BAE plans to keep its Eurofighter Typhoon UK final assembly line alive for GCAP	A UK Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon conducts a NATO air policing mission (UK MoD) BELFAST — When the emir of Qatar visits the UK this week, his trip will be watched closely in the city of Preston, located some 250 miles northwest of London. That’s because Preston is home to the Warton facility of BAE Systems, where final assembly of the Eurofighter Typhoon occurs. And the hope is that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani might use his trip to announce a new order of the fourth-generation jets, a Gulf lifeline that could help save the line from cooling for good. The Wharton facility is scheduled to produce two final Typhoon airframes by the end of 2025, the last from a previous order from Qatar for 24 jets. But after that, the future of the UK-made Typhoon is unclear. A spokesperson for BAE Systems was adamant that the British defense giant has no plans to shutter the Wharton facility, saying ''There is absolutely no suggestion of this' and pointing to potential international orders. Analysts and BAE executives say Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are all viable options for future orders. But those 'what ifs' appear to be little comfort to Steve McGuinness, a key union figure who kicked off something of a firestorm in England with a letter to lawmakers imploring the British government to invest in the Warton line — not just for the Typhoon program's own future, but for the future of British advanced fighter production. 'We have serious concerns that without a domestic order for Typhoon there will be no GCAP [Global Combat Air Programme] due to the loss of the skills necessary to build and fly aircraft,' wrote McGuinness, an aerospace and defense executive council member at the Unite trade union. BAE can keep at least some work at the line going with research and development efforts for future projects, and may redeploy staff currently working at the Warton plant across other parts of the Typhoon business and separate air combat projects run by the company. But in the end, the best way to keep the Typhoon line up and running, and its workforce employed in the lead up to GCAP, is to sell more Typhoons. And the jet is flying against significant headwinds. 'The world is moving to new generations,' said JJ Gertler, senior analyst at the Teal Group. 'The market for Typhoon in recent years has been for countries acquiring them more for diplomatic purposes than performance criteria.' Following the letter from McGuiness, the Spectator publication, a British conservative leaning publication, ran a piece entitled 'The sad death of the Eurofighter Typhoon.' It turned the letter into headline news. 'I think if you were the leadership of BAE Systems you probably wouldn't have looked favorably on that report coming out from the Unions,' Gary Waterfall, a former UK Royal Air Force air vice-marshal, told Breaking Defense. 'It's a bit prejudging,' on production prospects. 'There remains great interest in Typhoon and we are currently pursuing a number of orders in the Middle East and Europe, in addition to further orders from our European Eurofighter partners – as well publicised in recent press reporting,' the BAE response adds. 'Further orders will extend production beyond the latter part of this decade.' Options for further sales are limited, according to analysts, as the world is largely turning towards more advanced systems than the '4.5 generation' Typhoon. 'A higher degree of stealth has become the cost of entry into almost any fighter market, and you see systems like F-35 supplanting high-end fighters in many cases,' said Gertler. 'For some of the missions remaining to Typhoon, like air policing, less complicated and expensive systems can do the same job at a lower acquisition and operating cost.' The Typhoon is produced by four partner European nations: the UK (BAE), Germany (Airbus), Italy (Leonardo) and Spain (Airbus). Each has its own final assembly line, which puts the last touches on planes destined for their own militaries or for international customers. Whichever manufacturer is the lead campaigner for an export sale is generally awarded final assembly rights; The UK is the lead Eurofighter export nation for campaigns related to Qatar, Turkey, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The failure of the UK to commit to a new order of 24 Eurofighter Typhoons is chief among issues raised by McGuiness, alongside reports that London will replace older Eurofighter Typhoon Tranche 1 jets (due to be phased out in 2025) with additional orders of the Lockheed Martin F-35. London last procured the Typhoon in 2009, as part of a joint contract for 112 aircraft, alongside the Eurofighter partner nations. Under the Defence Command Paper of 2021, London cited a need to dispose of of aircraft with 'limited utility in the digital and future operating environment' [PDF] as motivation for axing the Tranche 1 jets. The letter from McGuiness warned against such the F-35 acquisition decision, defining it as 'a hammer blow to the British aircraft industry and potentially could end the design, manufacture and assembly of fast jets in this country, seriously damaging our sovereign capability.' A Royal Saudi Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon arrives at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, England, ahead of Exercise Cobra Warrior (UK Royal Air Force) Despite a lack of domestic interest in more Typhoons and the F-35’s clean sweep of global competitions against Eurofighter in recent years, analysts said that BAE is not wrong in having reason for optimism, thanks to potential sales to the Middle East. Turkey has said it wants to acquire 40 Eurofighters. Recently Germany, which had been against the deal, offered a 'positive response,' to reaching an agreement, according to Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler. In January, Germany also lifted a block on selling to the Saudis, opening the way for a long-delayed second tranche aircraft order (adding to 72 in operation) to take shape. A firm agreement has still to be reached, but could be on the agenda when UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits the country next month as part of a Middle East trip that will also include travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 'The Turkey campaign is quite active, and the highest priority,' said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy firm. 'There’s a good chance it comes through. The same is true for the second Saudi tranche. But Britain is lucky in that its [Typhoon] production line is the most likely to survive the end of the decade,' of all four partner nation final assemblies. Similarly, it is 'not inconceivable' that across the partner nations, Typhoon production could stretch 'out to the early to mid' 2030s 'given some of the export campaigns that are ongoing,' added Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. Additionally, the UK has also invested £2.4 billion ($3 billion) in a capability development package for Typhoon, under which BAE has been contracted to deliver an advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar &#8211; European Common Radar System (ECRS) Mk 2. 'These upgrades are also designed to support technology and skills development in readiness for Tempest/GCAP, the next generation combat aircraft,' added the BAE Systems spokesperson. 'Under current plans, Typhoon will remain in service with the RAF until at least 2040 and we are committed to ensuring that this vital capability remains at the cutting-edge of UK and NATO combat air power until its retirement,' said a UK MoD spokesperson. 'Multi decade programmes like the one made at Warton exemplify the UK’s enduring commitment to supporting global defence and security and underpin development of deeper strategic international alliances for the UK,' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, a UK aerospace and defense trade body, wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. 'Our supply chains are resilient, but they are also suffering at the hands of a mixed signal from UK government.' A Global Combat Air Programme(GCAP) core vehicle concept on display at DSEI, London (Breaking Defense) The other reason for optimism at Warton is the importance of GCAP, not just for BAE but for the United Kingdom as a geopolitical calling card. The next-gen program is tied up with Italy and Japan, and, should its Franco-German-Spanish FCAS/SCAF rival fall behind, it could emerge as the non-F-35 jet of choice for the Western world. Because of GCAP’s importance, there will likely be some production that goes on at Warton even if the Eurofighter falls off. 'When it comes to a bridge between generations, design work is generally more important than production work. This is why the issue of Eurofighter upgrades is [of] equal or greater importance than the survival of the production line,' Aboulafia said. 'Will there have to be some kind of bridge to GCAP? That looks likely. But particularly with the current defense austerity posture in the UK, that bridge does not look very much like a Eurofighter,' Gertler added. Barrie suggested that Typhoon experimentation with Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP’s), UK terminology for Collaborative Combat Aircraft, could be developed near term. 'There's obviously ambition to bring ACPs in, in advance of GCAP by quite some time, arguably, by about a decade, really. So you can say there's going to have to be some tech and R&amp;D around integrating … ACP capabilities with Typhoon,' he said. The RAF is on course to receive a first 'operationally useful' ACP 'before the end of the financial year,' said Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, RAF Chief of the Air Staff, earlier this month. The UK has not said which ACP it has selected specifically, but it will be a Tier 1 or disposable type. London also expects to operate a 'suite' of ACPs by 2030, according to its ACP strategy. 'The sooner you can develop that capability and produce it, the better,' in terms of generating combat mass, Barrie said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/how-bae-plans-to-keep-its-eurofighter-typhoon-uk-final-assembly-line-alive-for-gcap/	2024-12-02T01:29:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Eurofighter-Typhoon-e1732642769504.jpg
Swedish Gripen jets don’t ‘make sense’ for Ukraine yet, Dutch defense chief says	Three Swedish Armed Forces Gripens participated in a long range, long duration Bomber Task Force mission over Sweden, May 20, 2020. (Courtesy photo by the Swedish Armed Forces) ATLANTA — While Sweden stands ready to send its Gripen fighters to Ukraine, the head of a key ally's military said that move 'doesn't make sense for me,' at least not yet. 'In the long term, yes, [but] I think we have to avoid [giving] too many systems to Ukraine, because they have a shortage of pilots,' Chief of Defence of the Netherlands Gen. Onno Eichelsheim told Breaking Defense. 'So you have to avoid that you have more systems than pilots. Somewhere in the balance, you have to look at what capabilities are needed at this moment.' In July the Netherlands, Denmark and the US announced they were in the process of donating F-16s from Dutch and Danish stocks to Ukraine. The US has flatly rejected calls to give current American systems, but agreed to allow other nations to provide their US-made jets. Eichelsheim said it's better to 'focus' on the capabilities the Ukrainians currently have. 'So get them ready on these aircrafts, and provide them with the weapons, the money, the logistics, the parts that are available around the world to get these aircraft up and running continuously.' The Dutch official's comments clarify remarks from Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson, who said last week that Stockholm was ready and willing to donate Gripens to Ukraine but had been advised not to. 'The donation of the Gripens is not in the hands of ourselves,' Jonson said, suggesting at the time that other actors in the international coalition dedicated to Ukraine's air force, predominantly Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States, wanted to make sure Ukraine is settled with the F-16 before introducing other complex technologies into the ecosystem. 'They have advised us to wait to donate the Gripen until it goes further with the F-16 as well,' Jonson said. Deliveries of the fourth-generation aircraft, dating back to July, represent a major potential uplift in capability for Ukraine, which has been largely relying on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion, though officials and experts have said it won’t be a silver bullet. Eichelsheim said Kyiv's armed forces have been 'successful in using the aircraft, and they are actually quite successful in maintaining them at this moment.' 'But we also see that they use a lot of spare parts, so we have to work on the spare parts element together with the nations to provide them with the right amount to keep the aircrafts up and running,' he said. Earlier this month Reuters reported the White House had lifted a de facto ban on American contractors working in Ukraine in a move that could give a boost to the complex maintenance of the F-16. In the meantime, Eichelsheim said Ukrainian pilots 'do quite well' with the F-16, 'perhaps even better than we anticipated. 'They learn very fast how to operate the aircraft and how to operate the new weapon systems that they are getting on the aircraft,' he added. 'So, and that's all I can say, actually, about it.' Tim Martin contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/swedish-fighters-dont-make-sense-for-ukraine-yet-dutch-defense-chief-says/	2024-11-27T11:31:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241127_DVIDS_gripens_fly_6216613-e1732712867452.jpg
US drone maker Shield AI moves into Indian defense market, joint venture with JSW Group	A civilian contractor embarked with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, lands a V-BAT drone aboard the USS Green Bay in the Philippine Sea, Feb. 2, 2023. (U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Andrew King) SYDNEY — The Indian defense market, not known for its historic openness to foreign investment, has gotten an injection of very fresh US defense technology from the AI and drone company, Shield AI. The pan-industrial Indian company, JSW Group, has formed a joint venture with the US firm and JSW plans to invest roughly $90 million in the next two years to build a plant, secure the intellectual property and train workers. The goal is to build V-BAT, Shield's vertical takeoff and landing drone, in India, as well as provide its support and maintenance. A press release from Shield AI notes that JSW's 'investment will enable JSW to establish a local supply chain and create an advanced facility in India for manufacturing, assembling and testing V-BAT aircraft.' The US Marines own and operate V-BAT. This deal appears to be in keeping with a larger Indian effort known as Atmanirbharta designed to encourage foreign companies to work in India, instead of the foreign companies designing, building and assembling weapons to be exported to India. That effort includes an investment fund to attract disrupters and smaller companies, the webpage of which has a link to the drone deal. 'Once reliant on foreign suppliers, India now places a high priority on self-reliant manufacturing to meet its security needs, reinforcing its vision to strengthen national resilience and reduce dependency on external sources,' an Oct. 24 press release by the Indian Ministry of Defense about Atmanirbharta notes. It says that India used to rely on foreign countries for much of its weapons, with '65-70% of defense equipment being imported. However, this landscape has dramatically shifted, with around 65% of defense equipment now manufactured within India.' It points out that '21% of this production comes from the private sector, bolstering India's journey toward self-reliance.' Shield's release claims that this deal will 'allow India to function as a global production hub for the San Diego-based firm 'to handle both domestic and international sales and maintenance. It also will, the companies say, 'reduce reliance on external sources and ensure consistent delivery to India’s Armed Forces.' This 'marks a significant step in boosting India’s defense capabilities by bringing in world-class UAS technology to the country,' the release claims. 'JSW recognizes the same thing Shield AI does: that Group 3 UAS drones like the V-BAT can accomplish the same missions as many helicopters and larger Group 5 UAS drones for a fraction of the price,' Brandon Tseng, Shield AI’s co-founder and a former Navy SEAL, said in the release. 'As the market shifts from expensive, exquisite aircraft to swarms of lower-cost, AI-piloted UAS drones, this collaboration builds upon Shield AI’s significant U.S. investments, enhances global distribution, and supports continued expansion of U.S. operations.' Shield AI's managing director for India, Sarjan Shah, said the deal with JSW Group 'has been crafted over a multi-year period to transform the depth, scale and scope of India’s indigenous capabilities in the field of military unmanned systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-drone-maker-shield-ai-moves-into-indian-defense-market-joint-venture-with-jsw-group/	2024-11-27T10:31:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/V-bat-scaled-e1697122824715.jpg
New tech, including drones carrying blood, help injured Israeli soldiers survive	A Thor drone used to drop a small box that contains blood packets that can be used in the field by the IDF. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) JERUSALEM — The Israel Defense Forces estimate they have saved 380 lives of soldiers in the last 14 months of war due to new technology and procedures used to evacuate casualties to hospitals and to treat them on the field, including using drones to ferry blood for infusion into combat zones. At a tour of the IDF's Medical Corps and Technological and Logistics Directorate on Monday, an IDF official showed data that reveals the military has managed to reduce by half the number of soldiers who die from their injuries. In the 2006 Lebanon war, the IDF found that this rate was 14.1 percent. That number dropped to 9.2 percent during the 2014 war, and now is 6.9 percent for the Gaza front and 7.1 percent for the Lebanon fronts. 'The average time for a soldier to receive medical treatment in the field is between zero to four minutes, over 90 percent of soldiers injured from close-quarters combat received treatment in the field, approximately 1,600 injured soldiers were evacuated via helicopters,' the IDF said in a written statement. The short time to receive treatment is due to the presence of what the IDF calls Advanced Life Support providers, meaning medics deployed at the company level, and having more combat soldiers trained as medics. If the wounds are serious enough, the injured are placed in armored personnel carriers or Humvees and evacuated, either to a helicopter landing zone where Israel’s unit 669 takes them to civilian hospitals, or they continue in vehicles. The evacuation process can take slightly more than an hour when moving wounded from Gaza, to up to 111 minutes from Lebanon, due to the topography. The IDF also has increased the number of patients who receive whole blood and plasma that is constituted from freeze-dried plasma. Both of these have replaced the use of crystalloids, which had been used to treat blood loss in the field. Freeze-dried plasma does not require cooling, whereas whole blood does; the IDF has found a way to bring both to the front via small coolers for blood packets. The IDF has also recently used Thor drones, large quadcopters, to drop blood encased in a cooled box. The payload can be dropped from around 450 feet to troops in the field. The payload, around the size of a shoe box, lands via a small parachute rather than a cushion because blood should not be disturbed too much when being transported, an IDF official explained. A Humvee outfitted by the IDF as an example of how wounded can be transported from the field in specially-outfitted vehicles with stretchers and medics on board, for faster evacuation. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) The use of coolers deployed to the front with combat soldiers to carry blood has not only helped treat patients but also solved the problem of supplying the soldiers with these necessities during long periods in the field. During some of the fighting, IDF units have been in combat for days or weeks, and the coolers can provide several days of cooling for the blood. The blood is warmed via a small device, and the freeze-dried plasma can be reconstituted using water, a process that takes several minutes. The deployment of new tourniquets and homostatic bandages, used to control bleeding in an area like the groin where one can’t tie off an arm or leg, have been found to be effective. All of this helps treat soldiers in what is usually called the 'golden hour' in trauma care as patients are moved toward a hospital. However, the deployment of more medics at the front and movement of paramedics and physicians into the field has also resulted in more harm to these trained personnel. The IDF said 58 of their medical personnel have been killed. That's about 7 percent of the 804 IDF service members killed in the fighting since Hamas launched its devastating Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza is reported to exceed 44,000 and more than 3,000 in Lebanon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/new-tech-including-drones-carrying-blood-help-injured-israeli-soldiers-survive/	2024-11-27T07:39:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_IDF_medical_drone_handout-e1732644659771.png

(Photo by Adam J. Dewey/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump announced late Tuesday night that he has selected John Phelan, a prominent financier and campaign donor, to become Secretary of the Navy. 'John will be a tremendous force for our Naval Servicemembers, and a steadfast leader in advancing my America First vision. He will put the business of the U.S. Navy above all else,' Trump wrote in a post on TruthSocial, the social media platform he started. Phelan is the co-founder and chairman of Rugger Management, a private investment firm based in Palm Beach, Fla. The Hill reported he is also a donor to the Trump campaign and GOP-aligned efforts. It was not immediately clear if Phelan has any background or experience in national security. Phelan is Trump's second major pick for a spot as top brass at the Pentagon. Earlier this month, he selected Pete Hegseth, a co-host of Fox News's 'Fox &amp; Friend Weekend' and a former infantry captain in the Army National Guard to serve as secretary of the defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/john-phelan-financier-and-gop-donor-tapped-to-be-next-navy-secretary/	2024-11-27T04:17:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/trump-ngaus-e1724704355499.jpg
Aussie navigation firm, MBDA team and test AUKUS’ new tech-sharing muscles	Demonstration of MBDA's NILEQ sensors and how they read terrain like a fingerprint scanner. (MBDA) SYDNEY — A collaborative effort between a small Australian navigation firm and European defense giant MBDA is among the first to test the new tripartite arms export control system from the start of a program, and initial reports are positive, according to the CEO of the Australian firm. Before the changes to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) policies and the arms export regimes of Britain and Australia, 'it would take six months to get a license approved to just share information,' Sydney-based Advanced Navigation CEO Chris Shaw said in an interview today with Breaking Defense. But since a revamping of the rules in August, at least the timeline for information sharing has been trimmed down to days or weeks, he said. 'Yeah, there's still controls that have to be taken to account, which is fine, but it's a lot more simple now for something like this,' Shaw said. The memorandum of understanding between the two companies limits the work to between the United Kingdom and Australia, the release says, so has yet to test US rules. The Australian defense minister, Richard Marles, has hailed the arms export reforms as a 'generational' change, and Australian officials have generally been eager to comply with American requirements as they amend Australia’s arms export system. The ITAR system, of course, is infamous for its often slow and complex processes, overseen by the US State Department’s Political-Military Bureau. Pillar II of the US-UK-Australia venture known as AUKUS — whose primary focus in Pillar I is helping Australia buy and build nuclear-powered attack submarines — is a more diffuse effort which covers the rapid development, testing and deployment of new technologies in the realms of autonomy, hypersonics, cyber, artificial intelligence, electronic warfare and underwater systems. Shaw said his company and MBDA have been in talks with Pillar II contact points in each government since the beginning of this effort, and the press release mentions Pillar II without offering specifics. The collaboration, announced Nov. 20, is meant to produce and test a system that can work on a medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone that uses a newly developed sensor set to provide jam-proof navigation, as well as autonomy. MBDA developed the NILEQ sensors, which function in ways similar to fingerprint scanners, reading the terrain over which they fly. The system includes a detailed database of the Earth's surface. The sensors note changes between the database and what it senses, allowing rapid change detection and providing information that could be used for targeting. 'MBDA are convinced it has lots of different applications, so then they've decided to partner with us to explore taking that core tech and us integrating it with our navigation technology, and then trying to build an end solution for use on drones,' Shaw said in the interview. 'That's not something they do, because typically they build end products, right?' RELATED: When facing electronic warfare in Ukraine, small drones' quantity is quality The Australian general manager for MBDA, Tom Tizard, said in the press release that their new technology 'seeks to address the enormous demand for resilient absolute positioning information that will complement the existing navigation systems of airborne platforms.' Russia has made the risks of GPS all too clear, causing advanced weapons that depend entirely on GPS to lose much of their potency when jammed. Tizard praised Advanced Navigation as 'an ideal Australian partner to help accelerate the technology towards market entry. Navigation technologies that are not simply accurate and precise, but also provide the ‘resilience’ against interference, is what propels this partnership.' If it all works as designed, Advanced Navigation said in a press release that it believes the system 'will enable airborne systems to navigate unlimited distances over land without relying on GPS, and is passive and resistant to interference.' The venture is moving along at a clip, with the new systems' first test flight possibly happening before the end of the year, Advanced Navigation's CEO said. The MBDA agreement comes after the company signed in early September what could be a landmark agreement with South Korea's Hanwha to supply an already-developed precision guidance systems to Hanwha worldwide. It could, Shaw said the day of the signing, lead to as much as a 400 percent increase in business for the Australian firm.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aussie-navigation-firm-mbda-team-and-test-aukus-new-tech-sharing-muscles/	2024-11-27T02:07:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-2-e1732632837127.jpeg
Commerce announces more semiconductor funding for military aircraft, commercial satellites	US President Joe Biden holds a semiconductor during his remarks before signing an Executive Order on the economy in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 24, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In an effort to bolster domestic manufacturing of chips for national security and the space industry, the Department of Commerce announced it is awarding BAE Systems Inc. and Rocket Lab a CHIPS Incentive Award worth up to a combined $59.4 million. The funding comes from the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act. BAE Systems Inc., the US subsidiary of British company BAE Systems, will receive $35.5 million in direct funding to build chips used for military jets and commercial satellites, according to a press release from the Department of Commerce. Rocket Lab, the parent company of space power provider SolAero Technologies Corp., will receive up to $23.9 million for space-grade solar cells — space devices used to convert light to electricity which help operate missile awareness systems and 'world-leading science missions,' per the Monday release. The award announcements come after BAE Systems Inc. received a preliminary agreement for the funding in December 2023 and Rocket Lab received a preliminary agreement this past June. 'From satellites in space to defense systems on the ground, our most advanced defense and commercial technology rely on mature-node and compound semiconductors to operate,' Laurie Locascio, under secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, said in the release. 'By finalizing these awards, we are strengthening America’s domestic semiconductor supply chain resilience and broadening our manufacturing capabilities.' The money awarded to BAE Systems Inc. is specifically going to BAE Systems Electronics, a unit within the company responsible for producing commercial and defense electronics for flight and engine control, electronic warfare, surveillance, geospatial intelligence and power and energy management. It will support the company’s microelectronics center in New Hampshire, which was founded by the Department of Defense last year. With this funding, the company will increase its production capacity fourfold for Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit chips which are used to operate military aircraft and commercial satellite systems, per the Department of Commerce. 'The investment will also cut the company’s modernization timeline in half, bolstering the facility’s ability to serve mission-critical defense programs,' the release added. Rocket Lab will use its funding to 'create a more robust and resilient supply' of space-grade solar cells. It is one of two companies in the US that specializes in producing these types of semiconductors. 'The Department’s investment will support the modernization and expansion of Rocket Lab’s facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which will increase the company's compound semiconductor production by 50% within the next three years — helping to meet the growing national security and commercial demand for these solar cells in the United States,' the release said. Intel Corporation, another chip building company, was also awarded $7.87 billion from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday. This is less than the $8.5 billion outlined in the preliminary agreement, which was announced in March. 'The award will directly support Intel’s expected U.S. investment of nearly $90 billion by the end of the decade, which is part of the company’s overall $100+ billion expansion plan,' Tuesday’s release said. These recent awards from the Department of Commerce appear to be a last-ditch effort to finalize investments under the Biden administration's CHIPS Act before president-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump has recently criticized the program over the last several weeks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/commerce-announces-more-semiconductor-funding-for-military-aircraft-commercial-satellites/	2024-11-26T13:21:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/211029_biden_semiconductor_GettyImages-1303925325-scaled-e1635522770760.jpg
Netanyahu announces move toward ceasefire in Lebanon, along with stark warning	Smoke billows above Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike on November 26, 2024, amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. (Photo by FADEL ITANI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Just hours after Israel launched a barrage of strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he will bring a 'ceasefire outline' for approval by his cabinet, paving the way for a major, if tenuous development after two months of heavy fighting. A Lebanese official reportedly said that Hezbollah, Israel's Iran-backed enemy in Lebanon, has agreed to such a proposal. 'The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon. We have an understanding with the United States,' Netanyahu said, according to a live Sky News translation of his address. 'We are maintaining our full liberty to take military operations if Hezbollah tries to attack us, it arms itself, rebuild infrastructure next to the borders — we will attack them. If they launch missiles, if they dig tunnels, we will attack.' The prime minister did not offer details about the ceasefire proposal, but previous reporting said discussions included a 60-day cessation of hostilities. Israeli troops would withdraw from South Lebanon, and Hezbollah troops would withdraw north of the Litani River, according to the Times of Israel. Additionally, the deal reportedly calls for implementation of 1701 United Nations Security Council Resolution, the deployment of Lebanese Armed Forces on the southern border alongside United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, UNIFIL. A US-led international committee is purportedly would monitor the execution of the ceasefire. At the Pentagon today, spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder also did not reveal the specifics of the deal, but said that as 'far as the ceasefire goes, we're, of course, strongly supportive of a ceasefire. 'We're consulting closely with our interagency partners in terms of what potential contributions the DOD can make,' he said. 'I don't have anything to announce from here, but we'll certainly keep you updated.' The announcement comes 57 days after the Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon and 415 days after Hezbollah joined what it called the 'Gaza support' front on Oct. 8, 2023, dragging Lebanon into the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The ceasefire does not apply to Gaza. Lebanese retired armed forces Gen. Wehbe Katicha said the monitoring by the US-led group would likely include land, sea and air borders in part to prevent arms transfers to Hezbollah. Maroun Hitti, also a retired brigadier general from the Lebanese Armed Forces, told Breaking Defense ahead of the announcement that he viewed the acceptance of a ceasefire as a defeat for Hezbollah. 'Hezbollah would have given up linking Lebanese front to Gaza support and the strategy of &#8216;unity of the fronts' would have disintegrated and been crushed forever,' he said. More broadly Ali Bakir, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, said a ceasefire could prompt existential questions about Hezbollah, especially after its leadership has been systematically devastated by Israeli operations. 'The key question is: What is the purpose of Hezbollah's arsenal if it can neither fight Israel nor protect Hezbollah, its leaders, the Shiite community, and Lebanon, as the party has claimed for over a decade?' Bakir asked.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/netanyahu-announces-move-toward-ceasefire-in-lebanon-along-with-stark-warning/	2024-11-26T11:00:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_israel_strike_beirut_GettyImages-2186324612-scaled-e1732647429461.jpg
Commerce taps Slingshot to create space tracking user website	Slingshot Aerospace operates a network of telescopes for keeping tabs on objects in low Earth orbit. (Slingshot) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department has awarded Slingshot Aerospace a $13.3 million contract to build a web portal to access to its nascent space tracking database — slotting into place the last piece of the puzzle that will allow the Pentagon to wean commercial and foreign satellite operators from the military's increasingly threat-oriented system for monitoring the heavens. The Colorado-based startup will develop the so-called 'presentation layer' user interface for Commerce's Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS), based on its 'Slingshot Beacon' space traffic management software, according to a company press release today. Slingshot's work, which includes a year-long development phase and four one-year options, will be supported by COMSPOC and T and T Consulting Services, the release added. 'Deploying the TraCSS user interface is the next major step in operationalizing U.S. civil space traffic coordination,' said Audrey Schaffer, Slingshot vice president of strategy and policy. TraCSS is being developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Space Commerce (OSC), which was directed to take over traffic coordination responsibilities from the Defense Department following the issuance of Space Policy Directive 3 (SPD-3) in 2018. The TraCSS.gov website is expected to be online and begin the transition of all commercial users from the US Space Command's Space-track.org in late 2025. Slingshot has been working with OSC almost from the get-go, as the office sought to build up expertise in using open-source data from commercial and non-military telescopes and radars for space situational awareness, including the ability to calculate the likelihood of potential on-orbit collisions and warn operators in advance. For example, the company was among several chosen for OSC's Consolidated Pathfinder project to gather data about objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) launched in January via contracts managed via NASA’s Global Data Marketplace. Likewise it was involved in an earlier data-gathering effort back in December 2022 was conducted jointly by OSC and the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/commerce-taps-slingshot-to-create-space-tracking-user-website/	2024-11-26T10:15:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Slingshot-Global-Sensor-Network-–-Varda-Sensor-Day.png
France takes aim at unmanned systems, taking lessons from Paris Olympics	French soldiers from the Operation Sentinelle present a high frequency jammer NEROD RF rifle during a press visit in Paris on July 17, 2024. (Photo by ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty Images) PARIS — 'Attacks using swarms of armed, unmanned air systems is no longer just science fiction.' That was the warning from Emmanuel Chiva, director of France’s defense procurement agency, at one of the nation’s largest defense expositions, Euronaval, hosted in Paris in October. Since Chiva’s remarks Ukraine says it has suffered a wave of drone attacks from Russia, and Israel is bracing for a potential third barrage of drones and missiles fired by Iran. Meanwhile sea-based unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have struck both commercial and naval ships in the Red Sea, and Kyiv has managed to strike significant blows against Russia’s Black Sea fleet using the same kind of nascent technology. As such, defense against unmanned aerial and maritime systems was a key focus of this year’s Euronaval, where officials discussed what Paris was doing about the threat and industry players offered up their defensive systems as potential solutions. 'So, we need to stay in the race and find an answer to these threats, and use the lessons learned in the Red and Black seas,' Chiva’s deputy, General Thierry Carlier, said during the show. RELATED: Nets, jamming and &#8216;cyber scalpels': Pentagon weighs homeland counter-drone tech in mountain exercises In France’s 2024-30 Military Program Law, €5 billion ($5.3 billion) has been earmarked for ground-to-air defense, which includes counter-UAS equipment. In 2024, because of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, the anti-drone mission just during the competition weeks was expected to 'amount to 20,000 hours of surveillance, 10 times more than for the 2023 Rugby World Cup,' General Stéphane Mille, commander of the Air and Space Force, said in an interview prior to the event. According to a National Assembly report, 355 unauthorized drones were detected during the Games — largely flown by amateurs unaware of legislation — and 81 arrests were made. As the threat has grown, so has the investment of firms worldwide, including in France, to counter them. That requires the complex process of spotting the threat, classifying it and then passing that information along — in near-real time — to other systems that can do something about it. Erik Van Kimmenaede, Thales marketing director for surface radar, told journalists during a pre-Euronaval briefing that 'all this needs to be automated to act fast.' There’s also the question of cost-per-kill. There’s little point in using a million-dollar missile to take out a drone that cost just a few hundred dollars. Thales has developed the E-Trap to neutralize these Class 1 (micro, mini or small) drones, which had its first public outing at the Euronaval show although it was discreetly deployed during the Olympic Games, according to the company. Developed with the support of France’s procurement arm, DGA, Thales says E-Trap is a 360° high-power microwave antenna that emits a very brief but very powerful electromagnetic pulse meant to destroy the electronic components necessary to make a drone function. It is effective against a single UAV/USV or a swarm of them, the company says. Elsewhere, Safran Electronics &amp; Defense has teamed with the French company Hologarde to develop its Skyjacker counter-drone solution. That one was also used to protect the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The system, which the companies say is effective at ranges up to six miles spoofs the drone, altering its trajectory by replacing the satellite navigation signals it uses to guide it towards its target with different ones. According to Thales, 'Skyjacker can efficiently defeat isolated drones and drone swarms in land and naval environments.' Chiva told a National Assembly defense committee on Oct. 23 that 'at least three' of France’s FREMM frigates will be equipped with the Skyjacker system. He also mentioned that 'at sea (…) we can project a great quantity of metal into the air to neutralize these threats, notably when confronted by swarms. An anti-drone task force was set up in the light of events in the Red Sea. It studied, for example, the use of the 76mm munitions from the (Oto-Melara) 76mm gun to neutralize drone threats.' At Euronaval, MC2 technologies, a smaller business that specializes in micro and nanotechnologies, was also showing some of its counter-UAS systems, including the Nerod, a jammer gun designed to disrupt and neutralize communications between micro and/or mini—drones and their controllers. The company says 80 of these guns have already been delivered to French armed forces and police, and some 500 others have gone 'numerous clients abroad in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East,' including Luxembourg, Côte d’Ivoire and Japan. The Air and Space Force said one of their snipers used the Nerod from a Fennec helicopter in June during the 80th D-Day celebrations in Normandy to take out a drone that was flying too close to the official convoy, which included French President Emmanuel Macron. MC2 Technolgoies has also delivered its Neptune and Majes counter-drone systems (which work by jamming) to the French Navy which put them to good effect last week to neutralize a UAV, according to the company’s LinkedIn page.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/france-takes-aim-at-unmanned-systems-taking-lessons-from-paris-olympics/	2024-11-26T09:11:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_jammer_gun_france_GettyImages-2161802691-scaled-e1732640927853.jpg
Embraer targets prime status in US defense market	Embraer showed off its C-390 Millennium carrier during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow. Embraer signed a contract with the Netherlands and Austria for a combined order of the C-390 during the show. (Tim Martin/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Brazilian aerospace firm Embraer has been present in the American defense market for over a decade, with its commercial arm operating in the states even longer. But the company is now seeking to expand its US reach by chasing the coveted status of being a major prime contractor for the Pentagon — and to do so, 'all avenues' are at the firm’s disposal, including merger and acquisitions activity, executives recently told Breaking Defense. The core of Embraer's plans for penetrating the US market, according to Embraer Defense CEO Bosco da Costa Jr, are its two flagship products: the A-29 Super Tucano prop plane, and especially the firm's C-390 tactical airlifter. 'The main interest of Embraer Defense &amp; Security is to expand its presence here in the US using this platform,' da Costa said of the C-390, known as the 'Millennium,' in an October interview. The C-390 has enjoyed a string of recent successes on the international circuit, sometimes besting competitors like Lockheed Martin’s C-130, as da Costa noted that Embraer recently 'defined a strategy to turn Embraer Defense &amp; Security into an international player.' On the US side, da Costa emphasized that the Millennium is already compliant with Buy American Act requirements, pointing to customers like the Air Force or Marine Corps that the company would pitch the aircraft to. Embraer could even put forward the C-390 for any Pentagon buyers as a prime supplier. And it may have to, now that a partnership with L3Harris has fallen through for an 'agile tanker' aimed at the US Air Force, whose own air refueling plans are somewhat in flux. According to Embraer Defense &amp; Security Chief Commercial Officer Frederico Lemos, the company believes there could be 'space' for the C-390 in the Air Force’s tentative plans for a limited tranche of procurement, known as the KC-135 Tanker Recapitalization program. Additionally, Lemos said Embraer is looking ahead to a future tanker known as the Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS) and is responding to requests for information put out by the Air Force on the topic. The Millennium 'can play a very important role to address the requirements and the speed that we understand is needed to address the challenges in the Pacific,' Lemos said. And to potentially sweeten the deal, Embraer is evaluating whether to open a final assembly line in the US for the C-390 like it operates for the A-29, da Costa said. (In partnership with Sierra Nevada Corporation, Embraer manufactures its A-29 Super Tucano in Jacksonville, Fla., for Foreign Military Sales cases, but a dearth of sales have forced the company to stare down a potential production gap.) The C-390 is also by no means the only way the company hopes to grow its US footprint, with da Costa raising the prospect of new partnerships and mergers and acquisitions that could benefit the Millennium, as well as the entire company. 'We are evaluating all the avenues in order to allow us to be here as a strategic player for the US government,' he said. 'I think what we are looking [at are] possibilities that will add value to our business, that will add new capabilities, new systems, new technologies.' Making moves in the US market isn’t limited to Embraer’s defense business either. Instead, da Costa framed it as an all-hands-on deck strategy. 'This strategy to become a supplier of the US government is not a project that I have created inside of my business unit only. It is a &#8216;One Embraer' approach,' he said. 'This is not a simple project inside of the defense business unit. It is a very high-level project inside of Embraer and is a strategic project for us in the coming years.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/embraer-targets-prime-status-in-us-defense-market/	2024-11-26T06:53:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
Israel to buy new Corvettes, ‘hundreds’ of JLTVs	Driving through off-road obstacles showcases the Joint Light Tactical Vehicles’ capabilities to maneuver over uneven surfaces at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, Aug. 17, 2022. (Spc. Brittney Joy/US Army) JERSUALEM — The Israeli Ministry of Defense has approved a major new procurement deal to acquire five new corvettes for the Israeli navy and 'hundreds' of new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles for the ground forces. Israel has not specified how much each deal is worth, but in a statement described the two packages as a 'multi-billion Shekel' expenditure. The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 has led to the fast-tracking of a number of procurement deals, but this most recent announcement is the first to come from the Nagel Committee, a commission stood up in August. Chaired by Prof. Jacob Nagel, the commission was established by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the goal of 'formulating recommendations on the force building needs and the security budget in the coming decade.' The Israel Military Procurement Ministerial Committee approved the two acquisitions. They will now be submitted to the Knesset’s Joint Committee for the Defense Budget; however, the government did not give a timeline for when the Knesset submission and subsequent vote will happen The new 'next generation' advanced missile ships will be built by Israel Shipyards, and dubbed the Reshef-class, named after one of the older Sa’ar 4 class ships that have since been retired. The new Reshef-class frigates will replace the Sa’ar 4.5-class missile boats which Israel has used since the 1980s. These eight ships, which were launched between 1981 to 2003, are set to be decommissioned. Plans for the new Reshef class ships go back several years. Naval News reported in July 2023 that the ships will include a main gun at the bow, as well as the new C-Dome air defense system, which is the naval version of Iron Dome. The Israeli navy has undergone a major expansion in the last decade, with four new Sa’ar 6 naval ships that began to be commissioned in 2022, as well as new submarines. The Israeli navy currently has four active Sa’ar 6 ships, which first saw action in the recent war against Hamas in Gaza. It also has three Sa’ar 5 corvettes as well as eight of the Sa’ar 4.5. Meanwhile, the IDF held a naming ceremony for its sixth submarine in Germany on Nov. 12. The Israeli navy was also bolstered by two new landing craft that began arriving in 2023. The overall cost of the five ships was not revealed. However, the Sa’ar 6 cost more than $400 million each. Israel Shipyards built the original Reshef class Sa’ar 4 back in the 1960s. The company describes itself as the 'first in the Western world to design and build a fast-attack missile boat. … At that time, it was a new concept to use relatively small, fast missile-equipped craft to meet threats in the naval arena.' The Shipyards currently offer a 72 meter and 80 meter version of the Sa’ar series of ships, which they call Sa’ar -72 and Sa’ar-80 respectively. A report in 2022 said the Sa’ar 80 would be the export version of the new Reshef class; the firm that year said that 'The S80 will be the flagship of the Israel Shipyards for the next decades and she will serve the Israeli Navy and many other navies around the world.' In addition to the ships, Israel is procuring hundreds of new JLTVs. Oshkosh is the current procurer on the JLTV, but AM General in 2023 won the right to produce the US Army's next-generation of vehicles. Which company's version Israeli would receive could depend on when an order is officially placed. 'These armored combat mobility vehicles will be supplied to the IDF's maneuvering forces in the coming years,' the Defense Ministry noted in a post on social media. The vehicles, which first entered service in the US in 2019, will bolster Israel’s ground forces by giving new options in place of aging Humvees, which have been used widely in the 2024 war. In December 2023 Oshkosh Defense said it would fulfill two Israeli orders for a total of seventy-five of the 4X4 JLTVs. In 2020 Rafael Advanced Defense Systems showcased its Spike LR on a JLTV in Slovenia and Elbit has equipped weapon stations on JLTVs for Montenegro. The CH-53K which Israel is also acquiring can lift JLTVs, a point Lockheed Martin highlighted in a 2018 Hebrew statement about the heavy lifter.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-to-buy-new-corvettes-hundreds-of-jltvs/	2024-11-25T13:30:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/7376919-scaled-e1663702547702.jpg
Navy asking Congress for $5.7B in emergency submarine funding	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (US Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — The Office of Management and Budget today delivered a request to Congress for approximately $5.7 billion in emergency funding to account for unexpected 'shortfalls' in the Navy's Virginia-class fast attack submarine program, according to a senior Navy official. The emergency funding request was accompanied by a separate 'anomaly' that would permit the service to continue funding the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program in the event lawmakers pass a continuing resolution prior to when government funding is set to expire on Dec. 20. (Anomaly is the term the Defense Department uses when it seeks permission from Congress to spend money outside the traditional constraints of a continuing resolution.) 'Our Virginia-class fast attack submarine program is not where it needs to be right now. The program and the shipyards are not producing submarines at the rate that our national security strategy and the national defense strategy require,' the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. The Navy's stated goal for its submarine programs is the so-called '2+1' cadence, which refers to two Virginia-class subs and one Columbia-class submarine built per year. The service's historical record for Virginia-class submarines is closer to 1.2 to 1.3 boats per year. The official said roughly $2 billion would go towards addressing funding 'shortfalls' for the two fiscal 2024 Virginia-class submarines and $1.5 billion would go towards a similar anticipated shortfall for the one Virginia-class boat in the FY-25 budget. The rest of the funding would be split between submarine prime contractors General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII's Newport News Shipbuilding for increased wages and 'other productivity enhancements,' the official said. Both General Dynamics and HII in their most recent earnings calls have expressed concerns about the state of the post-COVID supply chain as well as the financial pain it has put on them. While speaking to reporters, the senior Navy official said the service has had numerous conversations with those companies and sees the emergency funding as a way to address the issues raised during those talks. RELATED: GD chief says Navy's 1 sub buy won't impact company short term, but out years less certain 'The phasing of these investments is focused on improving shipbuilder capability, capacity and efficiency and thereby reducing submarine construction delays and hope and ultimately controlling costs of future submarines,' the official said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-asking-congress-for-5-7b-in-emergency-submarine-funding/	2024-11-25T12:00:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8630521-e1732050099734.jpg
‘Everybody’s going to have to figure this out’: Army, Air Force debate base defense amid new threats	A U.S. Army MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system is fired for a coastal air defense event during Balikatan 23 at the Naval Education, Training and Doctrine Command, Philippines (Photo: US Marine Corps) WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump’s new defense secretary takes the reins of the Pentagon next year, they may quickly be faced with an internal debate to settle: whether the Army should continue with its traditional role of providing defenses for air bases, or whether the Air Force steps up to the task on its own. At the core of the issue is not only the capabilities brought to the fight by each service, but how they will be funded. The Army has traditionally been charged with defending air bases, which is part of the reason why systems like Patriot and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) reside under the service's control. But tepid investment during the Global War on Terror years, alongside the proliferation of missile threats from China and Russia, has led Air Force officials to begin openly grumbling that they feel the Army can't, or won't, make air base defense a priority — and that a change may be due. Recent comments from Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall seemed to bring the issue to a head, after he reportedly suggested his service could take over the air base defense mission from the Army in its entirety. Of course, if that happens, Air Force advocates would likely want to see more dollars distributed to the service, whether they come out of the Army's coffers or elsewhere. Asked about the ongoing discussion on Nov. 20, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said he recently met with his Air Force counterpart, Gen. David Allvin, to help chart a way forward. But George made it clear that in his mind, protection responsibilities have to fall on the entire joint force going forward. 'I do believe that every formation that’s out there — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines — you're going to have to protect yourself against long-range fires. You're going to have to protect yourself against drones. Everybody's going to have to figure this out,' he said at the National Security Innovation Forum event in Washington. George's comments seem to fall in line with a growing consensus that having one service responsible for base defense writ large isn't going to work in a modern era filled with a variety of threats. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says George's point that every service will need to have some internal base defense capability is 'reflecting reality' that 'all services are gonna have to get into air defense at some kind for the new threat environment,' not just for missiles but for drones as well. 'People keep saying, &#8216;Why isn’t the Army defending our air bases?' And the answer is, there is nowhere near enough missile defense capacity for everything we need to defend. That is true of air bases, and true of lots of other kinds of bases, it's true in Ukraine, in Israel — it's not just the Air Force assets that need tons more help, it's everything,' Karako said. He pointed out that the Marines are going out and trying to buy their own Iron Dome-like system to counter rockets and small drones, and that while there is a benefit in having a specialist branch of the Army that just does air defense, there will never be enough people in that unit to cover all the needs. 'Does the Air Force have a point that there is utility in specialization? Sure. But we are where we are, we got where we are today as a joint force and we’re gonna have to deal with it as a joint force,' Karako said. Services are also trying to shift tactics as the threat from adversaries like China grows, with the Air Force adopting a new, dispersed method of operations known as agile combat employment (ACE). The ACE concept is a necessary, but not sufficient, approach for protecting troops and assets; even with the concept, Air Force officials have become worried that air bases in the Indo-Pacific are still vulnerable against Beijing’s burgeoning missile arsenal and other budding weapons. Higher-end systems like Patriot or Aegis cruisers are placed where joint task force commanders think critical defensive capabilities are needed, and air bases have generally been protected as a result, Lt. Gen. David Harris, deputy chief of staff of Air Force futures, said in an interview with Breaking Defense at the Pentagon. 'But there could be a point in time in the future where the critical asset list or the defended asset list, there's other things in the region that might be more important than our air bases,' Harris continued. 'So this is where things are split.' Harris noted it's critical for disparate systems fielded by the services to connect into a common architecture, using an example where data can be passed from an Army theater defense system to a local air base. Echoing comments from other officials, Harris also said installations might need to operate their own systems to defend themselves from threats like small to mid-size drones, or 'maybe' even cruise missiles. Depending on the environment — with Harris using the example of struggles to combat small drones flying over bases on US soil — that could range from more limited defenses to a 'full package' that could take out threats spanning drones to ballistic missiles. 'So there's an aspect of this base defense that I think as an Air Force that we need to be thinking about next. Because if we're starting to march our way forward, part of our survivability as we go into a higher threat intensity, that's going to start to matter more,' Harris said. George, for his part, said he’d like to see more dollars put toward the base defense mission and for development efforts to move more quickly. 'I think we need to spend more [and move] faster on these problems and have the flexibility to get out there and innovate,' he said. 'So I think everybody's going to have to figure this out, and we're going to figure this out with the Air Force.'

Saudi Arabia reveals strides in local defense production as it races towards ambitious 2030 goal	A Royal Saudi Air Force pilot poses in front of an aircraft during the Athens Flying Show in Tanagra, Greece, on September 14, 2024. (Photo by Giorgos Arapekos/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently revealed significant strides in its quest to localize defense production, reaching nearly 20 percent localization by the end of 2023. That's up from just 4 percent in 2018 as the Kingdom pursues its ambitious goal of 50 percent by 2030. Saudia Arabia's General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI) 'issued many policies and legislation that regulate and stimulate the sector and enhance the competitiveness of the local product, which raised the localization rate from 4 percent in 2018 to 19.35 percent at the end of last year of military spending,' GAMI head Ahmad Abdulaziz Al-Ohali said Thursday during a dialogue session at the Local Content Forum. Al-Ohali added that the number of authorized and licensed facilities in the military industries sector has increased from five facilities in 2019 to 296 facilities by the third quarter of 2024. 'The Authority [GAMI] worked to sign more than 53 industrial cooperation programs worth approximately 35 billion riyals [$9.32 billion] with local and international companies, including approximately 13 billion riyals [$3.46 billion] purchase orders for local companies,' he said. Saudi Arabia, historically one of the largest defense importers worldwide, is concentrating heavily on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 to localize 50 percent of defense production. And though the year-to-year rise doesn't appear to be steep enough for Saudi Arabia to reach that high mark in time, another key figure in Saudi Arabia's defense industry previously told Breaking Defense that the policies, investments, joint ventures and production lines the Kingdom has established should cause an exponential growth curve in the years ahead. 'We are extremely confident that by 2030 we will achieve the target of 50 percent localization in defense spending,' the then-CEO of Saudi Arabian Military Industries Walid Abdukhaled said in June 2023. A few months later, in February 2024, Al-Ohali echoed the sentiment, telling Breaking Defense he was 'really confident' Riyadh would hit its goal or go beyond it. In October of last year, GAMI launched an 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' section on its official website, with the goal of pointing international firms to areas of opportunity. The authority identified 'more than 70 opportunities in the supply chain,' Al-Ohali said then, worth up to $64 billion over the next decade. 'We contributed to supporting local manufacturers through several initiatives, such as: applying the zero added tax on locally manufactured military goods, and most importantly, framework agreements,' Al-Ohali said. The governor highlighted that GAMI has launched a unified platform for military industries, 'which represents a unified structure for all services provided to beneficiaries, and we were keen to automate all services and use the latest means of technology, data science and artificial intelligence.' On Wednesday, a joint venture between Saudi and Spanish defense firms, SAMINavantia, launched a Saudi-designed combat management system, the first such product developed by the company in the Kingdom and which the company said was 'part of SAMINavantia's contribution to localizing over 50 [percent] of military spending by 2030[.]'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/saudi-arabia-reveals-strides-in-local-defense-production-as-it-races-towards-ambitious-2030-goal/	2024-11-25T06:40:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241122_saudi_fighter_GettyImages-2171209221-scaled-e1732298993557.jpg
Norway asks US about maritime drone options as it ponders new, long-range capability	The HNoMS Roald Amundsen (F 311) sails in a fjord as part of Cold Response 16, March 1, 2016 at Namsos, Norway. (Official Marine Corps Photo by Gunnery Sgt. Bryson K. Jones/Released) BELFAST — Norway has embarked on studies to examine how it would introduce a new, long-range, aerial maritime surveillance drone into its forces in the high north and has asked the US for information about suitable American options, the Ministry of Defence said in a new statement. 'Norway is considering several types of drones, and it is too early to comment further on the type, number, or specific requirements for the acquisition beyond what is outlined in the adopted long-term plan,' Anne Marie Aanerud, state secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Defence, told Breaking Defense Thursday. 'As part of the ongoing studies we have requested additional information on relevant drones from the U.S. authorities,' she said. 'The response will be incorporated into the ongoing work on the drone acquisition.' Aanerud noted that a timeline for contract signing has has still to be decided, as military officials continue to work up a strategy to implement recommendations for the long-term defense plan. That defense plan, published in April, revealed Oslo's intention to procure the maritime surveillance drones, and Aanerud told Breaking Defense the ministry envisions platforms that are able to 'monitor large areas for extended periods of time, complementing the tools we already have.' The future drones are set to be based out of Andøya Air Station, northern Norway, 300 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle and previously home to Royal Norwegian Air Force P-3 Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA). Olso decided to reverse a decision to close the base in the aftermath of the Ukraine war and amid a renewed focus on bolstering defense capabilities to counter Russian aggression. Though Aanerud declined to say if any specific platforms are under consideration, and several international firms make drones that could fit the bill, the fact that US authorities had been contacted suggests that American systems are in the running. Northrop Grumman delivers the fourth MQ-4C Triton for long-range, persistent, maritime surveillance to the U.S. Navy for Initial Operational Capability. Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman. An executive at Northrop Grumman, for one, said the company's MQ-4C Triton, a pricey high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) system, was among them. The US Navy operates the Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) mainly to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and as a complement to Boeing P-8A MPA operations. Norway operates five of the P-8 crewed platforms. Doug Shaffer, vice president of autonomous intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting programs at Northrop Grumman, told Breaking Defense his firm has had 'extensive' written exchanges as well as face-to-face meetings with Norwegian officials about the aerospace giant's offerings. 'We've had all our engineers there, answering hundreds of questions,' he said, adding that an aircraft selection decision could come in the 'next few months.' Northrop says the Triton, which can fly above 50,000 feet, can cover some 4 million nautical miles with its sensor array in a 24-hour sortie — roughly equivalent to the size of China. But it is expensive. In July, Inside Defense reported that each newest version of Triton has an estimated price tag of $618 million though that figure was a result of a per-unit price jump in the US Navy program after the total acquisition was slashed. Shaffer argued the capabilities of a single airframe are worth the price tag over the drone's entire lifecycle. 'The largest cost is the operational sustainment over decades, and to do the same mission as a HALE platform, it takes three to five times more MALES,' he claimed, referring to medium-altitude, long-endurance drones. 'That calculus is what Norway is evaluating.' If that is a calculus Norway is doing, on the other end of the equation could be the much less expensive American-made MQ-9B SeaGuardian, a MALE variant of the MQ-9 Reaper produced by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) that can fly at 40,000 feet. The flyaway unit cost of a MQ-9B sits at approximately $38 million, excluding through life and sustainment costs, according to figures from Shephard Media, a British trade publication. GA-ASI has positioned the drone for sale up north, saying in company literature that 'with MQ-9B, the Nordic and Northern European allies now have a surveillance platform to choose that can perform all their key missions with low acquisition and operating costs.' A GA-ASI MQ-9B SeaGuardian demonstrates its maritime capabilities during European Maritime Demos (GA-ASI) C. Mark Brinkley, a spokesperson for GA-ASI, declined to comment on whether the SeaGuardian is in the race for Norway's next UAV, but did suggest it would be an effective high north asset. 'MQ-9B’s advanced sensors, data processing power, worldwide proliferated low-Earth orbit (pLEO) satellite communications link, and impressive endurance make Arctic awareness possible from anywhere in the world,' he said. 'Over the Arctic, MQ-9B can detect air, ground, surface, and subsurface targets of interest, including surveillance balloons, maritime vessels, and submarines, and then feed real-time intelligence to military and civil authorities around the world.' Brinkley also said that future upgrades of the aircraft, including detect and avoid technology integrated with Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) capability, Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) and air-to-air radar, 'will add to the ease of operating in the Arctic.' Specific to maritime missions the MQ-9B can also be equipped with a 360-degree maritime radar, fitted with an Automated Identification System (AIS), an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capability, featuring a sonobuoy monitoring and control system capable of dispensing up to 40 sonobuoys, noted Brinkley. A spokesperson for the US State Department, which plays a key role in negotiating foreign military sales, told Breaking Defense that the US has a 'close defense trade partnership with Norway that includes co-production of advanced systems like the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS. However, we have no comment on our specific cooperation in the long-range maritime UAV space and would refer you to the Government of Norway.' Generally speaking, Oslo has consistently stressed that multinational collaboration with allies will be a core element of the maritime surveillance drone acquisition, particularly in areas such as development, operations and training. In June, it committed to closer bilateral defense cooperation with Scandinavian counterpart Denmark, through a letter of intent, covering drones and air defense, among other items. Similarly, Copenhagen has committed to the acquisition of long-range drones to monitor the Arctic and North Atlantic. Additional funding for the effort was secured in January, as part of an initial cross party agreement, that falls under a new, national defense settlement, according to a Danish Ministry of Defence statement. But at a local level, the Norwegian drone effort has been hotly debated in recent months with critics, including senior defense officials, publicly warning against the procurement of large, long-range surveillance types at all. Writing in a Norwegian Armed Forces magazine, Rolf Folland, former Chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force and currently the Norwegian military representative to NATO, questioned the survivability of the US platforms, specifically citing shootdown incidents of both aircraft. Large drones 'with their low speed and large radar cross-section &#8230; can become relatively easy targets for an adversary that has modern anti-aircraft systems, and they are vulnerable to electronic countermeasures that can disrupt their communication and navigation systems,' stated Folland. Instead of Norway opting for such large, expensive platforms, he recommended looking into alternative ideas, specifically procurement of a stealth-designed drone or ordering additional satellites. 'Monitoring and situation overview from space can potentially be significantly better than from a drone,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/norway-asks-us-about-maritime-drone-options-as-it-ponders-new-long-range-capability/	2024-11-25T04:30:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_norway_fjords_2435876-scaled-e1732225784515.jpg
Russia ‘likely’ to transfer submarine tech to China, N. Korea: INDOPACOM Chief	This pool photograph distributed by Russian state-owned agency Sputnik shows Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shaking hands during a meeting in Beijing on October 18, 2023. (Sergei Guneyev/AFP via Getty Images) HALIFAX, CANADA — The growing ties between China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been the source of Western leaders' ire for several years, but seem to be reaching a new, critical level, where transfer of the highest level of military technologies between the countries, including key Russian submarine tech, may become routine. The head of US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, told an audience today that in exchange for North Korean troops and artillery, Moscow 'will likely' provide Pyongyang with missile and submarine technology. And in exchange for China helping to rebuild 'Russia’s war machine,' Paparo anticipates that Moscow will also be sharing submarine technology with Beijing, a move that has the 'potential of closing American undersea dominance to the PRC.' 'Where one is resource poor, the others fulfill those resources. Where one has operational needs, the others are fulfilling those needs,' Paparo told the audience at this weekend’s annual Halifax International Security Forum. That concerning relationship between those four governments was a major theme throughout the Canadian event, with widespread agreement that the Ukraine war has now breached the geopolitical walls between the European and Indo-Pacific theaters for good. 'Those who might believe that you can just isolate the [Russian-Ukraine] conflict or accommodate somehow with Russia, I believe that's wrong,' Germany's Minister of State Tobias Lindner told reporters today. 'If you're interested in security in the Indo-Pacific and all those issues you need to have a tough stance on Russia too.' RELATED: INDOPACOM’s Paparo acknowledges stockpile shortages may impact his readiness North Korea’s decision to send upwards of 10,000 military personnel and additional weapons to fight alongside Russia forces in Ukraine makes the case stronger, with Dutch Adm. Rob Bauer — chair of the NATO Military Committee — arguing here that it gives the DPRK a potential seat at the negotiation table in ceasefire negotiations, a new complicating factor in the 1,000 day war. 'Not only [do you] have to talk to Russia now, but you also have to deal with North Korea,' Bauer told an audience on Friday. 'The North Koreans get technology and weapons systems and ammunition from the Russians as well… This is connecting the world in a way that we didn't think was possible and it is connected to China.' While China is not directly sending Russia weapons, Bauer argued that its transfer of key components, like semiconductors and machine tools, is keeping Russia in the fight. 'Without China, Russia would not be able to continue the war,' Bauer added. (Iran has been sending Russia weapons too, including missiles and attack drones.) While Officials in Canada this weekend didn’t have a clear answer on just what to do about the growing ties between the four countries that they view as an existential threat, some advice and words of caution were offered up. 'The idea of driving wedges between these two,' Shearer said, 'is fanciful.' In order to help disrupt the growing strategic partnerships, Shearer said the Western-aligned nations must 'adjust our mindsets, shift our policies and boost our defense spending and become, frankly, more assertive.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/russia-likely-to-transfer-submarine-tech-to-china-n-korea-indopacom-chief/	2024-11-23T14:58:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/GettyImages-1730511257-scaled-e1714416144291.jpg

Canada, Australia jointly pledge $474M to research hypersonic missile defense tech	Bill Blair, Minister of Defense of Canada, speaks to the press after his arrival at NATO headquarters on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Omar Havana/Getty Images) HALIFAX, CANADA — Australia and Canada have inked a new agreement to jointly work on technology to counter the ever-growing threat of missiles, especially hypersonic weapons, Canada’s Minister of National Defence Bill Blair announced today. 'I'm very pleased to announce that Canada and Australia have today signed an agreement to work together on researching emerging missile threats,' Blair told an audience during the kickoff of the Halifax International Security Forum. 'We're going to focus on countering hypersonic weapon systems and under this new agreement… [we will be] very closely tied in all of our efforts collectively together.' In total, the duo plan to spend up to $474 million over the next five years developing a 'range of solutions,' he added. While Blair didn’t drill down into the specific capabilities on the development table, a subsequent press release noted that the Defence Research and Development Canada and the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group will work together researching the emerging missile threats, to develop detection, monitoring, targeting and counter-measure technologies. Defense and political leaders from around the globe are gathered in Nova Scotia this weekend for the annual Halifax International Security Forum, Canada's premiere defense event. Among the main themes: Discussing the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East, along with potential changes to NATO as president-elect Donald Trump prepares for his return to the White House. During Trump’s first turn in office, he publicly bashed NATO countries not meeting the 2 percent GDP defense spending goal — a mark Canada does not currently hit. RELATED: America needs to keep pushing Canada on defense spending Blair used his opening speech today to praise Canada’s close relationship with its neighbor to the south and vowed to eventually meet that threshold. 'We have always depended upon that relationship [with the US] with an unparalleled alliance, especially illustrated through NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command], which is our binational military command that keeps a vigilant eye on North American airspace,' Blair said. 'NORAD defends our countries against threats in the air domain, that's why we are working in partnership with the United States to invest quite significantly in order modernization, we're making a generational investment,' he later added. Taking the stage just after Blair, two US Senators — James Risch, R-Idaho and Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire — called on Canada to get to that 2 percent spending target as quickly as possible.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/canada-australia-jointly-pledge-474m-to-research-hypersonic-missile-defense-tech/	2024-11-22T13:01:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/GettyImages-2157414961-scaled-e1719856571160.jpg
‘Plug and Play’: Army’s Project Linchpin prepares to unveil open-source architecture for AI	Army Reserve Soldiers with the 75th U.S. Army Reserve Innovation Command’s Army Applications Group and Support Group Artificial Intelligence and Data Team participate in Code-A-Thon 24, Aug. 1, 2024, at Fort Liberty, North Carolina. (Photo by Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Chlosta / 75th US Army Reserve Innovation Command) WASHINGTON — The Army’s artificial intelligence accelerator, Project Linchpin, is working with open source software firm Red Hat to unveil an initial version of its AI development architecture as early as next week, product lead Bharat Patel said. The architecture, in essence, is a set of common technical standards — Application Programming Interfaces (API), data labeling protocols, and so on — to ensure that AIs built for the Army by different vendors are all compatible. 'We are defining some of these APIs and some of these architectures with Red Hat now, [with] an open source project being dropped end of November,' Patel told the Red Hat Government Symposium here on Tuesday. 'This is going to be one of our first attempts at a public-private partnership.' By creating a level playing field for competition among innovative companies of different sizes, this 'open architecture' should allow the Army to use whichever algorithms it likes best into its suite of AI software, fully confident the different products will work together, Patel and other officials explained in public comments and interviews with Breaking Defense. 'This space moves so fast that we can't build a strategy that relies on one company or two,' Patel told the conference. 'We actually need to work on the standards that allow us to create more of a competitive architecture that people just kind of plug and play. &#8230; We want to really get after some of the non-traditional small businesses.' The problem with tapping into this rapidly expanding and evolving ecosystem of innovators is that, frankly, it’s kind of chaotic. 'It’s like the Wild, Wild West when it comes to AI right now,' Patel told Breaking Defense. 'Project Linchpin’s main focus is to be able to standardize a lot of how we deliver AI.' That chaos isn’t just in the private sector: There are plenty of ad hoc, incompatible AI efforts within the military itself. 'One of the trends we’ve seen across the Army is data is in pretty tough shape,' said Col. Chris Anderson, the Army’s product manager for Intelligence Systems &amp; Analytics, who works closely with Patel. 'It’s spread out all over the place, [and] it’s not labeled.' Such disorganized data (the polite term is 'unstructured') is difficult to do even basic analysis on, let alone train an AI algorithm. RELATED: ‘Fight tonight’ vs ‘Getting it right’: CDAO’s Martell wants to build AI to last Even when data is labeled, Anderson told Breaking Defense, the labeling may be inconsistent, idiosyncratic, or otherwise unintelligence to any human or machine beside the original users. For example, early on in Project Linchpin, 'one of the pilots that we did was in response to a real-world need in CENTCOM,' he recounted. 'A unit approached us and said, &#8216;We really need to find this specific target.' And they had a tranche of data that they had labeled, [but] that the labeled data was not very good.' Project Linchpin and a contractor spent a lot of time and effort relabeling the unit’s data so they could train an AI model to analyze it. But when they provided the trained-up model to the unit, it didn’t work properly on their computers, Anderson said, because model had been trained on machines using one type of chip (GPUs, common in the AI world) but the unit's devices used a different kind (CPUs). To bring order to this chaos of incompatible systems, 'we want to partner with industry to help define these standards,' Patel emphasized. 'We don’t want to be the government and be like, ‘Here’re our standards, you must comply.’' So step one was figuring out a common ground that different companies and the Army procurement system could all live with. 'We’ve been working really closely with ASA(ALT) [the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology] on what are the standards we are going to implement within the pipeline and how does that feed into Army-level policy,' Anderson said. 'The [Linchpin] team, they’ve done 500 one-on-one sessions with industry partners — multiple hours [apiece] — and evaluated, I think, 300 responses from industry, and the majority of those were either small businesses or non-traditionals.' 'Really early on we learned, there’s no turnkey solution, there’s no one size fits all,' Anderson said. 'It’s changing every day. &#8230; We’ve got to be able to bring in third-party applications and services quickly, we’ve got to be able to offboard them quickly when something better comes along.' At Linchpin, 'they don’t want a closed ecosystem, they don’t want black box closed-source contributors,' said Michael Zizza, who handle the Army account at Red Hat. 'They need &#8230; interoperability.' Red Hat was well suited to help develop such an architecture, Zizza told Breaking Defense, because as a vendor of open-source software, 'the code is free,' and what you’re paying Red Hat for is tech support. It’s an experienced intermediary between the chaotic creativity of the software development world and the order required by large corporations and government agencies. Project Linchpin originally contracted with both Red Hat and consulting firm Booz Allen to 'flesh out' the guiding principles behind the architecture, Patel told Breaking Defense. (In software development jargon, the final version of those principles is Traceability, Observability, Orchestration, Replaceability and automated Consumption, TOORC). From there, Patel said, Linchpin worked through the Army Research laboratory to set up a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Red Hat, which the firm announced last month. 'We’re kind of in the early stages now,' Zizza said, 'but we’re looking at specific things like architecture diagrams [and] an open API specification.'

Sweden to fund Ukrainian domestic production of long-range missiles, drones	Rustem Umerov, (C-L) Minister of Defense of Ukraine, greets Pål Jonson (C-R), Minister of Defense of Sweden before the start of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting at the NATO Headquarters on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Omar Havana/Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — The Swedish government today announced it will provide 'substantial funding' for the mass production of long-range missiles and drones inside Ukraine, a major step as Stockholm seeks to bolster Kyiv’s defensive efforts. Dollars and timelines were not revealed during the announcement, made today by Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson as he hosted his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. But the move shows that Stockholm is dedicated to supporting Ukraine for the long-haul. 'This will be produced in Ukraine by the Ukrainian defense industry. It will be financed by Sweden. President [Vladimir] Zelenskyy has stated that there is an especially high demand for funding long-range weapons and long-range drones,' Jonson said at a press briefing Friday at Karlsberg Palace in Solna. 'Ukraine is Sweden's number one security priority,' Jonson stated. He later underlined that Ukraine has 'the full right' in accordance with international law to defend itself 'inside and outside' of its territory. As of Oct. 4, Sweden has donated military assistance worth approximately 48.4 billion Swedish krona ($4.37 billion), per a government fact sheet. Stockholm has previously pledged a commitment of 25 billion Swedish krona ($2.28 billion USD) for 2025 and the same amount for 2026, numbers the government here has said could go up if needed. 'We're glad that we can further develop both your capability to produce long-range missiles and also long-range strike approach,' Jonson said, addressing Umerov. RELATED: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing &#8216;window' to prepare for Russia According to Jonson, the two ministers on Thursday met representatives from the Swedish Defense Research Agency (FOI) and Sweden's procurement agency (FMV). And 'later today [Friday] we're going to be having discussions with several representatives of the Swedish Defense Industry.' A government spokesperson declined to give details on what kind of long-range missiles will be considered for this effort. Decisions will be made in consultation with Ukraine, as they have several different projects they are working on. The spokesperson also declined to further comment on which companies the ministers were meeting with. Saab, Sweden’s defense champion, gave no further clue. 'At this point it is too soon to speculate and we refer further questions about how Sweden might support Ukraine’s long range missile capability to the Swedish Government. Generally speaking, we are always ready for discussions with Sweden and our other customers on how we can support their needs with our knowledge and expertise,' Saab spokesperson Mattias Rådström wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. Sweden has previously donated an Erieye platform, Saab’s Airborne Early Warning and Control System to Ukraine. Ukrainian pilots also have been trained on Saab’s Gripen fighters, and while the government says it is ready to begin giving Ukraine those jets, Jonson indicated that they have not done so at the behest of other allies. 'The donation of the Gripens is not in the hands of ourselves,' Jonson said, with other actors in the Air Force Coalition, predominantly Denmark, Netherlands and the United States, wanting to make sure Ukraine is settled with the F-16 before introducing other complex technologies into the ecosystem. 'They have advised us to wait to donate the Gripen until it goes further with the F-16 as well,' Jonson said. 'So now our focus has been on delivering the Erieye platform, which is the command and control platform that [works with] the F-16.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/sweden-to-fund-ukrainian-domestic-production-of-long-range-missiles-drones/	2024-11-22T11:13:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/pal-jonson-umerov-scaled-e1732302009113.jpg
For air superiority, USAF must pursue effective, rather than ‘affordable,’ mass	An F-22 Raptor takes off for a training mission at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii.

Alexander Martinez/Released) Constrained for funds and facing rapidly improving potential adversaries, the US Air Force (USAF) is grappling with how to ensure control of the air in the 2030s. One proposal — leaning heavily on standoff forces to provide 'affordable' mass without traditional air superiority — has a problem: even with long-range kill chains, exquisite smart weapons, and low-cost swarms, no one has specifically described how such novel ideas would lead to victory. As the USAF considers difficult standoff versus stand-in decisions and what future control of the air might entail, the debate must return to a critical focus: how to produce effective mass. Arguments over whether air superiority is necessary overlook a critical point: In a hypothetical defense against an invading adversary, the USAF might win with standoff-centric theories of victory, if they solve the effective mass calculus. However, with air superiority, the odds of victory increase drastically. The terms 'stand-in' and 'standoff' forces are popular among USAF planners but do not exist in USAF or Department of Defense doctrine. Generally speaking — although there is some important nuance for stealth capabilities — stand-in forces achieve effective mass and strike within contested areas via organic firing methods; for example, F-15E Strike Eagles employing weapons on self-generated coordinates. Standoff forces employ long-range weapons from aircraft outside notional enemy engagement zones; for instance, a bomber launching a Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile reliant on more complicated kill chains. 'Effective mass' embraces Col. John Boyd’s dictum to operate 'at a faster tempo or rhythm' than its adversaries. Traditionally, effective mass in the USAF translates to air superiority, which theorists generally define as the air control necessary for freedom of maneuver in support of striking varying target sets. In the modern era, fighting for air superiority is fundamental to historical examples of victory: success is most likely when leaders prepare their forces for complex challenges in the name of soundly defeating an adversary. The connection between stand-in forces and effective mass is meaningful because, traditionally, the former enables the latter. Stand-in forces with air superiority provide control of the air, support to ground elements, and short kill chains against mobile and deceptive adversaries. If the USAF is to succeed in a major conflict, it must not mistake affordable mass for effective mass. Of course, affordable mass is good to have. But, a standoff-centric approach has five significant issues. First, a standoff-centric approach might play into adversary capabilities and potential plans, as an opponent must only dodge or defeat a finite number of cruise missiles and drones. A 'hellscape' might be an adversary-specific hedge, but how long could such efforts delay a dedicated air, ground, and sea invasion supported by a rolling barrage? It is easy to imagine that standoff weapons provide mass, but the bar for delivering effective mass against mobile targets within protected airspace is quite high. Without a viable stand-in partner, standoff tactics comply with adversary strategies to push US forces farther from the battlefield, forcing the Air Force to reconsider its approach to air superiority and the fundamentals of basing. We do not discount the difficulties of penetrating modern anti-access, area-denial systems or claim that standoff, drone, or denial-based efforts might not be effective in specific contexts. However, given the inherent difficulties of interwar decisions, have planners explored how many options an aggressing adversary would have against pulsed operations employing standoff-centric tactics? Second, if the USAF depends on standoff-centric tactics and abandons air superiority, it is taking an ambitious leap away from historical lessons learned. Drones and other novel capabilities add to the complexity of modern warfare, but they are not a replacement for the capabilities enjoyed by a stand-in force ensuring even limited control of the air over a battlefield. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven unmanned platforms are an intriguing option, but they have no history of battlefield success and are likely unavailable near-term. The USAF has attempted to start the transition to more unmanned platforms before, but seeking to define affordable mass in terms of lower risk is an inherent admission that stand-in benefits are still necessary. If the technology is not immediately available, the USAF cannot afford to gamble its entire future on it. Third, creating an effective deterrent, always a tenuous concept at best, is much more difficult when you’re relying primarily on stand-off systems. The uneven effects of standoff munitions in Israel and Ukraine underscore the reality that such tactics are enabling and not decisive. Additionally, the United States rarely, if ever, fights the war it expects under predictable circumstances. It is certainly possible that, for example, a war with China might break out under the assumptions inherent in making it the 'pacing threat,' but it is equally likely that a situation requiring immediate stand-in forces — whether it be a deeply buried strategic target or something akin to the defense of Israel — will arise. Fourth, a standoff-centered force reduces the political means available to leaders attempting to manage escalation. Designing a force capable of winning with the least risk is laudable, but significant wars rarely finish within the realm of their original ends, if those means were ever straightforward in the first place. The longer a conflict endures, the more likely the Air Force will run short of standoff weapons or face demands for results only stand-in forces can provide. Compromising on funding the latter in the short-term might have devastating consequences and reduce national leader decision space should they demand higher risks in exchange for better results, i.e., striking at the heart of the enemy. Finally, a force designed primarily to prevent losses will be brittle and unthreatening to anti-access and area-denial defenses, as stand-in effects are a critical part of attrition when fighting adversaries capable of producing overwhelming mass on their home turf. The key to countering such advantages is not outproducing adversaries — the US industrial base will not allow it in an interwar period — but lies in procuring survivable and lethal stand-in assets capable of effectively fighting attritional conflicts from vigorously defended positions. Such investments would make a traditional theory of victory viable: effective mass with increasing levels of control of the air via a combination of risk-acceptable stand-in and standoff forces prevents an adversary’s fait accompli and attrits enemy advantages in mass over time. This is how the USAF could realistically attack adversary advantages and prove via Lanchester-type calculations a viable theory of victory. The obvious counter to an appeal for stand-in capabilities and air superiority is that pursuing traditional theories of victory is impossible, given modern peer capabilities. We are not arguing that success will be easy, even with advanced stealth capabilities and the most exquisite space and cyber programs. However, cultural shifts and a nuanced acquisition plan would allow the Air Force to embrace tactical creativity and determine what would be necessary to transition from pulsed operations to persistent efforts in a long campaign or press towards preventing a fait accompli at all reasonable costs, should political circumstances demand so. A balanced force that prioritizes effective mass over affordable mass and always pursues some version of control of the air via stand-in capabilities is key. Lt. Col.

Boeing inks contracts worth more than $4B for KC-46s, P-8s	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon this week awarded Boeing a pair of separate contracts for 15 KC-46A Pegasus tankers and seven P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, deals that are collectively worth more than $4 billion. Although both contracts had been expected under existing plans, getting the deals signed is good news for Boeing, whose defense arm logged $2 billion in losses for its last fiscal quarter and which is facing company-wide layoffs. The P-8A deal is valued at $1.67 billion and includes non-recurring engineering work for foreign military sales made to Canada and Germany. It will bring the number of P-8As on contract up to 207, 135 of which are for the US Navy. Australia, India, the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Germany and Canada all fly the maritime surveillance aircraft, which has played an integral part in experimentation done at the behest of the AUKUS trilateral security pact. 'This $1.67 billion undefinitized contract for seven additional P-8A Poseidons not only reinforces the U.S. Navy’s commitment to maintaining a robust maritime presence but also highlights Boeing's dedication to delivering safe, reliable platforms that enhance the Navy’s operational capabilities, readiness and effectiveness,' Tory Peterson, vice president and P-8 program manager at Boeing. 'We look forward to delivering these additional P-8A maritime patrol aircraft to ensure the continued safety and security of our nation and allies.' The KC-46A deal is valued at $2.38 billion and includes 15 additional planes for the US Air Force. The new deal brings the number of planes on contract up to 168, according to a Boeing statement. The company to date has delivered 89 KC-46As to the US Air Force as well as four to Japan. RELATED: Boeing Machinists Vote To End Strike, Putting KC-46, P-8 Programs Back On Track The State Department previously cleared Japan to purchase up to nine KC-46 tankers for its air force in a deal valued at a $4.1 billion. If the Japanese proceed with that deal, it would more than double its current fleet, which is currently set to eventually reach six planes. Israel is also under contract on the tanker, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns over the last decade.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/boeing-inks-contracts-worth-more-than-4b-for-kc-46s-p-8s/	2024-11-22T09:09:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
After watching Ukraine, Central Asian nations ‘turning away’ from Russia for arms: US officials	The Kazakhstan National Defense University welcomed then-Lt. Gen. Michael Garrett, the commander of US Army Central, as its guest speaker Dec. 13, 2016, in the capital city of Astana. (US Army photo by Sgt. Brandon Hubbard) WASHINGTON — The war in Ukraine has prompted 'introspection' among Central Asian nations about buying military equipment mostly from Russia, and pushed them to look farther from home for arms — from Beijing all the way to Washington, according to State Department officials. 'I would argue that's not countries turning towards China; it's countries turning away from Russia,' Ambassador Donald Lu, assistant secretary at the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, said on a panel at the Center for New American Security last week. 'And they're not just looking at China, they're looking at Iran, they're looking at Europe, they're looking at the United States. They're having to go further afield because military equipment is just not available in the way that it was before the Ukraine war.' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense this week that before the Kremlin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Central Asian nations — Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — already had been 'diversifying away from Russia.' But the process has been hurried along not only by the strain the war has put on the pipeline for Russian equipment and parts, but by the view of Russia's experience on the battlefield. 'The second factor that has caused sort of a reexamination is all the five Central Asian nations have observed the performance of Russian equipment in Ukraine and have raised questions about how that equipment would perform in a regional conflict, should they have that requirement,' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official declined to comment on the broader political implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the region, but an analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute in May said Central Asian nations, as fellow former members of the Soviet Union, were spooked by Russia's move. 'For Russia, the invasion deeply damaged its reputation and self-appointed role as the sole security manager for the region,' reads the analysis, written by Robert Hamilton, head of research at the FPRI's Eurasia Program. 'Given what the Central Asian governments, especially Kazakhstan, have seen in Ukraine regional states, they view Moscow’s motives with deep suspicion and have lost considerable faith in its military capabilities.' Central Asia is not a large defense market. The combined military expenditure for Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan in 2023 was approximately $1.84 billion, according to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, by far the lowest expenditure by region that SIPRI tracked. (Figures for Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were not available.) For comparison, the next closet regional expenditure, from Central America and the Caribbean, was approximately $14.7 billion. But the nations sit at a key geostrategic crossroads, with Russia immediately to the north, China to the east and Iran and Afghanistan to the south. Since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the region has become an even more important player in the realm of counterterrorism, according to the State Department official. 'So it is one part of the world where you do get a lot of these strategic competitors kind of working in a similar place,' the official said. The FPRI analysis notes that China has been a prime beneficiary of Central Asia's slow pull away from Russia, and Beijing has offered attractive economic packages as well as arms deals to draw them closer. But it also notes that Turkey has a presence in defense sales as well, especially when it comes to drone sales, according to SIPRI data. As Breaking Defense has reported, Ankara has been aggressively expanding its military export portfolio in recent years. Turkey 'frankly, [has] a share that is sizeable and growing,' the official added. The State Department official didn't expound on Lu's reference to Iran, and the SIPRI database makes scant mention of public Iranian exports to the region. But Breaking Defense has reported that global interest in Tehran's indigenous, relatively cheap unmanned aerial vehicles, used in mass in Ukraine by Russia, has only grown since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict. In 2022, Iran publicly inaugurated a drone manufacturing facility in Tajikistan. As for the US, the State Department official said Washington has seen a 'very high level' of interest in American-made defense products, platforms and services, but 'there's a couple of limiting factors there.' 'As you can imagine, expense is one of those,' the official said. 'Our defense articles and services are fairly advanced, right?' And, therefore, tend to be expensive. Relatedly, there are 'tech release' issues, as the US is cautious when it comes to handing over high-tech equipment, presumably especially to nations that have such historically close ties to Russia and China. Coming information-sharing agreements, the official said, could help with that particular obstacle. 'So we do see that we need to balance sometimes US protection of our tech against where we're going to be able to release those things. The Central Asians, though, are again very interested in our particular products; it's really just a matter of making a good match,' the official said. As such, the official said it's unlikely that big ticket items, like fighter jets, will be part of any deals any time soon. (One of the only announcements about major US Foreign Military Sales to the region on the website for the Defense Cooperation Security Agency, for instance, was a 2020 notice that the US had approved a potential $128 million deal with Kazakhstan for airborne ISR systems.) The official said what the US has seen, instead, are very precise requests, 'the sort of smaller capabilities that tend to fill niches they have.' 'So it will be things like, &#8216;I need a UAV with a 20-kilometer range, with some amount of loiter time that can do X, Y and Z,' the official said. 'Or I need an over-the-horizon radar, which will pick up the following kind of targets. 'I say that as an example that they're fairly sophisticated, or at least clear-eyed, about what they're looking for from us,' the official said. Another 'great place to start,' the official said, is small arms and ammunition — a lower-profile but ubiquitous military need that Central Asian nations have expressed interest in having the US fill. 'And we find that pretty significant because &#8230; these countries have been firing Russian caliber ammunition forever and ever,' the official said. 'But they look at the US small arms inventory and think, &#8216;I want to get to that; I want to get over to that capability.'' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense that Central Asian nations have also expressed interest in boutique equipment used by American special operations forces — sometimes after witnessing the equipment in action during joint training exercises. 'But yea we certainly see working ourselves up the ladder to bigger systems, to more capable systems,' the first official said. 'This is one of the way that we connect with countries around the world,' that official said. 'It's perhaps magnified in Central Asia because of the competition that's happening in the region.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-watching-ukraine-central-asian-nations-turning-away-from-russia-for-arms-us-officials/	2024-11-22T08:20:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_kazakhstan_armored_vehicle_3077375-scaled-e1732128967704.jpg
Integrating commercial off-the-shelf computing on military platforms and how to make it work	The NCS Technologies division responsible for additive manufacturing is subject to the same quality controls as third parties. NCS Technologies photo. The threats to maneuver-force ground vehicles and their crews today are in many ways akin to what platforms faced in Iraq and Afghanistan faced years ago. The need for mechanical systems to drive sensors and computers for command and control and situational awareness, for example, remains relevant today. Back then, maneuver forces needed 360-degree cameras to help identify subtle changes in a given area, like a truck that wasn’t there the day before. The cameras required sophisticated data handling and storage systems that were stressed even under good conditions, as vehicles traversed rough terrain in all kinds of weather, with limited cooling and power, and perhaps with bombs exploding nearby. In that environment, the systems also required filters to keep sand out of the ventilation, uninterruptible power supplies to prevent sudden shutdowns resulting in lost data – not uncommon on military vehicles – and removable data storage so the data collected by the vehicle can be shared with a command post. Steve Stuck is vice president of the Appliance and Server Engineering Group at NCS Technologies. 'We designed several different iterations of that for a customer,' said Steve Stuck, Vice President of the Appliance and Server Engineering Group at NCS Technologies, which designs and builds custom computing solutions for mobile military platforms. 'They used them in the field in Afghanistan and came back to us with lessons learned. We completely re-architected the design based on their feedback.' Subsequent versions proved resilient against just about anything short of physical destruction of the vehicle, Stuck says. The camera system is but one example of the type of requests NCS Technologies routinely fields today from its military customers trying to address threat scenarios across European, Indo-Pacific, and Middle East battlespace. Oftentimes, these customers know what capabilities they’re looking for and turn to NCS Technologies to bring them to fruition.' NCS does this in a variety of inventive ways. Custom computing with a COTS twist Modern military platforms rely on advanced computing systems that must be protected against natural elements, extreme temperatures, and salt water, as well as decidedly human threats ranging from kinetics to supply chain sabotage. Ground vehicles are becoming smaller, more autonomous and mobile, amplifying the challenge. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions. Different platforms have varied missions, not to mention their own size, weight, power and cost (SWAP-C) requirements. In addition, data processing and storage systems must be compatible with other onboard electronics with which they connect – whether by design or not. The company is often contracted to do technology insertion into legacy platforms, with the onboard electronics to which it must interface sometimes many years behind mainstream – necessitating some creativity in designing leading edge computer systems that can communicate with legacy systems. Checking all necessary boxes in an affordable way is complicated, but that’s what NCS Technologies regularly accomplishes with its builds. Ronald Keene is vice president of military business development for NCS Technologies. 'We're dedicated to providing solutions that deliver performance, security, and reliability for every scenario that our customers put in front of us; that’s all,' said Ronald Keene, the company’s vice president of military business development. NCS packages commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computing and storage components to fit within the space and power constraints of a given platform, be it a ship or combat vehicle, and ruggedizes them against all operational scenarios. The company relies on model-based systems engineering, additive manufacturing, and inventiveness to do this. 'Almost everything we develop requires some degree of engineering, even if it's a COTS offering; nobody wants something exactly the way they see it on the website,' Stuck noted. 'Sometimes that's easy, sometimes that's harder.' Take, for example, the often-complex network of fans, ducts, and vents needed to prevent compute systems from overheating. Typically, fans draw and expel air from opposite sides of a system, but sometimes a customer needs customization for a specific vehicle integration. 'A requirement came to us recently where airflow had to come from adjoining sides so we're having to design the system in a very unconventional way,' Stuck said. 'We're using off-the-shelf technology, but you don't find systems where airflow comes in the side and goes out the back. It doesn't exist in a normal environment.' That said, NCS is careful not to over-customize. 'We don't want to add cost by driving a customization that's not necessary for the use case,' Keene said. The role of additive manufacturing Not everything can be bought off the shelf, and this is especially true of the brackets and other hardware necessary to house, support, and protect sensitive computing systems customized for mobile military platforms and vessels. This is where NCS’s in-house additive manufacturing capability, colloquially known as 3D printing, comes into play. During the digital design and engineering process, NCS uses additive manufacturing to quickly build prototype component parts to see what works and what doesn’t. Having the additive manufacturing in house means that engineers can design several notional designs, print all three of them and see which one works best and move on. Even though these parts are manufactured in-house, the NCS division responsible for additive manufacturing is subject to the same quality controls as third parties. Additive manufacturing is also a valuable tool in making modifications relatively late in the design and production process. Stuck cited an example of this where a single semiconductor chip was overheating and the ability to cool it by increasing fan speed was found to increase Airborne Noise (ABN) and Structure-borne Noise (SBN) beyond allowable Environmental Qualification Testing (EQT) tolerances, resulting in a bit of a 'Catch-22'. A tight schedule precluded a system redesign, so NCS engineers designed and additively manufactured an unusually shaped plenum – a chamber where a substance is collected for distribution – that drew air from a specific spot and directed it toward the chip. Problem solved. Structured for success In an era where many companies are embracing vertical integration, NCS’s design and development organization has a horizontal structure that strings together disciplines including design, systems engineering, and manufacturing to tackle the complex challenges of SWAP-C. The company’s customer interfacing team, meanwhile, has deep expertise in specific mission areas. 'We help drive the requirements working with our product management and engineering experts to devise an offering that specifically meets the business use case that the customer's looking for,' Stuck says. The NCS engineering-design team in one area interfaces directly to the manufacturing engineering team to ensure that a specially designed product can be manufactured at scale. For example, when the engineering team designs a system to optimize airflow while minimizing costs, the manufacturing engineering team weighs in to ensure it can be built quickly and affordably, a process that can involve some compromises. This horizontal back-and-forth manufacturing approach differs from siloed structures where engineering teams handoff designs to a production team that only then figures out how to build it. Instead of subcontracting for hardware fabrication and waiting for parts to be built, delivered, then tested for shock and vibration, and properly integrated, NCS keeps the entire process in-house, speeding design iteration, manufacturing, and quality control. This approach also improves sustainment. NCS’ field products have an expected lifecycle as long as 8-10 years, so the company designs products with LRUs (line replaceable units) in mind to speed up field service should it become necessary, and to also enhance its customer’s support experience with a comprehensive sustainment offering. NCS Technologies packages COTS computing and storage components to fit within the space and power constraints of a given platform, be it a ship or combat vehicle, and ruggedizes them against all operational scenarios. NCS Technologies photo. Resilience testing and supply chain security Like any contractor, NCS wants to ship its products with a high confidence level that they will pass muster with the customer. The Navy, for example, requires that machinery, electronics, and structures to be deployed on ships pass MIL-DTL-901E Floating Shock Testing, also known as barge testing. This entails placing items on a covered barge in a deep-water pond that then is exposed to explosions at various depths and distances to ensure they can withstand the rigors of combat. NCS has in-house shock and vibration test equipment that can emulate the effects of barge testing. 'Going to the barge, which is a required step in qualifying products or solutions for the Navy, is expensive and takes time to schedule,' Stuck says. 'The last thing you want to do is go to the barge and fail.' Confidence in systems also applies to the supply chain and security of the industrial base. Combat-bound computer systems face threats before they reach the field in the form of counterfeit parts or chips deliberately infected with spyware or malware. To address this, NCS has partnered with another innovative Northern Virginia company to identify and counter supply chain threats by isolating and monitoring a device’s electromagnetic emissions. The resulting signatures are measured against an established baseline, using patented machine learning capabilities to identify differences that might be indicative of counterfeiting or malware. 'It's powerful,' Stuck says. 'We've used this in our supply chain environment to make sure that a board that we're using is what it's supposed to be.' It’s one more layer of resiliency that NCS Technologies brings to its military customers and OEMs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/integrating-commercial-off-the-shelf-computing-on-military-platforms-and-how-to-make-it-work/	2024-11-22T08:08:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/The-NCS-Technologies-division-responsible-for-additive-manufacturing-is-subject-to-the-same-quality-controls-as-third-parties.-NCS-Technologies-photo.jpg
Lockheed, Pentagon reach handshake deal for next 2 F-35 production lots	An F-35B lands aboard Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) for the first time on Oct. 20, 2024. (Photo by Cmdr. Darin Russell.) WASHINGTON — After protracted negotiations, the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have reached an informal agreement, known as a 'handshake deal,' for the next two production lots of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the parties confirmed to Breaking Defense. 'We have reached an initial agreement as part of ongoing negotiations for the Lot 18/19 Air Vehicle Production Contract,' the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) and Lockheed said in a joint statement. The statement did not share final quantities or prices, saying only that those figures will be disclosed 'when a final agreement is signed.' The news was first reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, which stated the agreement covers roughly 300 aircraft. Progress on F-35 negotiations is likely welcome news to Lockheed, which has recently been funding the tri-variant stealth fighter’s production out of pocket as talks dragged on. A Lockheed executive told Breaking Defense last year that the aerospace giant aimed to finalize the lot 18/19 deal by the end of 2023, marking a significant delay for the negotiations. The program has recently battled inflation woes, supply chain challenges and technical problems that halted deliveries of upgraded jets for a full year. It’s not clear what the price might be for the forthcoming jets, though Lockheed has telegraphed that inflation may hike costs. Jets in lots 15 through 17 came in at an average price of $82.5 million for the conventional takeoff and landing F-35A, $109 million for the short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B and $102.1 million for the carrier-launched F-35C, Breaking Defense previously reported. Unlike the previous contract structure that included three production lots, the upcoming F-35 deal only covers two. Officials have discussed lot 20 serving as the first multi-year production agreement. Lockheed maintains that its Fort Worth, Texas, plant can build 156 jets annually. If the past is any guide, it could be several months before an agreement is inked. When the two parties reached a similar handshake agreement for lots 15-17 in July 2022, the contract was not finalized until December of that year. Asked when Lockheed planned for the 18/19 deal to become official, a company spokesperson referred Breaking Defense to comments from Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave during the firm’s third quarter earnings call in October. Malave said then that company officials anticipated the lot 18/19 contract will be awarded this year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/lockheed-pentagon-reach-handshake-deal-for-next-2-f-35-production-lots/	2024-11-22T07:06:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8708105-scaled-e1729541848808.jpg
Lawmakers backing separate cyber force see opening with Trump’s return	U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly seen on a laptop computer in Hastings on the Hudson, New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 22. 2020. (Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has long pushed back against the establishment of a new military service dedicated to cyberspace, but with President-elect Donald Trump on his way back to the White House, a separate cyber force has a real shot at becoming a reality, according to experts and to lawmakers who support the move. 'This change in administration potentially could give more impetus to the creation of a separate cyber service,' Quentin Hodgson, formerly the Pentagon’s director of Cyber Plans, told Breaking Defense. '[Trump] did that with the Space Force. It was something that the Department of Defense didn't want, but he decided he wanted it, and it's possible that that could also happen with cyberspace.' Hodgson was hardly alone in connecting Trump’s then-controversial move to stand up the Space Force in 2019 to visions of what his second term could bring to the cyber realm. Among those who made the comparison to Breaking Defense was Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican and vocal supporter of the cyber force idea. 'As the past half century has shown us, there will be naysayers and contrarians within the Pentagon who will do everything to slow-roll major changes. However, only six years ago, we had the same issue in the space domain,' Fallon said in an email. 'We need concrete progress and limited stagnation in cyber, something I know the Trump Administration will emphasize throughout the next four years.' Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell, another Texas Republican, authored an amendment in the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that called for an independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. The study is being conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. 'Incumbent on the results of the commission, which I think will affirm the need for a cyber service, I believe there’s a good chance we will see [a cyber service] come to fruition in soon. The Trump administration has shown that they will not put up with the status quo, and will opt for bold action, if necessary, especially when US national security is at risk,' Fallon said. Luttrell, like Fallon, said in an interview that he thought that if the third-party study came back recommending an independent cyber force, Trump would likely be on board, but ultimately, it is 'most certainly the president’s call.' 'As a congressional member, if I want to know the advancements in AI, technology, name any given space, where do I get to go to that? Do I have to go talk to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or go talk to [Cyber Command]?' Luttrell told Breaking Defense. 'Or could I go to cyber force, talk to the leadership, like, ‘Hey, where are we?’ And then they could say, ‘This is where we stand. This is what we implemented.’' Outside experts agreed that a Trump administration would, as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Mark Montgomery put it, 'look more favorably' on a separate cyber service. Montgomery, the senior director for FDD’s Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, said such a service could 'address our poor cyber force generation efforts over the past decade.' Emily Harding, vice president of the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Breaking Defense that the possibility of a cyber force under Trump’s second term is a 'big shrug' and that she has 'zero evidence' it’s in the works. But, she said, 'I also know these guys like to build things, and you know they were the ones responsible for Space Force, so why not?' She added that Trump’s seemingly close relationship with SpaceX founder and technology innovator Elon Musk — who was recently tapped by Trump to co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency — is another factor that could lead to a cyber force. 'You could see somebody like Elon Musk understanding this in a way that you know other people might not. So I don't know. I think there's a decent chance that they pursue it. I think they should pursue it,' she said. Harding said she primarily supports a cyber force because she believes an independent service will allow the military to find the most cyber-capable fighters. 'The kinds of skills that you're recruiting for in a cyber service or in a cyber role are very different from the kinds of skills you're recruiting for in what you consider the other branches of the military,' she said. 'I think you would want a different setup for recruiting and for training. In the other services, each one of them has a cyber skill set. They have a cyber specialty, but there's not necessarily the same path to advancement. So I think it's worth it to create the separate service, to create the talent pipeline and the specific structures that you would need for reserve,' she added. The Pentagon disagrees, arguing that the creation of a separate cyber force could create new challenges for the DoD in terms of understanding warfighting needs within each service. 'A cyber service might have some benefits in ease of administrative management, but we have a variety of …military services in the Department of Defense who perform a variety of missions,' Mieke Eoyang, deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy, said last year. 'Having a cyber service that is divorced from those particular mission sets may pose some challenges in understanding the warfighting needs of the services to provide cyber to enable that fight.' 'I think the question is that for people who think the cyber service is the answer to our … current challenges in cyber personnel management: be careful what you wish for,' she said. Related: ‘Be careful what you wish for:’ DoD official warns separate cyber force could pose new challenges Furthermore, at the end of September, the department formally requested that lawmakers shut down Fallon and Luttrell’s proposal for the independent assessment. DoD leaders contended that Congress had already called for an assessment of the current cyber landscape within the Pentagon, which included the potential for creating a cyber service in the 2023 NDAA. Jacquelyn Schneider, a fellow at the Hoover Institution where she serves as the director of the Hoover Wargaming and Crisis Simulation Initiative, is also against the creation of a new cyber service. She argued that rather than consolidating cyber expertise and infrastructure, it would lead to information silos that would make the military less effective in the cyber domain. 'In a world in which warfare is inherently joint, every time you create these different organizations, you create information stove pipes,' said Schneider, who also previously served as a senior policy advisor to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. Right now it’s unclear where exactly Trump stands, and his transition team did not respond to a request for comment. 'Trump likes to make services,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/lawmakers-backing-separate-cyber-force-see-opening-with-trumps-return/	2024-11-22T05:20:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_trump_laptop_GettyImages-1228653864-scaled-e1732226397800.jpg
Navy to sideline support ships, re-assign mariner crews amid worsening workforce shortages	The Military Sealift Command fleet replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn (T-AO 198) conducts a fueling-at-sea with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), July 10, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Rashan Jefferson) WASHINGTON — The Navy late last month approved a plan to put a number of Military Sealift Command logistics ships into extended maintenance periods as well as re-assign certain crews to higher priority vessels, the service announced today. 'Our civil service mariners play invaluable roles providing continuous logistics support to our deployed naval forces, and they are working overtime to sustain that mission globally,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in a written statement. 'This initiative will not only address operational logistics challenges we face now, it will ensure that Military Sealift Command has policies, programs and incentives it needs to recruit and retain future generations of civil service mariners.' Military Sealift Command is responsible for managing civilian crews that operate the various support and auxiliary ships that resupply US Navy warships around the world. It employs roughly 5,500 civil service mariners, 1,500 contracted mariners, and operates 140 logistics supply ships, such as fleet replenishment oilers and dry cargo/ammunition ships. Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck, MSC's chief, told reporters ahead of the announcement that up to 17 ships would either be put into extended maintenance periods or undergo planned inactivation periods by the end of 2026, but declined to name specific vessels. USNI News first reported earlier this year the Navy was considering such a move. There is 'a critical shortage across the US, across the civilian mariner landscape, which certainly affects our ability to grow our Combat Logistics fleet and the other [government-owned, government-operated] ships, and our ability to fully generate ready forces,' Sobeck said. 'This shortage is an industry-wide problem, and we find ourselves direct in direct competition [with commercial industry.]' 'In fact, we're just not competitive,' he added, citing numerous obstacles MSC's mariners face, including delayed relief, extended deployment times and pay caps. By reassigning crews to higher priority vessels, the Navy is hoping to provide more predictable schedules for current crews and minimize 'overdue reliefs.' The shortage of qualified merchant mariners has been a long-festering problem. Ann Phillips, head of the Transportation Department's Maritime Administration, told lawmakers last year that a 2017 study found, 'concurrent operations of the commercially operated U.S.-flagged fleet and sustained military sealift operations' would require roughly 13,600 mariners with 'unlimited credentials.' At that time, there were roughly 11,760 mariners who were both qualified and actively sailing, a deficit of more than 1,800. Sobeck declined to provide updated numbers on the mariner shortage writ large across the country, but said within his purview, MSC is currently coping with roughly 800- to 1,000-person shortages daily. 'The goal is to fully execute MSC's workforce initiative by the end of fiscal year 2026,' he said. 'This brings us directly in line with [the chief of naval operations'] Project 33 goal, ready to sustain high-end, joint and combined combat by 2027.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-to-sideline-support-ships-re-assign-mariner-crews-amid-worsening-workforce-shortages/	2024-11-21T13:00:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8524368-scaled-e1727186104760.jpg
ULA’s Vulcan may forfeit planned Space Force launches this year	ULA’s first Vulcan rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex-41 at 2:18 a.m. EST on January 8, 2024. (United Launch Alliance photo) WASHINGTON — The United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan has two national security missions on its launch manifest this year, but given that the Space Force has yet to certify the heavy-lift rocket, it will likely be difficult to pull off either mission before 2025, a Space Force official said today. ULA launched its second certification flight in October, roughly a month behind schedule, following a first flight in January that was nearly four years behind schedule. The Space Force is still assessing data from the October launch in partnership with ULA to support the certification that will pave the way for the rocket to carry national security payloads. But even if that blessing comes swiftly, the calendar is unforgiving. With only six weeks left in the year, and other steps required like mounting payloads on the rocket, 'we are getting challenged to be able to launch this year,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, head of the Space Force’s Space Systems Command, told reporters this morning during a breakfast hosted by the Defense Writers Group. And how much schedule margin is left for 2024? 'Probably not much,' he replied, though he deferred to ULA for specifics. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amid dominance by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the Pentagon has been eager to field more launch providers to help foster competition, drive down costs and provide redundant launch options. ULA has since been racing to certify Vulcan, particularly after retiring the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy rockets from military service. Two well-executed launches are requisite to achieve certification for carrying national security payloads, meaning ULA could soon be given the go-ahead for Defense Department missions following the October launch. The January launch was deemed a success, but there was an anomaly during the October flight with one of Vulcan's solid rocket boosters that currently is under investigation. Nonetheless, Garrant noted, Vulcan was still able to achieve the criteria for certification by successfully continuing on its planned flight path. 'If they are not launching by the end of the year, we would delay those launches,' Garrant said of the two national security missions on Vulcan’s manifest. 'We are working with [ULA] to evaluate the data from their second flight, and they are making significant progress.' Garrant separately noted that the Space Force’s contract vehicle for launches, known as the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program, is currently in limbo due to the ongoing continuing resolution (CR), which appears likely to stretch into 2025. The service in June awarded the first contracts under the latest NSSL iteration, called Phase 3, to ULA, SpaceX and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, for non-critical and/or lower altitude launches under the program's first 'lane.' Due to the CR, the next tranche of awards under NSSL Phase 3 — for must-succeed missions under the program's Lane 2 — will not move forward until the full fiscal year 2025 budget is passed, Garrant said. While ULA’s Vulcan has not been certified, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has yet to even make its maiden flight — though that could occur this month. Still, Garrant indicated the Space Force expects the two companies will be able to compete against SpaceX for NSSL Phase 3, Lane 2 contracts. (SpaceX is currently the only certified launch provider for those missions.) 'We anticipate that they will be certified,' Garrant said of ULA and Blue Origin, though he added it’s 'probably too early to say how' the Space Force would divvy up contract awards between the three potential providers once the FY25 budget is passed. Theresa Hitchens contributed to this story.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/ulas-vulcan-may-forfeit-planned-space-force-launches-this-year/	2024-11-21T11:55:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/ULA-Vulcan-Certification-Flight_010824-e1704739766586.jpg
Pentagon plans secure cloud pilot to defend small businesses from hackers	Two engineers working on laptop in a factory. (Getty stock image) WASHINGTON — Next year, the Pentagon’s Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) will launch a pilot project to create creating a secure, cloud-based enclave for small contractors, who often struggle to meet DoD’s extensive cybersecurity requirements. 'We're building [a] secure cloud that we’ll offer as a platform and environment for all small business' that work with the Department of Defense, said Derrick Davis, director of industrial cybersecurity for SBP. While still very much a work-in-progress, the plan is to include a virtual desktop, secure communications and other tools for use by smaller firms, Davis told the GovExec Cybersecurity Futures Forum on Wednesday afternoon. The as-yet unnamed pilot will be run out of OSBP’s Project Spectrum. Created in the defense policy bill for 2019 [PDF], Spectrum provides online resources to educate contractors and a marketplace for government-vetted cybersecurity tools, but it hasn’t built such a comprehensive suite of services before. The plan is start small, initially recruiting firms that have prior experience working with DoD — 'all you in this room know that you need a doctorate degree just to navigate the defense contractor process,' Davis said wryly — but still need cybersecurity help. One model that SBP is looking at is the Army’s two-year, $26 million pilot project, NCODE, which is also creating a secure cloud to host small businesses. 'That's a great program that they have, we’ve reviewed it within our office, we're going to partner with those guys,' Davis told the GovExec conference. 'I’m headed to the Pentagon after this to actually speak with the Army CIO, Mr. [Leo] Garciga, about NCODE.' Driving both initiatives is the realization that while big prime contractors can build extensive in-house cybersecurity teams, small businesses generally lack the resources to hire cyber experts or even buy the latest security software. 'Especially just starting out, your laptop that you use to run your small business, it's also your [personal] laptop that you use to manage your family's finances,' Davis said. 'You may even help have your kid do their homework on your laptop.' But even tiny mom-and-pop shops working with the Defense Department can end up handling sensitive information or technology, or providing some obscure but critical component for a high-priority weapons system. So, besides the inevitable spammers and scammers that go after everyday internet users, small firms contracting with the Pentagon might be targeted by so-called 'Advanced Persistent Threats,' Davis warned: Nation-states using sophisticated techniques and technologies to suck up vast amounts of defense-related data and look for unlocked backdoors into sensitive networks. 'If we're going to force companies to get compliant with CMMC [Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification], we should also, on the flip side, offer assistance, and that's what we're trying to do,' Davis said. 'But … when we do something, everybody wants it to be perfect. The problem is, as you know, it takes time.' 'Have patience and grace with us,' he told the GovExec audience. 'We’re just trying to help.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-plans-secure-cloud-pilot-to-defend-small-businesses-from-hackers/	2024-11-21T11:20:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_stock_factory_computer_GettyImages-648822919-scaled-e1732202717985.jpg
Romania signs LOA to secure entry to F-35 club	Romania has ordered 32 F-35A fifth generation fighter jets, joining a host of other European nations (US Embassy in Romania) BELFAST — Romania has formally committed to the acquisition of 32 Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fifth-generation fighter jets after signing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) today. The procurement is valued at approximately $6.4 billion. Romania joins a wide base of European customers for the platform including Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. Reacting to the inking of the LOA, Lockheed Martin said in a company statement, 'This decision marks a significant milestone in Romania's defense strategy and its commitment to maintaining a robust and advanced military force.' Lt. Gen Mike Schmidt, director and program executive officer of the F-35 Joint Program Office said in the statement, 'The integration of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft into the Romanian Air Force will significantly strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities by providing unmatched strategic, operational, and tactical advantages.' He added, 'The F-35 Joint Program Office is dedicated to continuing a strong relationship with Romania, ensuring a successful transition and providing comprehensive support for their pilots and maintainers as we move forward together on this great effort.' US Ambassador to Romania Kathleen Kavalec told reporters at the LOA signing ceremony in Bucharest, 'We expect by 2030 these planes will be flying above Romania,' and that in the interim, the southeastern European country will continue to 'benefit' from its fleet of Lockheed Martin F-16 fourth-generation planes, while transition to the F-35 will be supported by a F-16 training center. The F-35 order 'will take Romania even a step forward, [beyond the F-16 protecting national borders] both on behalf of Romanian security, but also on behalf of the NATO Alliance,' she said. 'Because these planes will also be part of air policing, Romania participates in NATO wide air policing, air policing occurs here in Romania, it occurs in other parts of NATO territory, so this will allow Romania to keep up with the rest of the alliance and to have an even stronger security footprint.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/romania-signs-loa-to-secure-entry-to-f-35-club/	2024-11-21T10:25:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/53991823469_169e0d4a7c_k-e1732211600494.jpg
As adversaries attack, Pentagon’s zero trust office shifts focus to protecting ‘operational technology’	Chief of the Department of Defense Zero Trust Portfolio Management Office Randy Resnick (right), and DoD Senior Information Security Officer, David McKeown (left), hold an off-camera, on-the-record virtual press briefing on the release of the DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Nov. 22, 2022. DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders. 'For OT and weapon systems, we are coming out with initial zero trust guidance. Why? Because the adversary is attacking,' Randy Resnick, the director of the Zero Trust Office within the department’s Chief Information Office, told Breaking Defense Tuesday. 'The adversary wants to get into weapon systems to prevent their launch, or mess with the GPS coordinates, so the DoD is looking to initially secure these things beyond what they are today.' 'OT also has vulnerabilities that we are concerned about,' he said. Unlike IT that primarily deals with software and data, OT generally refers to systems and devices that control physical processes, like thermostats, water tanks and machinery on a factory floor. They're key components in critical infrastructure for civilians, but also in the sprawling defense ecosystem of facilities and systems. Defense critical infrastructure, meanwhile, is more related to weapons systems, Resnik said. Resnick said that language in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the Pentagon focus on zero trust for IT, OT and DCI. As a result, Resnick’s office stood up the plan to transition to a zero-trust cybersecurity framework by the end of fiscal year 2027, which plans to have zero trust fully implemented into IT by that time. Given adversarial threats and the department’s progress in implementing zero trust into IT, Resnick said the next step is to create guidance for implementing zero trust in OT and then eventually DCI. 'At the end of [2027] we're going to have a number of successes that achieve [our 2027] target, if not [advancing it],' he said of the IT zero trust strategy during the panel. 'We are going to be coming out with guidance for OT, and that'll probably come out at the end of summer [2025] and we'll have a date beyond 2027 where we start establishing ZT [zero trust] into OT. 'Then, of course, we're also concerned about defense critical infrastructure, so that's another thing,' he added. If adversaries are able to hack into the DoD’s OT like machinery in factories, it could lead to catastrophic results, Resnick warned. 'The DoD leases and owns factories, the communication between every single piece of equipment is not IT. So it's OT, okay, the whole factory runs on OT,' he told Breaking Defense. 'If they coordinated across 10 to 15 things simultaneously, it means a tremendous amount.' 'It could shut the factory down for a period of time until they’ve recovered. DoD could be put out for a month. I hope not, but that's the worst case scenario. It's a point of vulnerability, it's a point of attack. The whole point of zero trust is to prevent these attacks in a modern day sense,' he added. Resnick explained that vulnerabilities in OT can lead to threat actors hacking into IT as well because OT is often connected to IT or the internet because that’s how the OT systems communicate with each other — think the Internet of Things. 'This creates a back door to get to IT, so I could break into OT, and it's called ‘swim upstream.’ I want to prevent that,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/as-adversaries-attack-pentagons-zero-trust-office-shifts-focus-to-protecting-operational-technology/	2024-11-21T07:50:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Chief-scaled-e1686258310375.jpg
Israel likely partner for Greece as it looks for integrated air defense systems	The Army has two Iron Dome batteries and is fielding both at JBLM. (David Huskey/DVIDS) JERUSALEM — Greece is kicking the tires on Israeli-made air defense systems, as the NATO nation seeks to build a multi-layered air defense system capable of countering both enemy jets and low-level drones, sources confirm to Breaking Defense. News of Greece’s interest was first reported by Reuters, with the Greek daily Ekathimerini reporting that the multi-layered systems could surpass $2 billion in cost. 'The defenses would likely mimic Israel’s Iron Dome and other systems that intercept short- and long-range missiles launched during strikes from its neighbors amid the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon,' per Ekathimerini. A pair of sources told Breaking Defense that Greece is in the fact-finding process of what systems Israeli might be willing to sell, and while it appears Athens plans to cast a wide net as it looks for options, the two are a clear match: Israel, which has grown closer to Greece in recent years, already possesses a multi-layered air defense system, all parts of which are in varying states of being sold or used by other countries. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems makes the short-range Iron Dome system, used primarily against rockets and small drones; that system is soon to incorporate laser air defenses as well. Rafael also makes the medium-range system David’s Sling, which was jointly developed with the US and has been sold to Finland, as well as the Spyder, which can defend against aircraft and other threats. IAI makes Arrow, an exoatmospheric defense system jointly developed with the US which has been sold to Germany, as well as the Barak air defense system. IAI's Elta also makes the air defense radars used with Iron Dome, radars that have been sold to Czech Republic and Slovakia. The initial Reuters report came after a closed door briefing in Israel with Greek Defense Minister Nikos Dendias, who has emerged as a key figure in advancing Israel’s closer ties with Athens. A former foreign minister for Greece, Dendias visited Israel in August 2023 and met with then-Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'We discussed the important achievements of our Strategic Defence Relationship and expressed our wish to further broaden it,' he wrote on social media. He highlighted the joint exercises between Israel and Greece and also said that Athens and Jerusalem had 'agreed to enhance our mutually beneficial cooperation in the area of defence research and technology with the involvement of the defence industry, research institutions, and other innovation bodies.' The Israel-Greece ties are part of a growing context of emerging partnerships in the eastern Mediterranean that also include Cyprus. This trilateral relationship is the background in which Athens’ interest in a multi-layered defense system have emerged, noted Eran Lerman, a former Israeli deputy national security advisor and now vice-president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security. He said he uses the term 'alignment' for these ties, as opposed to 'alliance,' because there aren’t agreements on the horizon involving mutual defense. 'It’s enough to generate intelligence cooperation, military training — this is essentially a triangular relationship because the Cypriots are part of this story,' Lerman said, citing two key ways the relationship with Cyprus is benefitting Israel. The first is training in Cyprus for units such as Israeli commandos, which helps them familiarize with long-range operations in terrain similar to Lebanon. The second development is that Cyprus can be a logistical backstop if there are interruptions in trade with Israel — for instance, when flights were cancelled due to the recent war with Hamas and Hezbollah, airlines would fly to Cyprus and then Israeli jets would take them the rest of the way. 'That’s not a trivial matter when we faced the possibility of serious limitation on flights to Israel,' Lerman added. The burgeoning ties also have roots in joint drills with Greece, where Lerman says there has been 'close cooperation, particularly with the air forces.' Israel has participated in the annual multi-national air exercise called Iniochos in Greece and the Greeks have participated in Blue Flag, a semi-annual air force drill in Israel. In addition, Israel is deliver M-346 training aircraft to Greece as part of a government-to-government deal, and Israel’s Elbit Systems is creating a flight training center in Greece.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-likely-partner-for-greece-as-it-looks-for-integrated-air-defense-systems/	2024-11-21T06:29:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/6798386-scaled-e1659458065341.jpg
Anduril could receive up to $100M for Space Surveillance Network upgrade	A sunset view of Maui Space Surveillance System on Mount Haleakala, above the clouds at 10,000 feet. (US Air Force photo/Tech. Sgt. Bennie J. Davis III) WASHINGTON — The Space Force has awarded artificial intelligence startup Anduril a contract worth up to almost $100 million to create a modern, machine-to-machine communications network to link sensors for monitoring the heavens to command and control (C2) systems and data analysts, the company announced today. The indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, managed by Space Force Space Systems Command, covers a five-year program to deliver its Lattice software to US Space Command (SPACECOM) 'as a resilient mesh networking capability' to modernize the Space Surveillance Network (SSN), Anduril's press release said. 'The U.S. Space Command has mandated full deployment by the end of 2026,' the release added. The SSN is composed of primarily ground-based radars and telescopes that detect and track objects in space, ranging from active satellites to debris such as jettisoned rocket bodies and pieces from satellite breakups. That observational data is downlinked to SPACECOM computer systems for use by analysts who are charged with characterizing whether those objects present threats to US and allied space systems — as well as figuring out whether any are on a course to potentially collide with other space objects, especially any operational satellites. Anduril's mesh network, called the Space Domain Awareness Network (SDANet), includes hardware that will be deployed at every SSN sensor type over the next two years, a company official told Breaking Defense. That hardware will use the Lattice open software platform, which can bring in data from any type of sensor, then employ machine learning to process that information and fuze it, and finally distribute the results. SDANet will replace SPACECOM's Space Defense Interface Network, which is 'a 40-year-old system of point-to-point network connections leveraging serial lines coupled with aging infrastructure' used by SSN sensors, the company official said. That legacy network 'can only move data at speeds of roughly one-tenth of old dial up internet (i.e., ~4,800 Baud),' the official explained, and doesn't have any way to automatically reroute data if any part of the network goes down. SDANet thus will 'increase the level of connectivity between sensors, command and control systems, and data platforms to drastically decrease communications/messaging latency, increase availability/resiliency, and enable new concepts of operations essential to space warfighting operations currently not possible with legacy communications systems,' Anduril's press release said. Specifically, the company official said, the new network will be 'transporting and translating data' from SSN telescopes and radars to the C2 systems at Space Force Delta 2's 18th Space Defense Squadron at Vandenberg SFB, Calif. and 19th Space Defense Squadron at the Naval Support Facility Dahlgren, Va. The 18th Space Defense Squadron is the primary space domain awareness unit for SPACECOM, and is charged with C2 of the SSN sensors and managing the command's computerized database of space objects, according to a Space Force fact sheet. It also is responsible for sharing space tracking data with Defense Department, interagency, commercial, international and academic users. The 19th Space Defense Squadron provides tasking orders to the SSN sensors 'to maintain up-to-date orbital parameters for over 40,000 man-made Earth-orbiting objects,' according to a Space Force fact sheet. In particular, its role includes 'expanding cislunar and extra-geosynchronous awareness via current SSN and commercial capabilities' and contributing to 'space-based environmental monitoring missions.' Anduril's network already is operational at a subset of the SSN sites in Maui, Hawaii, via an experimental program with Space Systems Command first initiated in November 2022. Under that program, the Anduril official explained, the SDANet is feeding data to the Non-traditional Data Pre-Processor system built by L3Harris — essentially one of a series of software patches that have been developed over two-plus decades of unsuccessful efforts to overhaul the aging computer processing, data analysis and C2 systems used by SPACECOM to manage space domain awareness operations, and enable integration of new sensors and observational data. Specifically, the official said, the Non-traditional Data Pre-Processor feeds Anduril's SDANet data to SPACECOM's 1980s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system and software. SPADOC links directly with legacy SSN sensors, pulls it down, and processes it. That pre-processor also will be used to feed data into SPADOC's replacement system, called ATLAS (Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System) also being developed by L3Harris. ATLAS, however, is facing it own developmental problems. SDANet further will enable connections to 'various mission partners that currently rely on this data for intelligence and analysis mission sets,' the Anduril official said. The Defense Department and the services began experimenting with Anduril's AI-powered Lattice platform as long ago as 2020, including for counter-drone operations — winning a $1 billion contract from US Special Operations Command in 2022 — and as an enabler of its ambitious Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept. Further, Anduril has ambitious plans for its own constellation of space monitoring satellites, to be launched by 2025, based on Lattice.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/anduril-could-receive-up-to-100m-for-space-surveillance-network-upgrade/	2024-11-21T05:00:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Maui-Space-Surveillance-site-e1732138371199.jpeg
Norway puts France, Germany, UK and US in the frame for future frigate partnership	Norway is looking to replace aging Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates through a 'strategic' partnership with one of four newly shortlisted nations (Norwegian government) BELFAST — Norway has officially shortlisted four countries it will consider as options to support a future frigate 'strategic' partnership. France, Germany, the UK and the US are set to receive invitations to begin discussions on the matter, said the Norwegian Ministry of Defence in a Wednesday statement. Although Norway's statement does not say what designs are up for discussion, it is expected that the options will cover France's Defense and Intervention Frigate (FDI), Germany's F126, the UK Type 26/City-Class and/or Type 31, and the US Constellation-class. 'The new frigates represent the largest acquisition planned for the Norwegian Armed Forces in the coming years,' Bjørn Arild Gram, Norway’s Minister of Defence, is quoted as saying. 'Norway is an important maritime nation in NATO, and through this and other maritime investments we will be strengthening both national and allied security.' A strategic partner for the effort is due to be picked in 2025. Between five and six new frigates could be ordered to meet a requirement set out in Norway’s long term defense plan. The future ships will also be capable of embarking anti-submarine helicopters. Additionally, the proposed partnership will cover 'joint acquisition, operation, maintenance, continuous development and upgrades of the new frigates throughout their service life,' per the MoD statement. Oslo is focused on joining an active production frigate program in order to minimize the need for Fridtjof Nansen-class upgrades. 'Solid and predictable cooperation on both security and defence policy will be at the heart of the strategic partnership that we envision, which will include everything from force generation to operations and joint development of new capabilities,' said Arild Gram. 'It is therefore essential that we and our partners have the same long-term interests.' The frigate partnership push comes on the heels of Gen. Eirik Kristoffersen, Norway's Chief of Defense, telling Breaking Defense in April that, 'we need to' work in 'close cooperation with one ally. We need the same frigate as another ally. We cannot be the one user of a system, we are too small for that.' Such an outlook also mirrors Norway's favored approach to submarine investment, where it has opted for a joint procurement with Germany of Thyssenkrupp-made 212CD class vessels. A first Norwegian sub, of four on order, underwent construction at the shipbuilder's Kiel yard in September last year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/norway-puts-france-germany-uk-and-us-in-the-frame-for-future-frigate-partnership/	2024-11-20T13:53:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/knm-fritjof-nansen-foto-johan-ludvig-holst-scaled-e1732136926280.jpg
Army picks Red Cat’s small quadcopter for 2nd Short-Range Reconnaissance tranche	A soldier flies a Red Cat quadcopter in this image from the company. (Red Cat) WASHINGTON — The US Army announced it has picked systems made by Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones for the service’s Short-Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program of record. After the company preempted the service announcement on Tuesday, the Army confirmed today that it had selected Red Cat’s quadcopter for SRR but noted that 'exact funding, quantities, and other details' will be hammered out throughout the rest of the year as the duo work though the contract details. 'The selection was made based on a combination of criteria that included soldier feedback, performance, and reliability during the SRR tranche 2 prototyping effort,' an Army spokesman said in a brief statement. The Army spokesman did not disclose if Red Cat’s small Teal drone would be the only drone selected for this second tranche but noted that the program office is focused on fostering competition among companies and will be continually assessing new technologies for future tranches. 'The long-awaited production selection marks a new era for our company and the future of American drones,' George Matus, Red Cat’s chief technology officer, said in an announcement on Wednesday. 'Our top priority now is to start ramping production of the next generation system, recently announced as the Black Widow and WEB, and give warfighters the tools they need to be successful on the modern battlefield,' he later added. Skydio’s RQ-28A quadcopter was picked as the first tranche of the SRR program and was first delivered to soldiers in 2022, one of which noted at the time that the man-portable drones were so new that the service didn’t have tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for using them in operations. The service is moving out on plans to acquire and field a host of new aerial drones to provide soldiers at every echelon with a system. That plan includes:	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-picks-red-cats-small-quadcopter-for-2nd-short-range-reconnaissance-tranche/	2024-11-20T13:01:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_red_cat_drone_HANDOUT-e1732136676896.jpg
AUKUS will ‘cannibalize’ other programs with no budget boost: Former top Aussie general	Sir Angus Houston (L) delivers the Defence Strategic Review 2023 to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Deputy PM and Minister of Defence Richard Marles at Parliament House on February 14, 2023 in Canberra, Australia. (Photo by Martin Ollman/Getty Images) SYDNEY — Sounding the alarm that the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal will eat into non-naval priorities, the former head of the Australian Defense Force today called for a significant boost in defense spending, up to 3 percent of GDP. Sir Angus Houston was Australia's top military officer from 2005-2011 and was tapped to co-lead the recent Defense Strategic Review, making him a key, respected voice on matters of defense. While the DSR TKTKT, his comments today reflect what he sees as changed situation. The review and its Integrated Investment Plan projected a $55.5 billion AUD budget for 2024-25, rising to $67.9 billion in 2027-28 — roughly 2.2 percent of GDP. Part of that is simply acknowledging that the world is much more dangerous than when the review was completed in early 2023. When the strategy was published Houston made headlines with his claims that Australia faced the most dire strategic situation since World War II, and the situation has only expanded, with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the back and forth between several actors in the Middle East, a modernized and aggressive China and the increasingly close ties between North Korea, China, Russia and Iran. But in comments at the US Studies Centre here, Houston made clear he wasn't just talking about spending more because of the threats. He made an important structural point, that Australia must increase its defense spending so that buying and building nuclear powered attack submarines — the AUKUS program with the US and UK — does not consume too much of the defense budget. Houston said the AUKUS boats 'must be a net addition to Australia's military capability. The only way they can be a net addition to Australian military capability is to increase our defense spending by 3 percent plus of GDP as we move into and through the 2030s.' If that does not happen, it will mean the military can only buy the subs 'through the cannibalization of other military capability. So that is the challenge for us. And I don't think either side of the body politic in Australia has really come to terms with that.' The question of whether AUKUS will eat up other programs for the Australian defense community has been an open one ever since the project, the most expensive endeavor in the country's history, was launched. Officials have largely towed the line that the Lucky Country can do everything. For instance, Richard Vagg, the service’s head of Land Capability, told Breaking Defense in October that he was not concerned about losing out to AUKUS, noting 'we’ve made some very, very considered decisions about our investment plans from a ADF perspective, and are quite comfortable where we’re sitting in terms of our land projects.' However, there may be signs of budget pressure emerging already. Earlier this month, Australia killed a $5.3 billion AUD satellite contract with Lockheed Martin, with one analyst saying more cuts will likely have to happen as the true cost of AUKUS emerges. The current government in Canberra has pledged to increase defense spending by $50.3 billion over the next decade, with the plan being to hit $100 billion by 2033. That would put the country at 2.4 percent — well below what Houston believes is needed. Earlier in the conference, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, who won't have a government job after Jan. 20, urged the incoming Trump administration to work closely with Australia and New Zealand to counter a 'relentless' China and not to turn inward. 'China is relentless. They want to build bases. They want to extend their power there. We are going to have to do more, and do more with Australia and New Zealand,' he told the conference on a feed from Washington. 'This is a time right now to be innovative, to be optimistic, to work, to make the argument about why common purpose is in our best interests, and why the United States should not withdraw from the world, from partnerships, to work more closely than ever with Indo-Pacific partners. Nowhere is that more important than Australia.' RELATED: AUKUS faces little threat from Trump, Aussie officials say Campbell made a direct appeal to the presumptive Secretary of State in the Trump administration, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Trump has talked about large cuts to the State Department and other parts of the US foreign policy structure and his public rhetoric is about America First, which could mean ignoring or withdrawing from engagement in the Indo-Pacific. 'My hope is that Senator Rubio, the Trump administration, will recognize that this is a moment of acute strategic competition,' the deputy said. A range of speakers from Japan, the United States and Australia said at the conference they thought the Trump White House would support AUKUS, citing the incoming president's penchant for transactional diplomacy. Australia is spending billions to buy and build nuclear-powered attack boats, is helping the US expand its industrial base and Trump is likely to recognize that, they said. Unlike some NATO countries, which Trump has criticized for spending too little, Australia has committed more than $6 billion USD to expanding the tripartite sub industrial base and plans to spend a total of $368 billion on Virginia- and SSN AUKUS-class subs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/former-top-aussie-general-warns-aukus-will-cannibalize-other-programs-with-no-defense-boost/	2024-11-20T12:47:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/angus-houston-scaled-e1732110317443.jpg
Turkey joins drone-carrier operations club with first takeoff and landing from Turkish ship	Bayraktar TB3 prepares to take off from Turkish ship TCG Anadolu. (Photo credit: Baykar) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Baykar's unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) Bayraktar TB3 performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu, a short runway vessel, the firm said Tuesday in a statement. 'The flight, conducted at the convergence of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, lasted for 46 minutes before the aircraft successfully landed back on the same short runway, without the need for any landing support equipment,' Baykar said in the statement. Bayraktar TB3 performed the test on Nov. 19 after completing open-sea shipboard trials. The drone had completed its maiden flight from land in October 2023, and Tuesday it became the first Turkish UAV to be deployed from the drone carrier TCG Anadolu. The vessel is expected to also host Bayraktar TB3 and Kizilelma drones. Bayraktar TB3 PT1 and PT2 UCAVs underwent flight trainings from the company’s Flight Training and Test Center in Edirne to Dalaman Air Base Command. Bayraktar TB3 PT1 was deployed in flights during day and night on TCG Anadolu and 'successfully complet[ed] Approach Tests without any issues,' according to the statement. Though the company hailed the takeoff and landing as a world first from a short-runway ship, other drones have executed flights from maritime vessels before, including US drone-maker General Atomics's Mojave, which conducted a short takeoff and landing from the UK Royal Navy's HMS Prince of Wales a year ago this month. Bakyar did not respond to a request for additional comment by press time. Either way, the demonstration shows the continued interest of the world's navies in carrier-drone operations. Beyond the Mojave tests, the US Navy is pushing ahead with carrier-based drone control rooms. In May reports emerged that China may have constructed a relatively small carrier specifically designed for drone operations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/turkey-joins-drone-carrier-operations-club-with-first-takeoff-and-landing-from-turkish-ship/	2024-11-20T11:45:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Bayraktar_TB3_TCG_Anadolu_Take_off_and_Land_on-8-scaled-e1732123005228.jpg
INDOPACOM’s Paparo acknowledges stockpile shortages may impact his readiness	Adm. Samuel Paparo receives a tour of the ballistic missile submarine USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN 730) during a tour of Naval Base Kitsap (NBK)-Bangor, Wash. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Brian G. Reynolds) WASHINGTON — As the American weapons packages for Ukraine and Israel have started to include increasingly more complicated systems, the commander of US Indo-Pacific Command conceded finite munitions stockpiles could mean American assistance heading elsewhere around the world will impact the readiness of his own forces. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-ranged weapons, I had said not at all,' Adm. Samuel Paparo told an audience at the Brookings Institute yesterday when asked about the issue. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it’s now eating into stocks … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he continued. As commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, Paparo is the most senior American military officer who is tasked on a daily basis with managing aggression from China as well as aiding in diplomatic efforts with other key US allies and partners in the region. He went on to say that the United States’s stockpiles are 'fungible' across all the possible military theaters they may be used in. Additionally he said his area of responsibility, however important it may be given the Pentagon’s rhetoric, has nothing 'reserved.' RELATED: &#8216;Up our game': The Pentagon's 3 strategies to shore up munitions stockpiles 'Inherently, it imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because [China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' he said. When asked if he agrees with Paparo's assessment, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said today he had not seen the admiral's comments but 'every time we do a presidential drawdown, we take things that we have in our stocks, provide them to the country in need, and there's been a significant need, and then we replace those items with new items and better items. And those munitions and those weapons are built in the United States of America.' 'That creates jobs,' he continued. 'It puts us in a better position militarily &#8230; but it takes a little time and we recognize that. So we work with industry to expand capacity in our industrial base and that's happening. In many cases industry has is rising to meet the demand, meet the challenge, and we're going to continue to do that.' The admission, though reserved, is significant coming from someone as senior as Paparo. The notion that America’s aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia is hampering the country’s ability to respond to China and potentially assist Taiwan has gained an audience in certain sectors of the GOP. Those criticisms intensified last October as it became clear the US would also divert some of its munitions — as well as key assets like capital warships — to the Middle East to help defend Israel. When called to testify in front of lawmakers, senior military officials from across the services have acknowledged the packages to Ukraine and Israel have made a noticeable dent in the stockpiles held for US forces. But at a policy level, the Biden administration has made assisting Ukraine a top priority and staved off suggestions that the US must choose between helping Ukraine or preparing to counter China. That could soon change. Some of Trump’s allies in the GOP have been the most vocal in their criticisms against continuing to send weapons to Ukraine, and with Republicans controlling both the White House and the two chambers of Congress, continued support to Ukraine is anything but assured. When pressed about whether Taiwan should be 'concerned' about US stockpiles and the effect multiple global conflicts are having on them, Paparo said, 'When you say concerned — should it keep them up at night? 'We should replenish those stocks,' he continued. 'I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth. I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/indopacoms-paparo-acknowledges-stockpile-shortages-may-impact-his-readiness/	2024-11-20T11:08:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240214_DVIDS_paparo_sub_7263379-scaled-e1707925090340.jpg
Nets, jamming and ‘cyber scalpels’: Pentagon weighs homeland counter-drone tech in mountain tests	Fortem's DroneHunter floats to the ground as a captured sUAS hangs in a net underneath. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) FORT CARSON, Colo. — Hovering hundreds of yards away, the small quadcopter drone was nearly invisible to the naked eye, but its size didn’t make it any less of a potential threat to operations on the ground here. Spotted by sensors, defending personnel dispatched their own drone — this one armed with a net. A few minutes later, in the Colorado air, the friendly drone snagged the interloper, popped a parachute and both floated harmlessly to the ground. The incident, this time, was not a real threat but a demonstration, part of a series put on by US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) to explore ways to counter small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), an increasingly ubiquitous presence not only on the battlefields of Ukraine and the Middle East but lurking around American bases back home. The Pentagon has documented hundreds of suspected drone incursions at military facilities in the last few years, even if many are thought to be the work of hobbyists. Nets were just one tactic on display during this two-week exercise in October called Falcon Peak, which was limited to non- and low-kinetic mitigation techniques to stop small unmanned aircraft systems, or sUAS. On this Army base here, defense industry firms brought kit tailored to defeat the drones in scenarios where military officials emphasize their options are limited by regulations that protect civilian travel, largely preventing them from using many commonly available but more aggressive kinetic and non-kinetic tools. 'By all indications, sUAS will present a safety and security risk to military installations and other critical infrastructure for the foreseeable future. Mitigating those risks requires a dedicated effort across all federal departments and agencies, state, local, tribal and territorial communities, and Congress to further develop the capabilities, coordination and legal authorities necessary for detecting, tracking and addressing potential sUAS threats in the homeland,' said NORTHCOM chief Gen. Gregory Guillot. According to a handout from NORTHCOM, representatives at Falcon Peak from industry included Leidos, Teledyne FLIR, Trakka Systems, D-Fend solutions, HGH USA, Fortem Technologies, and ICR. A handful of fielded DoD systems were also brought along. According to a spokesperson for NORTHCOM, 'Every participant' in the exercise, whether industry or DoD, 'had to detect, track [and] identify sUAS.' Only 'some' participants 'had the additional ability to mitigate/interdict' a drone threat. The vendors set up along a strip of road here near the foothills of Cheyenne Mountain, in an area of Fort Carson called Agony Hill, displaying their systems in demos throughout the Falcon Peak event. During the actual trials, the counter-drone systems were set up along a simulated perimeter of a base and were tasked with tracking and in some cases taking out adversary systems flown by a 'red' team, however they could. In countering drone incursions, the first step is knowing that it’s happening at all, and that’s where cutting-edge sensing technology, calibrated to spot small drones, comes in. 'I'm pretty confident in our ability to detect and track' mid-size and large drones, Guillot said in a roundtable with reporters ahead of the visit to Fort Carson. 'The purpose of this demonstration is to improve our ability to detect and track' small UAS, he added. For Falcon Peak, Teledyne FLIR brought along its Cerberus XL system, dragged straight from its debut at the AUSA expo in Washington. The Cerberus XL fuses radar, electro-optical/infrared and radio frequency (RF) sensors to detect and track drones, according to a press release from the company. That data can then be fed to different third-party effectors to defeat the drones — in the case of another demonstration, connecting to jammers aimed at taking down offending drones’ datalinks and denying them access to global navigation systems, according to the handout from NORTHCOM. (Breaking Defense did not view it in action.) Steve Pedrotty, Teledyne FLIR’s director of US Air Force programs, said in an interview on the sidelines of Falcon Peak that the event was a great opportunity, though he hoped to see the government firm up requirements. 'It's still kind of early in this cycle' of rapidly changing drone and counter-drone technologies, Pedrotty said. 'So honing in on the requirements would help.' Falcon Peak wasn’t just an opportunity for industry to see if their tech was up to snuff; the event was also a chance for existing DoD systems to make improvements. According to NORTHCOM’s handout, the SUADS — an apparent reference to the small uncrewed aircraft defense system — was among those in attendance, which the handout says uses electro-optical/infrared sensors to sense drones. 'Before you can shoot something, you have to see it,' Jason Mayes, counter-small unmanned aerial systems deputy test director for NORTHCOM, told reporters. 'So that's why we want to present profiles that those systems have never seen before, and see if we could, from a detection standpoint, beat those systems so that now the services understand you do really good up to this point, but they're not there yet,' he continued. 'So even on that side of the house, they have some homework to go do.' A small drone flies over a bus for distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) Once the drone is spotted, there are myriad ways to try and take it down — even before getting into options like shooting the things out of the sky, which current policy mostly prohibits on US soil. On the non-kinetic side, there’s cyber and electronic warfare: either hacking the drone to disable it or take it over, or jamming or spoofing its communications or navigation signals to render it 'lost' mid-operation. (Tactics like navigation disruption had to be closely coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration at Falcon Peak, as any disruption to civilian travel could spell danger to the general public.) One example outlined at Falcon Peak was ICR’s 'system of systems' called TMX and a specific cyber tool crafted by the company called Bullet. According to Mike Powell, executive director of counter-UAS at the company, Bullet works like a 'cyber scalpel RF system' that exploits the downlink of an adversary device to take it over. 'There's no footprint. You're not going to see it. It is a tiny signal that is only pointed at one drone at a time,' he said. 'We can do drones every second. So in 30 seconds, I can control a small swarm of drones with this system' and force them to land at a designated area, return to where they were launched from or force them straight down to earth by turning off rotors. (The Bullet tech was not demonstrated during Breaking Defense’s visit.) Even then, Powell acknowledged challenges to Bullet’s tactics in light of ever-evolving drone tech. For example, as intense signal interference has dominated the war in Ukraine, drones belonging to both sides have often had trouble reaching their targets. And now, newer systems are on the rise that can offer more resistance to interference, like drones that follow onboard maps rather than GPS to find their targets. That approach, in turn, makes hijacking drones electronically that much harder, if not impossible. A good radar is needed to sense those threats especially because they don’t emit detectable transmissions, Powell stressed, and a different effector is required to take the drone down. 'There's no RF signature. There's nothing to break into,' Powell said. 'That's the hardest problem.' Breaking Defense did not witness any electronic warfare or cyber techniques at the Falcon Peak demo, and a spokesperson for NORTHCOM said although the tactics were used over the course of the event, the 'specific number, type, and system is classified.' In the low-kinetic realm, there was Fortem Technologies’s DroneHunter, the one armed with a net referenced at the start of this report. In that demo witnessed by Breaking Defense and other media outlets, the system appeared to successfully demonstrate a non-intrusive, low-collateral way to bring down an sUAS threat with little threat to anyone else in the area. Spencer Prows, executive vice president of solutions engineering at Fortem, explained that the DroneHunter can integrate with other systems or work standalone with the company’s equipment, boasting a towing capacity of about five kilograms. If the intercepted airframe is small enough, DroneHunter can drag its captured quarry back to base, or, as Breaking Defense witnessed, simply bring it straight down to the ground with a parachute if it’s too heavy. Leidos’s AirShield also played a part in the demo, featuring a spindle-shaped drone effector called the Co-axial Unmanned Guided Autonomous Rotorcraft (CUGAR). It’s designed to take down sUAS by blanketing them with streamers, like ones you’d see at a gender reveal party. But the streamers were never launched in the demo Breaking Defense viewed, as Mayes, the event’s emcee, explained that a target drone was down for maintenance. Sometimes, it’s the enemy’s equipment that fails. Capabilities like net capture and streamers do hold promise for defeating sUAS along the lines of hobbyist systems, said Mayes. But the technology is challenged by faster and more agile drones like first-person view (FPV) systems gaining traction in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 'They do very, very good with that, because the profiles are fairly steady,' Mayes said of their ability to deal with slower, hobbyist-type drones. 'Once you start getting into some of the faster [UAS], like your FPV drones, these racing ones that are 150 to 200 miles an hour, or drones that have been outfitted to be very agile, the systems themselves are not able to keep up with that because of the agility of the other [drones].' Leidos's CUGAR effector hovers above attendees at Falcon Peak. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) The military is pondering whether its options for taking out drones could expand with the right guardrails — potentially featuring weapons like lasers and microwaves — as it pushes for policy changes that can better accommodate the need to fight off small drones on American soil, a key intergovernmental effort that will be the subject of a future Breaking Defense report. But at the end of the day, beyond all the complexities of new tech, the counter-UAS problem broadly is a cultural one too. Branches like the Marine Corps have declared plans to equip every squad with the capability to defend themselves against UAS, for example, and any new tactics or technologies will require doctrinal changes — as well as buy-in from troops doing the work. 'It takes time to change doctrine and tactics and techniques and procedures. It takes time for culture and the climate to change,' Command Sgt. Maj. Demetrius Johnson, senior enlisted advisor to the Pentagon’s Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, told reporters when asked what the timeline for a new counter-drone culture might look like. 'It's still a relatively new threat. And the threat is evolving. Every time the threat evolves, we have to go back to the drawing board and change doctrine and change tactics,' he said. 'So it's going to be ongoing, and I can't see where there's an end anywhere in sight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/nets-jamming-and-cyber-scalpels-pentagon-weighs-homeland-counter-drone-tech-in-mountain-tests/	2024-11-20T10:52:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/fortem-net-capture-scaled-e1732126428452.jpg
UK makes sweeping defense cuts, doing away with several warships, scores of helicopters and drones	The UK has announced it will scrap a fleet of British Army Watchkeeper drones BELFAST — In a surprise announcement, the UK has said it will scrap five warships, 31 helicopters and a fleet of 46 intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) drones. The move, announced in parliament today by UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey, will generate savings of £500 million ($632 million) over the next five years, he said, and get rid of 'outdated capabilities.' But it also drew immediate criticism from opposition party lawmakers. The cuts are 'all backed' by service chiefs and were made in consultation with personnel involved in the UK's strategic defense review — set to release results of equipment planning and strategic thinking in mid-2025. 'Allies have been informed and we have constant dialogue with NATO,' added Healey. On the naval side, two amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, will be withdrawn from service at the end of the year. Healey suggested the vessels had been 'effectively retired by previous ministers, but superficially kept on the books,' at a cost of £9 million a year. The Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland will be axed because of 'structural damage that makes her simply uneconomical to repair,' he noted, alongside two Wave-Class tankers, 'neither of which has been to sea for years.' Elsewhere, the British Army’s Watchkeeper drone fleet will be retired, a fate that follows years of delays, cost overruns and a series of test and operational crashes. As of September 2022, the UK had spent £1.31 billion on the program, according to a lawmaker statement. Watchkeeper initially entered service in 2014, supporting Afghanistan force protection efforts, but has not been involved in military operations since. The aircraft was deployed in 2020 over the English channel in a surveillance capacity to monitor migrant boats. A total of 14 CH-47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters, including 'some' that have been in service for 35 years, will be retired, in parallel with 17 Puma multirole rotorcraft. The Pumas had been due to be replaced under the £1 billion New Medium Helicopter acquisition, but that plan was thrown into disarray in August after Lockheed Martin and Airbus walked away without submitting bids for the NMH, leaving Leonardo as the last competitor standing. Prior to Healey's Puma declaration, London's strategic defense review, set for release in mid-2025, was expected to determine if NMH moved ahead or not. The phasing out of older Chinooks is a different matter because they are set to be replaced with new H-47ER (Extended Range) platforms beginning in 2027. 'The UK is the only nation to be provided access to this class-leading heavy-lift helicopter capability outside of the US,' said Grant Shapps, former UK defence secretary, in March. Healey revealed that in all the new cuts 'are set to save the MoD £150 million over the next two years, and up to £500 million over five years, savings that will be retained in full in defense.' Reacting to the changes, Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense think tank, said in a statement, 'These are mostly capabilities that are approaching retirement anyway, have been at low levels of readiness or aren’t worth further refits or investment (Watchkeeper is probably obsolete).' 'But the fact that Defence either can’t crew them, or is prepared to cut them to make very modest savings over five years in the current international environment is an indication of just how tight resources must be in the MOD right now,' he added. 'In particular, the Defence Review will be under pressure to set out the future role of the Royal Marines; how the Navy will bring into service and sustain more escorts, which are the workhorses of the fleet; and the impact upon helicopter capacity and procurement.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/uk-makes-sweeping-defense-cuts-doing-away-with-several-warships-scores-of-helicopters-and-drones/	2024-11-20T09:14:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/APOLOND-OFFICIAL-20221017-114-013.jpg.iCfFhcbqMWATAA.EhYLNwi3LY-e1732120552526.jpg
DIU picks 7 companies to support Replicator autonomy, C2 efforts	AeroVironment’s Switchblade 600 bares its teeth at Sea Air Space. The loitering munition has gotten real-world practice during the Ukraine conflict, as a number of the weapons have been sent from the US to Kyiv. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has inked deals with seven software developers and tasked them with moving out with autonomy and command and control work, aimed at propelling the Replicator initiative forward. 'Many leading AI [artificial intelligence] and autonomy firms are outside of our traditional defense industrial base, and DIU is working actively with partners across the department to bring the very best capabilities from the US tech sector to bear in support of our most critical warfighter needs,' DIU Director Doug Beck said in today’s announcement. 'This latest step in the Replicator initiative is a critical example of that teamwork in action.' While DIU did not disclose contract values or the work timeline associated with those new C2 and autonomy deals, it did provide a few insights into the competition pool while also announcing the winners. In the category of Opportunistic, Resilient &amp; Innovative Expeditionary Network Topology (ORIENT), 119 companies submitted 130 solution proposals. From that pool, DIU selected Aalyria, Higher Ground, IoT/AI and Viasat for prototyping work. Meanwhile, the office’s call for help with Autonomous Collaborative Teaming (ACT), designed to better automate the coordination between hundreds or thousands of unmanned drones, sparked 132 companies to submit 165 solutions. DIU has now whittled that down to three, awarding prototyping deals to Anduril Industries, L3Harris Technologies and Swarm Aero. 'We are seeing the strength of the joint teams that assemble to collaborate on the challenges of deploying autonomous systems including policy, software architecture, experimentation, and more,' Pentagon AI chief Radha Plumb said in the press release. In August 2023, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks launched Replicator as an avenue for countering China’s military mass by cranking out multiple thousands of 'attritable autonomous systems' within two years — think unmanned surface vessels and loitering drones. Earlier this month, the Pentagon confirmed a host of details about the initiative including that the two drones selected for the Army’s Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft System program — Ghost X from Anduril Industries and the C-100 from Performance Drone Works – were also both under the Replicator-1, Tranche 2 umbrella. The Marine Corps’ Organic Precision Fires program, which revolves around Anduril’s Altius-600, has also been deemed a Replicator initiative, and is there to complement the Switchblade-600 loitering munition that was previously announced as part of Replicator. The Air Force’s Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV), a drone prototyping competition, is also joining the Replicator pack. In addition to work on Replicator 1, the department announced plans for a second Replicator initiative in September, this time focusing on finding systems to counter small drones at US military installations across the globe.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/diu-picks-7-companies-to-support-replicator-autonomy-c2-efforts/	2024-11-20T09:00:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230405_SAS_underwater_drone_Mehta_crop.png
F-35 EW system for the future fight	Image courtesy of BAE Systems. Lisa Aucoin is the vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems (ES) sector. With more than 35 years of experience in the aerospace and defense industry, she has held numerous positions in engineering and program management. Previously, she was vice president of Engineering for the ES sector, leading more than 5,000 engineers and technical support staff. She is a certified Six Sigma Black Belt and holds a master's degree in physics from Northeastern University, and a bachelor's degree in physics from Valparaiso University. Lisa is exceptionally passionate about developing our next generation of scientists and engineers and is actively involved with organizations that foster curiosity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects through active student participation. We sat down to interview Lisa about electromagnetic warfare, the F-35 program, and her leadership. You are the vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems. Can you describe your organization and its focus? Lisa Aucoin, vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems (ES) sector. As a key partner on the F-35 program, we hold a 13 to 15 percent workshare of each aircraft, excluding propulsion, and we play a major role across multiple markets. I specifically lead the company’s F-35 program in the U.S. that has more than 1,000 employees dedicated to providing the electromagnetic warfare (EW) system for the F-35. As the EW system provider for the fifth-generation fighter, a role we’ve held since the program’s inception in 2001, we deliver a system that helps protect U.S. and allied forces. For those unfamiliar with EW, simply put, it is the use of electromagnetic (EM) or directed energy and integrated cyber capabilities to carry out military and intelligence missions. The more rigorously a military force exploits the full EM spectrum –– radio waves, microwaves, millimeter waves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet light, and gamma rays – and cyber effects, the more successfully it can pre-empt adversarial threats and respond to attacks electronically. The system needs to detect threats and identify them, and give pilots the opportunity to evade or engage. These threats include other fighter jets, missiles, anti-aircraft systems, drones, and other adversary weapons systems. Everyday those threats are evolving, becoming more complex and harder to detect and counter as the electromagnetic spectrum grows more congested. Our F-35 team is busy designing, developing, manufacturing, testing and repairing advanced systems that protect warfighters and enable them to conduct missions in highly contested battlespaces. Our people are highly skilled in disciplines including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, software development, manufacturing, supply chain management, and program management. The program requires everyone to come together to deliver an exceptional technical system for integration into one of the most sophisticated fighter jets ever flown. The AN/ASQ-239, the F-35 EW system, can detect a broad spectrum of electromagnetic signals in a 360-degree sphere around the aircraft at long range. This is done passively without emitting energy, making the F-35 less observable to adversaries. The systems’ 'staring' sensors are embedded throughout the aircraft, providing immediate detection of electromagnetic signals, giving pilots critical situational awareness, and allowing them to act first. By delivering long-range, all-aspect (360-degree) broad-spectrum EW capabilities, the system also increases the probability of signal intercept. BAE Systems has a long history in EW, how does the F-35 system fit into that portfolio? Our EW history goes back more than 60 years and our systems have flown on over 120 platforms. They operate on 80 percent of U.S. military fixed-wing aircraft, over 95 percent of U.S. Army rotary-wing aircraft, and those of U.S. allies. The F-35 EW system is a key part of our extensive EW portfolio that includes protecting fighter aircrafts like the F-15, F-16, and the F-22 platforms. What is the current status of the F-35 program and the EW system? To date, 1,600 F-35s have been delivered around the world. Each aircraft is equipped with our integrated EW system. The F-35 is expected to stay in service until 2070 and was designed for continual upgrades to help it outpace emerging threats throughout its six-decade service life. Recently, the F-35 platform achieved a significant milestone – it was cleared to enter full-rate production. As part of a broader strategy focused on whole-life mission effectiveness, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) entrusted BAE Systems to design and manufacture the next-generation 'Block 4' version of the system. The powerful Block 4 EW system will offer greater situational awareness, enhanced survivability, and increased capabilities to counter evolving threats. As an upgradeable system, Block 4 will combine adaptable hardware and incremental software updates to accelerate the delivery of advanced EW capabilities to warfighters. This will also reduce engineering and sustainment costs for the U.S. DoD and its allies. Block 4 systems will include significantly advanced hardware and software that improve sensing and signal-processing capabilities. New, high-performance sensors will boost the system’s ability to detect more difficult-to-observe threats. It will help warfighters execute missions today and into the future. What does success look like for you? There are two primary ways we measure success – technology and operational milestones. These are driven by evolving mission requirements and the need to innovate. Both types are important, but at the end of the day, it is about people –– our customers and our end-users. Protecting the warfighter is our north star. It really is what drives us. None of this would be possible without our people. We employ the best and brightest and we ask them to do very hard things. We talked about our long history in EW, but looking forward, a platform like the F-35 is expected to fly for 60 years. So, to achieve this, it is about culture. We have always focused on our current workforce, but we know culture is a long-term strategy. In many ways a focus on the future helps to drive today’s success. For example, the F-35 EW system was developed with the future in mind. Designed to be adaptable and upgradeable, it will be able to keep up with threats that haven’t been developed yet. It’s not a moment-in-time system, it is designed for the future fight, wherever that future leads. You mention preparing for the future, how do you build your workforce for the future? Internally, we have several leadership development programs for employees. Looking further into the future, we support STEM initiatives like FIRST® Robotics. BAE Systems has supported FIRST for 30 years –– working together to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM. The company provides funding to FIRST teams near ES sites nationwide, helps with robotics and coding grants for Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, and funds an annual college scholarship program for FIRST students. We value this partnership because we believe FIRST is building the next generation of innovators. Another element of building our future workforce is identifying and creating non-traditional entries into industry. One success story is our long-running Microelectronics Boot Camp program with Nashua Community College. The Microelectronics Boot Camp is a 10-week hands-on career training that was developed in partnership with BAE Systems in 2016 to prepare students for entry-level careers in wire/ribbon bonding and die attach for microelectronic components in manufacturing. The program recently celebrated its 30th cohort graduating class and has now graduated over 300 students with a 98 percent job placement rate –– with BAE Systems having hired more than half of these graduates. Final thoughts? Today’s F-35 system was built on the shoulders of giants. The technology leverages decades of innovation, lessons learned, and techniques and procedures cultivated over generations of an entire F-35 ecosystem and community. Past employees influenced those working on the program today and we are cultivating the workforce of tomorrow to assure that we continue to serve our warfighters for generations to come. At the end of the day, it is the history, the ecosystem, the focus on people and the future that drive me every day to come to work knowing I’m helping to safeguard generations of warfighters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/f-35-ew-system-for-the-future-fight/	2024-11-20T07:42:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/BAE-F-35-600x300-2.png
Why Germany’s Scholz won’t follow Biden on long-range strikes for Ukraine	Members of the German Armed Forces Bundeswehr carry a 'Taurus' weapon system during the International Aerospace Exhibition (ILA) in Schoenefeld on May 30, 2016. (TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) BELFAST — In the wake of the US government approving Ukraine to use Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to bow to new calls to supply Kyiv with desperately needed Taurus long-range precision missiles. The Swedish-German ballistic missile offers a range in excess of 500 kilometers and is designed to hit hardened targets like bunkers, bridges, and command and control facilities. Germany completed an order of 600 units for integration on Tornado IDS (Interdiction/Strike) fighter jets in 2010. Scholz publicly justified the decision not to make a Taurus approval on Monday at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, saying that he did not want to be held 'responsible' for the weapons 'targeting,' — a reference to his long stated redline that Taurus should not draw Germany into the war. Ukraine has reportedly since fired ATACMS to strike into Russia for the first time. Ukrainian officials said an initial salvo targeted an ammunition depot in the Bryansk region of southwestern Russia, according to the New York Times. Analysts Breaking Defense spoke with suggested that Scholz's position on Taurus effectively amounts to an attempt to protect his political career and argued that he has limited clout over Russia more broadly. If he was to change course, it would be 'deeply unpopular' with the left-leaning faction of the Social Democratic Party — to the extent that Scholz could 'say goodbye' to any chance of the SDP considering him for the chancellorship again, ahead of a new general election planned for February, according to Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert at the University of Oslo in Norway. The election was prompted by the Free Democratic Party leaving the coalition government, which is also made up of the SDP and the Greens. Speaking before Scholz's G20 press conference, Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense think tank, said, 'If Scholz could be moved, I suspect he would have done so by now — he was extremely negative about Taurus over the weekend, and although the Russian strikes almost immediately after his call with Putin show how little influence he has, it doesn’t look likely that he would respond by changing policy now.' Even if approved, Taurus would face problems reaching the frontline in Ukraine in a timely fashion. In February, a conversation about potential deliveries to Ukraine by German Air Force officials was intercepted by Russia and shared online by state broadcaster RT. The leak included the suggestion that Taurus operations could only begin eight months after political approval, based on training and mounts needed to integrate it on fighter jets. 'Taurus would require a new round of integration and validation work before they could be launched by Ukrainian aircraft (most likely the UAF’s relatively small number of Su-24 strike planes, which already carry Storm Shadow),' said Jacob Parakilas, research leader for defense strategy, policy and capabilities at RAND Europe. 'It might be easier to integrate onto the UAF’s newly-arrived F-16s, which have NATO-standard mounts and connectors, although Taurus is not currently certified for F-16 carriage and launch either — so it would be a matter of months before they could be used in either case.' The UK and France are expected to follow the lead of the US on ATACMS and approve Ukraine to launch Storm Shadow and SCALP long-range cruise missiles inside Russian territory. French newspaper Le Figaro reported that approvals by Paris and London had been given but later edited the story to clarify that debates are still ongoing. A spokesperson for the French President's Office declined to comment on specific weapon systems, deferring to an address by French President Emmanuel Macron during a state visit to Germany in May where he stated that, 'we must allow them [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked, but we must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia, obviously civilian capabilities or other military targets.' Macron added at that time, 'When Ukraine is attacked from identified targets in Russia, well, I think we have to be able to allow them to do that if we really want to retain our objective. And I think I can say that, factually, we are not escalating by doing this, since it is Russia that is organising itself in this way.' In the case of the UK and Storm Shadow, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment on whether an approval for Ukraine had been made. Earlier this week, UK Defence Secretary John Healey told another lawmaker that commenting on the issue 'risks operational security and the only person that benefits from public debate is President Putin,' according to the BBC.
