Navy awards General Dynamics NASSCO contract worth up to $6.7B for 8 new fleet oilers	The John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler is designed and built by General Dynamics NASSCO. (Photo courtesy of GD NASSCO.) WASHINGTON — The Navy today announced it has awarded General Dynamics NASSCO a contract worth up to $6.7 billion for the construction of up to eight John Lewis-class fleet oilers, a block buy deal the service anticipates will save $491 million. Tom Rivers, executive director for amphibious, auxiliary and sealift for program executive office ships, told reporters the contract also extends an ongoing shipbuilding capability preservation agreement the Navy has with NASSCO meant to incentivize shipbuilders to seek out commercial work. 'The way this works is … if NASCO is successful in getting the commercial work, the Navy will share some of the burden cost of overhead,' he told reporters shortly after the contract announcement was published. 'What happens is NASSCO becomes more competitive, and then the Navy, by bringing in additional commercial work, reduces our overhead, so our costs will go down.' He added that the statute dates back to the 1990s and has been in use with NASSCO for several years now, but the new contract extends the agreement into the mid-2030s. The service in 2016 awarded General Dynamics NASSCO a $3.2 billion contract for the design and construction of the first six ships of the John Lewis-class fleet oilers. Subsequently in 2022, the Navy bought two additional ships and then a third in 2023. With the addition of today's contract, the service will have agreements for up to 17 of the planned 20 ships in the class. Replenishment oilers carry jet fuel, diesel fuel and lubricating oil, and small quantities of fresh and frozen provisions, stores, potable water and other items, according to a Navy description of the Kaiser class, the legacy class of ships the newer vessels will replace. NASSCO is the San Diego-based shipbuilding arm of General Dynamics and is a staple Navy shipbuilder for various support and auxiliary vessels such as the John Lewis-class oilers and the expeditionary sea bases, as well as a ship repair yard. 'We are pleased to continue building these ships, with seventeen of the Navy’s twenty-ship program of record now on contract. This will make the T-AO program the longest Navy production series in NASSCO history,' Dave Carver, president of General Dynamics NASSCO, said in a statement. 'The NASSCO team is honored to continue working with our Navy customer and thankful for their unwavering support.' The Navy's current class of replenishment oiler ships were first constructed and launched in the 1980s by Avondale Shipyards, an independent shipyard that was acquired by several larger firms over the years but ultimately closed in 2014.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/navy-awards-general-dynamics-nassco-contract-worth-up-to-6-7b-for-8-new-fleet-oilers/	2024-09-13T15:03:25-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/image002-e1726262130539.jpg
State clears potential $4.1B KC-46 refuelers sale to Japan, $7.2B F-35 stealth fighters sale to Romania	A U.S. Air Force KC-46 Pegasus, right, refuels a U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon, center, assigned to the 80th Fighter Squadron, over the Indo-Pacific, Oct. 22, 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Karrla Parra) WASHINGTON — The US State Department today approved a possible $4.1 billion sale for up to nine KC-46A Pegasus tankers for Japan — a buy that would more than double Tokyo’s currently planned Pegasus fleet — as well as a potential sale of 32 F-35A stealth fighters for Romania at a price of $7.2 billion, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced today. While the Romanian F-35 deal has been long expected, Japan's apparent interest in additional tankers comes as more of a surprise. Tokyo is already one of two international operators of the KC-46A, which is built by Boeing. Lockheed Martin manufactures the tri-variant F-35 and boasts an 18-member international customer base for the jet. The US Air Force is the largest customer for both platforms. Both announcements, issued in the form of a congressional notification from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA), are not final. Quantities and dollar totals often shift during negotiations, and these announcements essentially permit the acquisition process to move forward. And today’s announcements technically tee up an opportunity for lawmakers to block the buys within a 30-day period, though such a step would be unlikely in either case. The KC-46A sale to Japan would appear to greatly expand Tokyo’s aerial refueling capabilities, critical for extending aircraft ranges over the vast stretches of ocean in the Indo-Pacific. Besides the refuelers themselves, the sale would include up to 18 PW4062 engines made by Pratt & Whitney, along with associated subsystems and support equipment. The announcement does not say when the aircraft would be expected to be delivered. A Boeing official, speaking on background, confirmed the potential sale of up to nine aircraft would add to six Pegasus refuelers already on contract with Tokyo, four of which have been delivered. Boeing referred further questions to the Japanese Ministry of Defense and the State Department. The State Department similarly referred questions to the MoD, which did not immediately respond to an off-hours request for comment. Japan does not appear to have previewed such a large potential buy publicly, though The Wall Street Journal reported recently that it had put aside some $1.4 billion in its newest defense budget for new KC-46s. RELATED: Boeing defense programs to feel the pinch as Seattle-based union votes to strike For its part, Romania announced in April 2023 that it intended to buy the F-35, adding Bucharest to a burgeoning international network of Joint Strike Fighter operators. The sale cleared by State today is reportedly the first of two planned tranches, with a second order of 16 jets expected sometime in the future. Romania, a NATO ally that borders Ukraine, previously said it was moving ahead with the purchase in a bid to deter Russian 'aggression.' The sale announced today includes 33 F135 engines made by Pratt & Whitney, as well as associated support equipment, according to DSCA. The DSCA release did not include an expected delivery date, but the Romanian Ministry of National Defence has previously said the first aircraft should be delivered in 2030.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/state-clears-potential-4-1b-kc-46-refuelers-sale-to-japan-7-2b-f-35-stealth-fighters-sale-to-romania/	2024-09-13T14:03:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan2_4866234-scaled-e1726259237975.jpg
Anduril moves its AI focus to the heavens, planning new space monitoring sats	Anduril intends to develop new space surveillance satellites, using its AI-powered Lattice software. (Illustration: Anduril) WASHINGTON — Defense startup Anduril Industries, perhaps most known for its artificial intelligence applications for drone warfare, is setting its sights farther up — using its own funds to develop new satellites for monitoring the heavens. In an announcement released today, Anduril's Senior Vice President of Space and Engineering Gokul Subramanian said the company intends for the satellites to be launched by the end of 2025 — with the Space Force clearly the target market. Top brass from both the Space Force and US Space Command repeatedly have said that improved space domain awareness is a first-order priority. Anduril is looking to design multiple payloads, all based on its AI-powered Lattice software, the same platform used to power the counter-drone capabilities currently in use under the company's nearly $1 billion contract with Special Operations Command. 'Anduril will design, manufacture, and integrate modular mission payloads designed to enable unique mission requirements, leveraging our extensive expertise across imaging, electronic warfare, command and control, and mission autonomy. These payloads will provide warfighters with real-time data exploitation, autonomous coordination of satellites, and resilient communication capabilities,' Subramanian said. The first launch 'will serve as a testbed for maturation of multiple Anduril and third party payloads which we will be announcing in the coming months,' he added. Anduril quietly has been building experience in the space domain awareness arena. Subramanian explained that the company has 'multiple hardware and software payloads already deployed on orbit,' and is 'delivering advanced systems that range from on-orbit edge processing of sensor data to resilient satellite command and control.' Anduril's new satellites also will build off of work in November 2022 to demonstrate the application of its Lattice software for communications with the radars and telescopes making up the military's Space Surveillance Network. 'This expeditionary effort required multiple unique, site-specific software integrations that transformed the legacy SSN sites from a legacy system of communication to a resilient, high speed and integrated operational mesh network,' the company said in a July 2023 press release. In addition, the release said, Anduril's mesh network was used to restore the communications system of the Ground-Based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance (GEODSS) System site in Maui, Hawaii, following a severe Kona Low storm. GEODSS is a network of telescopes — three at each of three sites in the US and at US Pacific Command — operated by Space Force Delta 2 as part of the overarching Space Surveillance Network. The company also has extensive experience in developing cameras and infrared sensor systems for its drones and counter-drone systems, having announced in February a new family of passive, long-range sensors, called Iris, for missions such as 'infrared search and track,' missile warning, and targeting.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/anduril-moves-its-ai-focus-to-the-heavens-planning-new-space-monitoring-sats/	2024-09-13T13:20:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/andurial-image-of-sat-e1726257864753.png
False start? DoD IG ‘terminated’ NGAD next-gen fighter review, but may revisit down the road	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department's Inspector General has quietly shelved a review of the Air Force's high-profile Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter program after it emerged that the service wasn't actually as far along in development as Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall had suggested in public remarks. The odd saga started in June 2022 when Kendall made headlines in announcing that the NGAD program had already entered the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase, kicking off intense speculation about which defense prime pulled in the lucrative contract. But on Sept. 19 that year Kendall reversed himself, saying he was only speaking in a 'colloquial sense' to indicate the plane was in the design process. 'I’ve been around doing this stuff for a long time, and I still think of engineering and manufacturing development as a phase in which you are working on the new design,' he reportedly said at a Defense News conference earlier in September. Despite the walkback, later that month the DoD IG announced it was reviewing the program 'to determine the extent to which the Air Force demonstrated that the critical technologies used in the [NGAD] fighter aircraft were mature enough' to enter into the EMD phase. The review was to involve 'site visits as necessary.' But then a few months after that, sometime in 2023, the IG 'terminated' the review 'because of other priorities at the time,' IG office spokesperson Mollie Halpern told Breaking Defense this week. She added that '[t]he project will be reconsidered in the future.' An Air Force spokesperson referred questions about the review to the IG’s office. Whatever work was done during the review, it evidently didn’t get very far. Kendall and service acquisition chief Andrew Hunter both told Breaking Defense at the RIAT air show in July that they were unaware of the IG’s review, adding that it had no impact on the recent decision to pause work on NGAD. 'They’re doing a very quiet review,' Kendall quipped at the time. With NGAD Reevaluation, Northrop Sees Potential Window Like the review of the plane, the fate of the NGAD fighter itself has been thrown into doubt in more recent months as the Air Force has paused the program to reconsider its options. Kendall has maintained the Air Force will field a sixth-gen fighter, and possibly make it optionally manned. Budgetary constraints combined with fundamental questions about the fighter’s design — meant to perform across the vast stretches of the Indo-Pacific against sophisticated Chinese air defenses — have driven the service’s hesitancy, Kendall has said. Delays with the NGAD decision have now cast considerable doubt on the prospect of awarding an EMD contract this year, a goal the Air Force established in May 2023. The contest is thought to be between Lockheed Martin and Boeing after Northrop Grumman publicly pulled out. RELATED: As Air Force deliberates sixth-gen fighter plans, much is at stake for Boeing Still, the reevaluation of NGAD could present new opportunities, at least according to Northrop CEO Kathy Warden. At the Morgan Stanley Laguna conference on Thursday, Warden suggested that, based on what the Air Force does, Northrop may rejoin the fray. (Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop are all separately vying for a next-gen Navy fighter, with engine primes GE Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney actively competing in both Air Force and Navy efforts as well.) 'The Air Force has taken a strategic pause on that program and are revalidating requirements and the path forward for it. If they determine that there will be a material change to the program, we would go back and reevaluate, just as we would any new opportunity, whether we think that it is a program that we're well differentiated to perform, whether we view the business case as one that makes sense for a company and our investors, and we would look at new alternatives,' she said. 'So we're monitoring that one.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/false-start-dod-ig-terminated-ngad-next-gen-fighter-review-but-may-revisit-down-the-road/	2024-09-13T12:21:00-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-R1-scaled-e1718985449640.jpg

Boeing defense programs to feel the pinch as Seattle-based union votes to strike	KC-46 under construction at Boeing's factory. (Boeing) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s machinists union in Washington state voted to strike late Thursday evening, putting near-term deliveries of the KC-46 and P-8 military aircraft in limbo. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents about 33,000 Boeing workers in the region, rejected a proposed deal that was endorsed by union leadership. Union members across the Seattle area, as well as some in Oregon and California, began striking at midnight local time. IAM said that 94 percent of its members voted to reject the contract, with 96 percent voting to strike. A two-thirds majority was required to strike. A strike at two of Boeing’s major commercial plane factories near Seattle threatens to plunge the company into further financial disarray as it grapples with a safety crisis that has hampered airplane production this year. The strike stops production of Boeing’s 737, 767 and 777 jetliners as well as military derivatives of those aircraft, which include the 737-based P-8 Poseidon maritime aircraft and the 767-based KC-46 tanker. 'The tanker program is going to be impacted by the BCA [Boeing commercial airplanes] factory disruption and now work stoppage,' Boeing Chief Financial Officer Brian West said during the Morgan Stanley Laguna conference today. 'That is going to flow through the tanker [production] rates, which is going to be more cost pressure [on Boeing’s defense unit].' Specifically, the strike could hamper Boeing’s ability to deliver 15 KC-46 tankers to the Air Force by the end of 2024, depending on the length of the work stoppage. Over the first half of the year, Boeing delivered three P-8s and five KC-46s, the company said in July. Boeing delivery data shows an additional two 767s were delivered to its defense unit in July for conversion into KC-46s for the Air Force. West said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg is 'already at work' to get an agreement that addresses workers’ concerns, and that the company is focused on conserving cash during the strike. 'Kelly has been in Seattle all week getting first-hand information about the situation on the ground, and his priorities are to reset, reengage and rebuild,' West said. 'So how that plays out, in terms of timetable that will be up to the union the bargaining table participants to decide upon, but our intent is to get back to table and try to get an agreement.' IAM headquarters will make 'every resource available' to the local union groups now on strike, the union said in a statement. 'We are incredibly proud of the hard work and dedication shown by the negotiating teams from District 751 and W24 and the unwavering solidarity of our membership,' the union stated. 'Their tireless efforts have been on display throughout this entire process. Now, they will regroup and begin planning the next steps on securing an agreement that our membership can approve.' The Pentagon, Air Force and Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Strike Comes Despite Earlier ‘Reset’ Pledge Ortberg has sought to ameliorate the company’s relationship with its Puget Sound-area union, which deteriorated under the leadership of previous executives who publicly and sharply criticized the union in prior negotiations. Ortberg met with local IAM leaders shortly after taking the reins of the beleaguered company in August, pledging to 'reset' relations with the machinists, Aviation Week reported then. On Sunday, Boeing and IAM leadership endorsed a deal that promised a 25 percent general wage increase, reduced health care costs, improved terms on retirement benefits and a promise to build the next commercial airplane in the Puget Sound area, if announced during the life of the contract. The agreement fell short of IAM’s original objectives, which included boosting wages by 40 percent and reinstating Boeing’s pension plan, which was cut in 2014 in order to assure 777X production in Puget Sound. Analysts were optimistic that the backing of IAM’s leadership would get the deal over the finish line, but it quickly became clear that rank and file membership was not supportive. On Monday, IAM 751 President Jon Holden told the Seattle Times that he expected members to reject the contract and vote to strike. 'We have achieved everything we could in bargaining, short of a strike,' Holden said in a message to union members posted to the organization’s website on Monday. 'We recommended acceptance because we can't guarantee we can achieve more in a strike. But that is your decision to make and is a decision that we will protect and support, no matter what.' In a Wednesday letter to the workforce, Ortberg said a strike would put Boeing’s recovery in jeopardy, calling it a path 'where no one wins.' 'I know the reaction to our tentative agreement with the IAM has been passionate,' he said. 'I understand and respect that passion, but I ask you not to sacrifice the opportunity to secure our future together, because of the frustrations of the past.' Depending on the length of the strike, the work stoppage in Seattle could further squeeze margins at Boeing’s defense unit, which West said are expected to be negative again in the third quarter, with financial performance on par with the previous quarter when the company booked $527 million in losses. West said the results were a 'disappointment' and driven by cost pressures in two areas. First, the costs of winding down F/A-18 Super Hornet production and ramping up F-15EX production is proving to be more expensive than previously estimated. Cost overruns on fixed-price development programs — long a bane of Boeing’s defense earnings — also continue to be a problem, with West calling out 'development hurdles' on the Air Force’s T-7 trainer and Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone. Based on the duration of previous strikes, it is 'realistic' to assume that the current strike will last about 50 days, ending before the strike fund runs low ahead of the holiday season, Cai von Rumohr, an aerospace analyst with TD Cowen, wrote in a note to investors earlier this week. A strike of that length would cost Boeing about an estimated $3.5 billion in cash flow. Ron Epstein, an aerospace analyst for Bank of America and a former Boeing engineer, said that while previous strikes have hovered around the 60-day mark, last year’s strike at Boeing supplier Spirit AeroSystems could offer a precedent for a much more rapid negotiation — one that could end in as little as a week. 'We see it likely Boeing would have to make further concessions and move closer to the IAM's initial proposal of 40 [percent] wage gains,' Epstein said in the note to investors this morning.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/boeing-defense-programs-to-feel-the-pinch-as-seattle-based-union-votes-to-strike/	2024-09-13T10:59:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/KC-46-Boeing-factory-tanker-750xx960-541-0-55.jpg
Outgunned, outranged: The Ukraine war illustrates where fires modernization is needed	ARTEC RCH 155 - automated artillery firepower with shoot-on-the-move capability. Photo courtesy of KNDS. It’s not often that anyone would think of the U.S. as being outgunned in this day and age, but in the realm of artillery it’s likely true. While most NATO countries, much of Europe, and near-peer adversaries like Russia and China went to longer L52 cannon barrels years ago that provide greater range, the U.S. Army still uses and only manufactures the smaller L39 barrel that provides what can only be called 'last-generation' capability for 155mm field guns. The Ukraine war has made it clear that less artillery range is always going to be a losing proposition against an adversary with longer-range firepower. 'The U.S. field artillery fleet has been an L39 caliber length tube based cannon system for the last 60 years.' said Jon Milner, director of business development, Weapon and Ammunition, American Rheinmetall Defense. 'NATO and most of the world moved on to L52 length 155mm systems two decades ago because an L52 can shoot further than an L39. That's where the U.S. is literally outgunned and outranged by allies and adversaries.' This isn’t to say, though, that the U.S. Army hasn’t made significant investments and strides in fires modernization. The first increment of the Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) is being developed to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System. The service is also introducing the Mid-Range Capability, also known as Typhon, to strike targets with SM-6 and Tomahawk missiles at ranges from 300-1,725 miles that aren’t covered by PrSM and under-developmental hypersonic missiles. Rocket artillery has also enabled important advancements in precision strike, but lacks in mass. The Army has invested in advancing cannon projectiles and has gained significant advances in longer range solutions as seen with the XM1113 and XM1155 programs. But even with these important programs, tactical fires modernization continues to lag behind the threats. In one prominent example, earlier this year the Army canceled the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) program, keeping the M1299 self-propelled 155mm howitzer prototype an S&T effort. This has left the Army with an enduring, and problematic gap in its extended range tactical fire solutions, exacerbated by the fact that legacy artillery systems had already fallen behind our allies and adversaries. And there’s an additional challenge – the Army artillery fleet had also shrunk. 'In addition to the smaller caliber of the cannons in the Army’s existing fielded systems, the U.S. has not kept up with the threat in increasing the number of artillery units,' noted Milner. 'Since the Cold War, the U.S. has shrunk the artillery corps significantly, while our pacing threats, China and Russia have only increased their artillery number alongside giving it cannons with more range than U.S. systems.' Closing gaps in tactical fires can potentially be accomplished more quickly and cost effectively by following a time-honored acquisition method right out of the program-management playbook that calls for adopting rather than adapting systems that are already in production – and adopting a common moniker used since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, 'buy Allied.' Filling the Fires Capability and Capacity Gaps Army Futures Command Concept for Fires 2028 has validated the need to move away from certain existing systems in the arsenal that 'lack sufficient capacity, lethality, and range to deter and defeat peer threats.' The report went on to state: 'Peer threats have already demonstrated the ability to organize a highly effective fires complex (UAS, rocket artillery, and IADS) to detect targets, mass fires, and protect themselves. Enhanced threat capabilities will enable engagement of friendly fire support elements at standoff weapon ranges, precluding or pre-empting friendly fire support operations.' The U.S., Ukraine, and NATO also must have the capability to operate fires from standoff distances. Most NATO and European countries already have certain standoff ability because they all employ 52-caliber cannons, as mentioned. That leaves only U.S. systems with L39 barrels vulnerable due to their limited range. 'The term the Army uses is that our tactical fires lack capability and capacity,' said Michael Milner, vice president for business development and strategy, American Rheinmetall Vehicles. 'The capability is the range that we can fire and the capacity is the number of rounds we can put down range in a given amount of time. 'No one in the rest of the world wants or is buying a 39 caliber capability. Of course, Ukraine will take what it can get. Anything we can give Ukraine is good. However, what that means for the Ukrainians who have to operate these L39 U.S. systems is that for the guns to be able to range the enemy, they will always have to be in range of the enemy’s artillery. This is not the equation we want for our ally Ukraine in this fight nor for American Soldiers in any fight we might have in the future.' That’s arguably one of the most glaring tactical gaps in U.S. fires, and one that’s also tailor made for acquisition by adoption. In the case of artillery, adopt means acquiring a system that’s already in production and being fielded. There will be certain straightforward integration elements necessary such as different radios or fire control systems like Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). What you want to avoid though, is the adaption of that system, e.g., changing a fundamental architectural element such as adding armor, which increases weight and could require a new suspension, or inserting a different cannon. 'Adapting rather than adopting a proven system takes you from an off-the-shelf system to something that becomes bespoke and will take time, money, and effort to get it to where it’s what you need,' said Michael Milner. 'The priority, on the other hand, is rapidly fielding capability, which is what the Army's looking for with its desire to get capability into the field by 2030 that meets as much of the ERCA requirements as possible.' Achieving ERCA requirements requires not only an improved armament but the ability for heightened self-protection through mobility and self-propulsion, as well as automation of the firing system. Today’s advanced self-propelled, automated systems can fire eight to nine rounds per minute and then pick up and move immediately. Before the first rounds even hit the ground, that vehicle is moving to another location before the enemy can pick up the firing on radar and launch counter fires. 'This also plays into the new capability of battlefield drones where you're under persistent surveillance,' said Michael Milner. 'If you pick up an enemy drone, you’ve got to be able to move quickly. Current U.S. towed systems lack that capability because once the towed system is in place, it takes about a minute and a half to two minutes to get it moving while you're sitting there stationary.' A survey of artillery systems around the world shows several existing systems that could fit the bill and fill the gap, including the PzH 2000 and RCH 155 from KNDS Deutschland (formerly Krauss-Maffei Wegmann). Both are equipped with Rheinmetall’s combat proven, world-class main armament L52 artillery cannon. Both would also fill the Defense Department’s gap for a self-propelled 155mm howitzer with improved range, survivability, technology, and firing rates. Given the scale such a program would take on, the DoD would be expected to want such systems built in the U.S., but that would take several years at a minimum to stand up the factory and supply chain – leaving the capability gap in place for longer than defense leaders want. There’s a way, however, to both build them domestically and also start receiving and fielding them years sooner. 'U.S. Army leadership has said they are willing to accept a foreign-built system for the first two years of production and then it has to be moved onshore,' said Michael Milner. 'That third year of production, you have to have a facility and supply chain established, transition all the intellectual property to U.S. shores, and bring that cannon capacity, vehicle capacity, and artillery gun module capacity into the United States. 'That's no problem for American Rheinmetall; that's already an approach built into our business model,' he said. American Rheinmetall has the ability to design and build in the U.S., as it is doing for the turret on its XM30 Combat Vehicle which was 100 percent designed domestically by Rheinmetall’s U.S. engineers and being built in the U.S. It also has the ability to quickly receive a transfer of technology from its European parent and partners and execute localization of supply chains, production, and design updates inside the U.S. The same approach can help the Army not just in rapidly fielding a new ERCA capability, but for adding critical capability to its substantial M109A7 self-propelled howitzer fleet. American Rheinmetall, with key partners, can provide for 52 caliber cannon insertion in the M109A7, which would remove the out-gunned nature of these important systems and also bring valuable commonality in the cannon system if an ERCA solution like the RCH 155 were adopted. Rheinmetall and BAE developed just such an Independent Research and Development (IRAD) M109A7 L52 demonstrator, which the team test fired last year, showcased at AUSA 2023, and has a robust fall live fire schedule planned. Rheinmetall has, in fact, moved manufacturing capabilities to customer locations multiple times, including in Australia and Hungary where Rheinmetall took the opportunity to build state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to support those nation's needs. Said Michael Milner, 'Compare that to how it’s done here where we are still building combat vehicles very similar to how we did in World War II.' The production of U.S. cannons is currently at a state that can be considered a single point of failure. The only U.S. capability for producing ground forces/Army and Marine Corps cannons today is at Watervliet Arsenal, NY. The Army is in the process of modernizing the facility, however, with the addition of the L52 cannon into the U.S. fleet, capacity is an issue. Rheinmetall, as the world’s premier supplier of L52 cannons is ready to apply their successful approach to localizing cannon production to augment Watervliet’s capability issue and fill the gap of capacity. Innovation at the round: Assegai V-LAP and Extended Range Charge for L39 and L52 systems. Image courtesy of American Rheinmetall. Innovation at the round Another reason to adopt is so the U.S. and others can take advantage of the latest innovations at the round. This was also one of the outputs of the tactical fires study from Army Futures Command. It’s an area where Rheinmetall, a global leader in large caliber munitions technology, is always working to evolve projectiles and propellants so operators can squeeze more range out of their systems – whether they’re L39 or L52 based – and includes portfolio munitions like the Assegai Velocity-enhanced Long range Artillery Projectile (V-LAP), DM92 propellant, and extended range charge. The Assegai family of 155 projectiles is ballistically matched so all the projectiles behave the same and are state-of-the-art for long range. Assegai V-LAP set world records during a 2019 test for ranges at well beyond 70 kilometers. The DM92 propellant, which is the current propellant for the German Army and its PzH 2000 fleet, is tuned for the Rheinmetall L52 barrel. If the U.S. adopted that caliber and integrated the L52 on the M109 or in its ERCA program, there’s a ready, high performing propellant that can be adopted by the U.S. for that purpose. Rheinmetall has also qualified an extended range charge, the Supercharge, for several howitzers, including the Australian M777. The Supercharge allows operators to fire at longer ranges from the L52 cannon and adds 10 percent longer range from the L39 cannon. It was developed to 'buy back' the drag – the penalty that happens when using course-correcting fuzes, which are important for armies and precision fires. Additionally, the Supercharge is extremely clean burning and leaves little residue in the barrel which assists in extending the life of the barrel. Strengthening the Defense Industrial Base to close the gaps 'American Rheinmetall is a committed partner for the U.S. Army, fully focused on their field artillery requirements and localizing next-gen technology,' said Jon Milner. 'U.S. Cannoneers have been pulling lanyards and swabbing breaches since the Revolutionary War, and it’s time to get beyond that paradigm. 'The RCH 155 and M109-52 along with Rheinmetall’s family of ammunition provide real modernization solutions adoptable now to restore tactical fires overmatch, enhance the U.S. industrial base including bringing new jobs and capability, and delivering fast by sequencing delivery of proven systems from an allied base and then effectively and rapidly transitioning the technology and its production into the U.S. This is a proven capability at Rheinmetall.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/outgunned-outranged-the-ukraine-war-illustrates-where-fires-modernization-is-needed/	2024-09-13T10:20:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Artillery-Main-Image-600x300-V04.jpg
The Army doth protest too much: In Space, jointness must come first	Col. Mark Cobos, commander, 1st Space Brigade, US Army Space and Missile Defense Command, thanks Chief of Space Operations US Space Force Gen. Chance Saltzman and Chief Master Sgt. of the Space Force John F. Bentivegna for visiting the brigade headquarters at Fort Carson, Colo., April 10. (US Army photo by Dottie White) Our Aug. 13 op-ed on the Army’s overreach to create a new space career field and expand its space control capabilities struck a surprising chord, and generated a robust and frankly overdue debate about the Army’s role in space. After reading the Army’s formal rebuttal, visiting soldiers doing space missions, and having many conversations with members of the US Space Command, our takeaway is clear: The need to clearly understand the distinctions in roles and functions of the various services and combatant commands is foundational to the success of joint operations, and the conversation around the Space Force and its relationships needs to continue for all stakeholders to really understand each other’s stances. In our discussions since our first op-ed, we have concluded that there are three broad reasons behind the Army’s desire to increase its organic space expertise and capabilities. While these may make sense from a pure Army perspective, it does not mean they fit into the integrated warfighting construct now being pushed by top Pentagon leaders, who understand that joint collaboration is the best way to maximize effectiveness and efficiencies to win. First, the space missions are just the latest in a pattern of Army actions stemming from what appears to be deep-seated mistrust of other services providing tactically relevant cross-domain support. This sentiment goes back decades and spans multiple military functions. This is why the Army maintains its own uninhabited aerial vehicles for its own 'organic' use, of the same class that the Air Force operates for joint force application. This is also why the Army is now spending over $990 million on long-range fixed-wing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft. At the heart of these efforts is the desire to maintain control. The underlying mindset seems to be that if the Army doesn’t directly control it, they can’t trust it to deliver their desired effects. While it is understandable that an Army commander would feel this way, this is the antithesis of joint integration at a time when no one service will ever fight by itself. The second major factor is money, and maintaining funding priority in a new warfighting environment. This is clearly the case with the Army’s pursuit of very long-range, theater-capable hypersonic missiles (at over $50 million a shot) in response to China becoming the Department of Defense’s 'pacing' threat. Over two decades following 9/11, the Army received $1.3 trillion more than the Air Force, largely thanks to the focus on counter-insurgency operations. Given the nature of the threat and the priority to our nation, this was a justified expenditure. As the preponderance of forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, the Army used these funds for missions critical to our defense strategy at the time. They also used this money to modernize their equipment across the entire Army. But this was not without negative impacts to the other services. A 2022 Mitchell Institute paper describes how other services that were the source of the funding for the Army severely atrophied. As our nation and its military’s attention now shift to China, the relative priority and corresponding funding should likewise shift from the Army back to the Air Force, Space Force, and Navy, to reflect the preponderance of forces that will be involved in a China fight. Third, there is a breakdown in the joint lexicon for space missions and functions. For example, the Army states its systems are for space control, to 'interdict' adversary use of space against their soldiers in combat, as a service-unique requirement. But all service components that comprise a joint task force require protection from adversary space-enabled attacks. This is, in fact, a key element of space superiority and the central role of the Space Force, along with the continued delivery of capabilities and effects such as missile warning, satellite communication, space-based environmental monitoring, and position, navigation, and timing. The Space Force must secure our nation’s ability to deliver space capabilities and effects while denying the same to adversaries. The Army component of a joint task force—just like every other service component—may have requirements to interdict adversary use of space, but national leaders must clearly understand that space interdiction is simply a facet of space superiority. Trying to achieve it piecemeal would be like trying to achieve localized air superiority with fighters assigned to Army units—it doesn’t work. The current Army rationale is anachronistic when today, the Space Force and US Space Command are now assigned and responsible for performing this mission. Modern War Requires A Modern Joint Construct A long-standing mistrust of joint operations, improper budget prioritization, and terminology that is confusing and outdated is a recipe for failure against a peer adversary like China. The Department of Defense must take steps to better align and synchronize joint efforts if initiatives like Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) and the delivery of overwhelming cross-domain effects are to be realized. The following suggestions are aimed at increasing collaboration and ensuring future joint and coalition operations have the tools and skills to win against any adversary. 1) Most simply, all services should develop new space capabilities consistent with existing joint processes. Right now, that means the Joint Requirements Oversight Committee must validate an existing requirement. Then an analysis of potential non-materiel solutions must conclude that a materiel solution will be necessary to adequately address the requirement. Finally, the Space Acquisition Council must then determine which material solution(s) are necessary and which service will lead the efforts. As the DoD lead for space integration, the Space Force, through the Space Acquisition Council, must have a leading role in defining the integrated space architecture. Once fielded, regardless of the service operating the system, US Space Command must centrally coordinate space superiority effects. This approach ensures the appropriate allocation of taxpayer dollars, synchronizes operations, and avoids unintentional redundancy. 2) Additionally, all services must prioritize the execution of their existing assigned responsibilities that are critical for joint force operations over those that are parochial. For example, the Army is responsible for base defense and must deliver an effective suite of air and missile defense capabilities essential for all the service component requirements for future conflict. This is an Army mission, and they should fund it. Failing that, the other services should be funded to field active defense systems for their forward operating bases, and the Army budget reduced accordingly. 3) The Department of Defense should conduct a review of existing service and joint publications to ensure doctrine, policy, and organizational roles and responsibilities are consistent with service core missions and appropriate joint agreements. Previous updates conducted immediately after the stand-up of the Space Force had accelerated timelines and happened during a period when the Space Force's presence in the Pentagon was woefully understaffed. Now five years later, it is time to reassess these documents to ensure they accurately reflect the relationships and responsibilities of all services as they relate to space missions. Guardians assigned to the Pentagon, on the Space Force Staff, Joint Staff, or Office of the Secretary of Defense Staff, should scrutinize the language in policy and ensure service equities are properly addressed. 4) To improve cohesion and trust, the DoD should ramp up joint and coalition exercises and training events that specifically address the role of space operations. It takes practice and repetition to develop trust and refine the operational and tactical effectiveness of joint and coalition operations. When possible, these exercises should employ live jamming and coordination of joint fires to increase realism and refine employment tactics, techniques, and procedures. 5) Congress must ensure the resources and organizations within the Department of Defense are consistent with the spirit and intent of the guidance that created the Space Force and US Space Command. Congress should review joint space programs to verify the DoD is developing them with joint operations in mind and that they have followed the appropriate processes to ensure the most effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars. 6) The current overlap in perceived service roles in space operations with the Space Force is reason enough for Congress to direct the establishment of a commission, independent from the Department of Defense, to conduct a review of service roles and missions. The last such commission conducted this kind of review in 1994/95, well before the standup of the Space Force. While longstanding agreements should remain in place, new functions and authorities related to space and cyber would benefit from an updated evaluation and agreement. These are dangerous times. Organizing the DoD to ensure the United States is prepared for future challenges is vital. The discussion on Army overreach highlights the need to properly steward our nation’s resources to maximize effectiveness and lethality in a fiscally responsible and coordinated manner. There is undoubtedly a role for the Army and all services when it comes to space security. However, the DoD must identify and develop these approaches in a deliberate and coordinated manner, not passively allowing the services to independently and parochially pursue what only they determine is necessary for their own service component purposes.

Aussie military inks contracts for quantum clocks to aid ‘maritime domain awareness’	LANDFORCES — The Australian military has awarded a physics startup two contracts for a quantum clock designed to provide greater accuracy and a week or more of GPS coverage if conventional GPS is jammed or attacked. The deals, announced here this morning, mean Australia will buy QuantX Labs' quantum optical atomic clocks 'to support superior decision advantage and enhanced maritime domain awareness' for the Australian Defense Force, an ADF statement said. The head of operations for QuantX, Sandy Sinclair, said the announcement of the $2.7 million ($1.8 million USD) in deals 'is worth writing about because it's the first demonstration of quantum technology under AUKUS Pillar II.' ​The ADF statement carefully notes that these 'are key objectives under AUKUS Pillar II,' but it does not claim that they are being done as part of the second pillar, which focuses on a range of advanced technologies, including quantum, artificial intelligence and autonomy. 'Defense will increasingly leverage emerging disruptive technologies such as quantum to provide a capability edge for the warfighter,' Chief Defence Scientist Tanya Monro said in a statement. 'This is the first sale for QuantX Labs and a prime example of the collaborative relationships needed to transition leading-edge sovereign research into advanced operational capabilities for the Australian Defence Force.' Last year, the US Air Force Research Laboratory, the US Navy, and foreign partners from the Five Eyes alliance collaborated to test quantum tech at sea during the annual Rim of the Pacific exercises. Few details were released at the time. The portable atomic clocks are the result of more than seven years of research and development at the Institute of Photonics and Advanced Sensing at the University of Adelaide. 'So we're offering very similar performance to a hydrogen maser, which already exists, but in a much smaller form factor,' Sinclair told Breaking Defense. 'We will be accelerating that performance over the next couple of years in future iterations of the clock to a much better performance.' QuantX's clock uses a laser on rubidium molecules, targeting one to 'excite' it and then the 'physics package' emits a persistent radio frequency signal. ​Testing for the tech, the ADF statement said, will focus on 'operational resilience in global positioning systems (GPS) degraded environments.' In the event of attacks on the GPS network the Quantx clock should be able to provide signals for a week or more, Sinclair said. Militaries the world over have been racing to find alternatives to GPS, assuming that in the next conflict they're be operating where GPS is unavailable, whether naturally or due to enemy interference. ​The box containing the clock and its lasers will be part of a mobile test and measurement system, delivered in early 2025. The size of the clock is a major part of the company's success. They've reduced it to the size big enough for four servers and it will soon, Sinclair said, shrink to only three server slots in size.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/aussie-military-inks-contracts-for-quantum-clocks-to-aid-maritime-domain-awareness/	2024-09-13T07:45:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/QuantX-Quantum-GPS-clock-box.png
‘Biggest thing … for years’: Industry eagerly awaits next phase of Australian Army network contract	Project Currawong SATCOM trailer. (Boeing Australia) LANDFORCES — Multiple industry players appear to be positioning themselves here in Australia for what one executive called 'the biggest thing in town regarding comms — and will be for years to come.' The Australian military is expected to begin the competition to pick a winner for what some in industry believe will be a contract worth hundreds of millions to build and maintain the Army's new battlefield communications network early next year. Boeing Australia, builder of the Currawong tactical radio program, believes it has the inside track to win what is called Land 4140 because of that experience. But Boeing is not uncontested. 'It is a program we are tracking closely,' a Hanwha Defense Australia spokesperson said today. Executives here were closed lipped about the program, but the Australian arms of L3Harris, Leidos and Lockheed Martin are all believed to be similarly tracking the program. The Australian military released a request for information related to Land 4140, also known as the Land C4 Modernisation Project or the LC4 Program, in June 2022, saying it 'will modernise and enhance Land C4 systems in order to deliver decision-making superiority and improve the Command and Control, intelligence, sensors, and weapon system effectors, essential for the conduct of Joint Land Force operations.' Earlier this week the military requested that defense firms raise their hand if they're interested in Tranche 1 of the project, and said they expect the delivery timeframe for the tech to run from 2025 to 2030. The acquisition approach appears different from standard Australian programs where a prime contractor would design and build the system. Eager to ensure the software-heavy communications system would be regularly upgraded to cope with new cyber and electronic warfare threats, the government wants what it is calling a 'program integration partner.' It would be supplemented or augmented by at least one panel that apparently would approve the upgrades. Boeing executives, clearly hopeful they might win based on their Project Currawong work, spoke with reporters here about the program. 'So they're looking for a company that has the pedigree, the relationships, the right behaviors, the right experience, the right capabilities to partner with them over the next 10 years to help them effectively build the next generation of networks,' Darcy Rawlinson, a senior IT and cyber executive at Boeing Australia. It will be a challenging venture, according to the scope Rawlinson described. 'It's all the communications that army needs, from the forward rifleman, who's walking around carrying his pack, who's really just talking on a radio right the way through to a big Joint Task Force headquarters with heaps of people in it, a field hospital with big logistics sort of node — everything that's deployed,' he said. The executives who spoke with Breaking Defense made it clear the program is still evolving. The formal request for tender, when companies will have to decide whether to bid and how, is scheduled for the second quarter of 2025.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/biggest-thing-for-years-industry-eagerly-awaits-next-phase-of-australian-army-network-contract/	2024-09-13T06:40:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Currawong-SATCOM-trailer-e1664974372918.jpeg
Take off ‘handcuffs’ and make DoD information technology buying more ‘agile,’ DISA official says	The US and China are in a technology arms race. But which side has the best path forward? (Wong Yu Liang/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense must streamline its information technology procurement and acquisition policies if the US wants to stay ahead of its adversaries in coming years, according to John Hale, the chief of cloud services at the Defense Information Systems Agency. With the current policies, the DoD has to plan its budget so far in advance that it has trouble being flexible and adaptable to new technologies, Hale said during a General Dynamics Information Technology event Thursday. 'We still buy IT as if it was a weapon system. You have to do your planning and your budget cycles in such a way that don't really facilitate agile capabilities,' he said. 'It’s September of 2024. I just submitted my budget for 2026, and in that budget I had to submit my five year plan. So not only did I submit my budget for 2026, I had to also plan what I was going to spend all the way through to 2031. 'In today's world with with how rapid things are changing and how agile technology and capabilities are, those are the handcuffs that we're playing against,' he added. RELATED: Pentagon lacks 'comprehensive' strategy for buying AI tech, GAO warns Speaking to Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the event, Hale emphasized his concerns around falling behind China and other adversaries because the US’s current defense procurement and acquisition policies don’t account for unknown emerging technologies. 'What I don't want to have happen is for some new capabilities to come available that we simply can't get to in a timely fashion,' he told Breaking Defense. 'We're following policies that our adversaries don't. So a lot of the capabilities that we're talking about when we talk about AI, machine learning, our adversary is taking full advantage of them, and we are too for the extent that we can get access to. 'But the acquisition timelines that we have to deal with in the US are much longer than what our adversaries are doing. If we can streamline our acquisition processes, then we're going to be able to put capabilities in the hands of the warfighter quickly,' he added. Hales said US tech procurement is 'rooted in 1945 thought and and we're just, we're way beyond that.' Specifically, the stagnation is hindering one key process that's under Hales immediate purview: the transition of DoD data to the cloud. When asked how he’s trying to fix this, Hale joked, 'I pretty much just banged my head against the wall on a regular basis.' In reality, he said that he works 'very closely with the department's acquisition arm, and we're working diligently to try to change those policies where we can, but it is a long road.' Hales's frustrations are nothing new for the Pentagon, which for years has attempted in fits and starts to streamline emerging tech acquisition, especially when it comes to quickly evolving software, including through rapid development initiatives. RELATED: 3 steps towards fixing the acquisition insanity at the Pentagon As far as the cloud goes, the Pentagon is in the midst of a massive migration to the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC), an initiative launched in 2022 to provide cloud services for the Pentagon and each military branch. The contract is worth up to a collective $9 billion. 'We just crossed the $1 billion mark this last month of consumption of that contract vehicle, and so that provides an easy contract vehicle for the access to the four large, hyper scale cloud providers,' Hale said during his panel.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/take-off-handcuffs-and-make-dod-information-technology-buying-more-agile-disa-official-says/	2024-09-13T05:25:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/china-us-chip-scaled-e1716994085963.jpg
CCA: The operational concepts driving the Air Force’s future drone program [VIDEO #2]	WASHINGTON — The Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program could prove to be the heart of America's future airpower — but even as the technology is slowly developing, the service has a lot of questions to figure out how, exactly, it to wants to use these things. To get to the heart of what CCAs are and how they will work, Breaking Defense assembled a panel — featuring reporters Michael Marrow and Valerie Insinna, alongside Stacie Pettyjohn of the Center for a New American Security think tank — to break down what every reader needs to know. Above, you’ll find the second of four videos from that discussion. This one is focused on the kinds of complex questions Air Force planners are trying to sort out right now about concepts of operations, from how these wingmen can fly, to whether they need stealth capabilities, to how to get a pilot to actually trust that a CCA will do what they want it to. Down below you can see our first video, which serves as a primer on just what the CCA program is. In the coming weeks, we’ll publish further videos, one on international efforts to replicate a loyal wingman program from both partners and potential adversaries, and another on the technology that will make CCA fly.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/cca-the-operational-concepts-driving-the-air-forces-future-drone-program-video/	2024-09-12T14:52:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/ai-f16-scaled-e1726165319459.jpg
Lockheed could see $1B financial ‘impact’ this quarter as F-35 negotiations drag on	Airmen assigned to the Wisconsin Air National Guard's 115th Fighter Wing complete post-flight inspections on U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II aircraft Aug. 13, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Airman 1st Class Josh Kaeser) UPDATED on 9/13/24 at 12:53 pm ET with comment from the F-35 Joint Program Office. WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon are unlikely to reach a deal on the next lot of F-35 stealth fighters by the end of this month, potentially leading to a $1 billion cost 'impact' for the defense giant this quarter, a top Lockheed executive said today. 'Given where we are in that negotiation, we don't expect to be completed by the end of this quarter, and that will cause an impact in the quarter — up to about $500 million in sales, and potentially about $500 million of cash flow in the quarter,' Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said during the Morgan Stanley Laguna conference. The Pentagon’s F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) and Lockheed have been engaged in talks over F-35 Lots 18 and 19 for more than a year, and had initially hoped to wrap up contract negotiations by the end of 2023. However, there are still 'key terms that are yet to be negotiated' by the parties, which will drag discussions out into the fourth quarter, Malave said. If Lockheed and the JPO are able to hammer out an agreement on 'several outstanding issues' over the next couple of months, the Pentagon will be able to award a contract in early fiscal 2025 , the JPO said in a statement to Breaking Defense. Lockheed is currently seeking a cash injection, as the department’s initial funding for Lot 18 has 'pretty much been exhausted,' and the company has already invested some of its own funds to keep F-35 production running smoothly ahead of the contract, he said. 'We're working with our Joint Program Office partners as well as with congressional constituents so that we can get some funding in so that we don't really disrupt the production system,' Malave said, adding that the money could come in the form of reprogrammed funds approved by Congress. The JPO said it was 'closely monitoring' Lockheed’s execution of previously awarded funding for F-35 production and is working with the Pentagon and Congress 'to mitigate any impacts associated with negotiation delays.' Overall, Lockheed's latest financial guidance estimates sales between $70.5 billion and $71.5 billion this year, with free cash flow for 2024 between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. As part of the latest round of F-35 contract negotiations, the department is currently reviewing pricing information submitted by Lockheed that breaks down the costs borne by the aerospace prime and its supply chain, said Malave, who acknowledged that the company is still struggling with inflation, high labor costs and extended lead times. 'They have to go through that, get comfortable with that, make sure the data supports what we provide to them,' he said. Greg Ulmer, the top executive at Lockheed’s aeronautics unit, previously told Breaking Defense that unit costs for the upcoming batch of F-35s could continue to be negatively influenced by inflation as well as a lower annual buy rate from the US military. On top of the costs associated with contract negotiations, Lockheed expects up to $300 million in impact this year due to financial withholdings the Pentagon is making as it accepts F-35s that are being delivered without a full hardware and software upgrade known as Technology Refresh 3, or TR-3. In August, the Pentagon acknowledged it was withholding about $5 million per jet upon delivery. However, Malave and the JPO said that number will be reduced as Lockheed achieves specific targets. 'We expect to complete some of those milestones this year,' Malave said, adding the withholdings will determine where Lockheed lands on free cash flow. Michael Marrow in Washington contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lockheed-could-see-1b-financial-impact-this-quarter-as-f-35-negotiations-drag-on/	2024-09-12T14:45:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8603513-scaled-e1725629281248.jpg

Ford's (CVN 78) flight deck, March 10, 2023. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Grace Lyles) WASHINGTON — The US Navy this week said it had awarded a $587 million contract to L3Harris for the engineering and manufacturing development phase of its Next Generation Jammer – Low Band (NGJ-LB) system, a move that comes four years after the service initially attempted to advance that program in 2020. 'NGJ-LB will meet current and emerging electronic warfare threats and increase the lethality of 4th and 5th generation platforms and strike weapons,' Rear Adm. John Lemmon, program executive officer for tactical aircraft programs, said in a Sept. 10 statement. 'The Navy will partner with L3Harris to get this key capability into the hands of the warfighter.' The new pod is one element of the larger NGJ system scheduled to be installed on the Navy's EA-18G Growler aircraft and is expected to reach early operational capability in 2029. The new contract is for the engineering and manufacturing development phase, which is essentially when DoD asks industry to produce a handful of initial prototypes prior to full-scale production. It is intended to allow industry to be certain its manufacturing processes are satisfactory and gives the Navy a chance to test out a product before entering into serial production. 'Our Next Generation Jammer – Low Band solution provides the U.S. Navy with the latest digital, software-based technologies to address advanced and emerging threats from peer adversaries,' Christopher Kubasik, chair and CEO of L3Harris, said in a statement today. L3 said it will deliver eight prototypes to Naval Air Systems Command for assessment and additional testing over the next five years. The service initially awarded a contract for NGJ-LB in 2020 but faced Government Accountability Office protests from Northrop Grumman. That protest was eventually settled in 2022 with the Navy agreeing to amend its request for proposals and re-compete the contract in 2023. NGJ-LB is a joint cooperative program between the DoD and the Australian Department of Defence; the Royal Australian Air Force will eventually receive the capability, according to the US Navy statement. Raytheon is responsible for the mid-band capability associated with the NGJ program, and Flight Global reported the first production pods of that capability were delivered to the Navy in 2023.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/navy-awards-l3-587-million-contract-for-next-gen-electronic-warfare-pod/	2024-09-12T14:41:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230404_DVIDS_fighers_emals_7676875-scaled-e1680626490687.jpg
Aussie startup’s small box turns drones into swarm commanders	A four-legged robot mugs for the camera in a video on the website for Australian robotics firm Breaker. (Screengrab via Breaker) LANDFORCES 2024 — In a room full of large ground vehicles, the small box — roughly the size of a thick deck of cards — showed off by Australian startup Breaker doesn't stand out. But, the company says, this little box is chock full of artificial intelligence algorithms that can be easily integrated onto a variety of unmanned platforms for a wide range of mission sets. 'We build robots that act like humans. We want them to make it as easy as possible to control multiple autonomous systems across multiple domains,' co-founder Matthew Buffa told Breaking Defense at their tiny boothlet at the biennial Land Forces conference, echoing the firm's website which features a video of a medium-sized, four-legged robot. The company, which has been partially financed and assisted by the University of New South Wales' Founders Defence 10x accelerator program, made its first appearance at Land Forces this year and has attracted a steady stream of the curious and intrigued. Buffa claims the company already has a defense customer, whom he would only describe as a foreign special forces organization that 'bought a number of our systems.' The box, which Buffa called an 'autonomy stack,' incorporates six different AI models that can be put into 'any autonomous platform.' He compared the effects of their box as similar to the Star Wars robot R2D2, who helps Luke Skywalker pilot and target and shoot, instead of just providing him with reams of information he must decide on. That natural two-way communication between an operator and a drone is the key of what the company hopes to get at. As Buffa noted, 'When you're under high cognitive load and high stress response, humans naturally tend to do voice.' That's a heavy cognitive load if a soldier on a ridge line is trying to control multiple drones. But Breaker's system, according to Buffa, is designed to have the operator designate a single drone as the leader, have that drone coordinate with the other sensors, and then have that drone come back for final instructions. For instance, picture a soldier on one side of a ridge line. That soldier gets on the radio and designates one drone the 'commander' of the other 10 drones in a swam. 'Drones will then aggregate all the sensors across all 10 platforms, and if they find something interesting, say it's a supply truck or a vehicle full of operators with weapons, it will inform the operator, we've found a vehicle full of operators with weapons this distance, this bearing from your current location,' Buffa explained. 'Would you like me to follow them?' Before deploying the company tries to train the AIs on as many mission types and threats as possible. When they are deployed, he said they 'brief the drones, just like any operators for a mission. They get given the brief of what they're supposed to be doing, and where they're going and any information. We literally give the same information as natural language text, if it's a document or a photo or scan of a document, to the drones. They then use that information to make those smart decisions.' The drone will decide if, say, an abandoned car near a road appears to be a threat or not. If it decides it's not then it wouldn't 'bother the operator. 'The operator is doing something important. I'm (the drone) not going to go on the radio and tell him about this random car I've seen, which is what autonomous systems do right now.' Buffa adds that offloading the command structure more to an unmanned system should limit the number of human forces needed in the field, which is important given what has been seen on the battlefields of Ukraine, where the RF signals going off drone operators can be traced for a counter-strike by an enemy. 'The issues we saw was that, for every one autonomous system you wanted to play on the field, there's almost always at least one person who has to carry a lot of equipment, [and] it has to be very loud on the RF spectrum, so these types of systems are just failing in situations such as Ukraine. 'I mean, if you rely on continuous data and continuous video, and that is the fundamental requirement for your autonomy to exist, the minute it goes out, the systems are not helpful.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/aussie-startups-small-box-turns-drones-into-swarm-commanders/	2024-09-12T13:03:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240912_breaker_robot_dog_GRAB-e1726152978510.png
Commerce ‘on track’ for version 1.0 of space tracking system, using DoD data	On Dec. 13, 2023, Office of Space Commerce Director Richard DalBello testified before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, at a hearing on 'Government Promotion of Safety and Innovation in the New Space Economy.' (Photo: NOAA Office of Space Commerce) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department is readying the final step towards launch of its space object tracking system for non-military satellite operators, a key new responsibility the department is taking over from the Pentagon. 'We are weeks away from launching the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS),' Deputy Secretary Don Graves told the US Chamber of Commerce's Global Aerospace Summit 24 on Wednesday. 'It’s time for us to migrate this to the Department of Commerce.' Graves and other senior officials said the department will meet its Sept. 30 roll-out deadline, although the debut product will represent only a minimal capability. The National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Space Commerce (OSC) has been working since 2018 on the effort to establish a new process for taking on what is now a Defense Department's mission to keep tabs on satellites and dangerous space junk and warn non-military operators of possible on-orbit crashups. Commerce leadership, working with Congress and the Office of Management and Budget, in 2023 set this fall as the deadline for achieving that goal. 'TraCCS is on track,' OSC Director Richard DalBello told the summit during a later panel. He explained that the final step, coming shortly, is to contract for 'what we call the presentation layer, or more commonly the webpage 'TraCCS.gov'.' OSC already has contracted with Amazon Web Services to provide its cloud services, and Parsons to provide systems integration. 'Over 2025 … we will build out the system. We'll open the TraCCS.gov website … to satellite owner operators and other users, and we'll begin the transition of all the people who are on [DoD's] Space-Track.org who are not national security customers. We'll begin that transition, with the goal of completing it at the end of 2025,' DalBello said. That said, DalBello stressed that the roll out will comprise a 'minimum viable product' — rather than a more fulsome operating system as OSC had previously planned. 'We will be using the DoD system, the DoD website, to store the data for operators. But we will be able to take DoD Information, we'll be able to take operator information, and we'll be able to use our system to create conjunction data messages and orbital determination for the satellites that we're covering,' he said. 'Operators that are working with this know that this is not operational data yet. This is not data that they should be relying on for safety services yet,' he added. DalBello explained to Breaking Defense that this first version of TraCCS will in essence duplicate the data that DoD currently provides, although the system will process incoming and outgoing data every four hours rather than DoD's every eight hours. But TraCCS will evolve and improve over time under an agile development process, he said. Commerce's goal is to eventually create a free, government-owned collision warning service accurate enough to provide a baseline of space tracking data for satellite operators to be able to ensure a modicum of safety if they decide to move out of the way of a potential crash — unlike DoD's current warning system that has a fairly big margin of error. The move will also free up Pentagon resources to focus more directly on military space matters, officials have said. The problem is that Commerce leaders at the same time want to promote the handful of domestic commercial providers of space situational awareness (SSA) data and collision warning analysis that have sprung up over the past decade or so. Thus, they do not want TraCCS to become a competitor or squeeze those companies out of the marketplace. 'The plan is to integrate our SSA providers to get basic data out there that is free of charge to operators,' Graves said. 'We want to give that basic service, but make sure our commercial SSA providers are able to continue to innovate and beat the pants off of other companies in the world. … We are going to help drive the commercial marketplace by being an acquirer of data … to grow the industry significantly over the next couple of years.' Meanwhile, OSC also is hoping to help industry help itself, by promoting the creation of voluntary standards for safe on-orbit operations as part of the TraCCS project. The office has initiated a new 'pathfinder' project, 'that will examine the efficacy of generating improved satellite ephemeris based on data provided by satellite owners/operators (O/O’s),' according to a Sept. 10 announcement. 'OSC is investigating this capability to help inform quality standards for satellite ephemerides, and means of achieving those standards, for the system. Ephemeris (plural: ephemerides) is a table indicating a space object’s position and velocity at specific times,' the announcement added. The solicitation via DoD's Global Data Marketplace is asking interested vendors to submit proposals for three different potential buys: An order to generate ephemerides for a given set of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO); An order to generate ephemerides for a given set of satellites in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO); and An order for two companies to provide data quality monitoring services related to the above two orders Further, DalBello told Breaking Defense that OSC has been working closely with the European Union to try to align it's nascent Space Surveillance and Tracking System with TraCCS, in order to avoid the development of two different sets of measurement data that could result in operators working at odds in trying to avoid collisions. The eventual evolution of an international space traffic management system, however, will be a job for another day and another head of OSC — as DalBello intends to step down at the end of year. And this isn't a pro-forma, end-of-administration resignation, he told Breaking Defense, but actual retirement. 'I've done this three times. People are going to stop taking me seriously,' DalBello said, with a laugh.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/commerce-on-track-for-version-1-0-of-space-tracking-system-using-dod-data/	2024-09-12T12:30:58-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/2023-12-hearing-dalbello.jpeg
‘We will treat you better’: Commerce finalizes rule to incentivize industry to disclose export violations	U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Jared Faber, 23rd Maintenance Group AFREP technician, holds a circuit board at Moody Air Force Base, Georgia, Dec. 20, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Briana Beavers) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department today announced it has finalized new policies to incentivize industry to voluntarily disclose export control violations to the government and has appointed a 'first-ever' chief of corporate enforcement to coordinate between Commerce and Justice Department offices. 'We want [companies] to come tell us that [a violation] happened, and we provide incentives for companies to do that,' Matthew Axelrod, assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement, said today. 'And for a long time, it’s been clear that if you come in to us, in other words, you knock on our door before we knock on yours, you get concrete benefits. We will treat you better. You get a reduction in penalty.' Specifically the new rule gives Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security 'increased flexibility to determine fair and appropriate penalty amounts while also making it less burdensome for companies to submit certain [voluntary self-disclosures],' according to a BIS statement. 'The rule revises the BIS Penalty Guidelines to change how the Office of Export Enforcement (OEE) calculates the base penalty in administrative cases and how OEE applies various factors to the base penalty to determine the final penalty.' Axelrod, speaking at an event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said many of the changes were already in effect at his office as a matter of internal policy, but they will now be enshrined in law for future administrations. Axelrod’s office is responsible for enforcement of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which, in essence, dictate what kinds of technologies private industry can sell to actors outside the United States. (The EAR regulates the export of certain dual use technologies — meaning they have both civil and military applications, such as avionics and lasers — but are separate from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, which is managed by the State Department.) RELATED: State Department, RTX reach $200M settlement for export violations Though the new rule doesn’t specifically apply only to defense firms, earlier in his talk Axelrod highlighted the importance of keeping defense tech out of adversaries' hands. 'Whoever gets there first on hypersonics has a huge advantage in the current and future battlefield tactics,' Axelrod said. 'That's why it's so important to … the United States, that those technologies be protected, because the US is the leader in a number of them.' Raj Parekh, a former US attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, will serve as Commerce’s first chief of corporate enforcement. Parekh’s job will be to 'serve as the primary interface between BIS’s special agents, the Department of Commerce’s Office of Chief Counsel for Industry and Security, and the Department of Justice to advance significant corporate investigations,' according to the BIS statement. 'Today’s rule changes and appointment of Raj Parekh as chief of corporate enforcement are important steps in institutionalizing the progress we’ve made over the past three years to strengthen our administrative enforcement program,' Axelrod said, this time quoted in the department’s statement. 'The stakes of ensuring that we have the proper tools to deter export violations and — when that deterrence fails — to hold violators accountable could not be higher.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/we-will-treat-you-better-commerce-finalizes-rule-to-incentivize-industry-to-disclose-export-violations/	2024-09-12T10:27:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240912_circuit_board_AFREP_7026419-1-scaled-e1726158432822.jpg
Hyundai Rotem expects delayed Polish K2 tank contract to be signed by November	Hyundai Rotem displayed the K2 main battle tank, on order from Poland, at the annual MSPO trade show (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — South Korea’s Hyundai Rotem is confident a second contract covering180 Polish Army K2PL main battle tanks and 81 supporting vehicles will be signed by November, amid reports an agreement has been postponed because of industry contracting and financial problems. The forthcoming agreement, known as Executive Contract 2 (EC2), opens the way for a number of the tanks to be manufactured in Poland for the first time and was set to be signed at the country's annual International Defence Industry Exhibition (MSPO) last week. Warsaw originally signed a framework agreement covering 1,000 K2 tanks in 2022, part of an extraordinary spending spree in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that also included orders of 672 Hanwhai K9 self-propelled howitzers and 48 KAI FA-50 light combat aircraft. All told, the package came with an estimated $14.5 billion price tag.However, that total agreement is really broken up into a series of smaller tranches, and to this point only the first K2 tranche has actually been agreed to. Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland's deputy prime minister and defense minister, said after talks in July with his South Korean counterpart, that cooperation had been agreed on the transfer to Polish industry of 'all technical information' relating to the K2, so local suppliers, led by the state owned PGZ, could prepare to produce the vehicles. At that time, Kosiniak-Kamysz suggested EC2 would be signed at MSPO. 'This is the goal, so that tanks from this tranche are produced in Poland,' he noted. Ultimately, though, the signing of EC2 during MSPO, proved 'too ambitious' because there is 'so much work to be done,' Euiseong Lee, defense solutions senior vice president at Hyundai Rotem, told Breaking Defense. 'We are working on it, so we hope to sign it by October or November.' The K2 is equipped with a 120mm/55 caliber smoothbore gun, 7.62mm coaxial machine gun, an automatic loader capable of firing 16 rounds and self protection systems including automatic fire suppression technology, composite armor and a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protection suite, according to Hyundai Rotem. The upgraded K2PL tank will, additionally, be equipped with a remote control weapons system, counter UAS jammer and an active protection system, though a final configuration could take 'several years' to develop, said Lee. Local manufacturer Military Automotive Works (WZM), based in Poznan, has proposed producing 12 components 'from PGZ companies' for the upgraded tank, according to Defence 24, a Polish military trade publication. Lee said that Hyundai Rotem and the Polish Armaments Agency are currently in talks about which components will be produced by 'Polish companies.' He declined to comment on any specific parts or subsystems under discussion. Pavel Bejda, Polish deputy minister of national defense and Euiseong Lee, defense solutions senior vice president at Hyundai Rotem, discuss the K2 main battle tank at MSPO, Poland (Breaking Defense) He noted Hyundai will collaborate with PGZ so that the Polish manufacturer 'will be able to establish the production line,' which will also include technology transfers for in-country maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) infrastructure. 'This [K2PL design] will really enhance survivability,' he added, stressing that the Ukraine war has demonstrated the need for new land vehicles to be able to 'confront' drones. 'Delivery time is also crucial, so what we need to do, step by step, is gradually increase performance,' of the K2PL. 'Otherwise it takes too long. So the first K2PL will be equipped with these advanced systems, we believe, and the next batch' is to receive additional upgrades, said Lee. 'We don’t know yet,' what that future configuration will look like, 'but nowadays, technology leads' the way. Despite the future roadmap for the tank shared by Lee, Poland’s new government continues to face criticism from opposition lawmakers over the pace of high profile arms deals, including the K2. In a translated Tuesday post on X (formerly Twitter), Mariusz Blaszczak, PiS (Law and Justice) party chair and former Polish minister of defense, said, 'Another contract is going to waste,' in response to a Rzeczpospolita report (Polish business newspaper) claiming an acquisition of 486 US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) will be cancelled. 'This government is wasting a historic opportunity to build one of NATO's strongest armies in Poland. In less than a year, contracts for K2 tanks, K9 and Krab [self-propelled] howitzers were cancelled,' added Blaszczak. The Polish Ministry of National Defence and Lockheed Martin had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. The US State Department deferred questions about the HIMARS acquisition to the Polish government.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/hyundai-rotem-expects-delayed-polish-k2-tank-contract-to-be-signed-by-november/	2024-09-12T09:05:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_1744-e1726066303623.jpg
Where will Congress rank the nation’s security on its priority list?	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) It’s September, which means that it should be time for the annual Congressional rush to try and get the defense policy and funding bills through the House-Senate conference. But tragically, as Congress comes back into session, all the talk is actually about the length of the Continuing Resolution (CR). Some want it to be as short as possible, lasting until just after the November elections. Some want it to last until March, so the new administration — and Congress — have a chance to make a mark on final spending for the year. Some say it should last through the entire next fiscal year, thereby just admitting defeat now and be done with it. Sure, why not. Once you have completely shirked your duty and decided to just ignore the impacts, particularly on the nation’s competitiveness, security and military forces, why not just throw hands up in the air and work on other things? Here’s the reality: Hope is not lost. There is actually still time left in this fiscal year to get both defense bills passed and put American security on track — if leaders on the Hill are willing to fight for it. As a reminder, providing for the common defense is the only mandatory and exclusive job of the federal government and, even though domestic discretionary spending may still go into a CR, the national security consequences of delayed defense funding are the most costly and dangerous for the nation. First, let’s talk logistics. Only two of the four bills have gone through the entire pre-conference process, but that level of regular order is almost quaint these days. They could move quickly by taking the committee bills straight to conference; while that bypasses numerous elected representatives getting their chance to weigh in, they will still get a shot when the conference agreements come to the floors for a vote, which they actually must do before they can proceed to the president for signature. This type of process is not ideal, but it is better than a government shutdown or a lengthy CR that only incrementally extends last year’s money and priorities into the new year and wastes time and money. Despite the heated rhetoric of an election year, there are really only a half dozen big issues in play for the House-Senate conference to resolve to complete the bills on time: 1) the defense top line, 2) aircraft procurement, 3) equipment for the National Guard and Reserves, 4) military construction, 5) shipbuilding and 6) the pay raise for junior enlisted personnel. Once that first issue — the total amount of money the nation will invest in its security — is resolved, the others could quickly follow. Concerning the topline, the below breakout of the budget by Service shows that the major difference is between the House and the Senate. The Senate appropriators provided $21.5 billion more than their House counterparts, a sum that would increase the competitiveness and readiness of our military. Defense Toplines by Service Component Next are a few major issues concerning funding levels to specific appropriations. First, within the aircraft procurement accounts, the various committees are about $3.5 billion apart, with the House Armed Services Committee as the outlier. With three of the four committees marking above $40 billion, we can expect a final agreed-upon bill to include an increase over the request in aircraft procurement Next is equipment for the National Guard and Reserve Components. As usual, the administration requested no money for this account. However, Congress routinely provides about $1 billion in unrequested funds. Given appropriators in both chambers increased the account again this year, this should be easy to resolve in conference. On military construction, the House kept close to the president’s budget while the Senate added numerous projects it designated as emergency spending. A resolution on this issue will be tied tightly to the defense topline agreement. If spending is close to the Senate level, then military construction is the clear winner. If not, these projects will not happen. Next, and maybe the most consequential for the nation, is Navy shipbuilding. The House has marked at about $1 billion less than the Pentagon requested, a stinging rebuke in the confidence of the Navy to build ships. The Senate added several billion dollars, betting that the Navy, and the industrial base that supports it, can get its act together and produce the ships the nation needs. One can imagine that China is watching how this one will go. Top Defense Conference Issues The last major issue is the pay raise for junior enlisted military members. The Senate is taking a wait and see approach, with an additional one percent above the basic pay raise for these specific military ranks. They are waiting on the Secretary of Defense to release his Quadrennial Review of Military Compensation before taking action next year. The House is not waiting. Concerned with recruiting challenges and the effect of 20-plus percent of inflation over the past several years, they are recommending an additional 15 percent for the junior enlisted ranks. This could be resolved by simply splitting the difference with a 7.5 percent increase this year and the promise to review it again next year. Though CRs have become shamefully routine, their damage remains. The artificial budget caps related to a forgotten debt ceiling fight in the midst of supporting Ukraine and Israel, along with the threat of an aggressive China, is sending a message of weakness to our autocratic adversaries and providing them with the willpower to fight on. Yes, the deadline is close. But the issues simply are not that complicated. If Congress is willing to sit down and focus, rather than throw its hands in the air, America can be a more secure nation — not months down the line, but in a matter of weeks.

Bell launches campaign to sell Aussies V-280 Valor tiltrotor	Bell's V-280 Valor won the US Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft competition (Bell) LANDFORCES 2024 — A top executive with Bell Textron will meet Friday with Australia's Army chief, Lt. Gen. Simon Stuart, to push forward what may be a long campaign to convince the Lucky Country it needs the V-280 Valor tiltrotor. It's an ambitious move by Bell, who won the right to produce the V-280 for the Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) effort in December 2022. But Carl Coffman, vice president for military sales at Bell Textron, told Breaking Defense in an interview that the company believes Australia's geography and mission sets fit the Valor's capabilities perfectly. 'This is a huge country. And then you take a look at the force structure of the Australian Defense Force, and look at their posture, and there's two challenges you have. One is your deployment to secure the homeland, the Australian continent, and [two is] the movement of forces strategically to accomplish that,' Coffman said during the Land Forces 2024 conference. 'Most of your force structure is on the outer perimeter of the country, and in the middle of the country is a whole lot of very demanding terrain, and a lot of not very much, right? So I've got to be able to move my force structure internally very rapidly around this country in order to to defend it.' The executive noted that the Australians are already familiar with Bell's V-22 tiltrotor and the capability that brings, because of the US Marine force that rotates in and out of Darwin in the north of the country. Australia, faced with fires and floods across vast areas, often calls on its military to assist with those rescue and response missions. And it regularly provides assistance to countries across the Indo-Pacific. The V-280 responding to disasters and threats in the island archipelagos north of Australia would provide flexibility and lift that conventional helicopters can't provide, Coffman argued said. The V-280 is not ready for sale yet, of course. The program just entered the engineering, manufacturing and development phase in the United States, with the company hoping to get soldiers into the cockpit in 2030. Before that date, the company plans to build six prototype aircraft and two user test aircraft. 'We expect to fly our first prototype test vehicle (PTV) in 2026,' he said. The aircraft has been modified to incorporate changes requested by Special Operations Command, including a refueling probe capability in the nose. Coffman said that a potential sale would probably occur through the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. He added that he'd already met this week with the chief of Army Aviation, Maj. Gen. Stephen Jobson, whom he said appeared to respond positively. Coffman didn't mention it, but Australia's Special Air Services often operates with US forces and might be attracted by an aircraft that can fly vast distances at speeds much faster than a helicopter and is already rigged for use by special operators.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/bell-launches-campaign-to-sell-aussies-v-280-valor-tiltrotor/	2024-09-12T07:20:30-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221205_bell_valor_FLARA.png
Allies in acquisition: MITRE urges Pentagon to work better with partners in developing, buying weapons	AUKUS allies have trialled AI enabled drones to reduce enemy target identification time (US DoD) WASHINGTON — Working with partner nations is the norm for the US military when it operates around the globe, but the Pentagon is still far too alone when it comes to the business of defense acquisition, according to a new MITRE paper published today. Closer cooperation with allies and partner nations on acquisition could strengthen interoperability and better enable the Defense Department to harness breakthrough tech from outside the US, the research organization said in the report, called 'Buy the Way We Fight.' 'What we're proposing in the paper is that the US defense acquisition community should have connections and relationships and conversations and awareness with our international partners,' said Dan Ward, the military technologist who authored the paper. 'They [foreign nations] might have solutions that are available sooner, and we will find out about them by having those conversations.' International cooperation is a hallmark of certain weapons programs like the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, which was designed from the start to be produced in part by several partner nations that would eventually buy it, as well as in multi-lateral agreements like AUKUS, which was created to help enhance cooperation on defense technology among Australia, the UK and the US. However, a majority of US weapons development happens stateside, with acquisition and contracting officials working in isolation from counterparts in foreign countries that the US military will fight alongside. 'When we when we deploy, we deploy together,' Ward said. 'And doing that … without having first had some conversations about about the systems we're developing to deploy, I think is a pretty big risk.' To remedy the acquisition isolation, MITRE laid out three steps it says the Pentagon should take right now. First, it calls for the Defense Department to update its acquisition policies. Specifically, it should update DoD 5000.01 — the department's overarching acquisition ruleset — to require program offices 'explore connections' with partner nations. It also recommends modifying the guidance for middle-tier acquisition and software acquisition so that international cooperation and interoperability is considered as part of the acquisition process, the report states. Second, the report recommends that the department create new forums for US acquisition officials who work inside the military’s program offices to meet and engage with international counterparts. For example, representatives from the Defense Entrepreneurs Forum in March proposed creating a 'expeditionary diplomatic fellowship program' to increase international collaboration and build the networks of junior officers, enlisted and DoD civilians, and a similar model could be used for an acquisition fellowship, the report states. Finally, the Pentagon needs to build on those policy changes and new engagement opportunities by establishing 'new norms' for international collaboration — a recommendation Ward said the paper intentionally leaves open ended so that the Pentagon can experiment and see what works best. While the recommendations are designed to be applicable 'across the board' to acquisition programs of all shapes and sizes, Ward pointed to hypersonic weapons, AI and quantum as technologies from which the Pentagon might benefit from greater teamwork with its partners. (All of these are areas of focus within what's known as Pillar II of the AUKUS agreement.) 'It would be really useful to have some conversations across the alliance, with our coalition partners, to say, ‘Hey, we're starting to develop some stuff in this direction. What do you know? What can you contribute? What do you need? What do you have? How can we work together on that?’' he said. Even in programs where the United States does not plan to get directly involved, like the future French-German battle tank, the Defense Department could have production experience or data that it could share with its allies in order to make acquisition faster and cheaper or to enhance interoperability, Ward said. However, the Pentagon must also be careful not to course correct so hard that the pendulum swings the other direction, with DoD acquisition officers feeling hamstrung by onerous requirements to collaborate with foreign nations. The paper notes that its recommendations are 'not about granting other nations a veto over American acquisition policy nor allowing them to dictate elements of acquisition programs.' Ward acknowledged that including allies and partners in conversations about technology requirements and nascent acquisition programs might slightly increase time and complexity, but could also lead to technologies being fielded faster if a partner nation already has a solution under development. 'What's really going to take a lot of time and cost a lot and make things worse is if we don't have these conversations, if we're deploying alongside forces where we haven't had conversations about needs and capabilities and requirements and what the system can do,' he said. 'What we're not recommending is just that we spent all our time having conversations that don't go anywhere.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/allies-in-acquisition-mitre-urges-pentagon-to-work-better-with-partners-in-developing-buying-weapons/	2024-09-12T06:06:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240312-A-XM236-1038_AUS_DSTG_UAV_launch_Credit_US_DoD_gov-e1723206393851.jpg
Anduril unveils new cruise-missile like weapon, plus voice-controlled drones	Anduril's Barracuda-250. (Anduril photo) WASHINGTON — Arguing that many of today’s options don’t do the trick, Anduril worked to make up something quick: a new family of air-breathing, autonomous air vehicles, akin to cruise missiles or one-way drones, which the company calls 'Barracuda.' Unveiled today, the weapon comes in three configurations — the Barracuda-100, -250 and -500 — with each increasing in size and payload. According to the company, the largest configuration can offer a range of greater than 500 nautical miles and over 100 pounds of payload. The two smaller configurations have lower ranges and offer a payload of 35 pounds. The company says each of the three variants can fly at speeds of up to 500 knots. 'The problem that we are seeking to solve here … is America and our allies and partners do not have enough weapons, full stop. And we are not capable of producing the volume of weapons that we're going to need to establish deterrence against a peer competitor,' Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose said in a briefing with reporters ahead of the announcement. To do that, Anduril is striving to minimize defense-specific materials needed to produce the Barracuda and maximize the use of commercially available components. Depending on configuration, the weapon is compatible with different launch methods, the company says, such as from aircraft internal weapons bays, external rails, surface vessels, and ground-based systems. While the Barracuda may be new to the public, Anduril Vice President for Air Dominance & Strike Diem Salmon revealed the weapon has been selected for the early stage of a joint Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit effort to develop a low-cost air vehicle. Additionally, Salmon noted that the Barracuda can come in a -M configuration — denoting the qualities of a cruise missile or munition — and that modular features mean that the system is capable of 'a lot of different things.' Working together in either manned-unmanned or purely unmanned teaming, Brose said Barracudas could offer different capabilities like decoys, target detection and strike. At the core of the Barracuda enabling that autonomous collaboration is software, harnessing Anduril’s Lattice platform that serves as the foundation for much of the company’s weapons development. Called 'Lattice for Mission Autonomy,' the software could enable some ways to defeat adversary countermeasures, says Salmon, as well as smooth the way for upgrades. 'What we have sought to do with Barracuda is solve that problem [of limited production] at the level of design, to build a system that is simple, that is easy to manufacture, that is software-defined and mass-producible,' Brose said. Speak Now: Will Voice Commands Control Drone Wingmen? The Lattice software is also core to other high-profile efforts from the company. At a location in west Texas, the site of Anduril’s largest test range, company officials on Tuesday invited reporters to view a demonstration of what they think could be a step forward for programs like Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), the Air Force effort to field drones that can join fighter jets in battle: voice commands to control drones in the heat of a fight. The demo consisted of four mid-size, jet-powered drones, which the company referred to as 'clay pigeon' jets. The drones took off from the company’s runway, then synched up in formation before being tasked to sweep virtual enemies from the area. A simulated adversary aircraft then crossed into their airspace. Once the threat was detected, the fleet of drones asked for permission to blow up the enemy. 'Authorization requested for approval,' an AI voice asked, somewhat akin to Apple’s Siri voice assistant. Armed with a laptop and microphone, an operator gave his consent for one of the four drones to eliminate the threat. 'Mustang 11, engage,' the operator replied. Within seconds, the Mustang 11 drone released a simulated missile — shown on a screen during the demo — downing the virtual enemy aircraft. Its job complete, the drone resumed its route alongside its fellow unmanned wingmen. Anduril officials say it’s testing like this that can help burn down risk for efforts such as the CCA program, where the company and competitor General Atomics are on contract with the Air Force to build prototypes. Using Anduril’s Lattice autonomous software, engineers here inserted voice command capabilities with the aim of reducing cognitive load on pilots and other potential operators. 'We want our pilots to be able to command uncrewed platforms. They're going to need to be able to do it inside the cockpit while they're doing other things, their hands and eyes are already very busy, the environment is shaky. And a voice command interface will allow them to work with these uncrewed platforms pretty easily,' Andrew Burke, an Anduril mission software engineer, explained ahead of the demonstration. (Like other media, Breaking Defense accepted accommodations from Anduril for the trip.) While this event involved the air domain, Anduril is developing the Lattice mission autonomy applications for other environments like the land and sea. Salmon said the software is 'open and hardware agnostic' including for platforms produced by other companies. That could make the software a candidate for programs like a parallel CCA autonomy effort that the Air Force says has five companies on contract, though Salmon declined to comment on whether Anduril is involved. And, according to Kevin Chlan, senior director for Air Dominance & Strike at Anduril, the company is exploring other tools like large language models — think ChatGPT — for drone operations. For example, Chlan said, an operator could ask a drone for a readout after a long patrol. The capability has been tested in simulations and could soon be introduced in a live environment, he said. While the ability for a single operator to control small fleets of drones showed progress, company officials acknowledged that challenges remain, such as overcoming adversary interference in guidance systems. Still, with a focused development and specific use case, Salmon said her goal for fielding the technology that enabled the demonstration would be only a couple years away. The voice command demo, which required the operator to give permission to a drone to fire, additionally highlighted debates around the permissible degree of autonomy for a lethal weapon system, a problem that Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall previously told Breaking Defense needs more work. Chlan acknowledged the issue and said Anduril is striving to abide by relevant DoD policies that guide the use of autonomous weapon systems. Still, he noted that policies can change over time, and it’s always possible to build in a type of dial into the software that governs degrees of autonomy and can essentially be turned up or down. 'So I think that as long as we think about the software that we're building that has the ability to kind of scale up and down with the policy, I think we're doing right if we do that,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/anduril-unveils-new-cruise-missile-like-weapon-plus-voice-controlled-drones/	2024-09-12T03:48:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Barracuda_250_Hero_2-e1726085328497.jpg
Army selects 2 ‘attritable’ UASs for company-level recon, surveillance and target acquisition	Soldiers fly Performance Drone Works's C-100. (photo courtesy of PDW via the US Army). This story was updated on 9/13/24 at 10:15 am with additional details from Army leaders. WASHINGTON — The US Army announced tonight that it has selected two drones, the Ghost X from Anduril Industries and the C-100 from Performance Drone Works, to proceed with its Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft System program. 'The directed requirement for a Company Level Small [unmanned aerial system] UAS capability is a priority…based on observations from the ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza,' Gen. James Rainey, the head of the Army Futures Command, said in the announcement. 'This requirement describes the importance of considering the UAS as a system, not just an air vehicle, and also highlights the importance of adaptability.' The dual contracts span a 10-year ordering period, with the first tranche valued at $14.5 million for up to 48 drones, Col. Danielle Medaglia, the project manager for uncrewed aircraft systems, subsequently explained. And although the service and companies are still hashing out the terms of their respective agreements, she soldiers could have those initial drones later this fall. 'This is the first tranche is going to really allow us to learn,' Medaglia told reporters during a Thursday call. 'We're going to develop those tactics, techniques and procedures, and then form programs of instruction,' she added. That learning period could drive design changes, drive down the per unit price tag, or lead to the selection of other drones for company formations. Both drones, described as 'attritable' by the service, will be headed for maneuver companies and are designed to carry various payloads for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition missions. Anduril unveiled the Ghost X in 2023. The system is a dual battery UAS the company says has the ability to carry a 20-pound payload and fly up to 75 minutes with a range of 25 kilometers. Performance Drone Works's C-100 is a man-packable quadcopter designed to ferry up to 15 pounds, for missions up to 74 minutes. Both drones were on the Defense Innovation Unit’s Blue UAS List — an initiative designed to help the services more quickly select commercial systems that are fully-free of Chinese parts. 'By selecting approved platforms that have been on DIU’s Blue UAS List, this effort demonstrates the value of DIU’s approach to engaging with the commercial market and providing the DoD ready-to-scale solutions at speed,' said DIU Director, Doug Beck.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/army-selects-two-attritable-uass-for-company-level-recon-surveillance-and-target-acquisition/	2024-09-11T17:59:37-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Army.mil_-e1726101030879.jpg
Lockheed, Thales team to produce Aussie-made GMLRS munitions	Soldiers assigned to 1st Battalion, 6th Field Artillery Regiment, 41st Field Artillery Brigade fire M31 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems from their M270A1 MLRS during the Thunder Cloud live-fire exercise in Andoya, Norway on the night of Sept. 15, 2021. Thunder Cloud was designed to test out the targeting capability of the High Altitude Balloon system coordinated through the 2nd Multi-domain Task Force-Europe using long-range precision fires on a seaborne target 20 Kilometers off the coast on Andoya, above the Arctic Circle. (Official U.S. Army photo by Maj. Joe Bush) LANDFORCES 2024 — Australia is set to boost its capability for domestic manufacturing of precision guided munitions (PGM), by incorporating locally-made rocket motors and warheads into US guided multiple launch rocket system (GMLRS) missiles. Under an agreement announced at the Land Forces Expo in Melbourne on Wednesday, defense company Thales Australia, a subsidiary of the French parent, will manufacture rocket motors and warheads for Lockheed Martin’s GMLRS missiles. Earlier this year, Lockheed and the Australian defence department announced that GMLRS missiles would be assembled in Australia from solely US-sourced components. While derided by some as the equivalent of assembling flatpack furniture, that was a significant step in Australia’s journey towards a domestic PGM production line. Lockheed is standing up assembly of GMLRS at a defense facility at Orchard Hills, NSW, from US-made components, with the first wholly Australian-assembled round to be produced next year. Australian-made warheads and rocket motors from the Thales plants in Benalla, Victoria and Mulwala, NSW, are likely to be the first significant locally produced components for GMLRS. Ken Kota, Lockheed’s vice-president for international integration, said Lockheed was committed to finding Australian partners for missile production. 'The global supply of solid rocket motors is under stress. We need partners globally in order to be successful,' he said. 'We have very good plans in place. We have done a lot of engineering already. Our team in the US is designing and collaborating with the team here very regularly.' Thales chief executive officer Jeff Connolly said the deal was more than two years in the making. 'We started the discussion about, what would it take to make a rocket motor and warhead for GMLRS as a start point,' he said, stressing that this new agreement wasn’t just for Aussie needs but for global requirements. 'People would like to tell you that Australia can’t do – well it’s already there,' Connolly said. 'It’s enabled by AUKUS and propelled by AUKUS. The amount of cooperation between the states and Australia now because of AUKUS means we can really get going on certifications together, accelerate that through so that these weapons are the same as what would be produced by Lockheed and its partners in the US.' Connolly said Australian components would progressively be introduced to the GMLRS production line. All initial production rounds will feature only US-made components, including rocket motors and warheads, just assembled locally. Only once the Australian-made energetics are fully developed and certified will they be included in the new rounds, something the companies are hoping to see done before the end of the decade. Thales has already produced BLU series bombs which flew on US Marine Corps aircraft earlier this year, which helps with the development of the rocket motors. 'That’s the same chemistry involved in those type of aircraft bombs as in rocket motors, a cast compositive material with polymer chemistry,' said Duncan Watt, manager for the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise for Thales. The strategic benefit of having domestic production capabilities on PGMs is obvious when looking at a map. Should Australia find itself in a conflict, relying on production lines in the US or Europe could prove disastrous. In addition, Australian industry stands to benefit if it can become the Pacific hub for supplying regional partners and allies with weaponry. Australia has previously announced plans for local production of Kongsberg Naval Strike Missile and Joint Strike Missile. Air Marshal Leon Phillips, head of the Australian defence department’s Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise, said Australia wanted to do much more than assemble PGM from foreign supplied components. 'If all we did when we are sitting here in five years is bolting components together off extant foreign production lines, I will have failed in our ability to uplift our sovereignty,' he said. 'If all I am doing is taking rocket motors out of the US and trying to assemble more rocket motors, I will be hitting the same constraint supply point that already exists.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/lockheed-thales-team-to-produce-aussie-made-gmlrs-munitions/	2024-09-11T17:33:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/GMLRS-scaled-e1715360683573.jpg
DARPA ‘quantum skeptic’ challenges industry: Prove me wrong	Concept of quantum computing or supercomputer (Jackie Niam/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As entrepreneurs, researchers, and executives gather this week at the Quantum World Congress outside Washington, how can anyone cut through the hype and figure out which nascent technology has real potential? That’s why DARPA has issued an open challenge to anyone developing a quantum computer to submit themselves to rigorous government testing, led by a self-described 'quantum skeptic.' The deadline to submit a brief abstract of one’s project is Sept. 19. That date is not negotiable, warned program manager Joe Altepeter, who’s heading what the agency announced in July as the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI). Contenders deemed promising will be eligible, for starters, for $1 million to help their testing, but DARPA expects them to be spending that much and more of their own money. 'I have a reputation in the DARPA building as a quantum skeptic,' Altepeter said in an interview with Breaking Defense. 'I was definitely the reviewer you absolutely did not want to get on your quantum submission, because I measured my success based on how much money I could save the US taxpayer by not funding dumb quantum ideas — and trust me, there are plenty of dumb quantum ideas to go around.' But over the last few years, Altepeter told Breaking Defense, he’s come around to the idea that there might be fire somewhere in all this quantum smoke, after all. So he’s prepared to be convinced, and to convince others. 'We're going to do our best to disprove anybody who steps through our door — we're going to be skeptical, by design, but we're also going to be a fair arbiter,' Altepeter said in an interview. 'So if you really think you can go the distance and you convince my team, we will be your advocate inside the government, in rooms you can't go, and say, ‘look, agencies A, B and C, we tried to break it and we failed.’' That kind of DARPA seal of approval could be a tremendous asset for quantum computing companies — as well as the feedback from the testing process itself. 'We offer something to companies that is unique,' Altepeter said. 'We are going to build the best verification and validation team in the world for quantum computing, [giving] unbiased feedback on what is right and what is wrong about your approach.' In the increasingly competitive quantum space, 'almost every other player is looking to get rich somehow and has a dog in this fight,' Altepeter said. But on government salaries, 'we are definitely not going to get rich,' he noted dryly. 'We’re looking for the answer.' Once a company or research lab submits its abstract, it needs to make an oral presentation to DARPA, one that sounds a lot like a PhD thesis defense. 'We want you to come in and have a conversation with us for half a day so we can ask really hard questions and see how you respond,' Altepeter said. A proposal that passes this gauntlet may receive an Other Transaction Authority (OTA) award of up to $1 million for a six-month review of their concept for the quantum computer they plan to build. But that’s just 'Stage A.' If the proposal survives those six months, it becomes eligible for Stage B, up to $15 million in DARPA funding for a year-long assessment of its R&D plan. Make it through that year, and the proposal will qualify for Stage C: up to $300 million and 'an army of engineers' will work 'as long as it takes' to validate the design, Altepeter said. DARPA will provide the core of this expertise but is soliciting participants from academia, Energy Department national labs and Federally Funded R&D Centers as well, he said. 'We are building an initiative that could be more than a billion dollars over five years,' Altepeter said. '[But] everything depends on what we find.' If none of the proposals pass muster, he said, 'we won’t spend anything.' Companies that do win DARPA funding should consider an adjunct to their own investments in testing, validation and due diligence, Altepeter emphasized, not a replacement for them. 'We're only going to play with someone in Stage C if [they’re] spending more than DARPA on this,' he said. 'Anybody who's serious about doing this is already planning on committing huge resources … If they're not already planning on spending big money, they probably are not serious about this.' That said, as a fan of the classic Back to the Future movies and their iconic mad scientist inventing time machines in his garage, Altepeter promised, 'We will carefully evaluate absolutely every submission, from Doc Brown and from a megacorporation.' But, he said, 'I would be very surprised if Doc Brown makes it very far.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/darpa-quantum-skeptic-challenges-industry-prove-me-wrong/	2024-09-11T11:06:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-1335905020-e1726063101640.jpg
Why would Russia need Iranian ballistic missiles? Experts point to tactics, industrial challenges	Military vehicles carrying Iranian-made surface-to-surface missiles take part in a military parade marking Iran's Army Day anniversary near the Imam Khomeini shrine in the south of Tehran, April 18, 2023. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — On Tuesday the US leveled a new charge against Russia and Iran, alleging the Kremlin has received specific Iranian ballistic missiles for the first time and could employ them 'within weeks' in the war in Ukraine — what America's top diplomat called a 'dramatic escalation.' The purported move, denied by Iran, was condemned by Washington and its allies in Europe, but also served as a glimpse into Moscow's tactical thinking and, potentially, some deeper capacity challenges the Kremlin's war machine is facing, according to officials and experts. Tactically, US officials suggested the 75-mile-range Fath-360 missiles would be used in close-in fights, allowing Russia to 'preserv[e] its longer-range capabilities for use throughout the battlefield, thus deepening Russia's arsenal and also, again, giving it the ability to strike the kinds of targets that we've seen them striking, to include civilian targets,' as Pentagon Press Secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder put it. Jean Loup Samaan, a senior research fellow at the Middle East Institute, agreed. 'Over the past two decades, Iran has developed one of the most advanced ballistic arsenals and the bulk of them are either short or mid-range,' Samaan told Breaking Defense. 'I assume for Russia they are relevant for the kind of battles we see in the border area between Russian and Ukrainian troops, so at tactical level [they'll be used] to exhaust the Ukrainians.' But Samaan said Moscow's outreach to Iran could be the latest clue about internal production woes. 'It may also indicate, just like with North Korean involvement behind Russia, that the Russian defense industry is struggling to keep the pace with the production of weapons used by the Russian forces,' he said. RELATED: Russian 'conquest' of Ukraine on the table if US, allied military aid falters, study says The Kremlin may have cause to worry about the effectiveness of Iranian missiles after Israel and its allies were able to take down virtually all the threats launched towards Israel in a dramatic mid-April barrage, but Behnam Ben Taleblu of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank said that's not as relevant an example as it may seem. 'The Fath-360 is a derivative of Iran’s most precise ballistic missile, the Fateh family of single-stage, solid-propellant short-range ballistic missiles,' Ben Taleblu told Breaking Defense. 'Much of what Iran fired on April 13 were liquid-propellant medium-range ballistic missiles never before employed in regional military operations. There is a considerable difference between the track records of these two systems. And lest we forget, for Putin, the perfect is not the enemy of the good at the moment.' Can Kasapoğlu, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, wrote in an analysis today that the Fath-360 is a 'textbook tactical ballistic missile' whose 'rapid launch cycle and low per-unit cost make it a formidable option, particularly when fired in salvos.' Sanctions And Skepticism In response to the purported Iranian missile transfer to Russia, France, Germany and the United Kingdom announced that they 'will be taking immediate steps to cancel bilateral air services agreements with Iran,' in addition to sanctioning Iran air and entities and individuals involved with Iran’s missile program. The US followed suit. While the sanctions and canceling economic ties are important, the experts said they did not consider them enough to deter Tehran. 'The sanctions have sometimes slowed down the nuclear and ballistic programs but over the past decades, the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] has always found ways to circumvent those sanctions. They have a strong indigenous defense industry that is able to develop those ballistic missiles and they also relied on Asian partners such as North Korea so that also weakened the impact of sanctions,' Samaan told Breaking Defense. Ben Taleblu said that 'if anything, these penalties are what should have been levied following Iran's drone transfers [to Russia] two years ago to thwart the transfer of missiles more recently.' 'But now they can serve as the building block of a more coherent European policy toward Tehran if paired with the snap back of UN sanctions,' he added. Regardless of the sanctions, it appears Russia's ties to Iran are only growing stronger. Iran and Russia have both issued many statements that they are very close to signing a defense 'comprehensive agreement' to boost their military cooperation, as well as formalize it. '⁠Iran’s widening radius of arms proliferation is a symptom of a much larger problem,' Ben Taleblu said. 'Slowly and steadily, Iran and Russia are working to revise the regional balances of power in their favor, deepening their military cooperation and engaging in salami tactics against their adversaries while compartmentalizing their conflicts. Getting good on countering one of these threats will require improving your policy on the other.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/why-would-russia-need-iranian-ballistic-missiles-experts-point-to-tactics-defense-industrial-challenges/	2024-09-11T09:45:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240911_iranian_missiles_parade_GettyImages-1251974143-scaled-e1726067511535.jpg
Navy awards BlueForge Alliance new $950M contract to boost sub industrial base	The Virginia-class attack submarine Pre-Commissioning Unit Minnesota (SSN 783) pulls pierside at Naval Station Norfolk from a scheduled underway. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Alex R. Forster/Released) WASHINGTON — The Navy on Tuesday awarded BlueForge Alliance a $950 million contract to continue its efforts in bolstering the submarine industrial base (SIB) in the United States in preparation for the work necessary to carry out the AUKUS security pact. 'This contract will execute ongoing critical efforts to strengthen and expand the SIB and provides a direct contractual arrangement with a strong partner with demonstrated experience driving enhanced capability and capacity,' a Navy spokesperson told Breaking Defense. 'The contract supports urgent ongoing efforts to diversify and strengthen the supply chains, drive national/regional workforce attraction, targeted training capacity increases and enterprise wide retention improvements,' the spokesperson continued. 'Additionally, this work will scale manufacturing technology (additive manufacturing, robotics / automation) capacity and capability that is essential for defense industrial base wide production and maintenance.' Roughly $500 million of the contract award is categorized under foreign military sales. The spokesperson said those funds are under FMS because they directly support Australia's anticipated purchase of three or five Virginia-class submarines by adding capacity to the American industrial base. 'The U.S money being executed under this contract is part of the FY 2024 National Security Supplemental focused on accelerating and scaling critical efforts required for domestic submarine construction and sustainment. Efforts related to development of the larger submarine industrial base development, including Australia and/or the UK, may be considered at a future date,' the spokesperson said. BlueForge Alliance is a Texas-based nonprofit company that has rapidly made a name for itself in the defense industrial space by working with the Navy and submarine prime contractor General Dynamics to hit the service’s aspirational goal of hiring 100,000 new shipbuilders over the next 10 years. A spokesperson for BlueForge did not immediately return a request for comment about the contract. Prior to Tuesday's contract announcement, Navy officials had said they previously awarded the company roughly $500 million to turbo boost the service’s campaign to hire workers from across the country — most notably its advertising has been shown at Major League Baseball games and NASCAR races. The new contract brings the total amount of money the Navy has awarded to BlueForge in contracts up to $1.3 billion. Matt Sermon, a Navy civilian leading the service’s submarine industrial base efforts, previously told reporters BlueForge’s work has expanded to leading an additive manufacturing consortium across several universities as well as working with certain original equipment manufacturers and additive manufacturing companies to 'tie up that whole entire group from industry and academia into an organization that’s focused on the material maturity that we need to drive' capacity.

Boeing expects Polish air dominance fighter decision by early 2025	Boeing's F-15EX Eagle II features fly by wire flight controls and new electronic warfare equipment (Boeing) BELFAST — An aircraft selection decision relating to Poland’s air dominance fighter jet program could be made as soon as the end of the year, according to a Boeing official. Warsaw has long committed to acquiring 32 new multirole jets for the effort with rival bids from the manufacturer’s F-15EX Eagle II fourth generation type and the Eurofighter Typhoon on the table. A third option — another F-35A order — building off the $4.6 billion deal with Washington in 2020, has not been ruled out either. 'From our understanding, we are still trying to track when that [air dominance] decision is, we are of course meeting with the customer and also the political side, to make sure they understand the capabilities of the F-15EX,' said Marissa Myers, Boeing's senior manager for fighter programs, business development, during the International Defence Industry Exhibition (MSPO) in Poland. 'They have not given us a date per se, but we are targeting late 2024 or [early] 2025.' Maj. Gen. Cezary Wisniewski, deputy general commander for the Polish Armed Forces, told Breaking Defense last year that as part of an initial evaluation stage for the air dominance program, he had dispatched a team to Italy to discuss Eurofighter Typhoon capabilities. Myers at the time declined to comment on whether the F-15EX was similarly assessed. The jet is a modernized version of the legacy F-15, complete with digital fly-by-wire controls, glass cockpit and a new electronic warfare suite. Myers also weighed in on the question of powerplant, saying that 'if' Poland decided to place an order for Pratt and Whitney’s F100 turbo fan engine, an alterative to General Electric’s F-15EX qualified F110-129 powerplant, Pratt would face 'cost and schedule' issues tied to a F100 certification and test phase. Josh Goodman, F100 program director at Pratt and Whitney, told reporters on Sept. 3 that the company was campaigning for a Polish F100 order in support of the F-15EX offer, labelling the engine for Warsaw as 'low risk' and one that would require a 'couple of flight tests' to gain certification. In 2021, General Electric secured a $1.6 billion F110 contract for the Eagle II, beating the F100 in the process, while opening the door to the potential supply of 329 engines. USAF works off a program of record of 98 aircraft for the jet, subject to intervention by Congress. 'There was a response of timing [concerning Polish air dominance engine requirements],' Scott Keating, regional general manager of sales and business development in Europe for defense and systems at GE Aerospace, told Breaking Defense at MSPO. 'I’m not certain on how long that timing is, but it's a risk,' if additional time is required for engine qualification. 'We are the only qualified engine on the platform, that is a key element … the point that we want to illustrate is we are ready to serve, we are ready to deliver.' He also shared that F110 production will 'almost triple' in the next five years, adding, 'we are ramping up our supply chains to meet demand.' The GE offer also includes local sustainment benefits, with Poland able to maintain '90 percent' of engine shop replaceable units in country, according to Keating. According to a US Air Force spokesperson, 89 engines are on contract for F-15EX, covering Lots 1-5 and 29 spares. 21 engines have been delivered to date. GE company literature [PDF] notes that in addition to powering all USAF Eagle II aircraft, the F110 is also integrated on 70 percent of the service's 'frontline' F-16 fleet and at an export level, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Jordan, Qatar and Taiwan have all selected it for F-15 and F-16 integration. Planned export orders for the F-15EX include Israel acquiring up to 50 units, due to be named F-15IA. Tel Aviv's acquisition was cleared by the US State Department last month, as part of a wider F-15 package, valued at $19 billion. Additionally, in August 2023, Boeing and Indonesia signed a Memorandum of Understanding as a key milestone to finalize the sale of 24 Eagle II's.

Aussie GPS alternative firm Advanced Navigation wins big Hanwha contract	A Redback infantry fighting vehicle on display in Canberra. Army will take delivery of 129 of the vehicles, to be built in Geelong. (Andrew Green via Australian Ministry of Defence) LANDFORCES 2024 — A small Australian company, Advanced Navigation, scored a big win here today, signing agreements with Korean giant Hanwha to provide a unique inertial guidance systems for a range of the Asian company's weapons. 'We're really excited to announce that we have signed a contract with Hanwha Australia to supply the inertial navigation systems for their Redback vehicles for the Land 400 program,' CEO Chris Shaw told Breaking Defense. The contract, for $8.7 million AUD ($5.8 million USD), is a boost to Australia's pursuit of what it calls sovereign capability. The Redback is an infantry fighting vehicle meant to replace the country’s ancient M113 fleet. Hanwha won the $5-7 billion AUD ($3.38 billion US) contract in July 2023. That deal, combined with a broader agreement for Advanced Navigation to supply its precision guidance systems to Hanwha worldwide, could lead to as much as a 400 percent increase in business for the Australian firm, Shaw said. However, that broader agreement, as far as was disclosed, does not include an immediate contract. Advanced Navigation builds fiber-optic inertial guidance systems bolstered by artificial intelligence to provide systems that the company claims can operate in degraded combat environments, where GPS is subject to jamming or spoofing with a high degree of accuracy. That's important, because the conflict in Ukraine has shown that active electronic warfare capabilities can largely sideline the kind of precision-guided systems the West has invested in heavily for decades. (For instance, the precision artillery projectile Excalibur has reportedly been largely sidelined by Ukraine because its effectiveness declined below 10 percent. The munition costs around $160,000 per unit.) Shaw said his company already supplies systems used by Ukraine but he didn't identify any of them. 'Navigation warfare has emerged as one of the most effective mechanisms to level the battlefield,' Mike Smith, CEO of Hanwha Defense US, said at the ceremony marking the broader agreement. 'It has the potential to be the most expansive non-lethal effect in modern history.' The agreement will see the companies collaborate on the development of high-performance inertial navigation systems (INS) for autonomous, airborne and crewed systems on land and in the air. The deal calls for co-production of the systems by Advanced Navigation and Hanwha, appearing to open the door to deals in every country where Hanwha's defense units do business.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/aussie-gps-alternative-firm-advanced-navigation-wins-big-hanwha-contract/	2024-09-11T06:39:06-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240226_australian_redback_ifv_MoD-e1708986548908.jpg

The aviation-focused Experimental Gateway Demonstration Event (EDGE) 2024 kicked off Monday and is expected to run for over two weeks. While details about exactly what tech is being tested this year remains under wraps, the event is focused on examining launched effects and unmanned aerial vehicles. Can they work together? Hold up against electronic warfare jammers? 'We really wanted to pinpoint it down to autonomy and behaviors … inside a contested environment,' Brig. Gen. Cain Baker, the director of the Army Future Command’s Future of Vertical Lift Cross Functional Team, told reporters last week. 'We've established, really, some battlefield geometry out there at the brigade, division, corps, against replicated threats, you know, with our live emitters, and now we're going to ask industry to actually fly a mission set against those threats,' he later added. In total, the service selected five companies to haul along 30 different launched effects and aerial drones into the Arizona desert for this year’s demo, according to Baker, who did not disclose just who and what made that list. Sister services will also be on hand with their own tech. The goal, he said, is threefold: explore which capabilities worked well alone, which paired well with other weapons, and how they responded to threats. 'What we're doing out of EDGE is really informing our next set of requirements for launched effects or UAS,' Baker said. 'The outcome of EDGE really drives our set of requirements and acquisition,' he later added. Evolving Strategy As the Army looks to pull demo observations into the acquisition plan, service leaders have been grappling with its aviation weapons portfolio. After moving ahead with several, possibly overlapping, categories like launched effects, loitering munitions and drones, they sought a reset or at least a chance to better nail down each category. During a recent interview with Breaking Defense, Program Executive Officer for Aviation Brig. Gen. David Phillips said the Army Requirements Oversight Council inked an internal Abbreviated Concept Development Document earlier this summer. While he didn’t detail all the changes in the document, he revealed that the service is officially moving forward with the hunt for a short-range launched effect, studying lethal payloads for the medium-range option, and in a holding pattern for a long-range precision munition. When it comes to those launched effects — essentially small drones that shoot out of something else mid-flight to collect info or strike targets — the service is eyeing three ranges: short, medium and long. It initially opted to focus work on that middle option, but is now officially moving forward with development of a shorter-range variant. 'That's executing in parallel,' Phillips said. As for the medium-range weapon, the service formed a partnership between a handful of companies. Anduril Industries is providing the air vehicle (the Altius 700); Collins Aerospace, the mission system; Aurora Flight Sciences is the integrator; and two other undisclosed companies working on payloads. The change, here, according to Phillips, is that his shop is now working with the Program Executive Office for Missiles and Space to move forward to find the right lethality capability for that medium-range option. 'From our perspective on the launch effect capability … [it] is maturing rapidly, so to bring a warhead lethality capability on to that, would be a feasible approach, and so they're working on that,' he explained. The pursuit for a longer-range launched effect is still down the road, according to Phillips, but Baker explained that the Marine Corps is bringing out a similar 'lethal' capability to EDGE for the Army to try out and explore connectivity questions, like how far out it can fly. What isn’t clear is the fate of a helicopter-launched, long-range precision munition (LRPM). The service wants a longer-range weapon to fire off its AH-64 Apache helicopters and is buying and fielding the Spike Non-Line-Of-Sight missile system (NLOS) — made by Lockheed Martin and Israel’s Rafael — as the interim solution. However, it was planning to acquire a long-term solution and hosted a 'shoot-off' with three vendors in 2022. An Army Requirements Oversight Council had been slated to meet earlier this year to discuss the way ahead but that was postponed and possibly folded into that larger Abbreviated Concept Development Document decision point, in part because the service reclassified LRPM as a launched effect. Phillps didn’t disclose just how LRPM work now fits into the launched effect roadmap but said more decisions will be forthcoming. 'There's more to be determined based on technological maturity assessments, all those capabilities and discussions from a requirements perspective,' Phillips said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/09/army-to-test-out-30-new-drones-and-launched-effects-during-edge-24/	2024-09-11T04:34:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/09/UH-60-launches-Area-I-ALTIUS-mini-drone-e1649271214347.jpg
