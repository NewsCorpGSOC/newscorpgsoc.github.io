Army chooses BAE Systems for prototype base defense artillery cannon	Army Gen. Randy George, the 41st Chief of Staff of the Army, addresses attendees at the 146th National Guard Association of the United States General Conference, Detroit, Michigan, Aug. 24, 2024. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class Zach Sheely) WASHINGTON — The US Army has chosen BAE Systems to prototype a new artillery cannon, envisioned to defend bases against a variety of threats including unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and other advanced air threats. The system has been dubbed the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon (MDAC) and Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) prototype. The service announced the selection in a public Dec. 20 notice, which was sole-sourced to BAE, meaning the Pentagon did not hold a competition amongst private industry to determine its vendor. The Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office 'has a requirement to develop and deliver a full Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon System (MDACS) Battery no later than Q4FY27 followed by an operational demonstration in FY28,' according to the notice. 'A full MDACS battery consists of eight Multi-Domain Artillery Cannons, four Multi-Function Precision Radars, two Multi-Domain Battle Managers, and separately, no less than 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles.' The announcement did not include details about the amount of funding the contract would include, but Breaking Defense previously reported the Army was planning to spend $67 million in fiscal 2025 to kick off its efforts before investing more heavily in future years. (The government is currently operating under a continuing resolution, with funding stuck at FY24 levels through at least March.) 'Throughout the developmental effort, soldier touchpoints will gather feedback for Army requirements generation and prototype maturation,' the service wrote in its budget justification documents. 'MDACS will use the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) and conduct a series of flight tests culminating in a battery-level operational assessment in FY 2028.' An assessment is expected in 2028 to determine the technology can be fielded, according to the service, which is increasingly prioritizing base defense as it preps for a potential conflict in the Pacific.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-chooses-bae-systems-for-prototype-base-defense-artillery-cannon/	2025-01-03T07:56:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/randy-george-scaled-e1735919540725.jpg
The future of Syria, Lebanon and geopolitical moves in the Middle East to come: 2025 preview	Fighters walk in the Syrian presidential palace in Damascus' Mount Qasyoun on December 8, 2024, after Islamist-led rebels declared that they have taken the Syrian capital in a lightning offensive, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria. (Photo by OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Hopes are high that year 2025 will be one of peace in the region after an especially violent 2024. The fastest developing story, sure to dominate at least the start of the new year, is found in Syria, where leader Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, ending a 50-year family rule. Now, a coalition of rebels are in control of the capital, and the world is watching for how they will shape the nation's future — and whether democracy or extremism will blossom. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Additionally, this year is expected to reveal to future of Russian and Iranian influence in Syria, specifically the Russian military bases in the country. Will Moscow strike a deal with the rebels to keep Hmeimim air base and Tartus naval base as its power projection focal points in the Mediterranean or is 2024 the end of Russian presence in Syria? This remains to be answered and maybe sooner in 2025 than expected. After Syria itself, the region can be expected to keep a close eye on neighbor Iraq, which was already planning to end the US-led coalition mission there by September 2025. 'To be clear, the United States is not withdrawing from Iraq,' a senior administration official told reporters in September 2024. 'We are moving towards the type of productive long-term security relationship that the United States has with partners around the world.' Nevertheless, this upcoming year might put Baghdad under strain if ISIS and al Qaeda see a resurgence in Syria. Assad's fall in Damascus also may strain Iran's influence in Iraq, and could push Iranian-allied militias there to resort to asymmetric threats to compensate their retreat in other countries. Also in flux as the new year looms is the fate of Southern Lebanon, after Hezbollah and Israel agreed to a ceasefire there. On the Lebanese side, observers can expect the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to be the jewel of 2025, as it will take on a key role in maintaining the ceasefire to the south, but also contend with instability from Syria's collapse that could mean more stress on Lebanon's other borders. On the technical side, I expect international conferences to support the LAF to take place to boost its armament parallel to the increased role entrusted to the military. The military aid is expected mainly from the US, the traditional donor to LAF, France and Arab countries like Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, for their own defense Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates can be expected to boost cooperation with Western defense firms through joint ventures, while at the same time they're likely to keep investing at home to boost domestic industry. Twenty-twenty-five could bring on fighter jet news, as Saudi Arabia may find its way into the British-Italian-Japanese Global Combat Air Programme, and the UAE may redouble its efforts to join the American F-35 program. Last but not least, 2025 could see another big push towards normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, something the Biden administration had flirted with accomplishing before Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 attacks derailed that delicate process. Additionally Saudi Arabia might be able to seal the defense pact with US where Washington would be committed to defending Saudi territory in case of attack. Whether this pact, which was 'very close' back in May, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, will be a prerequisite to normalization with Israel remains to be seen.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/the-future-of-syria-lebanon-and-geopolitical-moves-in-the-middle-east-to-come-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T07:43:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241219_rebels_assad_palace_inside_GettyImages-2188884856-scaled-e1734640650830.jpg
Pacific political turmoil, AUKUS, and the looming Taiwan deadline: 2025 preview	Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on Dec. 4, after South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. (Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — Readers can expect the beginning of 2025 to be dominated by political turmoil in the Indo-Pacifc, with South Korea unexpectedly groping for an answer to the impeachment of its president, Australia possibly facing a closely divided parliament, Japan trying to build government that will last more than a year and China offering the prospect of more uncertainty in the highest reaches of its military. Once South Korea selects a replacement for impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose unexpected declaration of martial law sparked a fundamental threat to the country's hard-won democracy, the outlines of the new foreign and national security policies will begin to emerge from the political fog. The most likely outcome, at this point, seems to be a more amendable approach to China, more skepticism of the tight intelligence ties with Japan and a less hardline approach to North Korea. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Japan, whose government led by Prime Minister Ishiba Chigger, suffered a sharp rebuke from the public in late October elections, may struggle to maintain the intelligence-sharing arrangement with South Korea. The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) was originally signed for the two countries to share information on North Korea. Under the original terms of the deal, Japan would send satellite imagery and electronic information to South Korean analysts, who would reciprocate with human intelligence going to Japan. The agreement is also designed to allow the two sides to share real-time targeting information to counter North Korean missiles. The weakness of the Japanese government could also affect what have been rapidly tightening ties between Japan and Australia. For example, the two countries now speak each of other as partners second only to the United States, which is their primary ally. And the two countries defense ministers — flanked by outgoing US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — announced in mid-November that Japanese marines would make regular rotations to Australia for training and exercises. Further south, Australia may also face its own electoral turmoil with national elections likely to be held in March (they must be held by May). The Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is widely expected to prevail, but there is a reasonable chance that the election may result in Labor losing much of its authority as the group of MPs known as Teals could swell their ranks and the coalition of Liberal and National Party MPs might surge. That could be good for defense spending. The Labor Party, which has spoken bracingly of the grim regional strategic situation and the need for the three-nation AUKUS effort and for Australia to bolster its conventional major weapons systems, has actually let defense spending plans dip in real terms from 2023-2026. The election results will determine whether that changes. AUKUS, at least in theory, could benefit from increased support from the Liberal Party leadership. Japan and South Korea's efforts to tie themselves more closely to the so-called Pillar II or AUKUS — research and development of advanced capabilities such as hypersonic, cyber, autonomy, artificial intelligence and underwater tech — will depend on their and Australia's political results, as well as the assessment of the incoming Trump administration. On the other side of the geostrategic coin, in 2025 military planners, diplomats and strategists will be closely watching China as it continues to purge top military leaders, for reasons uncertain. Finally, all of this will be taking place in the shadow of 2027 — the year by which the US says Chinese President Xi Jinping has said he wants the Peoples Liberation Army to have the capabilities to execute an armed takeover of Taiwan. Australia and Japan are keenly aware of the date. Japan has significantly boosted its defense spending to record levels and published a strategy that makes Taiwan the keystone of much of its planning. While few experts believe Xi has set 2027 as the year he will actually try to take Taiwan, with only two years to go, military strategists usually plan for the worst.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/pacific-political-turmoil-aukus-and-the-looming-taiwan-deadline-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T05:33:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/south-korea-coup-scaled-e1733326013659.jpg
For the Space Force, terrestrial turf wars and rising budgets await: 2025 preview	The moon as a crystal ball. (Images via Getty / graphic by Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld elicited some snickers back in 2002 with his famous quote about 'known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns' bedevilling US intelligence about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. But those words seem pretty appropriate when trying to prognosticate what 2025 will look like for the US Space Force. From bureaucratic turf wars to extra-terrestrial combat, the old crystal ball is just pretty darn cloudy right now. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] There are a few things that pundits by and large agree are clearly on the agenda next year, with outcomes that are fairly likely. First is the likely growth in both the Space Force's budget and force size. As this humble scribe predicted at the end of last year, service leaders over the past 12 months sought to make its case for growth in personnel numbers, in mission areas and in budget. Indeed, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall — who, according to sources, has on more than one occasion and only half-jokingly called the newest military service his 'biggest unfunded priority' — called for the Space Force's budget to be doubled or even tripled. Given that President-elect Donald Trump takes personal credit for the Space Force's creation, service advocates appear pretty confident on social media that the service's budget and status within the Defense Department will rise. But given the administration's much-touted effort to cut costs by finding efficiency in government departments including DoD, few analysts are putting their bets on a funding increase anywhere close to Kendall's call. Second, Congress is already making noise about looking to 2025, the Space Force's fifth year, as a kind of deadline for the service to show first results from efforts to pivot to new ways of doing business — that is, to demonstrate tangible progress toward new, more resilient capabilities based on 'proliferated' constellations and the use of commercial satellites and technologies. Service leaders are likely to have to answer the question: Five years on, what new capabilities to meet the growing threat actually are in the field? And Space Force officials swear that they will have something to show for the investment so far. In particular, the Space Development Agency (SDA) is expected to begin launching its first set of satellites with limited operational capabilities, called Tranche 1, in March or April. Tranche 1 includes 126 Transport Layer data relay satellites, and 35 Tracking Layer birds for missile tracking, and the agency plans to have all of them on orbit by early 2026. Tranche 1 will be the first opportunity for SDA and the Space Force to prove that constellations made up of large numbers of smaller satellites in low Earth orbit can speed needed data to warfighters while complicating adversary targeting efforts. In addition, Col. Rich Kniseley, the head of the Space Force's Commercial Space Office, told Breaking Defense on Dec. 17 that he is confident his shop will award the first contracts under the service's fledgling Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR) program early next year. CASR is being developed as the Space Force's answer to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, and those first awards will be focused on commercial providers of space tracking data and analysis. Commercial industry officials are hoping CASR also will serve as a market stabilizer by providing predictable funding lines. Despite the intervention of White House budgetmeisters and the National Space Council, the long-running turf battle between the Space Force and the two key Intelligence Community agencies with space mandates, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), will continue to fester into next year. The most pressing source of strife is the question of who is in charge of buying commercial remote sensing imagery and products when and under what circumstances — an issue that a industry officials say threatens to undercut the nascent market. Government sources have told Breaking Defense that draft memos have been inked to clarify the lanes, in particular one between NGA and the Space Force, but that squabbling has broken out again in light of the pending administration change. It is anyone's guess whether, or how, the issue will be resolved over the next year. Savvy betters will be putting money on a marked shift in budget priorities next year towards the development of new kit and capabilities for targeting Russian and Chinese space systems, whether those be suspected killer satellites or more traditional military support systems such as intelligence-gathering satellites. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has spent much of this year advocating for such a shift — one that from all past evidence the incoming Trump administration likely will support. The unknown here is how far that tilt will go, given that the Space Force is still struggling to make a number traditional satellite systems foundational for warfighting fit for purpose. And as noted above the budget will not be unlimited. All things considered — the churn in domestic politics, the famous unpredictability of the incoming POTUS, the increasingly volatile international security scene and the runaway pace of technology innovation in the commercial space market — 2025 seems even more ripe than this year for supernova-sized surprises. Honestly, who had the fall of Syria or North Korean garbage balloons on their 2024 bingo card? What's next, extra-terrestrial craft among the ever-increasing drone swarms? Chemical weapons production in space? A materials breakthrough enabling a (squee!) space elevator? Obviously, all of those are pretty far out — but you never know. Proceed at your own risk, and hardhats are highly recommended.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/for-the-space-force-terrestrial-turf-wars-and-rising-budgets-await-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T12:01:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241218_space_crystal_ball_GFX.png
Trump administration inherits Air Force funding hurdle: 2025 preview	Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin makes remarks before presenting Maj. Brady Augustin the 2022 Koren Kolligian Jr. Trophy during a ceremony at the Pentagon, Arlington, Va., Feb. 7, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — In a March briefing with reporters outlining the service’s fiscal 2025 budget, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall issued a warning: Although spending limits imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act are set to expire by FY26, leaders would still have to make 'tough choices' about big priorities that year. The FY26 budget is now (almost) here, and decisions within it are in the hands of the incoming Trump administration. In conjunction with incumbent Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, Kendall’s successor — who has not been announced as of this writing — will officially chart the way forward for a service that is struggling with a shrinking fighter force, pressing modernization needs and a wholesale revamp aimed at countering China. An early preview of the problems facing the next administration was recently laid out by Kendall, who mused that the service’s plans for a next-gen tanker may not be affordable. Similar funding constraints apply to a next-gen fighter whose fate will now be settled by the incoming Trump team, a key program for the Air Force that Breaking Defense previously reported is supported by the service's internal analysis. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Other critical efforts additionally need funding in the upcoming FY26 budget, most notably two legs of the nuclear triad. As a seemingly successful flight test campaign continues, officials expect to ramp up production of the service’s B-21 Raider built by Northrop Grumman. And work on the new Sentinel ICBM, where Northrop is also the prime contractor, must proceed after a congressionally mandated review determined that there was no alternative for the increasingly expensive program. Compounding the service’s woes, the FY25 budget has yet to be approved by lawmakers, and likely won’t be until March at the earliest. Trump-appointed officials alongside lawmakers will then simultaneously have to finalize the FY25 budget and craft FY26 spending plans — leading one top outgoing Pentagon official to predict the FY26 budget may not arrive until April or May. How the new leadership in Washington influences the Air Force is an open question. But even two big milestones ahead that will likely be welcomed by the service may be interpreted differently by up-and-coming power players — notably Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-leads of a planned commission that will seek to slash government spending. A leading example is the service’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft program. The drone wingmen are set to make their maiden flights next year, as the likes of Ramaswamy call to pour more investment into uncrewed systems, rather than 'a wide range of other expenditures for new kinds of fighter jets' among other capabilities. A successful CCA program could bolster calls to scale back manned fighters, but for now, officials are pushing back against moving to fully unmanned combat. As Allvin recently told attendees at the Reagan Forum, his vision for the future consists of manned–unmanned teaming. In a similar vein, upgraded versions of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 could finally be cleared for combat in 2025. While likely to be celebrated by officials once it’s achieved, significant delays for the upgrade may only embolden the likes of Musk, who has called officials 'idiots' for continuing to build the stealth fighter. As always, it'll be Congress that makes the final call on Pentagon programs. And though incumbent Biden administration officials have said they’ve been working to a higher topline for a notional 2026 budget than what was the norm under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, it’s not clear if congressional conservatives — who backed the legislation in the first place — would support major boosts to defense spending. However, proponents of a bigger Air Force budget will still have allies on Capitol Hill under the new GOP majority. One key champion for a larger Pentagon topline will likely be Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is set to chair the Senate subcommittee that oversees defense spending. Incoming Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., has also called for a 'full-scale rebuilding of the shrinking US Air Force,' including by pressing forward with the Next Generation Air Dominance program. Speaking Dec. 10 during a virtual discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, outgoing Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter described two principal challenges awaiting the next administration: getting the proper resourcing, and ensuring systems are effectively integrated in a new, highly connected age of warfighting. '[I]f the Fiscal Responsibility Act shapes the resource posture of the nation, we will not be able to fulfill the national defense strategy,' Hunter said of budgetary challenges. Regarding the 'sophisticated integration mission,' Hunter then said that 'I think we’ve got people who can hit it out of the park,' although '[y]ou’re still going to have to swing at the pitch and make contact.' Lauding 'wins' notched under his tenure, Hunter added, 'there is a lot still to be done.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trump-administration-inherits-air-force-funding-hurdle-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T10:30:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/allvin-scaled-e1718387249735.jpg
From a new civilian leader to modernization priorities, Army changes afoot: 2025 preview	Gen. Randy George, Chief of Staff of the Army, discusses next generation command and control (C2) system capabilities with a 1st Infantry Division Soldier during a human machine Integration demonstration at Project Convergence &#8211; Capstone 4. (US Army/Sgt. Brahim Douglas) WASHINGTON — An upcoming civilian leadership shakeup across the entire Department of Defense next year could usher Daniel Driscoll in as the 26th Army secretary if Senators give their blessings. President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick — a former soldier and adviser to Vice President-elect JD Vance — to lead the ground service in early December. The gig brings with it a host of decisions including ways to move weapon development programs into production; revamp ones that have foundered in early development; and carve out efficiencies. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, who still has several years left of his tenure, talked about some of these challenges back in October. 'It should be clear to all of us that the days where we indiscriminately could buy an entire Army’s worth of inventory in a single program of record are gone,' he told an audience during the Association of the US Army annual conference. 'We can’t afford to invest in obsolescence. 'There are also some things that we are going to stop buying, old, stand-alone tech that doesn’t connect to our network, equipment that can’t operate in our [transformation in contact] formations, all of the outdated stuff that isn’t survivable on the modern battlefield,' the four-star general later added. 'Even if it was a requirement in the past, even if it was a program of record, we may have to stop buying it.' While he didn’t name names of possible programs on the cutting room floor, the service has been grappling with a flat budget as it pushed forward with modernization priorities categories — long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift, the network, air and missile defense and soldier lethality — that were inked out during the first Trump administration. By and large, those priorities remained during the Biden administration, with the exception of some systems being killed off, like the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), and others sent back to the drawing board. While service officials haven’t disclosed if 2025 will be the year they need to make sweeping cuts and prioritize funding, they do have some key decision points set for the coming 12 months. This year, for example, the service officially announced it was halting development on its Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) platform after spending several years integrating and testing out the addition of a 30-foot, 58-caliber gun tube to BAE Systems’ Paladin M109A7 self-propelled howitzer. It subsequently announced that five companies had been picked — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems — to demo their existing platforms. In early December, Director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks said those early evaluations indicate that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation,' which means the service may decide not to delve into another lengthy development phase, and a decision is likely coming in 2025. Depending on when a new Army civilian leader is ultimately sworn in, a couple of other big-ticket items may await including the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next and a single vendor selected for the Robotic Combat Vehicle Phase II. The Army is also poised to use next year’s Project Convergence capstone event to test out the service’s future command and control (C2) architecture to see if it’s on the right track. If testing there goes well, senior leaders will likely hand the prototyping project over to the Army Futures Command's (AFC) Network Cross-Functional Team to continue work. That team is 'already getting the requirements developers together. They’re already looking at the budget that it will require, and working [on] the acquisition approach,' explained Col. Michael Kaloostian, the AFC’s networks and security director for Next Generation C2. Part of that tentative plan ahead revolves around delivering a 'minimal viable product' to units later in 2025 for continued testing before the service begins fielding it to soldiers, possibly in 2026. Another hot topic across the government next year is poised to be the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. An initiative rather than a department, there have been threats of major cuts to the DoD, and for his part, George has said is in favor of finding efficiency inside the Army. 'We’ve talking about process innovation in the Army for the last year,' he told an audience in early December out at the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'If it doesn’t make us more lethal or our teams more cohesive, we have to be looking at, you know, should we be doing it? So I think we have to review everything that we’re doing in that light.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/from-a-new-civilian-leader-to-modernization-priorities-army-changes-afoot-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T08:14:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/8298347-scaled-e1734367699797.jpg
Ireland and Airbus agree to $95 million H145M helicopter deal	The Airbus H145M helicopter can be fitted with a range of ballistic and guided weapons BELFAST — The Irish Department of Defence has signed a contract with Airbus UK for the acquisition of four H145M light-utility helicopters, in a deal valued at €91.7 million ($94.6 million). Announced this week in a statement by Micheál Martin, Irish deputy prime minister and minister for defence, the new multirole rotorcraft — set to replace two aging EC-135 aircraft — will be used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), light attack operations, police air support and training. 'These helicopters will not only significantly boost the capacity of the Defence Forces pilot training programmes, but also enhance intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and light combat capabilities of our Air Corps,' said Martin. Dublin also stressed that the new aircraft will 'greatly improve' operational support for Special Forces and the Army Ranger Wing. General Officer Commanding of the Irish Air Corps, Brig. Gen. Rory O’Connor, said the aircraft 'will provide vital light tactical transport support to the Army, Navy, and Army Ranger Wing, reinforcing our interoperability with Special Operations Forces.' He added, 'These helicopters will also play an important role in shaping the next generation of rotary-wing pilots, ensuring the Irish Air Corps remains agile, adaptable, and mission-ready for years to come.' Dublin did not disclose which weapons will be fitted on the H145M fleet, but a first aircraft delivery is scheduled for Q1 2027. The H145M is typically outfitted with the Airbus HForce weapons management system, which covers a range of ballistic and guided missile options, including machine gun (12.7mm), canon (20mm), rocket (70mm), as well as air-to-air, air-to-ground and laser guided rocket munitions, according to company literature [PDF]. The latest aviation acquisition by the small, militarily neutral nation comes weeks after signing a €53 million order with France's Dassault for a Falcon 6X multipurpose strategic reach aircraft, which will be used for 'transport, airlift and medical capabilities,' per the announcement. Set to be operated out of Casement Aerodrome, Dublin, the fixed wing aircraft is set for delivery in December 2025 — and likely will play a VIP transport role when Ireland takes over the presidency of the European Union in 2026. More broadly, Ireland has committed to transforming its defense forces by 2028, based around the implementation of recommendations made by the Commission on the Defence Forces. To reach such an ambition, Dublin is focused on the Commission’s Level of Ambition 2 (LOA2) concept and addressing 'priority gaps' related to 'an assault on Irish sovereignty.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/ireland-and-airbus-agree-to-95-million-h145m-helicopter-deal/	2025-01-02T07:44:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/H145-EXPH-1745-11-scaled-e1702556338132.jpg
For the Navy, all eyes will be on the China-Taiwan question: 2025 preview	The Arleigh-Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG-52) transits in the Taiwan Strait. (US Navy photo by Ensign Samuel Hardgrove) WASHINGTON — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti has ordered the US Navy to be prepared for the possibility of conflict with China over Taiwan in 2027. But for better or worse, the Navy the US has today is largely the one it will have in 2027, and what last-minute preparations Franchetti can make will be my focus in the new year. In the Pentagon, there are three budgets that exist. (Technically, Congress has not yet passed an appropriations bill for 2025, but for the sake of simplicity, let’s assume they will by March.) That means the budgets in play next year will be the one being executed, fiscal 2025; the one being debated on Capitol Hill, FY26; and the one being crafted inside the Pentagon, FY27. In other words, the service has just one more budget cycle to make meaningful pre-2027 changes to its fleet composition that haven’t already been publicly disclosed. As Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., likes to say, 'Shipbuilding is a long game.' One year is not enough time for dramatic change, as long-time Congressional Budget Office analyst Eric Labs pointed out earlier this month. Which leaves the question of: What can the Navy do before then to prepare for a potential conflict with China? The answer the service has presented comes from Franchetti’s recently published Navigation Plan, which includes her 'Project 33,' the spearheading initiative setting the service’s focus on 2027. Franchetti lays out numerous goals but one that stands out to me is her focus on 80 percent surge readiness. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 'Think back to 9/11. We know that all of a sudden we need to get ships underway to do different missions … We want to be able to have a process through each one of our communities: aviation, surface and submarines, that they can certify a ship as combat surge ready, and get it out the door on the timeline that it’s needed,' she told reporters earlier this year. It certainly seems like a worthwhile goal, but the Navy’s struggles with maintenance keeping pace with operational tempo — even in peacetime, never mind wartime — are well documented. The CNO will be trying to rapidly overcome problems that I suspect many, if not all, of her predecessors, and their respective counterparts in the Commandant’s office, grappled with when they were at helm. Franchetti has also taken to using the phrase 'Getting more players on the field,' referring to building traditional warships, but also unmanned vessels, among other efforts. The service has spent considerable time and money in the first half of the 2020s going through the steps to incorporate unmanned surface and subsurface vessels into its fleet. And there are success stories such as Saildrones patrolling the seas in support of 4th Fleet. My focus in 2025 will be watching to see if the service can maintain its momentum in adding unmanned vessels to its fleet and when will we more frequently hear about those vessels’ inclusion in real-world operations alongside the manned fleet. Engaging Houthis alongside a carrier strike group in the Red Sea is a vastly different mission than surveilling the coast of South America. Lastly, there’s the money. Franchetti’s plan states candidly that without a larger budget, the service will face 'deep strategic constraints.' When faced with a difficult financial situation this past year, the service opted to heavily cut into its future modernization budget to make up the difference. Cutting funds for next-generation strike fighter development was one big bill payer. While conventional wisdom suggests a Trump administration will certainly request more funding for defense, whether Congress — with all its varying factions, even within the GOP alone — provides that higher level of funding is still very much a question in my mind. How the Navy copes with whatever money it does receive will be a key point on my watch list in 2025. For those who haven’t heard Franchetti speak publicly recently, she has said she has a countdown timer in her office indicating the number of days until 2027. China and its intentions toward Taiwan are clearly at the front of mind for the CNO; she has it put it at the front of mind for her service and, indeed, it will be front of mind for me in the new year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/for-the-navy-all-eyes-will-be-on-the-china-taiwan-question-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T06:03:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/6185323.jpg
Defense industry could see big shakeup under Trump: 2025 Preview	A model of the proposed paint scheme of the next generation of Air Force One is on display during a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Oval Office of the White House June 20, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON— No one could predict the twists and turns of the first Trump administration, even for an area as obscure and mundane as the defense industrial base, and it would be a fool’s errand to try to do that for a second one. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Instead, let’s break down the current state of play in the political environment, look back at the first Trump term, and think about some of the major questions facing the defense industry during a second Trump administration: Will Trump personally involve himself in defense acquisition, again? For defense acquisition nerds, Trump’s first term was marked by his highly unusual personal involvement in weapons contracting. Whether it was his stated desire to return to 'goddamn steam' catapults on the Ford-class carrier, interrogating Boeing executives on the possibility of buying a 'Super Duper Hornet' F/A-18 variant, or having personal meetings with defense CEOs on Air Force One and F-35 contracts, Trump delved into the minutia of defense acquisition in a way that no US president had done in the modern era. With the Wall Street Journal reporting that Trump has already spoken with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg about the Air Force One replacement program — as well as the return of the F-35 and drone warfare to the mainstream news cycle — it’s highly probable that we could see Trump once again try to make his mark on a program, putting pressure on defense contractors to highlight his deal-making skills to the American taxpayer. If I were a gambler, my money would be on Trump interference on big-name aerospace projects — most likely F-35 or Air Force One, again — but potentially also other fighter jets, including the Navy and Air Force’s sixth-generation fighter programs. What happens with defense spending? The fiscal 24 defense budget was constrained by the spending limits imposed by last year’s Fiscal Responsibility Act, and while final appropriations for FY25 won’t be passed until spring (at earliest), signs point to a budget that conforms to those limits. Those restrictions will be gone in time for FY26 — the first chance the Trump administration has to shape the defense budget, albeit not from the bottom up. While the groundwork for the FY26 was performed by the Biden-era Pentagon, whether the incoming administration doubles down on that stagnant Pentagon spending or bumps it up could be a bellwether for its approach in future years. Analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense immediately after the presidential election were split on whether Trump would be good for defense spending. Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with TD Cowen, pointed to boosts in defense spending under the first Trump administration and cited support for higher toplines among Republican leaders on the defense committees. However, whether defense budgets ultimately see a boost could be down to the interplay of House Republicans, as the razor-thin GOP majority in the House has given hardline fiscal conservatives enormous bargaining power. The Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, could be another fly in the ointment for defense spending hawks. Musk has declared his intent to use DOGE to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget. And although lawmakers, defense executives and military leaders have suggested they’re on board to cut wasteful spending (who doesn’t love government efficiency?), I don’t see defense companies lining up to suggest programs where they should receive less money. RELATED: Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon's DOGE to wow Is Trump a friend or foe to the defense industry, and who benefits? During his last term, Trump got cozy with the defense primes, celebrating the business acumen of defense executives such as then-Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and — before the Boeing 737 MAX crisis — Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. It remains to be seen whether any CEOs from legacy defense primes win Trump’s favor, but so far his regard seems to be centered on business leaders from the defense startup and venture capital world. The incoming president recently tapped Stephen Feinberg, who leads private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, as deputy secretary of defense. Other executives from firms like Anduril and Palantir are also reportedly being considered for major roles inside the Pentagon, and Musk could be helping to cut Pentagon spending despite leading a major defense company in SpaceX. One way this dynamic could play out is greater preference for inexpensive uncrewed systems — an area where defense startups have firm footing — instead of the exquisite, expensive weapons platforms traditionally made by defense primes. Pentagon leaders could potentially opt to sacrifice a discrete quantity of a major weapons system such as a single Virginia-class submarine or several dozen F-35s in order to buy hundreds of autonomous weapons and improved networks, Byron Callan, a defense analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a Dec. 18 note to investors. 'The tension between GOP fiscal hawks and defense hawks will likely push the administration to look for lower-cost options for defense in the form of autonomous air and naval systems. The role of persons with defense tech/venture/start-up backgrounds in senior administration positions adds firepower to this battle,' he wrote. Down further into the weeds are questions about the regulatory environment, changes to defense contracting, and how Trump’s overall trade policy influences defense contractors. The previous Trump administration took a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement, resulting in increased mergers and acquisitions, most controversially seen in Northrop Grumman’s purchase of Orbital ATK. (The Biden administration would later block a similar proposal for Lockheed to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne.) Analysts speculate that the second Trump administration will revert back to a more permissive environment for M&amp;A.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/defense-industry-could-see-big-shakeup-under-trump-2025-preview/	2024-12-31T11:45:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220427_trump_af1_model_GettyImages-1157175271-scaled-e1651086105288.jpg
Austria picks Leonardo M-346 light fighter to replace retired Saab 105s	The M-346, produced by Leonardo, showed off some of its weapons options at the 2023 Paris Air Show. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Austria has taken the next step in shoring up its small and aging fleet of jet fighters, with the formal announcement that Vienna will procure 12 Leonardo M-346FA aircraft. The announcement, made by Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner on Dec. 28, had been been anticipated for months. It comes four years after the neutral nation retired its Swedish-built Saab 105 trainers. The M-346 model selected is light fighter variant of the Italian firm's jet, which is best known as an aircraft trainer. Austria will buy the jets from the Italian government under a government-to-government contract whose details are still under negotiation, the Bundesheer announcement said. While the timeline and pricing for the purchase remain unclear, the Austrian government budgeted 1 billion Euros (currently just over $1 billion US) for the purchase in 2022. Leonardo declined to comment for this article. Until the M-346s begin arriving, the Austrian Air Force’s only combat aircraft are 15 Eurofighters, according to a Flight Global database [PDF] — six of them purchased second-hand from the German Luftwaffe and all of them in the barebones Tranche 1 configuration. (The latest Eurofighter upgrade is Tranche 4). The single-engine M-346 is a significantly lighter aircraft than the twin-engined Typhoon, albeit heftier than the 1960s-vintage Saab 105s it replaces. The M-346 first flew in 2004 as an advanced training aircraft, but like many trainers it can be configured for air defense or ground attack as well. It is currently operated by Italy, Poland, Singapore, Israel, Greece and Qatar, and Leonardo is pitching the aircraft aggressively both to Latin American nations and to the US Navy to replace its aging T-45. The M-346 is also used by the Italian-run International Flight Training School, where Austrian jet pilots have trained since the Saabs were retired. That training will return to Austria once the nation has its own M-346s, Tanner said in her announcement. 'By purchasing the jets, we are closing a significant capability gap in our air force,' Tanner said, according to an online translation of her German statement. 'In this way, we are not only bringing 100 percent of the training of our pilots back to Austria, but we are also significantly strengthening airspace defense. This increases the protection of Austria, the Austrian population and our neutrality against threats from the air.' Replacing the Saabs will also shore up the military value of Vogler Air Base and protect local jobs, Tanner said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/austria-picks-leonardo-m-346-light-fighter-to-replace-retired-saab-105s/	2024-12-31T10:45:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/IMG_4965-scaled-e1713255621953.jpg
China stirred the Pacific pot, Japan powered up and Aussie AUKUS anxiety emerged: 2024 in review	A China Coast Guard ship (L) is seen from the Philippine Coast Guard vessel BRP Cabra during a supply mission to Sabina Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea on August 26, 2024. (Photo by JAM STA ROSA/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — Turmoil, violence and reaction. That was the theme of 2024 across the Indo-Pacific, with China's belligerence and attempts to remake the international order to its liking at its core driving many decisions of the nations in the theater. In several instances this year Chinese forces engaged in hostile behavior, ramming Philippine ships, allegedly attacking Vietnamese fishermen and threatening Taiwan. But the actions were not without repercussions as they drove China's neighbors and NATO countries to sign major new agreements, increase exercises, sail more joint Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) and bang the diplomatic drums more loudly and more often. Japan made among the biggest moves in 2024. Tokyo and Canberra signed a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), clearing the way for regular deployments of Japanese marines to Australia, similar to the rotational force the US Marines have at what Australians call the Top End. Japan and Britain also signed an RAA. Japan also announced its biggest defense spending increase since World War II in September. 'The international community is facing the greatest post-war trial yet, and has entered a new era of crisis,' the first page of the their defense budget declared. In the Pacific Islands, scene of much turmoil over the last two years as China pressed to gain advantage in the region, the situation has seemed to stabilize in favor of Australia and its allies. Nauru, the troubled island that once had the world's highest GDP per capital and now faces possible ruin from climate change, agreed to accept $64 million USD from Australia in return for a veto of future Chinese activities in the tiny island. Nauru President David Adeang came to Canberra and signed the agreement on Dec. 9. This is similar to a treaty with Tuvalu, the Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union, which came into force in late August this year. In addition, the Pacific Island states agreed to join an Australian initiative to improve the region's police forces. Australia committed $400 million AUD ($253 million USD) over five years, which included creation of a regional training center in Brisbane, which opened the day after the Nauru treaty was agreed. The Chinese military itself also wasn't free of internal turmoil, which came into clear view with the suspension from office of a senior member of the powerful Central Military Commission and the previous disappearance of China's third defense minister. All that 'does not give a sense of stability within the PLA [People's Liberation Army],' Meia Nouwens of the International Institute for Strategic Sutfies told Breaking Defense earlier this month when the story broke. One of the few events largely divorced from China of great import in the region was the remarkable declaration of martial law — and its retraction — by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Now that Yoon has avoided immediate impeachment, there may be more regional stability than first expected, but his actions did, analysts said, put the crucial General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Japan at risk because the opposition is likely to suspend or scrap if should they take power. There is also concern among China watchers that should the opposition take power, they are likely to listen more carefully to Chinese policymakers than did Yoon. Meanwhile, threading through all these events has been the uncertain course of AUKUS, the massive effort by Australia, the UK and the US to help Australia buy at least three Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines and build a small fleet of SSN AUKUS boats over the next 20-plus years at an estimated cost of $368 billion AUD ($237 billion USD). Australia's defense budget will not increase in real terms until after the next election — likely to be held by March or April next year — at least. Sir Angus Houston, former chief of the defense force and co-author of the Defense Strategic Review, said in late November that Australia must increase overall defense spending to 3 percent of GDP to avoid cannibalizing the military in order to pay for AUKUS. The current plan would only boost spending to 2.2 percent of GDP by 2028. And there are signs of concern among senior Australian officials about budget and execution. Australia killed a $5.3 billion AUD satellite contract with Lockheed Martin, which would appear to be very sort of cannibalization Houston worried about. The Australian government claims it has protected the money and will invest in a new approach, but the cut occurred roughly 18 months after the award was announced. And in a little noticed declaration at a conference in the Indian Ocean focused on AUKUS, an Australian admiral voiced public worry that Australia’s generational effort to buy and deploy nuclear powered submarines was 'at risk' if the government does not take quick, decisive action on infrastructure. The military and government needed to 'get going' on crucial work to ready Western Australia for AUKUS submarines or risk falling behind, Rear Adm. Wendy Malcolm said. He added that Australia’s generational effort to buy and deploy nuclear powered submarines is 'at risk' if the government does not take quick, decisive action on infrastructure.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/china-stirred-the-pacific-pot-japan-powered-up-and-aussie-aukus-anxiety-emerged-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T09:26:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241213_china_philippine_ships_GettyImages-2167796597-scaled-e1734121917898.jpg
Middle East was designed by regional conflicts and increased indigenous production: 2024 in review	A cloud of smoke erupts during an Israeli air strike on the village of Sujud in southern Lebanon on September 25, 2024. (Photo by RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As the war drums fade in Lebanon and to the east the half-century Syrian regime has toppled, I've leaned toward labeling 2024 as 'the year the Middle East was reshaped.' [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The conflict between Israel and Lebanese group Hezbollah reached a ceasefire after a dramatic course of events including an Israeli attack on Hezbollah that included exploding pagers and walkie talkies, Israel targeting storage warehouses in civilian neighborhoods, and the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. The US-mediated ceasefire launched a 60-day truce between Israel and Lebanon starting on Nov. 27, with a monitoring committee comprised of the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Then, on Dec. 8 Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia while rebel forces swept through the country and captured Damascus. After the regime collapse, eyes moved to the fate of the Russian military bases in Syria and the potential collapse of an Iranian weapons pipeline to Hezbollah. In late 2023, the Red Sea saw attacks from the Yemen-based Houthi rebel group, which led to an international coalition to secure the waters. Notably, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were absent from these coalitions, and Bahrain was the only Gulf state to take part in the US-led operation Prosperity Garden. While parts of the Middle East reeled from those geopolitical earthquakes, the defense industries of other nations in the region doggedly pursued their own goals, including parallel focuses on localization and expansion with international partnerships. For instance, Qatar's Barzan Holdings is cementing the investments it's already made in platforms like unmanned vehicles, counter-UAS solutions, command and control systems and ammunition. 'We have built a good portfolio in the last seven years, and we are planning to strengthen this portfolio in these sectors,' deputy CEO Mohammad Al Marri told Breaking Defense in a March interview at DIMDEX in Qatar. 'We are not planning to diversify since what we have right now is competent enough. Our focus for the next five years is to ensure capability and sustainability for our platforms,' he added. UAE defense conglomerate EDGE Group expanded in 2024 its international reach with cross border cooperation plans, including founding an ammunition production line in Indonesia, signing an agreement with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to codevelop underwater solutions in the UAE, and signing another agreement with the Brazilian navy to codevelop counter-drone systems. 'This year [2024] for us is a year to catch up on our deliveries, our commitments, whether that is a delivery of a solution, or a development,' Hamad Al Marar, EDGE Group CEO told Breaking Defense in February. The firm also made its first stride in the space domain this year, launching a new company dubbed FADA. Saudi Arabia has worked on its ambitious defense plans this year, as it eyes to join the international sixth-generation fighter jets program, GCAP. Saudi Arabian Military Industries showed off its defense plans and platforms developed at second edition of the World Defense Show this year. Turkey made confident strides in its defense production projects. Its national fifth-generation fighter jet, dubbed KAAN, performed its maiden flight in February. Ankara also launched its first mostly indigenous communications satellite to orbit and expanded its deals with other nations, including its first export contract to a NATO nation.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/middle-east-was-designed-by-regional-conflicts-and-increased-indigenous-production-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T07:12:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-2173524754-scaled-e1734622532317.jpg
Russia doubled down on nuclear threats in Europe: 2024 in review	View of the Kremlin in the aftermath of a drone attack by Ukraine (Getty Images) BELFAST — This year Russian President Vladimir Putin ramped up threats to his enemies across the NATO alliance by lowering the threshold for a nuclear strike — a move that directly followed Moscow accusing the US of approving Ukraine to fire Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia for the first time since the war began. Shortly after, Washington went on to publicly acknowledge the policy to loosen weapon restrictions was in place, after months of resisting calls to do so. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Russia's new nuclear doctrine, signed by Putin in November, laid out in clear terms that any non nuclear power aligned with a nuclear state, or receiving support from a nuclear state — effectively all 32 members of NATO — will be considered targets if Russia thinks it is under threat. William Alberque, former Director of NATO’s Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Center, noted in an op-ed published on Breaking Defense, that 'In all, the new doctrine says that Russia will use nuclear weapons whenever the president decides to do so.' He added, 'But by expanding the role of nuclear weapons beyond … deterrence, and by expanding the dangers that could become threats — to include military infrastructure or exercises near its borders — it risks sending ambiguous or non-credible deterrent signals that could, in turn, require Putin to act out further in order to credibly deter the West.' On the ground in Ukraine, another 12 months have passed, over 1,000 days in all since the war started, without either side able to strike a winning blow — though Russia continued with slow advances. Kyiv has shown renewed resilience and ingenuity, most notably making a surprise incursion in the border territory of Kursk that featured an estimated deployment of 10,000 troops. At the time, the tactical gamble was looked upon by Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, as Ukraine's way of cracking 'open' debate in NATO over whether to allow long range weapon strikes in Russia, but it was only when North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk that Washington finally dropped long range weapons restrictions to strike inside Russia. It is estimated that Pyongyang has sent around 11,000 troops to Kursk. Losses on the North Korean side, shared for the first time in December by Ukraine's main defense intelligence agency, are said to amount to at least 30 dead or wounded in action, reported ABC News. Europe's efforts to increase weapons production on Ukraine's behalf and to restock equipment offered to Kyiv remains in the shadow of Russian industrial might. Morten Brandtzaeg, CEO of Norway’s Nammo, suggested that competing with Russian artillery shell production output on a 'one-to-one' basis is futile, and that European industry would be better served by concentrating on quality over quantity. He did share reasons for optimism however, explaining that European production took a 'huge step forward' over the last year, off the back of 'separate nations' supporting 'local industry' through government subsidies. Brandtzaeg added that Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany had all followed such a path. As the year draws to a close, top of mind for European leaders is the potential threat posed by President-elect Donald Trump; not just from the fallout that could occur from the US ending military aid to Ukraine — a move he has threatened — but a peace plan that might take Ukraine membership of NATO off the table. The sudden collapse of French and German governments in quick succession has not helped to allay fears that European unity on defense issues will suffer to boot.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/russia-doubled-down-on-nuclear-threats-in-europe-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T05:45:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/kremlin-scaled-e1683228223123.jpg
Turkey’s Baykar acquires Italian firm Piaggio Aerospace	A full-scale mockup of the Piaggio Aerospace's P.1 HH Hammerhead unmanned aerial system is presented at the International Paris Airshow at Le Bourget on June 17, 2015. (ERIC PIERMONT/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Baykar has been approved by the Italian government to buy Italian aviation giant Piaggio Aerospace in a move that thecompany says will expand its reach in the European Union. 'The relaunch of the company is guaranteed, with a clear and ambitious industrial vision,' Industry Minister Adolfo Urso said, according to a statement from the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy. 'After six years of waiting, we are giving Piaggio Aerospace a future, a strategic asset for our country, with a long-term production perspective, safeguarding corporate complexes and workforce.' Baykar outbid two other offers for the sale, according to the ministry's statement, though the value of the deal was not disclosed. Piaggio Aerospace was launched in 1884, and specializes in designing developing, manufacturing and maintaining aircraft, UAVs and engines. Piaggio Aerospace has developed the P.1HH HammerHead and P.180 Avanti unmanned aerial systems — giving it obvious synergies with Baykar, which rose to prominence on the back of its own UAV designs — and also conducts maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) services. 'It makes sense for Baykar to buy an Italian company. This will provide access to European markets, but also access to EU funded projects,' Caglar Kurc, a defense analyst and assistant professor at Abdullah Gül University, told Breaking Defense. 'I also think that this would protect Baykar's business with European countries if there are any crises between Turkey and European countries (or EU),' he said. Turkey was previously part of the Lockheed Martin-led F-35 fifth-generation aircraft program, with Turkish firms producing parts of the aircraft. In 2019, however, the US suspended Turkey’s participation in the program over Ankara’s purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense systems. Piaggio Aerospace was selected in 2004 by Pratt &amp; Whitney America to produce and supply components of F-135 engine for the F-35. With the purchase of Piaggio, it is possible Turkey could regain access to the F-35 supplier program. Spokespeople for Pratt &amp; Whitney did not respond to a request for comment by press time about what Piaggio’s current role on the F135 engine production line is or whether the company had any concerns about that role. A full return to F-35 program is 'unlikely' as long as Turkey has the S-400, Kurc said. But, 'Baykar, through Piaggio will become a supplier to F-35 [which] is pretty interesting to watch,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/turkeys-baykar-acquires-italian-firm-piaggio-aerospace/	2024-12-30T14:03:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/GettyImages-477405560-scaled-e1735574795992.jpg
Pentagon unveils new $2.5 billion package for Ukraine; USAI funds depleted	The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, firing a missile. The system, jointly produced by the US and Norway, is a critical part of Ukraine's air defense. (Photo: Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department today announced a new package of military assistance for Ukraine collectively worth roughly $2.5 billion, as the Biden administration in its waning days rushes to get aid to Kyiv out the door. Included in the announcement is $1.25 billion worth of equipment delivered via presidential drawdown authority, as well as $1.22 billion stemming from Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds. Drawdown equipment is taken directly from US stocks, whereas USAI funds can support a range of activities from training to the purchase of new equipment. The aid package, the Biden administration’s final of 2024, represents the depletion of USAI dollars Congress appropriated in an April supplemental spending bill, according to a White House press release. According to the Pentagon, drawdown equipment focused on Kyiv’s 'most urgent needs,' such as missile defense articles, artillery munitions and anti-tank weapons. For its part, USAI funds covered capabilities such as air defense and drones. The full list of equipment from a DoD press release is as follows: The package comes during a tough winter for Ukraine amid an onslaught of Russian strikes, including a Christmas Day attack on the country’s power grid. With USAI funds depleted, President Joe Biden is hurrying to spend remaining drawdown authority before President-elect Donald Trump takes office — whom many observers fear could turn off the spigot of military assistance for Kyiv. 'I’ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible — including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons,' Biden said in the release. 'At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagon-unveils-new-2-5-billion-package-for-ukraine-usai-funds-depleted/	2024-12-30T12:23:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/NASAMS-Firing-RMD-e1735589628352.jpg

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In Congress, most major defense issues were stuck in a holding pattern this year as lawmakers worked through a backlog of must-pass legislation under the restrictions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, with little willingness to make big moves ahead of the election in November. With President Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election and the GOP takeover of Congress, we’ll see if big changes to defense spending and policy hit the accelerator. Breaking Defense will have more on what could be in the ether in a future piece, but a key question there is whether the Senate confirms controversial nominees in the national security realm, including Pete Hegseth as defense secretary and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, as well as who gets tapped for key service and acquisition-related jobs. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] For now, let’s rewind: 2024 started with Congress on the backfoot, funding the government through a continuing resolution that kept spending at fiscal 2023 levels and an outstanding request from the Biden administration for supplemental funding for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Last year’s debt ceiling agreement, which birthed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, also set the stage for a pretty stagnant spending environment for FY24 and FY25, with limits for nondiscretionary defense spending that did not keep pace with the rate of inflation. Congress narrowly staved off a government shutdown in March, approving FY24 appropriations halfway through the fiscal year. By then, the Biden administration had already released its FY25 budget proposal, creating a unique situation where the Defense Department was defending its latest request while trying to figure out the FY24 budget. Despite the Senate having passed a similar bill in February, it took until the end of April for Congress to approve a $95 billion defense supplement that addressed foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as emerging requirements for the submarine industrial base. Given many House Republicans’ opposition to funds for Kyiv and Trump’s uncertain posture for future weapons donations, the package may have marked the last major collection of aid for Ukraine. The legislation also included a TikTok ban that would go into effect unless its Chinese owners divest from the social media app. Those provisions, which were backed by US tech execs from firms like Palantir, could be reviewed by the Trump administration, making the fate of TikTok in the United States one of the biggest technology questions for 2025. The biggest legislative fight over defense — one still not decided given the ongoing continuing resolution — is whether Congress ultimately agrees to boost funding over the FRA limits, which set a defense topline of $895.2 billion. Senate appropriators have argued for emergency funding that would increase defense spending by $21 billion without technically breaking the FRA caps. However, Senate and House armed services committees opted to keep to the FRA limits in the FY25 NDAA, which passed mid-December. RELATED: What to know about what's in the compromise NDAA In the realm of industry, several stories dominated the year. One was the shifting landscape at Boeing’s defense unit, which saw production challenges that resulted in financial turmoil and leadership changes. Another major thread was the instability in the submarine industrial base. While the sector has faced production issues since the COVID-19 pandemic, executives from General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII —the nation’s two submarine makers — lamented a lack of progress in the supply chain, as subcontractors struggle to make on time deliveries, adding schedule and cost risk. We also saw the continuation of two major plotlines: the ramp up of munitions production and the rise of the defense tech sector, as the Pentagon continues pouring funding into areas like drones, space and counter-drone systems through Replicator and other developmental initiatives.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/defense-spending-stagnates-as-election-dominates-us-politics-2024-in-review/	2024-12-30T11:21:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_rep_mike_johnson_GettyImages-1770847690-scaled-e1709241354686.jpg
DoD keeps pushing for the next-gen of IT and cyber systems: 2024 in review	US Sailors assigned to the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) stand watch in the ship’s Combat Information Center during an operation to defeat a combination of Houthi missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Oct. 19. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Aaron Lau) WASHINGTON — With ongoing conflicts in the European and Central theaters, the Pentagon has placed updating its digital strategies at the top of its list of priorities. As a result, the DoD unveiled ambitious plans in 2024 to rev up its information technology and network capabilities, both at the highest level and within the services. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] In June, the Pentagon released a comprehensive information technology strategy, coined the Fulcrum Strategy, that aims to serve as a catalyst for 'transformative change' and a 'tipping point' for bolstering digital modernization within the Pentagon, according to the strategy. 'Fulcrum prioritizes user experience by driving capabilities that are intuitive, resilient and combat-ready from day one, and we think that’s important because it sort of takes the idea of having a strategy that is more functional base, and then flips it around and have it more warfighter driven,' Leslie Beavers, principal deputy CIO at the DoD told reporters during a media roundtable this summer. The strategy has four lines of effort: Embedded in the first line of effort was the initiative to implement zero trust principles — the idea that no user should be assumed to be who they say they are. Basically, networks should always be assumed to be compromised. The Pentagon began putting a heavy emphasis on zero trust after the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the DoD completely implement zero trust in its IT, operational technology and defense critical infrastructure by 2027. First, the Pentagon focused on implementing zero trust for IT, and because the department was able to make strides in this realm combined with past and looming adversarial threats, it has 'pivoted' its focus to OT, Randy Resnick, the director of the Pentagon's Zero Trust Office, told Breaking Defense in November. 'For OT and weapon systems, we are coming out with initial zero trust guidance. Why? Because the adversary is attacking,' he said. 'The adversary wants to get into weapon systems to prevent their launch, or mess with the GPS coordinates, so the DoD is looking to initially secure these things beyond what they are today.' While the DoD as a whole appears to be pushing for network and IT resilience, the Army has its own wide-scale plan aimed at creating an integrated command and control structure focused on data centricity at every echelon. The systems of systems approach, called Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) was announced by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George in May. The effort is being led by Army Futures Command, with Gen. James Rainey at the forefront of the effort. While still in the early development stages, NGC2 will create a consolidated network architecture based on a technology stack that AFC officials released in December. This includes an application layer, an operational systems layer, a compute layer and a transport layer. The point of NGC2: to make things as easy as possible for forces in the field. The Army is looking to industry to help develop capabilities and technologies that can bring this program to life. In doing so, the service has said that it’s going to stray away from requirements that are too prescriptive. 'We're continuing to better describe the problem characteristics of the solution space, but still we are not getting prescriptive in a sense of, ‘This is the technology we need, this is the vendor we need to get it from,’ those types of things,' Joe Welch, deputy to the commanding general of AFC said during an interview in December. 'It's still very much in the attributes of the solutions more so than the solutions themselves.' Additionally, the service said they plan to hire a few team leads instead of having one lead systems integrator. 'Having competition and giving our users opportunities to prototype with more than one solution is potentially powerful, and it also stimulates industry investment, because there's more opportunities for industry,' Mark Kitz, program executive officer for the Army’s command, control and communications-network portfolio told Breaking Defense. 'We certainly want to avoid this incumbency, right? We don't want an [integrator] who's going to lead us for the next 10 years, right? We want constant competition. We want constant new teaming.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/dod-keeps-pushing-for-the-next-gen-of-it-and-cyber-systems-2024-in-review/	2024-12-30T09:23:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240808_DVIDS_destoyer_control_8082819-scaled-e1723125369641.jpg
How the Pentagon domesticated the chatbot: 2024 in review	Sailors assigned to Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command monitor, analyze, detect and respond to unauthorized activity within U.S. Navy information systems and computer networks. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — Large Language Models haven’t achieved human-like consciousness and transformed or shattered society — at least not yet — as prominent figures like Elon Musk suggested early in the hype cycle. But they also haven’t been crippled to the point of inutility by their tendency to 'hallucinate' false answers. Instead, generative AI is emerging as a useful tool for a wide but hardly unlimited range of purposes, from summarizing reams of regulations to drafting procurement memoranda and supply plans. So, two years after the public unveiling of ChatGPT, 16 months after the Department of Defense launched Task Force Lima to figure out the perils and potential of generative AI, the Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Office (CDAO) effectively declared the new technology was adequately understood and sufficiently safeguarded to deploy. On Dec. 11 the CDAO officially wrapped up the exploratory task force a few months ahead of schedule, institutionalized its findings, and created a standing AI Rapid Capabilities Cell (AIRCC) with $100 million in seed funding to accelerate GenAI adoption across the DoD. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The AIRCC’s forthcoming pilot projects are hardly the first Pentagon deployments of GenAI. The Air Force gave its personnel access to a chatbot called NIPRGPT in June, for example, while the Army deployed a GenAI system by Ask Sage that could even be used to draft formal acquisition documents. But these two cases also show the kinds of 'guardrails' the Pentagon believes are necessary to safely and responsibly use generative AI. RELATED: In AI we trust: how DoD’s Task Force Lima can safeguard generative AI for warfighters To start with, neither AI is on the open internet: They both run only on closed Defense Department networks — the Army cloud for Ask Sage, the DoD-wide NIPRnet for NIPRPT. That sequestration helps prevent leakage of users’ inputs, such as detailed prompts which might reveal sensitive information. Commercial chatbots, by contrast, often suck up everything their users tell them to feed their insatiable appetite for training data, and it’s possible to prompt them in such a way that they regurgitate, verbatim, the original information they’ve been fed — something the military definitely doesn’t want to happen. Another increasingly common safeguard to run the user’s input through multiple Large Language Models and use them to doublecheck each other. Ask Sage, for instance, has over 150 different models under the hood. That way, while any individual AI may still hallucinate random absurdities, it’s unlikely that two completely different models from different makers will generate the same mistakes. Finally, in 2024 it became a best practice in both DoD and the private sector to put generative AI on a diet, feeding it only carefully selected and trustworthy data, often using a process called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). By contrast, many free public chatbots were trained on vast swathes of the Internet, without any human factchecking beforehand or any algorithmic ability to detect errors, frauds, or outright jokes — like an old Reddit post about putting glue on pizza that Google’s AI began regurgitating as a serious recipe in one notable example this year. Some defense officials said this year they a savvy adversary could go further and deliberately insert errors into training data, 'poisoning' any AI built on it to make errors they could exploit. By contrast, the Pentagon prefers AIs which are trained on official documents and other government datasets, and which cite specific pages and paragraphs as supporting evidence for their answers so the human user can double-check for themselves. None of these safeguards is surefire, and it’s still possible for generative AI to go wrong. But at least the guardrails are now strong enough that the Pentagon feels safe to drive ahead into 2025.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/how-the-pentagon-domesticated-the-chatbot-2024-in-review/	2024-12-30T06:11:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240815_DVIDS_navy_computers_308045-scaled-e1723757674705.jpg
Army halted weapon development and pushed tech to soldiers faster: 2024 in review	An antenna farm is set up away from soldiers inside the command post. (Breaking Defense/ Ashley Roque) WASHINGTON — In what has turned out as Army Secretary Christine Wormuth's fourth and final year as the service’s top civilian leader and Gen. Randy George’s first full year as chief of staff, the duo shed high-profile modernization programs, revamped others and pushed tech down to soldiers at a faster clip. Wormuth, slated to wave goodbye to her post as the 25th secretary of the Army in January 2025, largely spent her tenure keeping the service’s high-profile modernization portfolio intact. This year, though, the axe fell on several initiatives starting with the early February aviation shakeup that ended development on the next generation Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), kept General Electric’s Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) in the development phase longer, and shelved legacy Shadow and Raven unmanned aerial systems. 'We are learning from the battlefield — especially Ukraine — that aerial reconnaissance has fundamentally changed,' Army Chief Gen. Randy George said in a press release at the time. 'Sensors and weapons mounted on a variety of unmanned systems and in space are more ubiquitous, further reaching and more inexpensive than ever before.' In turn, the service is planning to spend dollars freed up by those decisions to ink a multi-year procurement deal with Lockheed-Sikorsky for the UH-60M Blackhawk line, give Boeing the greenlight to formally begin production on the CH-47F Block II Chinook, buy new drones and more. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The axe officially dropped on another big-ticket development effort just a few weeks later when the Army unfurled its fiscal 2025 budget request: It was halting development on its Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) platform. The goal was to use the modified artillery platform to launch 155-mm rounds out to 70km, an increase from the current max range of up to 30km. But after spending several years integrating and testing out the addition of a 30-foot, 58-caliber gun tube to BAE Systems’ Paladin M109A7 self-propelled howitzer, it was not working out as planned. However, the requirement for such a weapon remains and the service subsequently announced it has selected five companies — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems — to demo their existing platforms on a roadshow of sorts. In early December, the director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team, Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, said those early evaluations should be completed by month's end. And, he added, so far so good, with early findings indicating that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation,' which means the service may decide not to delve into another lengthy development phase. 'We're very pleased with what we're seeing so far, and even some on the autonomy side,' the one-star general told an audience Dec. 3. Eyeing soldiers' kit, the service also spent part of the year preparing industry for a possible shake up to its portfolio of night vision devices including the mixed-reality goggles dubbed the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, for example, were tasked with running Microsoft’s most advanced mixed-reality system, IVAS version 1.2, through the ringer alongside dedicated night vision systems like the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENGV-B) and another system dubbed PVS-14. 'They’re going to provide the best feedback in terms of, here’s what the ENGV-B can provide versus a PVS-14 versus the capability inside of IVAS,' an Army official told Breaking Defense. The goal is for those Rangers to provide a 'more mature look' at how they use night vision while also answering questions about the ideal IVAS form factor, battery needs and more. Those answers are expected to help Army leaders decide the best pair up specific night vision devices with units and define IVAS Next requirements for an upcoming competition. George announced plans to expand his keystone inactive beyond infantry under a 2.0 push. The plan, he said, expands the bottom-up approach to two divisions, two Armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and reserve and guard formations. The service started with the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, 2nd Light Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division and 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Next year, it will be expanded beyond infantry under a 2.0 push and will include two divisions, two Armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and reserve and guard formations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-halted-weapon-development-and-pushed-tech-to-soldiers-faster-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T11:34:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/antenna-farm-scaled-e1724767823161.jpg
Space Force gets loud and proud about warfighting role: 2024 in review	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman addressed the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 6, 2024. (Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — Over the past year, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has issued a series of internal 'Commander's Notes' that have sought to create the culture and operational concepts for the newest military service, with a firm focus on the Space Force's warfighting role. It's clear that as 2024 comes to a close and the Space Force celebrates its fifth birthday, what one observer called 'chest-thumping rhetoric' clearly has entered into the public domain — a change that defined how the service went about its public and private posturing over the last year. Saltzman spent most of this year charging up the forces to think of themselves not as support specialists, but as frontline capabilities — or, as he told Guardians assembled at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 10, 'You are warfighters, whether you carry a gun or not.' [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 'In accordance with the law and at the direction of the president, you are trained and expected to carry out offensive and defensive actions against military forces of other countries, or support other military elements that do. When you're in a combat squadron, you're the first line of defense for conflict in space and your actions directly impact lives on the ground, in and out of harm's way.' In conjunction with this culture setting, top brass from Saltzman on down have become ever-more open about the service's plans and classified offensive capabilities to take out Chinese and Russian satellites on orbit in any future conflict — whether the mission be to defend American military and commercial satellites or to attack enemy birds being used to target US terrestrial forces. Saltzman told the Spacepower conference that 'space control' in now the Space Force's top priority because adversaries 'will absolutely try to disrupt, degrade and destroy US capabilities. This is unacceptable. In short, what we have, we will fight to keep.' Further, he stressed that China in particular 'can and will use their space capability to hold the joint and combined force at risk,' thus making it imperative that the Space Force be trained and equipped 'to make sure that doesn't happen.' Space Force Gen. Stephen Whiting, who commands US Space Command, told reporters on Dec. 11 that 'space fires is our number one Integrated Priority List gap.' The Integrated Priorities List is an annual compendium of requirements put together by each combatant command to inform the military services of their operational needs to be included in budget an acquisition plans. Whiting explained 'fires are defined in joint doctrine as the ability to affect or influence targets, and those could be targets in any domain that support the space mission. &#8230; If we are trying to achieve space superiority, there are targets that need to be influenced — in the cyber realm, in the terrestrial realm, [and] in space.' Lt. Gen. Douglas Schiess, who commands the Space Force's component for providing trained operators to SPACECOM called Space Forces-Space, told reporters on Dec. 11 that his first priority is 'to protect the joint warfighter from space-enabled attack, and secondly, to defend our assets and our allies' assets from attack from someone else.' To do this, he added, operators need 'effectors that can negate' adversary space capabilities. The loud new messaging moves away from the Pentagon's traditional silence on space warfighting plans — with the traditional focus on support services to the joint force such as communications and positioning, navigation and timing. Speaking to reporters after his Spacepower presentation, Saltzman said that in the past the Defense Department kept information about 'offensive and defensive' space capabilities 'close to the vest' — asserting that some of the rationale was 'just kind of hand-wringing' rather than a need to 'protect' anything. 'We have to conduct counter space operations to deny an adversary the ability to target our forces,' he said, and that requires 'offensive and defensive capabilities. &#8230; I have no problem saying that we are gonna be ready to contest the space domain,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-gets-loud-and-proud-about-warfighting-role-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T09:58:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/RS_20241210_0067-151-scaled-e1734122255777.jpg
A year of next-gen fighter doubts for the Air Force: 2024 in review	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — After years of development, the Air Force broke cover on its futuristic stealth fighter in May 2023 to announce that a winner would be picked to build the platform in 2024, teeing up the highly anticipated next generation of airpower. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The trouble started this summer, when whispers about NGAD’s fate first started swirling around Washington. Budget constraints bearing down on the Air Force — thanks to high-profile headaches like cost overruns with the nuclear-tipped Sentinel ballistic missile and pricey new programs like the B-21 Raider — began to exact their toll as the service built out its fiscal 2026 budget. In June, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin appeared to suggest NGAD was in hot water, equivocating when asked whether the service could commit to the program. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall subsequently confirmed the stealth fighter program was on pause, and bowing to the obvious, the service announced this month that the 'way ahead' for the program would officially be decided by the Trump administration. The service’s own capabilities have also rapidly evolved, featuring tech like space-based ISR and comms, drone wingmen dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) and a budding 'kill web' that threads together disparate sensors, weapons and shooters to neutralize a threat. Any NGAD fighter is 'going to need to work with CCAs. It’s going to need to work in an architecture which includes space-based support and other off-board support and an architecture that uses our most advanced weapons,' Kendall said in July. 'So we’ve got an opportunity here to really just be careful and make sure we’re on the right path before we make the final commitment.' The NGAD challenge also lies in unforgiving geography. Should American troops clash with the PLA, particularly over the Taiwan Strait, Chinese forces would enjoy a significant homefield advantage. Beijing’s burgeoning missile arsenal further threatens to lay waste to critical American installations in the region, which includes aircraft that could be caught in the crossfire while parked on the ground — creating a rift between the Air Force and Army on air base defense. 'The infrastructure that’s required to support an F-22 class aircraft, if you will, leads to some vulnerabilities. Runway length, for example,' Kendall previously told Breaking Defense. The same is true for engine-makers GE Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney, who are separately competing to build the NGAD fighter’s powerplant. After the Air Force passed on re-engining the F-35, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion effort, the program name for the NGAD engine, appears to be the only avenue left to carry revolutionary, 'adaptive' powerplant technologies forward. Ironically, the Air Force’s NGAD pause could very well prompt the Navy to go first on a different next-gen fighter. While the Air Force wrestles with its sixth-gen design, a Navy official previously told Aviation Week the sea-based service remains confident in its plans, and is still on track to award an engineering and manufacturing development contract by the end of fiscal 2025 for its own future airframe. Though all this, Kendall has maintained he's confident an NGAD fighter, in some form, will be built. And to that end, internal Air Force analysis now supports the development of a manned, next-gen platform, Breaking Defense previously reported. But a new administration will take over in January, where 'Department of Government Efficiency' co-leads Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have both called into question current fighter procurement efforts. What the Trump administration will do is unclear, though if history is any guide, manned fighter jets may be here to stay for at least one more generation. Like the flying car, the death of the manned fighter has been predicted for decades, but neither have come to pass.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/a-year-of-next-gen-fighter-doubts-for-the-air-force-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T07:58:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
Tensions between Navy and industry in the spotlight: 2024 in review	Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, crosses the walkway of guided-missile destroyer USS Preble (DDG 88) following a tour of the ship, Feb. 16. Preble is an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer homeported in San Diego. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Olivia Rucker) WASHINGTON — In 2024, the US Navy’s frustrations with its industrial base were on public display. Whether those frustrations were justified depends on who you ask. I've been watching the US Navy and industry interact with one another since 2017. My view is limited to what happens in open forums, granted, but nonetheless, it represents the same view the rest of the public has. What one quickly realizes as one follows admirals and secretaries around from conference to conference is that the visible relationship between industry and military is typically sterilized. There's a lot of talk about partnerships and camaraderie, patriotism and love for America, an ingrained sense of service to country. I bring all that up to juxtapose it with what we saw this year. Acquisition executive Nickolas Guertin published a one-page document outlining the severe delays of each major shipbuilding program and highlighting their associated prime contractors. Uniformed commanders publicly voiced their frustrations about industry's production cadence for munitions. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] And Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro on multiple occasions tore into industry for what he said were excessive stock buy backs and industry's failure to re-invest in their own facilities. He chastised American shipbuilders for, in his view, failing to rise to the occasion in the way South Korean and Japanese industries have done in their own quests to compete with China. In one notable speech, Del Toro mentioned the possibility of personnel misconduct on industry’s part and previewed an office that will go after those individuals. To be clear, I do not think there is anything wrong with the Navy expecting its contractors to act ethically and follow the law. But I do find it odd that Del Toro — the service's civilian leader handpicked by the president — would raise that subject voluntarily to a friendly audience in a Navy-centric city like San Diego. When I asked Del Toro about his posture towards industry during this year's Sea Air Space Exposition, he told me the broader message he was trying to send was one about industry respecting the investment taxpayers have been making into the industrial base. 'It takes a team effort and the American taxpayers are making enormous investments in the industrial base,' he said at the time. 'I need industry to make the proper capital investments themselves. And if you take a look at the major primes in this country, for example, that work in the defense industry, about a third of them are putting enormous buybacks into their own stocks. That prevents basically the utilization of those monies to be able to recapitalize those industries to try to get us to a better place. So that's what I'm saying. Everybody's got to do their part, and we expect industry to do their part as well.' I should note that in the latter half of the year the secretary noticeably toned down his criticisms of industry in public forums. Nevertheless, when I've asked executives about Del Toro's prodding, they usually respond with shrugs. No one wants to get into a public shouting match with their customer and, at the end of the day, it's not Del Toro sitting on the other side of the table when contracts are negotiated, written and signed. The backdrop to all of this has been a US Navy under as much pressure as its ever been in modern history. The October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in American destroyers seeing more action than they have in years. That in turn has led to increased pressure both on munitions production and the maintenance requirements for the fleet. The service has infamously struggled with the ship maintenance required to upkeep a blue water navy even in peacetime — rotating carrier strike groups to the Middle East to aid Israel only added to that pressure. While Del Toro will ultimately leave office by Jan. 20, the munitions shortages, the ship maintenance backlogs and the increasingly higher operational tempo the Navy has had to adjust to will likely all follow the service well into 2025 — and perhaps beyond.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/tensions-between-navy-and-industry-in-the-spotlight-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T06:02:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/8244067-scaled-e1712070593740.jpg
We fed every 2024 Pentagon briefing into ChatGPT. Here’s what it thought.	WASHINGTON -Tech. Sgt. Bryan Scharman, Non-commissioned Officer In Charge of Cyber Support of the 151st Communications Flight in the Utah National Guard, works on setting up communications between supported agencies during the 58th Presidential Inauguration. (National Guard photo by Tech. Jonathan Young, JTF-DC) MOBILE, Ala. — If 2023 was the year that OpenAI's ChatGPT exploded onto the public scene, 2024 was the year the US military and Intelligence Community began carefully wading into the potential of generative AI. Officials have said that kind of tech could be used for everything from streamlining acquisition to sifting through a mountain of open source data for relatively low-level intelligence analysis. And while the Pentagon has grown to trust generative AI enough to build a new 'cell' around it's use, many officials are still cautious because the cutting edge technology is not without its risks, especially its propensity to 'hallucinate' false information. Echoing many other officials this year, Jimmy Hall, chief information officer in the State Department's intelligence wing, said last week, 'We want to be able to use a gen AI,' but the office is 'just not ready.' 'As we step our way through, we don't want to be so quick to the trigger that we put our situation where civil liberties or privacy or something else is violated,' Hall said in a webinar put on by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. 'So we're really behind the scenes testing a few items, mechanisms, systems, tools, before we're ready to roll that out. But we do want to take advantage of emerging technology.' So while generative AIs may not be fully ready for prime time in many ways, the fact that the US security establishment is eagerly pursuing use cases makes it worthy of some of our own experimentation. As such, below is an end-of-year interview with ChatGPT, which has been armed with a document compiled by Breaking Defense containing every Pentagon transcript posted on Defense.gov since Jan. 1, 2024 up to the middle of last week. This interview was conducted with the less robust, free version of ChatGPT, GPT-4o mini, and the application has been directed to keep its answers shorter than usual. The following transcript has been slightly edited and additional context has been added in Editor's Notes. Breaking Defense: What was the biggest development in the world of defense in 2024? ChatGPT: The biggest development in defense in 2024 was the launch and execution of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational coalition effort involving over 22 nations to secure vital shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden from escalating Houthi attacks, supported by Iran. This operation demonstrated a significant shift towards proactive, collective international defense strategies, leveraging advanced technologies and persistent presence to ensure maritime security and economic stability. [Editor's Note: This is a bit of a curious answer. While Prosperity Guardian and its parallel European counterpart Operation Aspides are certainly potent international security collaborations, 2024 saw several arguably more significant developments in the Middle East region alone, from the killing of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah to the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.] Ensign Hunter Riportella relays information from the bridge aboard the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Mason (DDG 87) during a vertical replenishment with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) while the ships operate in support of Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) in the Red Sea, Jan. 8, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Chris Krucke) How did US policy change toward Ukraine in 2024, if at all? In 2024, U.S. policy toward Ukraine remained consistent in its commitment to supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression, with continued delivery of advanced weapons systems and training for Ukrainian pilots, including on F-16 fighter jets. However, the policy faced challenges due to depleted replenishment funds for military aid, underscoring the need for congressional approval of supplemental funding to sustain assistance levels. [Editor's Note: Yup, pretty much, even if the US and Europe have apparently run out of Ukrainian pilots to train on the F-16. What Congress will do with regard to Ukraine aid under the incoming Trump administration is another question entirely.] What are the Pentagon's top concerns as it relates to the future of Syria? The Pentagon's top concerns regarding the future of Syria include the persistent threat posed by Iranian-backed proxies, such as Harakat al-Nujaba, which continue to target U.S. forces in the region, and the destabilizing influence of actors like Iran and other extremist groups. Ensuring the safety of U.S. forces and maintaining the fight against ISIS to prevent its resurgence remain critical priorities, while managing broader regional dynamics and avoiding escalation with Iran. [Editor's Note: Here, ChatGPT's answer is consistent with fears officials have publicly expressed, though the particular mention of Harakat al-Nujaba is a bit unusual. The Pentagon announced it had killed a leader of that group back in January 2024, but has made little mention of it since in official transcripts, and media reporting does not appear to have identified the group as a specific concern currently.] Fighters walk in the Syrian presidential palace in Damascus' Mount Qasyoun on December 8, 2024, after Islamist-led rebels declared that they have taken the Syrian capital in a lightning offensive, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria.

The Pentagon's top priorities in the Indo-Pacific region in 2024 included ensuring regional security and stability through extended deterrence and collaboration with allies, particularly in the face of threats from China and North Korea. Efforts focused on mitigating risks of conflict over Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula while maintaining strong defense partnerships to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific. [Editor's Note: That does about sum it up, especially the focus on international partnerships in the region, which has been a top priority for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.] What was the Defense Department's biggest mistake in 2024? The Defense Department's biggest mistake in 2024 was the delayed notification and lack of transparency regarding Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hospitalization and the temporary transfer of certain operational authorities. This lapse highlighted weaknesses in communication protocols, prompting internal reviews to improve procedures and ensure timely dissemination of critical information to senior officials and the public. [Editor's Note: There's a necessary reminder here that ChatGPT is answering based on Pentagon transcripts, and the fervor around Austin's secret January hospitalization required several days of cleanup from the Pentagon public affairs office — hence the emphasis from the generative AI. Arguably the DoD made bigger, or at least more impactful mistakes in 2024, whether it was related to troubled weapons programs or broader defense policy, but officials tend to be more circumspect about those kinds of calls.]	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/we-fed-every-2024-pentagon-briefing-into-chatgpt-heres-what-it-thought/	2024-12-26T12:38:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241220_DVIDS_computer_DC_3148118-scaled-e1734712089434.jpg
Everything comes down to Ukraine: 5 stories from Europe in 2024	South Koreans watch a television broadcast reporting the North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin (Getty Images) BELFAST — The war in Ukraine surpassed the 1,000 day mark earlier this year and continues on with slow Russian advances amid growing uncertainty in Europe that a new US administration under Donald Trump could end desperately needed military aid to Kyiv or result in a peace deal of greater, long-term strategic value to Moscow. Of all that happened during the conflict in the last 12 months, the deployment of North Korean troops to the Russian border territory of Kursk stands out from the pack. The move itself was officially confirmed by Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General in October, after he held a North Atlantic Council meeting with South Korea’s National Intelligence Service and its Ministry of National Defense. It will be of no surprise to readers then that events from, or linked to, the war dominate our picks for the top European stories from 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘Growing desperation’? NATO chief confirms North Korean troops deployed to help Russia in Kursk Rutte defined the deployment as a 'significant escalation' of DPRK’s continued involvement in Russia’s 'illegal war' against Ukraine, while labelling it as a further 'breach' of UN Security Council resolutions. Soon after, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, echoed NATO's appraisal, as she shared that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been sent to 'train in eastern Russia [and] will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks.' 2. Sweden officially joins NATO as 32nd alliance member Forced to wait longer than Nordic counterpart Finland, Sweden finally joined NATO in March. Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg took to social media to mark the occasion. 'It’s official – #Sweden is now the 32nd member of #NATO, taking its rightful place at our table,' he shared. 'Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer, and the whole Alliance more secure.' The addition of Sweden notably increases alliance capabilities across the High North and Baltic Sea, while serving as a counterweight to Russian threats in the two strategically pivotal regions. Stockholm boasts formidable air, land and sea prowess shaped by multirole Gripen fighter jets and Gotland-class diesel-electric attack submarines. 3. Why Germany’s Scholz won’t follow Biden on long-range strikes for Ukraine After months of resistance, the US ended its opposition to Ukraine firing Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia for the first time in November. The UK soon followed suit, overturning a hold on Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles. France, which refers to the weapon as SCALP, has also supplied a number of units to Kyiv. Similar to the lift on long range strikes by the US and UK, French President Emmanuel Macron said, 'there’s no red line on this.' Germany, on the other hand, stood out from the crowd, refusing to change course. Analysts that spoke with Breaking Defense about the matter said that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was potentially holding out on the supply of Taurus long-range precision missiles in a bid to protect his political career and argued that he has limited clout over Russia. 4. French defense minister attacks industry over production rates, threatens requisitioning In March, France’s Minister for the armed forces Sébastien Lecornu aired concerns around national weapons productions rates by threatening industry with the requisitioning of 'personnel, stocks or production tools' if things don't improve. And he didn't stop there. Prime manufacturers were not the only group in Lecornu's line of fire. Subcontractors could also be forced to prioritize defense customers over civilian clients if they didn't rise to the challenge, he explained. In light of demand spiking to boost weapon supplies to Ukraine, KNDS told Breaking Defense that production of 155mm artillery shells had doubled, reaching an annual rate of 60,000 units in 2024, with a target of reaching 120,000 in 2025. 5. KNDS debuts Enhanced Main Battle Tank technology demonstrator On the equipment front, European defense firm KNDS unveiled a new Enhanced Main Battle Tank (EMBT) technology demonstrator at Eurosatory in France. The vehicle offers a glimpse into the manufacturer's thinking for the Franco-German Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program, which effectively amounts to development of the continent's next generation main battle tank. As freelance writer Andrew White wrote of the EMBT, it includes an upgraded Leopard chassis with shortened engine to increase space inside the vehicle’s compartment; a new uncrewed turret, fitted with a 140mm Ascalon gun, ARX30 30mm x 113mm remote controlled weapon station; and the French Ministry of Defense’s Prometheus active protection system.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/everything-comes-down-to-ukraine-5-stories-from-europe-in-2024/	2024-12-26T10:14:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221222_putin_kim_GettyImages-1139189964-scaled-e1671728927858.jpg
The terror of war, a helo crash mystery and the business of defense: 5 Middle East stories from 2024	Smoke billows above Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike on November 26, 2024, amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. (Photo by FADEL ITANI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — This year it was nearly impossible to choose just five stories from our coverage of the Middle East in 2024, a year of brutal wars, seismic shifts in power and, for now, at least some hope for broader peace. It was a year in which stories about new technology, joint ventures and defense contracts were overshadowed by invasions and missile barrages, but that didn't mean the business of defense was stagnant, as the Saudi World Defense Show and Qatar's DIMDEX proved. So, after much consideration, here are the top five stories for 2024 from my list: [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. What life looks like in Lebanon after 1 year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel It's the task of a journalist to report impartially, including when a conflict comes to your own country. Still, that doesn't mean it's impossible to tell human stories, including in this report about what life was like on Lebanon's southern border during Israel's invasion. Most residents left the area, but some stayed, and a few told Breaking Defense what it looked and felt like to be in their homes while barrages of missiles and bombs were exchanged between Israel, Hezbollah and even Iran above their heads. The 'bombardment sounds never seem to pause. The nights are the worst,' one southerner told Breaking Defense. But life elsewhere in Lebanon, including here in Beirut, did not feel safe before November's ceasefire. 'Are we going to die tonight?' my children asked me every night while they rush into my room, awakened from their sleep, not by calls to get ready for school but from bombs. It was easy to see the black and white smoke plumes from these attacks rising above the city. 2. What a Turkish drone in the Raisi crash crisis reveals about Iran’s UAV capabilities Who would have believed that the Iranian president's helicopter would crash in fog, and that it would be a Turkish UAV to be deployed to find the crash site? That's apparently what happened in May, even if Iranian officials later denied the drone had succeeded in its mission. Either way, experts said the use of the drone and its onboard sensors revealed perhaps more than Tehran would've liked about Iran's indigenous drone capabilities — as popular as they may be. Can Kasapoglu, a Turkish defense expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said at the time he wasn’t buying Tehran’s claim. 'Iran was dwarfed by the Turkish information superiority [and] overshadowed by NATO standards,' he said. 3. Past the deadline, Western defense firms still navigating Saudi Arabia’s localization mandates Raising its domestic defense ambitions, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called on all firms to set their regional headquarters in the Kingdom by January 2024. But at the Saudi World Defense show in February this year, Breaking Defense asked executives whether they have abided by this mandate. Already past the deadline, Western firms said they were still navigating their path and ways to accommodate the mandate. They were doubly caught between a rock and a hard place, since many are already established in the United Arab Emirates, which is making a parallel localization push. Some firms got creative, while others tried to work their way around the issue and resorted to more generous interpretations of the rules. 'I don’t know if we read the [regional headquarters] request that specifically but we are working with the government to make sure that we support whatever the request turns out to be in the right way and, again, I think our interpretation may be a little bit different than you described,' Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security President and CEO Ted Colbert (who has since left the company) told Breaking Defense then. 4. Iran shows off naval guns, missiles and UAV named ‘Gaza’ at Qatari defense show As rare as it is for Iran to show it arms in a defense show abroad, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps made a surprise appearance with their armament in Qatar at Dimdex. Breaking Defense was able to speak with Iranian officials and get a close view of the systems exhibited. From a drone dubbed 'Gaza' to naval guns, radars and missile defense systems, the Iranians had an array of systems to show the world. All of the systems at the stand were developed and produced by Iran and, one official said, are open for export to any country 'except Israel and [the] US.' 5. Russian bases and Hezbollah weapons: Key questions follow fall of Syrian regime At the tail end of 2024, more than half a century of the Assad family rule in Syria came to an end. Rebels took over one city after another, reaching Damscus apparently after Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad fled to Russia. But below the surface, key questions festered about the future of Russian military bases in Syria as well as Hezbollah arms transfer routes from Iran.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-terror-of-war-a-helo-crash-mystery-and-the-business-of-defense-5-middle-east-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-26T08:23:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_israel_strike_beirut_GettyImages-2186324612-scaled-e1732647429461.jpg
Government watchdog greenlights Army’s new spy plane contract, denies L3Harris’s protest	A Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft. (Bombardier via US Army) WASHINGTON — The Army is cleared to proceed building out its new spy plane with the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), after the government watchdog agency denied L3Harris’s contract protest. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued its decision on December 23, noting that the protest is covered by a 'protective order,' and a report on the rationale behind the denial will be publicly released once it's redacted. L3Harris did not immediately respond to questions today about the new GAO decision, but the forthcoming report should shed additional light on the company's complaint into how the service awarded the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) deal. Neither the Army nor SNC immediately responded to questions from Breaking Defense about the program and if the stop work order has now been lifted. In August, the service selected SNC to convert Bombardier’s Global 6500 business jets into an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform under its HADES program. An industry team up featuring L3Harris, Leidos and MAG Aerospace had also bid on the program to replace the legacy fleet of RC-12 Guardrail turboprop aircraft. By October, L3Harris filed a protest with the GAO. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army’s debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation,' an L3Harris spokesperson said in a statement at the time. 'Our goal remains to ensure that mission operators receive the lowest risk and most capable solution available for an increasingly complex security environment.' The Army halted HADES integration work while GAO sorted through the protest, but in November it officially accepted the first business jet slated for integration during a ceremony in Wichita, Kansas. 'Once we're in a position to begin integrating the aircraft, that will be the next step … the integration of the equipment in the back,' Andrew Evans, the director of the Army’s ISR Task Force, told reporters at the time. 'The airplane itself is what we describe as the workhorse to HADES, it's what enables HADES to get in position, to collect … to have the endurance necessary to provide meaningful station time,' he added. 'But the magic of a HADES is what will happen in the back of that aircraft.' That magic includes moving target indication, high-end signals intelligence and other capabilities, possibly including launched effects. The service is also gleaning feedback from 'bridging' aerial ISR assets designed, in part, to inform HADES requirements. Those efforts included: Evans and Lt. Gen. Anthony Hale, the Army’s deputy chief of staff for intelligence, said the goal is to create commonality across those aircraft and port back lessons into the HADES design. 'Every day the enemy is working in the electromagnetic spectrum, they're utilizing EW [electronic warfare] capabilities, they're utilizing unmanned aerial system capabilities that we haven't seen before, and then they're increasing the use of new weapon systems,' the three-star general said. 'Whether it's [in] Ukraine or whether it's somewhere in Africa, our adversary is using these places as battlefields and testing areas to develop and continue to emerge technology and so … getting after what we see in one theater is going to come to another theater,' Hale later added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/government-watchdog-gives-army-greenlight-for-new-spy-plane-contract-denies-l3harriss-protest/	2024-12-26T06:51:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240103_bombardier_hades_army-e1704312802342.jpg
From Japan’s build-up to stumbles in the Lucky Country: 5 Pacific stories for 2024	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches fourth of Mogami-class frigates, Mikuma. Credit Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force SYDNEY — One of the biggest stories of the year in the Indo-Pacific was Japan casting aside the cloak of pacifism and moving to boost defense spending and actually export a major weapons system. While some of the policy planks had been laid down over the least decade, this was the year Japan really began taking concrete steps to make these a reality. The importance of the development is reflected below in this selection of five stories from Asia in 2024, plus an eyebrow-raising shakeup in the Chinese military, as well as a couple reports that look at some important moves Australia made as well. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Japanese MoD makes first appearance at foreign airshow, seeking arms exports When Breaking Defense saw the Ministry of Defense booth at the Singapore Air Show in February, the first reaction was shock : a Japanese government booth trying to sell weapons. True, it was relatively small and the companies were too, for the most part. But there were Japanese officials, some in uniform, actively courting the international press, companies ands representative of foreign governments. And they spoke with Breaking Defense and encouraged the coma[pnies to speak with media. 2. &#8216;Huge implications' as top Chinese military leader under investigation, joins 3rd defense minister While Japan was trying to do one of the things China most fears — become a serious, power-projecting regional power — China's top leadership appeared to go a bit bonkers. A senior member of the body that rules the Peoples Liberation Army, the Central Millitary Commission, was 'suspended' and the third defense minister vanished from view. In any other large military, such actions would set off global alarm bills. More than a month after the CMC member and the the most recent defense minister vanished, there is still only informed speculation as to why this is happening, but analysts agree on one thing: all does not appear well in the Chinese military. 3. Australia, Japan ink first R&amp;D trial on underwater tech Two of the US allies most closely watched by China got much closer this year. Adding to the US Marines who operate from northern Australia for six months each year, 6,600 of its service members can train each year for nine weeks, Japan will now send its marines each year to Northern Australia. In addition to the new rotational force at the beginning of the year, Australia and Japan agreed to start working together on some of the most advanced and highly classified military equipment for 'strategic capabilities in robotic and autonomous systems for undersea warfare.' 4. &#8216;Alarming' but &#8216;not surprising': Australia reportedly left with 1 operational sub amid repairs, upgrades This year cracks in the Royal Australian Navy submersible fleet started to appear, even as the country pushed to bolster both fleets in the longer term. The Collins-class fleet was virtually crippled as the government admitted it could only deploy one of the country's six ageing subs. The government declared that a second boat could put to sea if necessary and claimed the fleet was meeting its operational requirements. But the news raised basic questions about whether Australia could close the capability gap between Collins and the arrival of the first boats in the AUKUS fleet. 5. Aussie Navy to double surface fleet with $7B plan, but future funding uncertain Knowing its aging fleet of ANZAC-class destroyers and other surface assets was growing increasingly thin as a deterrent, Australia decided on a $11.1 billion AUD ($7.2 billion US) plan to double its surface fleet. A key part of that is the General Purpose Frigate program, which has been whittled down to a competition between ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems' MEKO A-200 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Mogami frigate. The MEKO-200 is an upgraded version of the ANZAC class ships. The Mogami would be Japan's first sale of a major weapon system to a foreign country.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-japans-build-up-to-stumbles-in-the-lucky-country-5-pacific-stories-for-2024/	2024-12-26T06:03:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg

And with America’s youngest military service hitting kindergarten age, class was in session at this year’s Spacepower Conference. The show, the second ever put on by the Space Force Association, has grown considerably since its first outing, gathering a host of senior military officials, including Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and head of US Space Command Gen. Stephen Whiting. Of course, no gathering of the space community would be complete without Breaking Defense’s own Theresa Hitchens, who went down to Orlando to cover the event.

Killer Apps: 5 stories highlight quiet progress on military AI and CJADC2	Members of the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam operate cyber systems using a Enhanced communications flyaway kit during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3 and Architect Demonstration Evaluation 5 at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July, 12, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Amy Picard) WASHINGTON — This year saw major progress in the Pentagon’s years-long push to harness artificial intelligence — not for drones or 'killer robots,' but for software tools that help staff officers bring some order to the chaos of modern conflict. From the intelligence analysis algorithms of Project Maven, the seven-year-old granddaddy of military AI tools, to the data-sharing systems collectively known as CJADC2, 2024 has seen significant expansion in both capabilities and the number of people using them for real-world operations. These unglamorous utilities matter, because the ultimate weapon is often not a weapon at all. Prussia united Germany in the 1800s in large part thanks to the superior organizational skills of its General Staff. The Nazi Panzers in 1940 didn’t outgun or outnumber their French opponents, but they had radios to coordinate mobile operations, while the French relied on landlines and signal flags. The Pentagon itself, today a byword for bureaucracy, was built in 16 months to house the massive administrative apparatus essential to running a global war. Victory, in short, doesn't go to the side with the shiniest toys, but to the organization that manages the digital grunt work most efficiently. Here's how the Pentagon applied AI to military command and control in 2024: [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. First version of all-service battle network is ‘real and ready now’: Hicks In the 21at century paper files, voice calls, and human staff are no longer enough to stay on top of fast-moving events on land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. The need to share data, intelligence, and orders rapidly across those five 'domains' drove the Department to Defense to try to develop an AI-powered system of Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control. While 'CJADC2' is still a nascent capability with many well-informed skeptics, the last 12 months saw the first pieces of it move from experiments to real-world operations. In February, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks publicly announced an initial version of CJADC2 — the 'Minimum Viable Capability,' a spin on the software industry term of 'Minimum Viable Product.' (The MVC had actually been certified as ready in December 2023, after months of urgent work, but it wasn’t announced for another three months). This version was focused on sharing information among the military’s 11 four-star operational headquarters, the Combatant Commands — but the military immediately began expanding it. 2. ‘Who should shoot who?’: INDOPACOM getting ‘combat representative’ JFN this year One of the most sought-after CJADC2 capabilities is, in essence, fire control. The US military has a large and growing arsenal of long-range weapons, from Air Force stealth bombers to Navy guided-missile subs and destroyers to new Army truck-mounted missile launchers. Traditional processes for figuring out which target is best attacked with which weapon, like the daily Air Tasking Order (ATO), require big staffs and lots of time, making it difficult to adjust to new intelligence or enemy maneuvers. And the more drones, satellites, and other sensors are feeding data in the front end of the process, the more overwhelmed the human middlemen become. So much of the CJADC2 work this year has focused on something called the Joint Fires Network. JFN doesn’t take human fingers off the trigger, but it automates the process of suggesting 'who should shoot who' for the human commanders to sign off on (or amend) and for human troops to execute. While not yet operational, a prototype of JFN impressed officials during June’s Valiant Shield wargames in the Pacific and a 'Version 1.0' is expected to enter service by early 2025. 3. Decentralizing battle data: CDAO, Anduril open tactical ‘mesh’ to third-party developers The CJADC2 Minimum Viable Capability and Joint Fires Network looked at warfare from the top down, but the American military, at its best, is infamously bottom-up and inventive. Besides, big HQs are big targets, vulnerable not only to direct attack but to signal jamming or network hacks that cut off their communications. So the CJADC2 effort includes a tactical dimension. For frontline units to share data directly, rather than wait for updates to come down from higher headquarters, their digital systems have to understand each other. That turns out to be technically complex, especially as the military deploys more and more sensors built by more and more contractors. So, after several years of quiet experimentation, this month the Pentagon publicly announced a $100 million, three-year contract with Anduril for large-scale deployment of the company’s Lattice Mesh. The critical ingredient: a set of translation algorithms that lets a unit with Lattice make sense of sensor feeds from over a hundred different systems, without having to wait for a central hub to do the data processing. 4. Open DAGIR: DoD plans July industry day, experiments for new CJADC2 command apps A recurring theme in the evolution of CJADC2 is that it is not one thing, but rather dozens of different applications for different purposes, all (in theory) compatible and knit together. Such a 'federated' approach to building military technology, however, is at odds with traditional Pentagon procurement practices, which tend to create mega-projects run by a single prime contractor. Historically, tech built by different vendors tends to use incompatible standards and protocols that make it difficult or impossible to share data. Conversely, any individual system may suffer 'vendor lock,' where only the original contractor has the intellectual property required to make it work, locking out potential competitors. The Pentagon, naturally, would prefer CJADC2 work more like Lego, with any piece able to connect to each other and everything easy to replace or rearrange as needed. To make this work, in May the Pentagon’s Chief Digital and AI Office, the lead agency on CJADC2 and a host of other high-tech projects, rolled out a new way of designing both software systems and the contracts to build them, starting with the Maven intelligence-analysis AI. Known as Open DAGIR, the acquisition construct decouples different elements of a project so they can be built by different contractors and yet still work smoothly together. 5. Empowered edge versus the centralization trap: Who will wield AI better, the US or China? The ultimate test of any military technology is how well it works in combat, a lethally unforgiving environment. And while artificial intelligence can replace human brainpower for an increasing number of functions, war remains a profoundly human undertaking, where human beings still make the big decisions and do the dying. So how well technology performs depends, in large part, on how humans choose to use it. For the US, there is cause for cautious optimism here. American military culture, like the civilian society from which it recruits, historically favors initiative and improvisation — in ways its authoritarian adversaries generally don’t. And while Industrial Age machinery lent itself to efficiencies of scale and central planning, Information Age networks have great potential to empower the individual on the ground. The challenge for CJADC2 is to unleash that potential.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/killer-apps-5-stories-highlight-quiet-progress-on-military-ai-and-cjadc2/	2024-12-24T10:04:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240716_gide_finger_computer_6733216-e1721160785247.jpg
From a ‘lightbulb’ moment to a ‘sense of urgency’: 5 cyber and network stories from 2024	Sgt. James Hyman, Expeditionary Cyber-Electromagnetic Activities (CEMA) operator, 11th Cyber Battalion, gathers information from sensors to develop cyber effects. (Photo by Steven Stover/780th Military Intelligence Brigade) WASHINGTON — Over the past year, the Pentagon has made clear that addressing adversarial cyber threats are at the forefront of the department’s priorities, especially against China. As a result, the services have made adjustments to their information technology practices and network structures to become more resilient against the enemy, but not without the occasional bumps in the road. But Pentagon officials noted that they cannot do this alone. In order to be better prepared in a fight against China, the US needs to partner with allies like those in the NATO alliance and with industry partners. From increased capabilities through partnerships to the potential resurrection of a once-contested Pentagon office, here are the top five stories on the cyber and networks beat in 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘A light bulb moment’: US, Canada achieve ‘vital’ federated ICAM connection through joint pilot During the NATO Edge conference at the beginning of December, Canadian and US officials announced that the Pentagon and the Canadian Armed Forces have achieved federated identity, credential and access management (ICAM) connection between their armed forces in a joint pilot program. ICAM, which has been adopted in recent years throughout the US Department of Defense, is a system that ensures users are who they say they are and determines what they have access to when logging on to information systems. With this shared connection, users in the US and Canada were able to securely access the other country’s data on an existing platform that they share. Now that the US and Canada have achieved federated ICAM connection with each other, Pentagon acting Chief Information Officer Leslie Beavers said the next step is to expand this capability to all of NATO countries and other allies. 2. ‘Sense of urgency’: Army’s NETCOM says it will transform IT and cyber ops by the end of next year During the annual AUSA conference in October, Gen. Jacqueline McPhail, the commanding general of the Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, or NETCOM, said that the service is planning to transform from solely a network provider to an information technology and cybersecurity provider by the end of next year. This move is part of the service’s Command and Control (C2) Fix initiative — a current project focused on improving and simplifying the existing C2 network infrastructure. McPhail said the move will allow her office to become more of an operational force spending less time on fixing IT and cyber issues and more time focused on progressing and protecting the DoD’s Information Network, or DODIN. She added that this transformation will happen at the 'global level,' but the process will be theater-aligned. 3. Army’s new virtual desktop meant real-world problems for some Guard, Reserve users On June 1, the Army rolled out a new mandate requiring a virtual desktop for all soldiers to access Microsoft Office 365 platforms. The Army said the move would increase cybersecurity at a time when America’s enemies are looking for digital vulnerabilities. Though it was meant to keep foreign hackers out of the Army 365 suite, some legitimate National Guard or Army Reserve users said a clumsy rollout with inadequate warning meant that they, too, were locked out of their official accounts. The fluke 'exposed a potential gap in the seem that, should there be a crisis situation, would have been a real challenge,' Katherine Kuzminski, deputy director of studies and program director of military, veterans and society at the Center for New American Security, told Breaking Defense over the summer. 4. Defense Innovation Board calls to resurrect AT&amp;L office, but with new name In July, the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Board called for a major restructure of the Department of Defense’s acquisition house. The board recommended that it was time to resurrect the old Undersecretary for Acquisition and Logistics (AT&amp;L) office by recombining the offices of the undersecretaries for Acquisition &amp; Sustainment and Research and Engineering. However, the new office wouldn't inherit its old name and instead has the working name of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for International Integration and Cooperation. The call to recombine the offices comes after Congress split the AT&amp;L office into the offices of A&amp;S and R&amp;E in the National Defense Authorization Act of 2017, after years of questioning from leaders about whether having such an immense, joint office was logical in fulfilling modern technological needs. (Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, the last person to hold the title of undersecretary of AT&amp;L, fiercely advocated for not splitting up the office.) 5. System update: Army general takes over from Skinner as director of DISA, JFHQ-DoDIN At the beginning of October, Air Force Gen. Robert Skinner passed his responsibilities as director of DISA and Joint Force Headquarters-Department of Defense Information Networks (JFHQ-DoDIN) to Army Gen. Paul Stanton. 'I leave this agency and command with a deep sense of humility, optimism, confidence and, most importantly, honor,' Skinner said during a passing of the flags ceremony. Skinner retired after a 40-year military career in which he started as an administrative supervisor for the Office of the Secretary of the Navy. He later worked his way up to an Air Force general and in 2015 became the chief of staff at DISA and deputy commander of the JFHQ-DoDIN. In 2021 he took over the post of director of DISA and JFHQ-DoDIN.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-a-lightbulb-moment-to-a-sense-of-urgency-5-cyber-and-network-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-24T08:42:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/7719557-scaled-e1724434615567.jpg
Israel signs $583 million deal to sell Barak air defense to Slovakia	The launch of a Barack-8 interceptor. (IAI) JERUSALEM — Slovakia has agreed to pay €560 million ($583 million) for the Israeli-made Barak MX air defense system, in a deal the Israeli Ministry of Defense hailed as the largest ever between the two nations. The sale is the latest acquisition by a European government of Israeli air defenses, following agreements for Germany to buy the Arrow and Finland to buy David's Sling. 'Defense exports are key to our security and economic strength,' Israel’s Director General of the Ministry of Defense Eyal Zamir said in an announcement Monday. The Barak MX was developed by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), which with the US also developed the Arrow. The ministry described the deal as 'marking a significant milestone in defense cooperation' between Israel and Slovakia. 'This landmark deal, orchestrated by the International Defense Cooperation Directorate of the Israel Ministry of Defense (SIBAT), will further strengthen the bond between the two nations and enhance Slovakia's defense capabilities,' the ministry added. Slovakia has already acquired a number of Israeli systems in the last decade. In 2020 it selected the Spike LR2 anti-tank guided missile, which is made by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. Bratislava also acquired radars from IAI subsidiary ELTA in 2021. RELATED: Israel retires Patriot as native air defenses step up According to the Israeli military, the Barak MX Integrated Air Defense System can protect against a number of threats, including ballistic missiles. 'The system is known for its flexible capability to counter threats from various sources, including fighter jets, helicopters, UAVs, cruise missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles,' the ministry noted. It also added that the system has different types of interceptors for different ranges, out to 150 kilometers. The interceptors have 'active radar seeker, dual-pulse engine, and powerful warhead, the system delivers unparalleled interception performance against a wide range of threats,' the ministry said. Zamir said that the sale is part of a wider increase in Israeli defense exports that have taken place despite Israel's involvement in combat operations against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon — at least until the Lebanese conflict cooled with a ceasefire recently. In addition to logistical issues, the conflict in Gaza especially presented a geopolitical challenge to the Israeli defense industry, typified by France's refusal to allow Israeli companies attend high-profile defense shows in the country due to its conduct in Gaza. RELATED: Iran says it shot down Israel's attack. Here's what air defense systems it might've used. However, Zamir said Israeli defense technologies have proven themselves on the battlefield. 'We're seeing increased interest from more countries in the exceptional performance of the IDF [Israel Defense Force] and Israeli combat systems, both defensive and offensive,' he said, adding that exports 'enable us to keep developing the next generations of the world's most advanced combat systems.' The head of SIBAT, Brig. Gen. (Res.) Yair Kulas, also praised the Slovakia deal for integrating 'Israeli defense industry systems in European countries at NATO standards.' Boaz Levy, the CEO of IAI, said that the agreement 'underscores the system's advanced technology, proven performance, and IAI's commitment to delivering the world’s best air defense solutions in accordance with the requirements of Slovakia’s Ministry of Defence.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israel-signs-583-million-deal-to-sell-barak-air-defense-to-slovakia/	2024-12-24T07:39:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221019_barak_8_launch_IAI-scaled-e1666189021894.jpg
From Boeing’s struggles to inflation relief funds: 5 industry stories from 2024	A full-sized model of General Atomics's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (top) and Anduril's (bottom) on display at AFA 2024 on Sept. 20, 2024. (Breaking Defense photos) WASHINGTON — Whew, what a year, huh? We picked sides during a Kendrick Lamar and Drake beef, partied during a brat summer (if you don’t know what that means, ask your daughter), and sat on our couches for the Olympics. And it goes without saying, but I’m sure everyone reading Breaking Defense continued to have their eyes glued on the continued wars in Gaza and Ukraine and is closely watching the fallout of the attempted South Korean coup and the fall of Assad in Syria. But everything that happened in 2024 — at least in the United States — seemed to fall in the shadow of the election, which saw President Joe Biden withdraw and Vice President Kamala Harris generate momentum as the Democratic nominee, but ultimately lose overwhelmingly to former President Donald Trump. In much smaller news, this year also brought me back to Breaking Defense, this time in the guise of its Congress and industry reporter. I’m so ecstatic to be back covering the fast-moving world of defense technology and the people who build it, fund it and use it. I hope that’s reflected in this list of some of my favorite industry stories I wrote during this year. Rather than following my annual tradition of assigning thematically similar Taylor Swift songs to stories as I did in 2021 and 2022, I’m going to provide the defense players involved in the story a corresponding album recommendation. You know, for fun. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘I don’t see it’: Before their CCA drones even take to the air, Anduril and General Atomics trade shots As Azealia Banks once famously said, 'the girls are fighting!' When defense companies battle over a contract, they typically don’t say much (at least publicly) about the competition. This story about the potshots between General Atomics and Anduril is the exception that proves the rule. The most interesting thing about this discourse is how potentially unnecessary it is. The Air Force will choose which Collaborative Combat Aircraft variants to put into production in 2026, but leaders have said they could dole out production contracts to both Anduril and General Atomics and choose not to eliminate either company. I may be reading too much into this, but I view the clash between Anduril and General Atomics as similar to the hostility between two literary foils. Both companies are mid-tier, privately-owned and boast a more maverick sensibility than the highly corporatized defense primes. But if Anduril epitomizes the rise of the Silicon Valley-backed defense tech firm — AI and software focused, with glossy advertisements and an irreverent founder — General Atomics feels more a part of the atomic age, a historically quiet company whose culture has been shaped by engineers and physicists running experiments out in the desert. Album recommendation: 'Brat' by Charli XCX, but also maybe the fantastic soundtrack to 'Challengers' by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor. 2. As Air Force deliberates sixth-generation fighter plans, much is at stake for Boeing Has any defense contractor had a more difficult year than Boeing? (That question is rhetorical, because the answer is obviously no.) 2024 kicked off with a major accident involving its 737 MAX 9 jetliner. The company made major shifts in leadership, with Kelly Ortberg coming onboard to replace Dave Calhoun as chief executive, while also announcing plans to acquire Spirit AeroSystems, a former Boeing spin-off in dire financial straits. Boeing’s defense arm didn’t fare much better. New headwinds associated with fighter production and continued difficulties on fixed-price development programs generated billions in cost overruns. Boeing defense CEO Ted Colbert departed the company in September amid those problems, and has yet to be permanently replaced. This story isn’t about those immediate challenges, but teased out what could be an even bigger problem for Boeing: If the Air Force cancels its sixth-generation fighter, known as Next Generation Air Dominance, what kind of future will Boeing have in advanced combat aircraft development? Album recommendation: Let’s all scream into the void along with 'You Won’t Go Before You’re Supposed To' by Knocked Loose. 3. From Kabul to keel laying: Afghan immigrants find new careers at US shipyards Man, I loved writing this story. The idea germinated from a throwaway comment made by Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine at a hearing, when he mentioned that Afghan refugees were being trained in Navy-sanctioned programs to enter the shipbuilding industry. I needed to know more. Who was joining these programs, and how successful were they? While these efforts are fairly new — meaning only a handful of Afghan immigrants have completed them and found work in shipbuilding — I was struck by the resilience and determination of the Afghans I interviewed. When Rafiullah Noori told me that his job at Philly Shipyard gave him a shot at a lucrative career he thought he had lost after leaving Afghanistan, all I could think is, 'This is as close to the American Dream as you can find in 2024.' Album recommendation: I’m not a shipbuilding expert but 'American Motor Sports' by Bilmuri would be great music to listen to while fabricating Navy vessels. Also 'Cowboy Carter' by Beyonce, a fantastic reminder of the richness and adaptability of American country music. 4. Six months after fatal V-22 crash, an Air Force Osprey squadron in Japan prepares to fly again. A trip to Tokyo to explore how Japan is revitalizing its industrial base led to an excursion at Yokota Air Base, home to the Air Force squadron that had recently suffered a fatal V-22 accident that resulted in the death of eight airmen. I was honored to have the first opportunity to talk to leaders and members of the 21st Special Operations Squadron about how they were coping with the tragedy and getting ready to fly the Osprey again. Members of the 21st SOS expressed excitement about returning to flight when I spoke to them, and the squadron restarted V-22 operations weeks after this story was published. However the Osprey’s safety record has continued to be a controversial topic, and on Dec. 9, the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy temporarily suspended V-22 flight operations. Album recommendation: 'Flight B741' by King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard — an album about surviving life’s hardships and the power of friendship, all set to a bunch of flying metaphors — seems like the right pick. 5. How the Pentagon quietly spent $1 billion of inflation relief money In this story, air warfare reporter Michael Marrow and I dove deep to answer what we initially thought would be an easy question: When Congress appropriated a special $1 billion fund dedicated to inflation relief for defense contractors, where did the money go? More difficult than obtaining the list of 68 programs that obtained relief funds was getting a clearer picture of which companies benefitted from the funding, and why. A small number of big-name weapons programs —including the Constellation-class frigate, F-15EX fighter jet and John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler — clearly gobbled up the majority of the money, but what remains opaque, even to Pentagon leaders like comptroller Mike McCord, is how much funding trickled down to small suppliers desperately in need of cash. Album recommendation: 'Songs of a Lost World' by The Cure Honorable mention: NAVSEA is in its ‘survey era,’ writes top civilian in email loaded with Taylor Swift lyrics My other editors were off work, so I bullied Breaking Defense Assistant Editor Alyssa Schonhaut into letting me write this story. Album recommendation: 'The Tortured Poet’s Department: The Anthology,' by Taylor Swift, obviously.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-boeings-struggles-to-inflation-relief-funds-5-industry-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-24T06:11:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240926_cca_anduril_ga_BDPHOTOS.png
Italy inks deal to buy up to 24 more Typhoons, Leonardo says	Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon (Airbus) WASHINGTON — Italian defense firm Leonardo today announced the Italian government will buy up to an additional 24 Eurofighter Typhoons, meant to replace the air force's Tranche 1 Eurofighters. French aerospace giant Airbus, the UK's BAE Systems, and Leonardo are partners in building the aircraft, under the auspices of the four-nation Eurofighter Typhoon consortium. Consortium members are Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. Leonardo said the consortium, along with the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency had struck the deal with Rome. The new jets will be equipped with 'advanced avionics, enhanced weapon systems capable of operating Brimstone III and Meteor, new sensors and improved connectivity,' Leonardo's announcement said. Brimstone III is air-launched ground attack missile; Meteor is an active radar guided beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile. 'The order will enhance the Italian Air Force’s combat air capabilities and provide security for Italy, Europe and the NATO Alliance,' Simon Ellard, general manager of the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency, said in the Leonardo announcement. The contract with Rome follows hard on the heels of a deal with Spain for 25 Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation fighter jets under the country's Halcon II program. 'During this past seven days we have seen two of the four Eurofighter Core Nations sign new contract orders, with a clear desire to modernise their Air Forces and confirming the crucial role they attribute to our aircraft,' Giancarlo Mezzanatto, Eurofighter chief executive, said. Turkey also is hoping to get an approval to buy some 40 Typhoons, if Berlin can be persuaded by its partners to go along with the deal.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/italy-inks-deal-to-buy-up-to-24-more-typhoons-leonardo-says/	2024-12-23T12:55:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/pm_38_677_677584-e8nd1ey288-scaled-e1734715882530.jpg
Peeking behind the veil: 5 revelatory space stories from 2024	The Orion Nebula. (Photo Credits: NASA, ESA, M. Robberto [STScI/ESA], and the Hubble Space Telescope Orion Treasury Project Team) Nonetheless, 2024 saw evidence that a shift toward more openness is coming whether those deep in the 'black world' are ready or not — driven in large part by the realities of a space environment now dominated by commercial interests rather than government operators. Below find five stories (plus a bonus one) that provide a peak behind the secrecy veil or are revelatory in some way. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Hide and seek: Despite sharper eyes on the heavens, sneaky sats can still find shadows With technological advances, including artificial intelligence, and a boom in commercial companies keeping metaphorical eyes on the heavens, it is increasingly hard for governments to hide their satellites or obscure their purpose. Of course, those wishing to do just that — including US adversaries — meanwhile have been working to improve their stealth techniques. The fun part has been watching that cat-and-mouse game play out more and more openly in the public domain over the past couple of years. 2. Is Russia’s Cosmos 2553 satellite a test for a future orbital nuclear weapon? Independent space watchers with personal telescopes long have been tracking and sharing information among themselves (and with interested researchers and reporters) about intriguing space objects such as unacknowledged spy satellites and potentially dangerous space junk. Indeed, some of the most accurate and timely news about Russian and Chinese space activities have come not from the US Space Force, but from independents and, increasingly, commercial firms showing off their space tracking chops. There still has been no official word that Russia's Cosmos 2553 is the satellite that prompted a nukes-in-space scare in Washington, but if the shoe fits &#8230; . 3. GMTI emerges as new front in Space Force-NGA turf battle, and NGA director pushes back at criticisms of agency, touts ‘wetware,’ tradecraft As yours truly has documented over the past several years, the Space Force and the nation's primary spy satellite operator, the National Reconnaissance Office, have slowly been working out their relationship woes and are now settled into a (mostly) working partnership for acquiring satellite imagery about targets on Earth and in space. But like in any classic love triangle, the NRO-Space Force rapprochement has left the IC's other key space organization, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), out in the cold — and, somewhat extraordinarily, was not shy about making its grievances public. This duo of exclusives blew open the doors on the fight between the Space Force and the NGA, over primacy in managing how intelligence intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites are tasked and deciding who gets what resulting analytical products. While Breaking Defense has learned that a bilateral 'governance' accord has been drafted, under some duress from the White House, and is being reviewed up the chain of command, the ending of the saga is not yet clear. This reporter, for one, will be looking for clues when the fiscal 2026 budget drops — whenever that finally is. 4. Space Force boots RTX from MEO missile warning/tracking program Under the watchful eye of Air Force Space Acquisition Executive Frank Calvelli, who early in his tenure vowed to kick ass and take names on failing programs, the Space Force's Space Systems Command (SSC) recently has been a bit more willing to admit to programmatic woes and contractor shortfalls. Still, it was a small surprise to see SSC so readily confirm in June that it terminated RTX's contract for development of the service’s new missile warning/tracking constellation in medium Earth orbit (MEO) due to cost and schedule overruns, as well as technical issues. The company, which in March announced it was backing out as a space prime, also is the lead contractor on one of the Space Force's most expensive and long-standing problem children, the ground system for command and control of modern GPS satellites, the Next-Generation Operational Control System (OCX). SSC head Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant on Nov. 21 told reporters that one contractor has been put on the Space Force's Contractor Watch List (the first documented use of that 2018 congressionally granted power) but refused to name the firm. 5. DoD ‘completely rewrites’ classification policy for secret space programs The Defense Department's Space Policy office in January announced that it has completed its year-long policy review of how space programs traditionally have used, and many say abused, the tightly restricted Special Access Program (SAP) classification — moving to both downgrade the classification level of a number of programs and put in place rules to curtail future SAP designations. Sadly for us ink-stained scribes, nothing was actually declassified. Indeed, even the new policy itself remains firmly classified.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/peeking-behind-the-veil-5-revelatory-space-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T12:43:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-04-at-4.10.21 PM-e1733755176521.png
Advancing military training with VR and simulators	If someone was going off the full name of the annual I/ITSEC meeting — the Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference — they probably wouldn’t realize what the show floor looks like: basically, a giant arcade. No, there’s no Street Fighter machines scattered about, but the show is loaded with virtual reality, shooting simulators, and digital training exercises, all of which have a distinct video game aesthetic. But underneath the shiny, loud toys is a very real, important role in moving military training forward. After all, as Lt. Gen. Benjamin T. Watson, the head of the USMC Training and Education Command, put it, the Pentagon faces a 'steeply increasing need for simulation.' And unsurprisingly, the industry is happy to provide. In this eBook you’ll get a taste of what the show floor at I/ITSEC 2024, hosted in Orlando, Florida, looked like. Companies were out in droves, showing off their most advanced training and simulation offerings, and while these pieces won’t capture the cacophony of the floor itself, they do give you a sense of where industry is looking to invest its training and simulation dollars.

From a runaway ICBM pricetag to AI dogfighting: 5 air warfare stories from 2024	US Air Force artist's rendering of the Sentinel in flight. (Credit: US Air Force) WASHINGTON — For the US Air Force, 2024 was supposed to mark the beginning of the next generation. That was true in many cases: The service made significant headway for its drone wingmen program and in a related effort demonstrated that an AI-piloted jet can make for a formidable adversary, as well as certifying the F-35A to carry a nuclear weapon. But other efforts experienced setbacks. From the Air Force’s ballooning costs for a new, nuclear-tipped ICBM to a pause for its Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, questions now hang over some of the service’s leading priorities. In semi-particular order, here are the top five air warfare stories of 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘No alternatives’: Pentagon doubles down as new Sentinel ICBM’s cost jumps to $141 billion Air Force leaders had long warned the Sentinel ICBM would run into trouble, but even after an early preview of rising costs, many in Washington were caught flat-footed by a startling new price tag estimated to be 81 percent higher than originally forecast. Sentinel is now consuming the Air Force’s budget, much to the dismay of service leaders eager to fund other priorities. Despite its exploding costs, officials determined through a congressionally-mandated review that there are 'no alternatives' for the new ICBM, casting aside other options like road-mobile ICBMs or an extension of the Minuteman III fleet. And what drove the new estimate? Bad assumptions and 'unknown unknowns,' Air Force officials explained. It’s been decades since the Pentagon has undertaken a similar project, leading to unwelcome discoveries — the bulk of them concentrated in the construction element of the project. Multiply that problem over hundreds of silos, thousands of miles of cabling and countless easements, and the bill quickly runs up. 2. F-35A officially certified to carry nuclear bomb Reporters sweat the details of their stories, but being drawn into the global nuclear balance of power can be particularly daunting. And that’s what happened when Breaking Defense reported the F-35A was certified to carry the B61-12 thermonuclear gravity bomb — news apparently noticed by the Kremlin, as it was quickly picked up by Russian state media. The certification meant that the F-35 became the first stealth fighter in the world approved to carry a nuke. Alongside the US, fellow NATO nations and F-35 operators Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands — and Germany once Berlin’s jets are delivered — can now complement the traditional nuclear triad of submarines, ballistic missiles and bombers with fast-moving, forward-deployed stealth fighters. All as nuclear tensions ratchet higher over the war in Ukraine. Looking to you, proponents of deterrence theory. 3. V-22 Ospreys barred from full mission capability until ‘mid-2025’: NAVAIR boss After a long string of incidents, a crash of the V-22 Osprey in November 2023 prompted officials to significantly scale back operations with the troubled tiltrotor, later admitting that the aircraft won’t resume its full mission profile until mid-2025. The incident ignited anger among lawmakers, leading some to threaten canceling the program altogether if another aircraft crashed. Recent reporting has also shed light on the aircraft’s troubles, such as an internal report showing that warnings of a mechanical issue that caused the November 2023 crash were known for at least a decade. Other reporting has revealed a recent concerning rise in severe incidents and that underlying manufacturing issues carry wider implications for military and civilian aircraft. The aircraft’s woes continue: On Dec. 9, officials confirmed that the Osprey’s operations would once again be paused following a recent in-flight incident. 4. In a ‘world first,’ DARPA project demonstrates AI dogfighting in real jet Few announcements this year had a bigger impact on the future of warfare than when DARPA, the Air Force and industry vendors revealed that an F-16 tricked out to serve as an autonomy testbed can not only fly itself, but also dogfight. Officials declined to disclose specifics results from those trials like a win/loss ratio, but after Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall took a ride himself in the special F-16, he described the AI as putting on roughly an even match against a seasoned pilot. Many officials think human pilots will stick around for the foreseeable future, their abilities augmented by manned-unmanned teaming arrangements. And, Kendall has emphasized, any highly autonomous weapon systems will only be flown under tight human control. As more experiments like the DARPA project proceed and autonomous capabilities only get better, time will tell whether the future is closer than it seems. 5. Air Force picks Anduril, General Atomics for next round of CCA work The Air Force made significant strides this year for its effort to field drone wingmen, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft. After Breaking Defense first reported the five industry vendors in play for the CCA program’s first round of procurement, the Air Force winnowed that group to two, leaving startup Anduril and legacy dronemaker General Atomics still standing. Heralding a revolution in airpower, officials hope CCA can offset numerical advantages enjoyed by China as the Air Force’s own fighter inventory shrinks. One day, these drones might even take the place of manned fighters — and if incoming Department of Government Efficiency co-lead Elon Musk has his way, that day could come sooner rather than later.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-a-runaway-icbm-pricetag-to-ai-dogfighting-5-air-warfare-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T10:58:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220405_USAF_sentinel_gfx.png
Trump names picks for top Pentagon posts, with financier as No. 2	U.S. Army Reserve soldiers receive an overview of Washington D.C. as part of the 4th Annual Day with the Army Reserve May 25, 2016. The event was led by the Private Public Partnership office. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has made his picks for a handful of top jobs at the Defense Department, including several who served in national security jobs during his first term of office and a billionaire financier for the number two spot. Trump announced the choices late Sunday, saying the team would 'work in conjunction with our GREAT Secretary of Defense Nominee, Pete Hegseth!' — signaling the Trump team is standing by Hegseth, the Fox News host despite allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied. For Hegseth's would-be deputy, Trump nominated Stephen Feinberg, billionaire investor and co-founder of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Feinberg's firm, which is active in the defense space, owns Stratolaunch Systems, which provides hypersonic vehicles for testing including to DoD. He also has been a major funder to political organizations backing Trump. Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch CEO, told reporters on Dec. 5 that Feinberg would 'be a phenomenal choice,' even though Stratolaunch would then face 'heavy, heavy conflict of interest rules and precedents put in place such that we will be treated no differently than any other company.' During Trump's first term in office, Feinberg headed the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives private citizens access to classified information so they can assess how the Intelligence Community goes about its normally cloistered business. Dan Coats, Trump's Director of National Intelligence, told lawmakers in February 2017 that he knew Feinberg 'personally' and considered him a 'patriot.' Elbridge Colby, a well-known Washington voice on national security affairs with a long government career, was nominated as DoD undersecretary for policy. Colby, the grandson of Nixon-era CIA Director William Colby, held the position of DoD deputy assistant secretary for strategy and force development from 2017 to 2018. As an analyst at the Center for a New American Security and the Center for Naval Analyses known for his 'realist' views, Colby was active on issues surrounding space security — arguing for the US military to build up the capacity to fight a 'limited' space war with China and Russia. Michael Duffey, who served in several roles including at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the first Trump administration, was nominated as undersecretary for acquisitions and sustainment. A former head of the Wisconsin Republican Party, Duffey was reportedly a key figure in Trump's first impeachment saga as an administration official involved in the freezing of aid to Ukraine. Emil Michael, a former Uber executive, was tapped to be undersecretary for research and engineering. Michael led the ride-share company's expansion into Russia and China, negotiating co-investment deals worth billions, according to accounts he's provided publicly. Michael was linked to controversies while at Uber, including a suggestion in 2014 that the company dig up dirt on reporters critical of the firm, according to a Buzzfeed report. (Michael apologized at the time.) Also in 2014 Michael was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to the Pentagon's Defense Business Board. According to his website, he also is an investor in or advisor to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Joe Kasper, who served at DoD and the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, was nominated as chief of staff to the secretary of defense. Kasper began his career as an aide to then-Rep. Duncan Hunter, R.-Calif., and left the job in 2017, months after Hunter came under investigation for misusing campaign funds from 2010 to 2016. Kasper was not accused of wrongdoing in that case. (Hunter pleaded guilty in 2019 but was later pardoned by Trump.) Kasper currently serves as managing director at consulting firm Ervin Graves. Finally, Keith Bass, a retired Navy commander, was nominated as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Bass since June 2023 has been medical center director of the West Texas VA Health Care System for the Veterans Integrated Service Network, having previously worked as a senior vice president for business development at GlobalMed, a Vienna, Va.-based provider of telemedicine including for DoD and the Veterans Administration. While not a physician, he also served as the director of the CIA Office of Medical Services.

To win, US must eliminate gap between the supply chain and the kill chain	Contractor employees at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant prepare 155 mm artillery rounds to be filled as a part of the load, assemble and pack operation. (Photo by JMC) In early October, when Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, two US Navy destroyers were strategically in place in the Mediterranean Sea. The USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired off a dozen interceptors to aid in Israel’s defense. Those interceptors, which proved their life-saving abilities, cost up to $30 million a copy. Each one takes years to build. In an era of on-demand everything, a reasonable American might think that the expenditure of this costly, munition, immediately kicked off replenishment at the Alabama factory where it’s made. One might reasonably assume that a sophisticated tracking, production, and resupply system keeps our servicemembers armed and our military at a heightened state of readiness. The reasonable American, conditioned to these expectations by the suggestive powers of 'smart' homes, cars, grocery shopping apps, and more, would be completely wrong. Today, no such system is in place and it often takes years to replenish weapons used on the battlefield. The American factory is separated from the fight. This gap must be closed, the need is urgent, and the technology to fix this is available. Historically, this type of system wasn't actually needed. For most of human history, armies lived off the land. They acquired food and supplies from local populations. Armies stashed supplies at magazines, transported equipment like artillery, and acquired goods and services from sutlers and camp followers. Likewise, navies operating far from home ports relied on local supplies of fresh water, food, and naval stores. Pre-industrial forces, therefore, lacked the logistical umbilical cord that stretches back to home territory. Logistics was a local affair conducted by forces in the field, rather than supplied by a dedicated corps. This created freedom of maneuver at the cost of the ability to sustain large forces in the field over time. The second industrial revolution changed all of this. It freed up labor and created the means to outfit huge forces with materiel. Railroads and steamships could quickly and reliably transport these armies, along with their increasingly sophisticated equipment and supplies over great distances. Telegraphs allowed for rapid communication of orders and logistical requests. Armies and navies still acquired some supplies locally, but on balance, sustainment now came over supply lines. This change propelled the emergence of a standing military staff to manage the complexity of industrial logistics. Militaries created large supply corps and dedicated infrastructure to keep forces and equipment sustained in the field. As military operations became larger and more far-flung, these processes and organizations expanded in size and complexity to keep pace. Over time, this specialization increasingly divorced rear-area support functions from frontline combat forces. Which is why today, the supply chain and the kill chain are separate, distinct functions in the American military. There have been some modest technology advancements to help connect logisticians to warfighters, but nothing has bridged the gap between supply and demand. Rather, we remain largely stuck in a 20th century model in which combat forces rely on a distant and labor-intensive process to provide them with materiel, ranging from bombs to blood, when and where it is needed. The separated military functions of supply and demand systems have created bloat in civilian and military bureaucracy and a disconnect between what the warfighter needs and America is producing that does not exist in the commercial sector. The sad reality is that because the Pentagon does not typically invest in technology for the 'staff functions' of DoD, the on-demand technology in the hands of an American consumer right now is more powerful than that in the hands of an American logistics officer. The good news is that changing this requires exactly zero new authorities from Congress, acquisition reforms, changes to the FAR, or new blue star commissions. The military can solve this today by leveraging the same software and AI that the commercial sector has relied upon for decades. Today, units manually calculate supply consumption and communicate it to the next echelon. Resupply is then aggregated across units and fed into plans, at which point they are locked in for that planning cycle. As a result of this slow, sequential process, forward-deployed units often depend on establishing surpluses of supply in theater—surpluses that we now know are difficult to maintain, and that are vulnerable to disruption in a contested environment. The supply chains and manufacturers that ultimately power these operations have rationally organized around this intermittent cadence. Now imagine a process that runs more like the always-on systems Americans have come to expect in every other industry. In the case of Navy missiles fired in the Mediterranean, the weapons used in the kill chain are Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) surface-to-air missiles, built by Raytheon and fired using a Vertical Launcher System (VLS). That VLS would be equipped with software to measure SM-2 expenditures, allowing accurate inventory and consumption to be readily visible across echelons. These same command and control (C2) systems would provide proactive recommendations on replenishment actions for the supply chain, transforming unreliable stockpiling into data-backed predictive logistics. This can and should be replicated across a variety of weapons systems and other critical equipment. The harder piece will be fully restoring the size and strength of the American industrial base to meet the production and manufacturing demands that today’s challenging global environment requires. There are signs that a resurgence is underway, but a full transformation of American production cannot take place without a clear and sustained demand signal from the Pentagon. Making the changes described here actually helps this big challenge. Sending industry a much earlier demand signal and reducing delays in getting industry gears turning is the goal. Furthermore, everything purchased under DoD’s Operations &amp; Maintenance account—repairs, fuel, medical supplies, and more—enjoys significantly more flexibility in terms of DoD’s flexibility and discretion to buy when needed. You simply have to look at the attendance at this month’s Reagan National Defense Forum to see that American companies, old and new, are rising up to meet the needs of the warfighters. It is incumbent on military leaders to put in place the efficient, direct, real-time connectivity between what those companies supply and what our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians need for today’s fight, and tomorrow’s.

From drone red tape to an aviation shake up: 5 Army stories from 2024	An RCV light at desert testing. (Original image by Savannah Baldwin/ US Army; Code image by Markus Spiske via Pexels; Graphic by Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — US Army leaders spent the year teasing changes both big and small. After kicking off 2024 with an aviation upheaval and revamping artillery plans, they foreshadowed additional changes to acquisition programs and policy alike. Here are my five top Army stories from the past 12 months, ranging from red tape hamstringing soldiers from using smaller drones to Army leaders butting up with tech challenges developing a fleet of future robotic combat vehicles. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 2. US Army takes on most effective counter-drone system yet: Red tape Every time a US Army soldier loses or breaks a drone — regardless of its size or price tag — they are saddled with reporting paperwork, a mandatory investigation and possibly a loss of pay. That red tape has left soldiers hesitant to fly smaller drones and the service officials looking to reclassify ones tipping the scales below 55 pounds as expendable. 3. Army looks to limit early Robotic Combat Vehicle missions to keep soldiers out of harm's way Army plans to team up soldiers with machines kicked into high gear this year with part of that push centered around the revamped Robotic Combat Vehicle program. But questions about the service’s autonomy approach coupled with the state of technology, mean it is relying on a radio 'tether' that can break if soldiers in control vehicles are too far behind the robots, obstacles get in the way or an adversary is jamming the signals. As a result, too many troops are needed to control those ground robots and they are in the line of fire. 4. Army open to replacing Microsoft as prime under &#8216;IVAS Next,' industry sources say The Army and Microsoft are still teamed up on the futuristic mixed-reality goggles dubbed the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). However, change is afoot after multiple years of starts and fits with the heads-up display. Several tech companies, for example, spent 2024 preparing to jump into the IVAS Next competition after receiving briefings from the service about a decision to recompete the prime contractor position. 5. Inside the US Army's race to apply Ukraine lessons to future Abrams, Bradley replacement Loitering munitions and cheap one-way drones inside Ukraine have left a string of combat vehicles from both sides of the conflict destroyed in battle. The US Army leaders are using the conflict as a crash course in how their own tactics and technology could end up on the wrong side of a war, while also rushing to incorporate lessons into the development of tracked combat vehicles like the Abrams tank and Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-drone-red-tape-to-an-aviation-shake-up-5-army-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T07:30:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240719_RCV_desert_gfx.png
The Navy’s never-ending quest for 355 ships: 5 Navy stories from 2024	The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group transits the Pacific Ocean Jan. 25, 2020. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jason Isaacs) WASHINGTON — In 2024, the US Navy didn’t have enough ships or subs it wanted in its fleet. And it showed. A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers as well as top Navy leadership have bemoaned the fleet’s size for years now. Despite federal law stating the service must maintain more than 355 ships, the fleet’s actual size currently fluctuates between the high 280s and low 290s. But what distinguished 2024 were the numerous fronts on which the Navy, and other parts of the federal government, has pushed to stop the bleeding before 2027 — the year the US believes China wants to have the ability to invade Taiwan, should leader Xi Jingping call them to do so. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti herself has seemingly coined the phrase 'more players on the field' since the start of her tenure. It's a motto that encompasses several aspects of the Navy's capabilities and arsenal, the overall number of warships being one of them. From calling out industry to making a big bet on venture capital, these are five stories from 2024 where the Pentagon’s anxiety about ship counts was showing. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Navy lays out major shipbuilding delays, in rare public accounting Not too long after the president’s budget request was published in March, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro released a brief but damning document outlining massive delays on nearly every premiere shipbuilding program in the service’s repertoire. The news that those programs were behind wasn’t inherently surprising; Pentagon observers use a combination of public statements and budget justification documents to keep tabs on the general status of all new ships and submarines. But this story makes it to the top of this list because of how unusual it was for a senior Defense Department official such as Del Toro to so outwardly and publicly proclaim some of the country’s most important national security programs are lagging behind. And as has been a pattern for Del Toro, to which the next story on this list will allude, he also made sure to call out prime contractors for each program on that list of delays. 2. How SECNAV’s claims about S. Korean, Japanese shipbuilders do and do not line up In the first half of 2024, Del Toro on multiple occasions let industry know that, as he saw it, they had their share of the blame to carry for the Navy’s problems, particularly when it came to ship construction and maintenance. At major expositions that are otherwise meant as opportunities for industry to get face time with senior military leaders, Del Toro laid into unnamed C-suite executives for excessive 'stock buybacks' and failing to re-invest in their facilities for the benefit of the Navy. That leads into this story, which explored Del Toro’s proposal for Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders to invest in American shipyards. These Asian companies, Del Toro argued, are technologically ahead of their American counterparts and their work output reaps the benefits. It was a premise with which some American officials took exception. (At least one major Asian company, the Hanwha Group, has taken Del Toro up on his offer and started making inroads with the American industrial base since then.)

(U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Briana Carter) 3. ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers This next story also featured the US reaching out to allies for a helping hand in shipbuilding. The ICE Pact came out of this summer’s NATO summit and was one of the last big foreign policy initiatives by the Biden administration. While icebreakers are technically the purview of the US Coast Guard with regards to shipbuilding, the operations of the US Navy — and the wider joint force — are dependent upon the United States and allies being able to access existing and emerging sea lanes in the High North. This was clearly on the minds of Biden administration officials when it enlisted the assistance of Canada and Finland, both of whom are proficient at icebreaker shipbuilding and Arctic navigation, to join forces with the American defense industrial base for the benefit of all three nations’ fleets. The story linked above dives deep into the circumstances surrounding the ICE Pact including why the US needed help from its northern allies and where Russia and China stand in their own push in the Arctic. 4. Navy takes ‘really big swing with private investment to boost sub industrial base The advent of the AUKUS trilateral security pact in 2021 has put a massive spotlight on the submarine industrial base and its challenges. This story is a highlight for the year because of the unusual nature of the deal in play. The Navy teamed up with a private investment fund to purchase and develop a plot of land in Mobile, Ala., aimed at prioritizing 'maritime infrastructure investments and sustainment activities with the goal of developing an additional 75 [percent] of the site to support submarine production, workforce training, and industrial capacity.' The business arrangement is a novel one for the Navy and speaks to the service’s willingness to use outside the box thinking if it means bolstering the submarine industrial base. That thinking is why it makes this list. (Some readers might notice this story was written by Breaking Defense’s managing editor Lee Ferran, who insists on calling it 'eloquent prose.' I'll leave that to the reader to decide. [Editor's Note: Eloquent or elegant, either fits.]) Sailors stand watch aboard the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun (DDG 103) while it transits the Turkish Straits. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Scott Barnes/Released) 5. US Navy to extend service lives of 12 destroyers This last story is short, but to the point. The service announced it would extend the lives of a dozen Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, which will add an anticipated 48 years of operational life to a fleet of ships regularly dubbed the workhorse of the US Navy. During the first Trump administration, Navy officials went on record to say that extending the service lives of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, combined with producing additional ships beyond previously planned amounts, was the surest way to reach 355 ships. The fleet's composition would not be optimal but, they argued, having too many destroyers was the best place to be imbalanced. Given this announcement, that thinking is clearly still resident in the US Navy’s leadership.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-navys-never-ending-quest-for-355-ships-5-navy-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T06:01:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220420_dvids_roosevelt_strike_group_6046018-scaled-e1650476195702.jpg
Pentagon awards Lockheed $11.8 billion undefinitized F-35 production contract	Airmen assigned to the 34th Fighter Squadron and Fighter Generation Squadron perform pre-flight checks on F-35A Lightning IIs during an agile combat employment exercise at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, March 28, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman Keagan Lee) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has awarded Lockheed Martin a roughly $11.8 billion contract to continue production of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as the two parties inch toward finalizing an agreement for the stealth fighter. In a contract announcement posted tonight, the Pentagon said the award covers 145 copies of the tri-variant fighter between the US Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy as well as foreign customers. The contract is undefinitized, meaning dollar values and quantities could change as negotiations continue, and only covers production lot 18 of the stealth fighter. Lockheed referred questions to the Pentagon. Russ Goemaere, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office, told Breaking Defense that the Pentagon aims to finalize the lot 18 contract in the spring. Additionally, Goemaere said officials expect to similarly issue an undefinitized contract for lot 19 production when the fiscal 2025 budget is approved — which may not occur until March at the earliest, following a last-minute, stopgap measure lawmakers passed today. After originally aiming to reach an agreement last year for production lots 18 and 19, the Pentagon and Lockheed have remained at an impasse amid inflation and other challenges. The parties reached a 'handshake' deal for the two lots in November — though the announcement did not share quantities or prices — and a Lockheed official later said the program may first move forward with an undefinitized contract as talks continued. Getting a contract award was critical, Lockheed officials have previously said, to provide a cash injection for the program that the company resorted to partially funding out of pocket to ensure production could continue smoothly. The F-35 has also been a target of top Trump ally Elon Musk in recent weeks, who is set to co-lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) commission that could recommend cuts to government spending. Musk has called officials 'idiots' for continuing to build the jet, while DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy recently advocated for shifting funds away from manned fighters and into other platforms like drones — raising questions of the Joint Strike Fighter’s fate under the new administration. Yet the jet still has defenders. Outgoing Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has long been critical of the F-35 program’s many problems, hit back at Musk’s comments Thursday, arguing that the US should continue to buy and upgrade the stealth fighter.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagon-awards-lockheed-11-8-billion-undefinitized-f-35-production-contract/	2024-12-20T17:54:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240728_f35s_fog_USAF-scaled-e1722204407178.jpg
Top defense insights from 2024	In my intro to last year’s collection of opinion and analysis pieces, I started with this line: 'In many ways, 2023 was a year of chaos.' Rather than writing this, I really could have just cut and pasted that intro and changed some dates, because 2024 wasn’t any calmer. The wars in Ukraine and Israel expanded, major Pentagon programs found themselves fighting for their lives and a presidential election dominated America’s attention. All of which is to say, the defense community had a lot of thoughts in 2024, which is why Breaking Defense published over 85 opinion and analysis pieces this year. Below, we’ve collected a small handful of those that we think really stood out, whether because they came from newsmakers, because of their topicality, or because of the way they drove the conversation. Of course, we could only select a limited number of the pieces we ran for this eBook, which means a lot of great stuff got left on the cutting room floor. For this collection, we largely avoided the many excellent news-of-the-moment pieces (such as how Congress should approach the budget) that are less relevant months later, even though those pieces helped define the discussion at the time. Also not fully represented here is our 'NATO’s Northern Edge' collection, published around the alliance’s 75th Anniversary in Washington and featuring pieces from top officials from Norway, Finland, Canada and the United Kingdom.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/top-defense-insights-from-2024/	2024-12-20T15:35:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Defense-Influences-Featured-Image-2024-V2.png
Air Force reopens F-16 ejection seat deal, setting up contest between Collins, Martin-Baker	Three F-16s from the 93rd Fighter Squadron prepare for takeoff at Homestead Air Reserve Base on Aug. 3, 2022, during the Golden Gecko Airmen Readiness Exercise 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Lionel Castellano) WASHINGTON — The Air Force is formally recompeting a deal with Collins Aerospace to provide modernized ejection seats for the service’s F-16 fleet, and could do the same for the F-22 and B-1 based on the results, the service announced tonight. Work already underway to integrate Collins’s ACES 5 ejection seat on the Air Force’s F-15 fleet will continue, according to the service’s press release. But officials will now compete a deal to reseat the F-16, and 'decisions following the competition could extend to other platforms, including the F-22 and B-1,' the release said. A new request for proposals will be issued, the Air Force said. As Breaking Defense covered last month, the decision puts up for grabs the safety of upwards of thousands of Air Force pilots, hundreds of millions of dollars and a chance for sole competitor Martin-Baker to steal away at least some business from RTX subsidiary Collins. 'With 713 lives saved, ACES is the safest ejection seat available. We look forward to working with the US Air Force to qualify and install the latest generation of our ejection seats, the ACES 5, on the F-16 fleet,' Collins said in a statement. Martin-Baker, whose US18E seat is on contract for foreign sales of the F-16, said in a statement that '[w]e have a qualified seat for the F-16, and we look forward to the opportunity to compete.' The service said an original sole-source award to Collins under the Next Generation Ejection Seat (NGES) program was 'based on previous market research and assessment of technological maturity.' But the program has been hit by delays, and officials decided to review the deal with Collins by querying industry again in August. Officials chose a new approach based on that market survey, as well as 'new data' and 'evolving operations demands,' according to the release. 'The decision to re-open the competition underscores our commitment to continually assess our strategies to ensure we meet warfighter needs and timelines,' Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said in the release. 'By reassessing market conditions and fostering competition, we ensure industry delivers the best possible solutions for both current and future Air Force requirements.' The Air Force’s original NGES plan called for reseating the A-10, though officials have since decided to retire the platform — mirroring a shrinking fighter fleet. Collins is on contract separately to provide a new seat for the B-2 fleet, and the first bomber got its new seats last month. It’s unclear how a competition might impact the already-delayed seat plan. For each platform under the NGES effort, 'the Air Force projects a 36-month integration and test program, followed by a 24-month manufacturing lead-time, followed by aircraft modifications,' an Air Force spokesperson previously told Breaking Defense. Asked how a competition could impact that timeline, the spokesperson replied that '[i]nformation gathered from industry in the [August] sources sought notice will inform us on potential impacts to platform integration timelines.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/air-force-reopens-f-16-ejection-seat-deal-setting-up-contest-between-collins-martin-baker/	2024-12-20T15:28:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/7963466-scaled-e1695394371635.jpg
Continuing resolution with $14B in submarine funds survives House vote	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Just hours before a midnight deadline is set to trigger a government shutdown, the House overwhelmingly approved a stopgap funding bill that keeps federal funding rolling until mid-March and adds $14 billion for submarines. The bill, approved in a 366-34-1 vote in which Republicans made up the only 'nay' votes, was the third deal floated this week amid a Republican back-and-forth in which President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk played starring roles. In the end, House Democrats overwhelmingly backed the bill after the White House voiced reluctant support. 'Following an order by President-elect Trump, yesterday Republicans walked away from a bipartisan deal and threatened to shut down the government at the 11th hour in order to pave the way to provide tax breaks for billionaires. This revised legislation does not do that,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. 'President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans — from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans — can continue as well as to grant assistance for communities that were impacted by devastating hurricanes,' she added. The measure now moves to the Senate, which is expected to pass the bill as early as this evening. Like previous proposals, the latest bill included more than $14 billion in additional funds for the Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines. That sum includes $5.7 billion in emergency funds for Virginia-class submarine construction for 'the improvement of workforce wages and non-executive level salaries.' That funding, which the Navy could incrementally dole out until the end of fiscal 2029, is aimed at mitigating ongoing instability in the submarine industrial base, which has had difficultly recruiting and retaining skilled shipbuilding technicians since the pandemic. It also included $9 billion for Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine procurement. The additional submarine funding was an uncontroversial provision that drew little conversation during the past week of negotiations. 'Importantly, the final Continuing Resolution maintains the Biden Administration’s request to Congress of over $14 billion for the Virginia and Columbia class submarine programs and the industrial base, which will help the Navy and industry boost production cadence and grow the supply chain.' Rep. Joe Courtney, the Connecticut Democrat who is ranking member on the House Armed Services seapower subcommittee, said in a statement. Other defense related increases that remained in the latest bill were the addition of disaster relief funding for military installations for damages caused by Typhoon Mawar as well as various hurricanes. However, previous language that would transfer a District of Columbia Air National Guard wing to the Maryland Guard was not included, as that move was part of a deal that would transfer the RFK stadium site to DC, which was not addressed in the current CR bill. The road to the current deal has been fraught with drama. The initial CR deal, negotiated between House GOP and Democratic leadership and released on Tuesday, included billions of dollars in farm aid and disaster relief, as well as a laundry list of additional provisions spanning from the ownership of Washington’s RFK stadium to a pay raise for congressional salaries to music tourism. Without Democrat buy-in to ensure passage of the bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson risked the CR being derailed by hardline fiscal hawks in his own party. However, Republicans were incensed by the unrelated items attached to the CR, which had ballooned into more than 1,500-pages. The wheels came off on Wednesday as Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have both been tapped to lead Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, took to social media and issued a string of posts decrying the bipartisan agreement as a waste of taxpayer dollars and calling for a shutdown unless a clean CR was put forward. Trump’s disavowal of the deal — and his demand that any agreement also tackle the debt ceiling — proved to be the final death knell, leaving Republicans scrambling to figure out a new plan with only two days left before federal funding ran out. With Trump’s blessing, Johnson put forward another bill yesterday: a clean CR with disaster relief and the farm bill, as well as suspend the debt ceiling. However, the bill failed in a 174-235 vote in which 38 Republicans voted against the measure. Republicans spent all day trying to put forward another option, at one point considering conducting four different votes for the CR, the farm bill, the disaster relief and the debt ceiling. Ultimately, House leadership opted for a single bill that dropped the debt ceiling issue. Democratic leaders repeatedly stated that Republicans would be responsible for getting a funding bill over the line without Democrat help, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stating on a Wednesday post on the X social media site, 'You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow.' Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, criticized Musk’s involvement in the process in a floor speech ahead of the vote. 'We need to rely on each other to keep our word, that when we have an agreement, we keep that agreement,' she said. However, both Democrats ended up voting for the bill. Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., implored Democrats to consider funding measures that included in the bill on their own merits, not what had been stripped out from the previous bipartisan agreement. 'If you vote no on this bill, you are effectively voting to shut down the government,' he said. 'These are things that we agree on, and there is nothing in this bill certainly that my friends on the other side disagree with.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/continuing-resolution-with-14b-in-submarine-funds-survives-house-vote/	2024-12-20T15:14:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231108_DVIDS_submarine_construction_820194-e1699443296744.jpg
Spain orders 25 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, links arms on Turkish trainer	Spain is set to operate a total of 115 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets after placing a new order for the fourth generation type (Airbus) BELFAST — Spain has signed off on an order for 25 Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation fighter jets under its Halcon II program. A contract between the Spanish government and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) was inked today and covers the acquisition of 21 single-seat and four twin-seat aircraft. The Eurofighter consortium said in a statement that deliveries to the Spanish Air and Space Force will take place between 2030 and 2035. 'The Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon jets will replace part of the legacy F-18 fleet, based in Torrejon and Zaragoza, and bring the total number of Typhoon aircraft in the Spanish Air Force to 115,' it added. In a related statement, Airbus, which builds all Spanish Air Force Eurofighters out of its Getafe site, said that the 'new aircraft will: boost Spain’s air-power capabilities and operations; reinforce its prominent position at the heart of NATO, and secure the programme’s industrial footprint.' Halcon is Spain’s national two-phase acquisition program to replace all F/A-18C/D Hornets, split between the already contracted $2.15 billion Halcon 1, covering 20 aircraft, and the new second batch order. The Halcon II effort, valued at €4.6 billion ($4.8 billion), was cleared by Spain's Council of Ministers in 2023. Alongside aircraft, the program also covers engines and support services. Gen. Javier Salto Martínez-Avial, chief of the Spanish Air and Space Force has long pressed for the Halcon II order not to be delayed, warning last year that deliveries could take 10 years. Halcon aircraft are to be equipped with state of the art avionics, electronically-scanning radar (E-Scan), and weapon systems that can support launch of Brimstone III and Full Meteor missiles, alongside new sensors and improved connectivity, according to Airbus. Separately, Spain has also decided to partner with Turkey to support development of the Hurjet advanced jet trainer. A Memorandum of Understanding for the collaboration was signed today between the Spanish Ministry of Defence and the Turkish Presidency of Defence Industries. The move could lead to Madrid acquiring the platform as a replacement for Northrop SF-5M aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/spain-orders-25-additional-eurofighter-typhoon-fighter-jets-links-arms-on-turkish-trainer/	2024-12-20T11:45:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/pm_38_677_677584-e8nd1ey288-scaled-e1734715882530.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: New Air Force review supports manned 6th-gen NGAD fighter concept	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — A recent internal Air Force analysis supports the development of a manned, next-generation fighter jet, three sources told Breaking Defense — a finding that comes amid a high-profile debate over the future of the multi-billion-dollar Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. While the Trump administration will make the final decision of whether to press forward with NGAD, which was paused earlier this year, the review’s results could strengthen the case to keep the program alive and award a contract for the future fighter. In a statement to Breaking Defense today, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall did not dispute that the overall conclusion of the analysis supports a next-gen manned fighter, though he did caution that other factors including cost would determine its outcome. 'While our analysis does demonstrate that there is value in a next generation crewed platform, the current NGAD design comes at high total and unit costs that may be unaffordable,' Kendall said. 'Our analysis also highlights that there may be significant opportunity costs associated with proceeding with NGAD, given the DAF’s [Department of the Air Force] strategic priorities and the potential level of Air Force and Space Force budgets. There are a number of interdependencies and alternative options at various risk and resourcing levels which the next administration will have to consider before making a decision. All options remain on the table,' he added. The NGAD program was temporarily suspended as the Air Force weighed whether it could afford an expensive next-generation fighter in light of ongoing budget constraints, the breakneck pace of adversary threats, and technological progress on competing spending priorities, especially a budding effort to field drone wingmen dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft. The CCA wingmen are expected to be a critical force multiplier for manned Air Force aircraft and have been described as a key component of the envisioned NGAD family of systems. Kendall said in public comments Thursday that other concerns also influenced the delay, like how the platform would fit into the service’s Agile Combat Employment — a method of dispersing operations to avoid a crippling attack, relying on a network of bases officials fret may not have adequate defenses. The service is also weighing what elements are needed to support an NGAD fighter, like a next-gen tanker, whose fate is currently in limbo. Air Force leaders decided to use the fall to review the NGAD concept, calling in help from former officials and researchers to conduct additional analysis. The process was expected to wrap up in time to inform the Air Force’s fiscal 2026 budget request, though the service recently announced it would punt a decision on the platform’s fate to the incoming Trump administration. Without sharing the results, Kendall said publicly Thursday that the NGAD analysis was 'mostly done' with the caveat that the new Trump team 'may want some additional analysis when they show up.' He noted that the Air Force is 'very close to being ready to proceed if that program continues its current form.' The Air Force’s NGAD hesitancy sent shockwaves through the defense industry, which after a decade of development was gearing up for a decision on the jet originally expected this year. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are believed to be the prime contractors vying for the jet’s lucrative contract, which would likely be the world’s first sixth-gen fighter. RELATED: As Air Force deliberates sixth-gen fighter plans, much at stake for Boeing A next-gen fighter effort also carries profound implications for the engine industrial base. The NGAD platform is the only aircraft publicly planned to use an 'adaptive' powerplant, which could offer leaps in fuel efficiency and thrust. GE Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney are competing to build the NGAD engine under a program called Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion. While the Air Force’s analysis substantiates the requirement for a sixth-generation fighter, it’s unclear whether the service will be able to find the funding to continue development of the NGAD aircraft and engine given significant budget pressure from other programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the B-21 Raider stealth bomber and the nuclear-tipped Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system, whose price recently ballooned by 81 percent. Kendall told Breaking Defense earlier this year he was confident that a sixth-generation fighter would be built, though he left the door open to an optionally manned version. Kendall said the operational challenges, primarily due to the rise of China, have been defined by an 'accumulation of threats,' noting that Cold War-era assumptions can no longer hold. 'We’re not up against the Soviet Union anymore,' Kendall said. 'We’re up against China, primarily, as the pacing challenge. And we’ve got to be sure we’re doing the right thing.' How the incoming Trump administration will handle the NGAD issue is unknown. President-elect Donald Trump has yet to name his nominee for Air Force Secretary, but Elon Musk — an influential associate of Trump who will run his Department of Government Efficiency initiative — has made his views clear. '[M]anned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones,' Musk recently posted on X, the social media platform he owns.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/exclusive-new-air-force-review-supports-manned-6th-gen-ngad-fighter-concept/	2024-12-20T11:06:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
