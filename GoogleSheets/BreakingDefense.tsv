Army says DUCES to cyber hackers: New RFI looks for tactical edge zero trust solutions	Sgt.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. Alexander Rector) WASHINGTON — The Army is on the hunt for zero trust capabilities to ensure its data is secure in tactical network architectures, according to a request for information published Monday. The service’s C5ISR Center is soliciting information from interested businesses to help find zero trust solutions that can 'integrate seamlessly' into the Army’s existing infrastructure while operating in denied, degraded, intermittent or limited (DDIL) environments. The service is calling such capabilities Tactical Data in Use Security (DUCES) solutions. 'This constrained, highly dynamic, and adversarial-susceptible tactical environment will be a challenge to implement ZT solutions that meet mission needs,' the RFI reads. The Army is turning to zero trust to protect its data as it has found that 'traditional' security models aren’t making the cut anymore given the ever increasing complexity of cyber threats, according to the RFI. The solicitation is specifically looking for solutions that offer advanced capabilities in encryption and anomaly detection in addition to 'secure communication protocols' that protect against current and future threats. The concept of zero trust has gained considerable momentum in recent years as data leaks and the proliferation of adversarial attacks on critical infrastructure have surmounted. At its core, zero trust follows the philosophy 'never trust, always verify' and assumes that the network is always compromised. This means that instead of allowing users to have free reign over a network, there are constant checks to make sure that users are allowed to access what they are trying to access. This verification happens through identity, credential, and access management, or ICAM. Related: Army picks Akamai for prototype battlefield zero trust project: T-ICAM Monday’s RFI is not the first time the Army has searched for zero trust solutions at the tactical edge. Last spring the service chose cloud and edge-computing company Akamai to develop prototype Tactical ICAM capabilities for its combat units. However, the service didn’t go through the typical procurement process or fire out an RFI for Akamai’s prototypes. Instead it used the streamlined Software Acquisition Pathway and a flexible Other Transaction Authority contract to get Akamai’s products in the hands of the warfighters much quicker. But this time around, the Army seems to be acquiring zero trust solutions the old-fashioned way. Responses are due before noon on March 5.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-says-duces-to-cyber-hackers-new-rfi-looks-for-tactical-edge-zero-trust-solutions/	2025-02-04T13:06:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/3472038-1-scaled-e1696963690988.jpg
Eyeing a new autonomous launcher prototyping initiative, Army checking out industry options	The US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation &amp; Missile Center and Ground Vehicle Systems Center's combined Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher team conducted a live fire of a Reduced Range Practice Rocket fired from the AML at Yuma Proving Ground in April 2024. (US Army photo) WASHINGTON — US Army leaders are looking at different autonomous launchers as they eye a possible prototyping competition and grapple with the right mix of crewed and uncrewed systems for the future force, according to a one-star general helping to lead the charge. After a series of studies and projections into surface-to-surface fires threats through 2035, the service believes it is facing 'deficits' in three categories — range, capacity and survivability — if it doesn’t 'rectify our course,' said Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team leader Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks. 'Achieving local fire superiority starts with surface-to-surface parity,' he explained during a Jan. 29 interview with Breaking Defense. 'Once we achieve that local fire superiority with surface-to-surface [and] surface-to air, then we can set the right conditions to bring in our air component,' Crooks later added. But to achieve that vision and address those perceived deficits, the service has devised a three-pronged approach: ammunition innovation; scaling launched effects plans; and introducing 'mature or existing platforms' and augmenting them with autonomous systems. Work on all three lines of effort are underway, and for that third bucket, it includes penning new requirements for autonomous launchers that could lead to an eventual prototyping competition. That potential move comes as the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) has spent years developing its own Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML), an uncrewed M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. But as an internal development effort, the command is not in a position to produce enough AMLs for soldiers to test out and feed the requirements and acquisition decision cycle. 'I don't see DEVCOM as being the way to introduce larger numbers into formations in the near future: That will be how we leverage industry,' Crooks said. 'But it starts with refining that requirement, which we're in the process of [doing].' The next step, he explained, is inking an abbreviated capability development document (A-CDD) that essentially validates the need for a capability and could lead to a competitive rapid prototyping competition. While work on AML will be factored into that requirements process, so will observations from demos with alternative autonomous launchers being pitched by industry and set to be demoed at events like the upcoming Project Convergence Capstone 5 event. 'This is not all about not replacing humans with robots but how do you make existing formations more lethal with autonomous systems,' he said. While service priorities could change with new Army civilian leadership, such a future launcher may mean the service is not constrained by a 13-foot pod and could instead fire a new 'Affordable High-Speed Strike' missile slated for science and technology development in fiscal 2026. (The service previously referred to that weapon as the Precision Strike Missile Increment 5.) 'We're interested to see what we can achieve in terms of range, lethality on a surface fired missile that might be larger than 13 feet,' Crooks said. 'We don't know yet what a crewed system can accomplish in terms of its own tasks that we expect of it today … receive the mission, fire, resupply, all those associated tasks, and how much of that can they do and also control an autonomous system simultaneously,' Crooks said. 'It could be one-to-one. It could be one-to-N. We don't know what that is yet,' he added. While he didn’t dive into the specific unmanned launchers at the event to help answer those questions, the AML is expected to be on hand, potentially alongside two launchers under development by different industry teams. Lockheed Martin has been touting one such new launcher, and Raytheon confirmed it is working another one that will be at the Army event. 'Integration of autonomous vehicles into the military can lead to a future where operations are faster, safer and more adaptable,' Brian Burton, vice president of Precision Fires and Maneuver at Raytheon, wrote in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'Our innovative approach with multiple partners helps bring a next-gen solution that increases operational efficiency, crosses difficult terrain, enhances mission survivability and reduces risk to soldiers.' Crooks’s requirements team has also been closely following US Marine Corps progress on the smaller Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE Fires), a program ripe for 'collaboration,' he said. ROGUE Fires integrates the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) — a mountable, ground-based anti-ship missile launcher with two Naval Strike Missiles — onto the 2.5-ton class Joint Light Tactical Vehicle chassis instead of the five-ton Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) platform used for the AML. The USMC is also ramping up the weapon’s level of autonomy, announcing last month a new $30 million investment in autonomous navigation in the form of tech firm Forterra’s AutoDrive system. 'We think [AML] could be complimentary in some ways to what the Marine Corps is doing,' Crooks said, noting that some of the autonomous launchers share the same autonomy stack.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/eyeing-a-new-autonomous-launcher-prototyping-initiative-army-checking-out-industry-options/	2025-02-04T12:03:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AML1-e1738692850160.jpg
Turkish defense exports surge to $7.15B, up 29 percent from 2023	Kaplan MT tanks produced for Indonesia are ready for delivery as the first package of the project will be completed this year in Ankara, Turkiye on March 13, 2022. (Photo by Dogukan Keskinkilic/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Turkish defense sector saw a 29 percent growth in defense exports in 2024, amounting to $7.15 billion, according to President of Turkey's Defence Industry Agency Haluk Görgün. 'These figures reflect not only an economic success but also the vision of independence in the defense industry that Turkey has written on its own,' Gorgun said in post on X. He further stated that Turkey is 'building a strong defense industry for our friends and allies, and a groundbreaking ecosystem in technology exports for our future. We are working tirelessly for a Turkey that not only produces, but also designs, exports, and builds the future.' Turkey's biggest defense exporters include dronemaker Baykar, Turkish Aerospace Industries, ASFAT, armored vehicle producer MKE and ARCA, according to another post on X by Gorgun. Aselsan said in a statement that it signed export contracts with seven new countries worth $1 billion in 2024, 'a record high figure in its history.' Meanwhile, Baykar made $1.8 billion in revenue from exports, amounting to 90 percent of the firm’s total revenue, according to a statement from the company. 'In 2023, the company ranked among Türkiye’s top 10 exporters, achieving $1.8 billion in exports — a milestone it successfully repeated in 2024, further cementing its resounding success,' Baykar said. Turkey has been pushing to boost its defense production to decrease dependence on Western nations and firms that might be subjected to embargoes. 'Turkey saw the need for localization of defense innovation/production for strategic reasons and accelerated a campaign to invest in developing critical high-tech equipment encompassing a whole array of highly sophisticated platforms with homegrown weapon systems,' Serhat Süha Çubukçuoğlu, an expert at Trends Research &amp; Advisory in Abu Dhabi, told Breaking Defense today. The upsurge in defense exports could be due to 'Turkey’s localization of strategic industries including defense and Turkey’s economic instability and relatively small market size that prompts defense firms to aim entry into foreign markets,' he said. 'It helps Turkey to earn much needed foreign-currency denominated revenues to plug budget deficits, service foreign debt, and re-invest in R&amp;D. With a wider portfolio of clients the defense sector receives more demand and becomes financially more sustainable.' Çubukçuoğlu highlighted that while Turkey sources most of the standard, mid-grade equipment locally, 'critical dependencies on key components like jet engines, semiconductors, and naval propulsion technologies persist.' Turkey's 'commitment to self-reliance in defense technology is evident and this trend is set to continue in the coming decade,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/turkish-defense-exports-surge-to-7-15b-up-29-percent-from-2023/	2025-02-04T11:15:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230712_turkey_kaplan_tank_GettyImages-1239187201-scaled-e1689172760648.jpg
How Trump’s ‘Iron Dome for America’ upends four decades of nuclear doctrine	Rockets launched towards Israel from the northern Gaza Strip and response from the Israeli missile defense system known as the Iron Dome leave streaks through the sky on May 14, 2021 in Gaza City, Gaza. (Photo by Fatima Shbair/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — For 40 years America's missile defense framework has been based on two parallel concepts: First, that kinetic missile defense systems would be designed to physically stop missiles fired by a rogue nation like North Korea or Iran. And second, that those same systems would not be scaled to the level that the US could credibly defend the homeland against a barrage from Russia and China. It may seem counterintuitive, but the policy case is simple, if somewhat apocalyptic: only the threat of a world-ending nuclear response would keep those powers from launching, and if Moscow and Beijing felt the US could credibly hold them at threat while defending itself, it would cause those competitors to invest even more in nuclear weapons. And with the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump upended that balance, with the call for a vastly expanded missile defense system he's dubbed 'Iron Dome for America.' Trump's Jan. 27 executive order maintains that the US should 'deter' or 'defend' against 'any foreign aerial attack,' but goes a step further in calling on the Secretary of Defense to submit plans for 'Defense ... against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries[.]' The shift in US policy would be, in the words of a former US official involved in nuclear operations, a 'big change,' one that a bevy of experts interviewed by Breaking Defense say raises questions about the stability of nuclear arms control, the basic feasibility of such a plan and, particularly, how it will change the balance of power in space. Trump’s vision is 'even more bold' than former President Ronald Reagan’s 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program, the former official stressed. 'SDI was an R&amp;D program. This is: ‘come back to me in under 120 days with a plan for how you're going to deploy something.’ So, in that sense, it's very ambitious,' the former official said. Already, it has led to swift threats from Moscow. Discussion of a comprehensive missile defense shield for the US, especially one that includes space-based interceptors (SBIs) — long a nightmare scenario for Russian leaders worried about their nuclear deterrent — was enough for Russian Foreign Ministry official Grigory Mashkov to say any such move 'puts an end to the prospects of strategic offensive arms reduction and preservation of strategic stability on the previous terms.' 'It is not ruled out that in the current conditions of confrontation with the West, with its policy of inflicting strategic damage on Russia, we may face the need for moving away from restrictions on nuclear and missile arsenals in favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase,' he wrote in a Russian publication, according to a Jan. 30 report by the state media service TASS. Mashkov’s comments were tantamount to a threat that Moscow, in an effort to counter Trump’s plan, will bust through the caps placed on both US and Russian nuclear arsenals under the 2011 New START treaty. Asked to respond to Mashkov’s suggestion that Moscow may increase its nuclear arsenal, a White House official told Breaking Defense that 'President Trump is focused on ensuring Americans stay safe. Russia’s threats suggest this focus is well founded.' The State Department referred to a statement by Secretary Marco Rubio detailing the priorities and mission of the administration. Citing 'longstanding SOP [standard operating procedure],' a Pentagon spokesperson said 'we don’t discuss hypothetical situations' when asked the same. But with Trump’s executive order, that situation is much less hypothetical than at any point since the 1980s, seven experts told Breaking Defense. And while split on whether the risks of Trump's plan outweigh the benefits with regard to US nuclear security — and in particular whether a space-based capability is a good idea, or even feasible — all agreed on one thing: An American Iron Dome system would mean the global nuclear calculus will change dramatically. The fundamental policy argument with regard to homeland missile defense vice peer nuclear powers reflects long-standing differences within the US nuclear literati: does it improve the US ability to deter nuclear attack, or instead increase the likelihood of atomic armageddon? Ankit Panda, Stanton Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Breaking Defense that Moscow’s signature on New START was contingent on there being no fundamental change in Washington’s missile defense policy. 'The most essential principle of nuclear deterrence is the principle of an assured second strike, and Russia and China are going to ensure that as the United States seeks new types of missile defense modes, including space-based interceptors, they will have the means to retaliate and to penetrate,' Panda explained. Further, he said, both Russia and China might not simply move to increase their ICBM arsenals, but also find 'alternative' ways of delivering nuclear weapons, such as Russia’s Poseidon underwater autonomous torpedo. 'This [Iron Dome] doesn't solve the problem of vulnerability,' he argued. 'It simply gives America's adversaries incentives to adapt their own forces to ensure that they're able to assure their ability to retaliate.' Already, some of the longstanding arms control threads have frayed between the US and Russia. (China, while a signatory along with the other major nuclear powers of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that pledges them to reducing their arsenals over an unspecified time, has never signed up to bilateral arms control with the United States.) While Russia in February 2023 suspended its compliance with the treaty citing US and NATO support for Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin at the time still pledged to uphold New START’s weapons caps, refraining from a formal withdrawal. The treaty sets the following limits, according to the State Department website: Russia moving away from New Start, and its investments in alternative types of nuclear delivery mechanisms, means America is adhering to the old paradigm while ignoring reality, said Rebeccah Heinrichs, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and member of the bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission. 'The solution cannot be only offensive investments on the part of the US,' she said. 'It has to be defensive investments as well.' Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), argued: 'I think [the Trump order] is largely irrelevant in terms of arms control implications. Arms control is effectively dead already with China building out its arsenal at a rapid pace under no treaty constraints.' However, Tom Karako, head of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that some narratives are missing the larger strategic context. Efforts to preserve nuclear stability are 'old think' based on a paradigm that has disappeared, he said. On the other hand, he cautioned against those who are championing a 'faith-based' idea of an invulnerable shield against all missile threats against the US homeland, saying 'missile defense is hard. … They're not taking the threat seriously enough, is what I would say.' And nothing fits the description of a hard missile defense technology than the most controversial part of Trump’s executive order: space-based interceptors.

(Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory) Experts said it was no surprise that what caught Mashkov’s attention was the executive order’s call for space-based interceptors (SBIs), a technology that has long been a point of contention in the arms control community. The concept of space-based interceptors for hitting missiles in their boost phase seconds after launch was a central focus of Reagan’s SDI effort — hence its infamous 'Star Wars' nickname — and has been controversial ever since. Scientists then and now are at odds about not only the effects on nuclear stability, but also whether SBIs are affordable, technologically possible, and operationally sound. Further, in more recent years, the debate has broadened to include what impact SBIs might have on the risks of war in space. 'The pursuit of space-based interceptors is a blueprint for instability. History shows that chasing invulnerability only fuels arms races,' Jessica West of Canada’s Project Ploughshares said. 'The hard truth? SBI won’t shield us; it will spark a wave of new threats while offering limited real protection in return.' With regard to space war, the key issue is that Russia and China not only worry that SBIs will negate their nuclear deterrent, but that they also could be used to kill their satellites, opponents assert. Victoria Samson, a long-time missile defense analyst at the Secure World Foundation, said that the new order’s resurrection of SBIs will throw a monkey wrench into ongoing talks at the United Nations aimed at creating norms of responsible behavior in space — talks that the State Department and Pentagon helped lead under the Biden administration. 'These discussions are crucial for the future of space stability,' she told Breaking Defense. Other analysts point out that America’s adversaries are already deploying weapons on orbit. China, for example, has demonstrated a fractional orbital bombardment system, and American officials have accused Russia of plans to equip a satellite with a nuclear weapon. 'Our adversaries have not restrained themselves the way we would have liked over the last 40 years,' Heinrichs said. While emphasizing the US should not violate the principles of the Outer Space Treaty, which bans weapons of mass destruction in space, Heinrichs said that US space assets have to be protected, and not only by defensive measures. 'We have to … make sure that they know that the United States also has a kill capability in space,' Heinrichs stressed. But does it work? After all, Star Wars is famous not just for its nickname, but as a wildly expensive program that ultimately was a failure. Harrison, in a commentary on AEI’s website, said that while the technology wasn’t ready and the costs were way too high during the Reagan era, that is not the case today. Working SBIs can be deployed, and for a price that is not undoable, he maintained. What hasn’t changed, however, is that the laws of physics make the concept of operations for SBIs somewhat dubious, because of the large number of interceptors required even to defeat a small number of incoming enemy missiles, Harrison cautioned. 'The total cost to develop, build, and launch an initial constellation of 1,900 space-based interceptors would likely be on the order of $11 to $27 billion' — with the 'catch' that such a constellation could only take on 'a maximum of two missiles launched in a salvo,' he wrote. That means that if three missiles were launched simultaneously, at least one would get through, a problem that is known as 'absenteeism.' If China and Russia were to launch missiles at the US, one can safely assume it would be more than three. 'Do we really want to be investing in yet another type of weapon system that does not scale well with the threats we face?' Harrison told Breaking Defense. The Glide Phase Interceptor is the first system specifically designed to defeat hypersonic threats. (Raytheon graphic) While there is an argument to be made that a 'thin' layer of SBIs could be deployed specifically to cover Pacific latitudes to address the Chinese regional threat, Karako stressed that SBIs are not the end-all, be-all for missile defense. Missile defense and space warfare concepts have to be integrated into a larger defense strategy that includes protecting against modern technologies like hypersonic delivery systems and cruise missiles, he said. 'It’s about raising the threshold for the other guys to be able to cause damage and to inflict all manner of bad effects short of the perceived nuclear threshold,' he said. Doing so means using not just missile defenses but also weapons for 'missile defeat' — that is, taking out launch systems before any missiles actually take off. 'There's no one panacea. There's no one silver bullet. You have to do all the things,' Karako said. And therein lies the biggest question of all: what things can actually be achieved within the next four years — especially given that Trump’s plan goes way beyond SBIs to include 'an underlayer and terminal-phase intercept' systems, space-based sensors, long-range radars, and ‘non-kinetic’ capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks.' The former government official said that, given weapon development timelines, the only weapon systems that will be able to actually 'shoot down anything' during Trump’s current term are the ship-launched SM-3 Block 2A, being co-developed by the US and Japan, and US Army’s THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), which would form the Trump plan’s missile defense 'underlayer.' 'In the last year of the Trump administration, they had proposed a five-year spending plan for SM-3 and THAAD to integrate them into the GMD program. So this is something that the last Trump administration had in the works when they left,' the official said. Thus, the former official said, the wisest thing for the Defense Department is to put forward a research, development and testing plan to determine what pieces of the Trump executive order can be deployed by when. A key issue, of course, will be funding. And while the Pentagon and the US Space Force are expecting an increased budget, there still will need to be tradeoffs among many competing priorities. The question then becomes what priority the Iron Dome effort will be accorded in those budgetary food fights. 'Right now, we spend about one third of one percent of the defense budget on homeland missile defense, and I'm referring just to the GMD system,' for a total of about '$3 billion' a year, the former official said. 'If you believe that this is an important mission, why don't we raise this to say, one percent, of the DoD budget for homeland defense,' which would raise it to around $8 billion in total. At this level of spending, the Trump administration 'could do just about everything' in the Iron Dome plan, the former official said, but stressed that it is 'a lot of money. … I think they're in for a rude awakening, if you will, with the numbers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/how-trumps-iron-dome-for-america-upends-four-decades-of-nuclear-doctrine/	2025-02-04T09:59:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220113_israel_iron_dome_GettyImages-1232873450-1-scaled-e1642095709377.jpg

Marine Corps cutting F-35B buy for more F-35Cs: New aviation plan	An F-35B lands aboard Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) for the first time on Oct. 20, 2024. (Photo by Cmdr. Darin Russell.) WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps is shifting the balance of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters it intends to buy, opting to purchase dozens more carrier-based variants in lieu of the short-take-off and vertical landing variant, according to the service’s new 2025 aviation plan. Moving forward, the Marines plan to buy a total of 280 F-35Bs rather than their previous objective of 353 aircraft. In turn, the service will purchase 140 F-35Cs rather than the previous objective of 67 F-35Cs. The total procurement objective of 420 F-35s remains the same. 'Per the TACAIR Transition plan, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (VMFA) and VMFA-323, VMFA-112, and VMFA-134 will now transition as F-35C squadrons. The program of record now includes 280 F-35Bs and 140 F-35Cs to support 12 F-35B squadrons and 8 F-35C squadrons,' according to the document, published Monday and signed out by Lt. Gen. Bradford Gering, the deputy commandant for aviation. The new aviation plan states 183 F-35Bs and 52 F-35Cs have been delivered to the service thus far. The aviation plan acts as a high-level roadmap detailing the Marine Corps’ plans for its various platforms. Central to this new plan is the inclusion of 'Project Eagle,' a multi-phase initiative spanning through 2040 that focuses on projects such as new warfighting concepts as well as the implementation of artificial intelligence. 'What Project Eagle does for us, as we look across three [future years defense programs] is it shows us where the trade space is,' Gering said last year. The US Air Force has for years set its sights on buying 1,763 F-35As, a number that former Secretary Frank Kendall suggested before leaving office should be revisited down the road. The US Navy intends to buy 273 F-35Cs. After publication of this report, F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin said in a statement that 'We support the U.S. Marine Corps’ decision to adjust to an F-35 fleet configuration that best allows them to fulfill their critical missions with the world’s most advanced aircraft.' Meanwhile, the F-35 program is still plagued by a series of issues, from lagging readiness to sluggish software development, the Pentagon’s top weapons tester found in a recent report. A leading issue for the tri-variant stealth fighter is its disappointing availability — measured by mission capable rates, meaning a jet could perform one of its assigned missions, or fully mission capable rates, meaning it can execute all of them — a critical issue for officials and a focus of a 'War on Readiness' launched by the program in 2023. Despite concerted effort spanning several years, results have been mixed, according to a chart included in the report. The conventional takeoff and landing F-35A has seen declines in its mission capable and fully mission capable rates in recent years, which are well below targets. The short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B saw its mission capable rate decline and its fully mission capable rate plateau, where both metrics are still below objectives. Only the carrier-launched F-35C has seen measurable improvement, as its mission capable rate remained largely flat and its fully mission capable rate inched up, but both key measurements are also beneath program goals. Another central problem for the program is software development, a key reason why officials previously took the unprecedented step of halting deliveries for a full year amid difficulties with a new upgrade known as Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3). According to the report, in some cases the program 'has shown no improvement in meeting schedule and performance timelines for developing and testing software designed to address deficiencies and add new capabilities.' Jets currently flying with the TR-3 upgrade are restricted to training, and officials are striving to ensure full combat capability can be delivered this year. Still, the program likely will not begin 'dedicated operational testing' of the full TR-3 enhancement until 'mid to late FY26, approximately two years after the configuration began delivery to the field,' the report says. And even after years of production, military customers are still discovering quality escapes with aircraft, which the report notes should have been identified during the acceptance process. But there have been improvements in the manufacturing process as well: According to the report, the program has achieved a 47 percent reduction in scrap, rework, and repair time as well as a 63 percent reduction in quality escapes discovered from the aircraft’s production line between 2016 and 2023. The program has also generally improved upon some reliability metrics in recent years, indicating advances like more sturdy parts that don’t need to be removed as frequently. A spokesperson for Lockheed said in a statement that 'Delivering the highest quality to the warfighter is foundational to our Lockheed Martin culture, and we remain focused on achieving 100% quality each and every day.' Regarding mission capable rates, the spokesperson said the aircraft 'has demonstrated high combat and deployed readiness since data was collected for this report, in some cases more than five years ago.' They added that information in the DOT&amp;E report is 'dated,' and that quality escapes could entail 'minor items such as an incorrect serial number on paperwork.' The spokesperson also pointed to a previously announced internal investment of over $350 million to boost the program. 'These investments will enhance fidelity and capacity across our development, integration, and test labs, ultimately enabling us to shift defect discovery to the left,' they said. In a statement, the head of the F-35 program, Air Force Lt. Gen. Mike Schmidt, said the report 'highlights shortcomings without adequately addressing the corrective actions the JPO has taken to address the challenges. Every observation requires — and has received — a response from the JPO, and we have made tangible progress in remediating the issues in the report.' Readiness is weighed down by what the program calls 'degraders,' which can be factors like supply chain issues. Over the past year, according to Schmidt, the program has eliminated 20 of these degraders, though a 'small number' of remaining degraders 'mask tremendous progress that’s been made.' Additionally, Schmidt noted that deployed and operational aircraft achieve higher mission capable rates than the fleet when measured as a whole, though he acknowledged that 'overall readiness rates remain unacceptable.' Regarding TR-3, Schmidt said, 'We are aggressively implementing comprehensive test plans to ensure this critical upgrade delivers cutting-edge capabilities to the warfighter.' 'While there is always room for improvement, the steps we have taken reinforce our dedication to providing the capabilities our warfighters need,' Schmidt said. 'The F-35 program remains the cornerstone of our nation’s air superiority, and this report underscores both our accomplishments and areas for continued growth.'

(Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) Elsewhere in the aviation plan, the Marines detailed several planned upgrades and modifications to its MV-22 fleet in the years ahead to better position the fleet to foresee material failures before they disrupt operations. Those changes include the VeCToR upgrade, which deals with a number of obsolescence issues inside the cockpit; a new modernization plan, dubbed ReVAMP, to 'ensure platform relevance' until the end of the aircraft’s service life; and redesigning the flight control computer. With respect to the proprotor gearbox, which has been the focus of numerous mishaps in recent years involving the Osprey, the aviation plan states the Marines will 'install sensors in critical areas of the PRGB and drive train to provide vibration signature data that will allow maintenance to forecast the failure of parts and plan to remove those parts prior to failure.' 'A more refined Triple-Melt steel will be the source material for the internal components of the PRGB which will drastically reduce the likelihood of material defects in critical gears and bearings,' according to the document. 'A redesigned Input Quill Assembly (IQA) will reduce the incidence of the wearout mode observed in previous IQA failures that led to aircraft Hard Clutch Engagement (HCE) occurrences.' UPDATED 2/4/25 at 12:06 pm with a statement from Lockheed Martin addressing the Marines' new aviation plan.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/marine-corps-cutting-f-35b-buy-for-more-f-35cs-new-aviation-plan/	2025-02-04T08:08:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8708105-scaled-e1729541848808.jpg
Baltic Sentry mission could provide proving ground for NATO’s underwater drones	Standing NATO Maritime Group One trains with Finnish FNS Hanko during a 2017 passing exercise in the Baltic Sea. (FRAN CPO Christian Valverde) This is the latest in a series of semi-regular columns by Robbin Laird, where he will tackle current defense issues through the lens of more than 45 years of defense expertise in both the US and abroad. The goal of these columns: to look back at how questions and perspectives of the past should inform decisions being made today. NATO has formed a new Baltic Sentry effort to deal with threats to the NATO nations surrounding the Baltic Sea from the Russians. And while the challenge is real, there is significant opportunity for innovation in shaping a new paradigm in maritime operations. Currently, I am in Europe and had a chance to discuss this opportunity with Torben Mikkelsen, former head of the Danish navy and a well-respected innovator in maritime affairs. His key point: 'Baltic Sentry' could serve as a forcing function to get these nations focused on integrating uncrewed systems, notably automated ones, to deliver the basic ISR needed for a mission which encompasses both underwater and above water surveillance. 'These systems could be launched from shore, air dropped or launched from manned vessels. In fact, learning how to work multiple platforms and locational launch points in a mesh consisting of manned and unmanned platforms and systems would be an important part of preparing for any future crisis in the Baltic Sea region. 'NATO needs to start from the ground up with a new approach built on how a combination of manned ship platforms with payloads of uncrewed systems could deliver the desired results in the entire spectrum of conflict, and the Baltic Sea is a very good ‘naval laboratory’ to use for exactly that,' Mikkelsen said. 'It is important to ensure that we can deliver the needed effects both now, when operating without a direct threat, and in a wartime scenario which is congested with hostile unmanned effects in all domains. In the latter situation the interest in operating with manned assets will be very low. 'It is about being able to transform the needed effects between manned and unmanned assets and to be able to use such in the right combination in line with the current threat and that signal you want to send to the opponent,' he added. We also discussed the fact that NATO has a shortage of manned ships and personnel, which will not end any time soon, and that using autonomous systems provided a significant innovation path to get the desired effects one wanted with much less operational personnel. And with maritime autonomous systems, the personnel would not even have to be in the military but could be private contractors as well. With the European states surrounding the Baltic Sea all now part of NATO there was the important opportunity to learn how to operate these new systems together and to share the data generated from them. As Mikkelsen put it: 'If we do this right, then we will be able to share military payloads amongst those nations.' It is a question of both technological and organizational change which is entailed in a new approach to managing Baltic security. The time to learn to do so is now, and not when in the midst of a crisis. (I will be publishing a book later this year addressing the question of the nature of the paradigm shift in maritime operations.) Mikkelsen’s last job was as Denmark’s executive director for Navy programs at Defence Command, where he was laser focused on building a new generation of modular ships which were designed with the engagement of autonomous systems in mind. The Danes, like others, are focused on building capital ships which function as 'motherships' that are tied inherently into unmanned operations. The question then, he asked: 'How much autonomous military payload can the mothership carry? And [can] that mothership platform [also be] remotely controlled in case of full-scale war?' He underscored the similarities between the Black Sea with the Baltic and felt that the experiences of the Ukrainians and Russians there would clearly be deeply imprinted on the Russian mind. The irony could be that the Russians learned faster from the Ukraine war about maritime operations than NATO, and now NATO needs to adjust its own thinking. The Ukrainian example of using remotely piloted USVs to significantly impact maritime operations has led to Ukrainian interest in such a concept as well. If the Russians have learned the value of these new systems taught to them by the Ukrainians, why would NATO drag its feet on learning to use them as part of its combat force? The Baltic Sentry effort is a perfect place to start.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/baltic-sentry-mission-could-provide-proving-ground-for-natos-underwater-drones/	2025-02-04T07:15:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/finland_navy-scaled-e1680813959198.jpg
North Korea welcomes Trump back with ‘strategic’ cruise missile test: What’s next?	A Yonhap news TV broadcast shows test-firing of a sea-based (underwater) ground-to-ground strategic cruise guided missile in North Korea. (Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SYDNEY — North Korea's test launch of a 'strategic' underwater-launched cruise missile within a week of President Donald Trump's inauguration brought back into the spotlight a key geopolitical relationship from Trump's first term: How he will approach North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The American president's relationship with Kim was a source of soundbites and drama between 2017 and 2021. It was the origin of 'fury and fire' as a nuclear crisis between the two countries escalated in 2017. It was also the core of Trump's 2019 meeting at the DMZ, when Trump became the first US leader to step foot into North Korean territory. And this last week, Trump said he would reach back out to Kim, saying of the dictator, 'He liked me.' But while that relationship warmed over Trump's term, North Korea has a tendency to want to make sure it's seen on the world stage with proverbial fireworks — or as close to proverbial as one can get when it involves missile launches. Which means the Jan. 25 launch, which was 'succesfu' according to the Korean Central News Agency, could very well have been timed to catch the attention of the newly-sworn-in American leader. Experts seem to agree that Kim is in a much stronger position than he was when Trump was first elected in 2016, a reality that will impact how Washington and Pyongyang interact in the coming years. Meanwhile, they say, the American president is much more likely to press ahead on ending the war in Ukraine, pursuing Chinese tariffs and domestic priorities before pressing ahead with efforts to reshape relations with Kim. Start with the situation in North Korea itself. Kim has repositioned his country over the least year, scrapping all cooperation with the South and declaring his country was on a war footing. 'Kim has already signaled a change in state policy vis a vis South Korea, to turn away from any sort of reunification and instead to prepare the DPRK military for war. So his military build up will continue, including investing in advanced missile capabilities,' Malcolm Davis, an expert on the Indo-Pacific at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in Canberra said in an email, 'These include a range of delivery systems for tactical and strategic nuclear forces, including hypersonic weapons, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.' What has long been the unachieved goal of the West — North Korea abandoning nuclear weapons and allowing inspections of its facilities to prove it — is unlikely to happen, both Davis and Leonid Petrov, a North Korea expert at the Australian National University in Canberra, told Breaking Defense. 'From Donald Trump's point of view, he's not going to gain anything by denuclearizing North Korea. North Korea is not posing any plausible threat to US territory,' Petrov said. 'Yes, it can create trouble to South Korea, to Japan, to US bases in the Pacific, but that's probably it. I don't think North Korea is actually a threat, any threat to the US homeland.' The CIA's former deputy division chief for Korea, Bruce Klingner, said last week that there are conflicting signals coming from the Trump administration towards Pyongyang in its early days. 'Everyone has to be prepared for a wide variety of course changes and high speed changes. And we'll just have to wait and see on some of these,' the Heritage Foundation expert said during an event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Michael Allen, a former National Security aide to George W. Bush and managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, noted on the CSIS panel that Trump's comment about talking to Kim was in reaction to a question. 'I don't hear him proactively raising this issue,' he said. Allen added that Trump 'may have made the assessment that a deal is just not possible.' He said he didn't know if talks with North Korea are 'going to be a big thrust of what President Trump wants to be able to do, because I think a lot of people look at this and they say, this is a huge problem.' Part of that problem is how to manage US and allied relations with the isolated leader. 'As for how Trump and US allies &#8216;manage Kim' — I don't think they do. Trump may be tempted to do a summit, but he'll get nothing out of it, and probably come under pressure to make concessions,' Davis said. He noted that South Korea, under disgraced leader Yoon Suk Yeol had discussed the need for nuclear weapons. Now that he appears likely be removed from office and the opposition opposes nuclear weapons and favors engagements with Pyongyang, Davis says the situation grows even more complicated for Trump. But perhaps the biggest change in Kim's posture is not an internal shift, but a new powerful friend: Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Petrov pointed to the fact that 'things have changed dramatically,' since Trump stepped briefly into Kim's country, thanks to Putin serving as Kim's new 'benefactor &#8230; Putin gives them money and technology and protection.' Of course, it's not been free. Kim has sent at least 11,000 North Korean troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. In return, Kim is getting billions of dollars in advanced weapons, food and oil from Russia. 'He already has secured his regime through Russia's commitment to secure it, and North Korea will get enough technology and recognition and sanctions can be diverted through Russian border and the Chinese border,' Petrov said. For his part, Kim followed the missile test up with a Jan. 29 visit to a nuclear weapons facility, which he praised for 'epochal successes' in producing material for nuclear weapons and 'strengthening the nuclear shield of the country,' the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. Kim said 2025 will be 'a watershed year' for improving his nuclear forces. So, about that missile&#8230; Perhaps the most important question is whether this cruise missile can carry a nuclear warhead. North Korea has claimed it has a warhead that is small enough to fit onto the weapon, but like so many things about North Korea, no one is really sure. 'The DPRK has shown several purported nuclear weapons. In 2016 and 2017 they showed two designs in relation to ballistic missiles. It is unclear whether these were real, but in any case they were too large to fit inside a cruise missile. However, more recently, in March 2023, they unveiled the much smaller &#8216;Hwasan-31' nuclear warhead. This would fit inside a cruise missile,' Ralph Savelsberg, a missile expert with the Netherlands Defence Academy said, adding that he 'cannot assess whether these are real, though.' The KCNA announcement of the launch, published in English late on Jan. 26, included alleged details of the test, which it says Kim watched. 'Based on the press statement, the missile flew 1,500 km,' Savelsberg said. 'If that is its range, when launched from the DPRK, that would put all of Japan, including Okinawa, in range. If it can indeed be launched from a submarine, depending on the range of the submarine, it could threaten Guam. They claim to have launched a nuclear submarine in September 2023 and that could theoretically even threaten Hawaii or the US West Coast.' In some ways a smaller missile like this poses a more difficult threat to the US, South Korea, Japan and other countries in range because cruise missiles are 'difficult to defend against. They don't fly as fast as a ballistic missile, but they are small and fly at low altitudes, which makes them difficult to detect. Furthermore, they can fly an unpredictable path and thus attack from a direction which you might not anticipate,' Savelsberg said. One of the interesting tidbits in Pyongyang's news story is that 'the test-fire had no negative impact on the security of the neighboring countries.' According to Savelsberg, the North Koreans 'seem to fly them in circles or figure-8 patterns, in order not to overfly any of their neighbors.' That may be a clear indicator of how much North Korea wants to remind the world of its weapons without sparking serious reactions to its actions. Yonhap, South Korea's semi-official news agency, said the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a text message to reporters saying that, 'Detailed specifications are currently being closely analyzed by the intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States.' No statements or comments have been made by US Indo-Pacific Command since the launch. Breaking Defense requested comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/north-korea-welcomes-trump-back-with-strategic-cruise-missile-test-whats-next/	2025-02-04T04:52:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250129_nk_missile_launch_GettyImages-2195386955-e1738160480944.jpg
Pentagon weapons tester highlights delays for B-52, 3DELRR radars	A US Air Force B-52H Stratofortress and a Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet fly over the Northern Territory during Exercise Talisman Sabre 23. Credit: Australian MoD WASHINGTON — The Air Force is pushing back its schedule for modernizing the Eisenhower-era B-52 Stratofortress with a new radar by a year amid integration challenges, according to a new report by the US military’s top weapons tester. A two-stage Milestone C decision — the beginning of a program’s production phase that in this case signifies when the first bombers will get new radars — for the B-52 Radar Modernization Program is now planned for fiscal 2026, in the second and fourth quarters, according to the Jan. 31 report [PDF] from the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E). The dates are somewhat notional, as the report states that '[e]xact dates are uncertain due to technical and schedule risks.' However, last year’s DOT&amp;E report [PDF] found the decision points were previously planned for the same quarters in FY25, pointing to a full-year delay. The two-part milestone C decision calls for modifying a total of 28 aircraft, roughly a third of the B-52 fleet, with the new radar, the DOT&amp;E report says. A full-rate production decision for the remaining 48 aircraft set to be outfitted with the new radar will then follow initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E), now slated to kick off in FY28. Delays for the radar effort largely stem from 'integration issues,' the DOT&amp;E report says, leading the Air Force to 'refine' the design of the aircraft’s radome, or the housing for the radar. The radar program is part of a larger overall effort to modernize the B-52, which includes fielding new engines for the decades-old Stratofortress. Boeing is the prime contractor for both efforts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RTX, which supplies the updated radar, and the Air Force similarly did not immediately reply. Air Force officials in August warned that costs are rising and schedules slipping for the overall modernization effort of the B-52 a platform that will continue to play an integral role in the service’s bomber force structure and likely continue to fly into the 2060s. Service leaders revealed then that the price tag for the bomber’s new radar in particular was projected to jump from $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion. The report found similar delays for a project to deploy a new radar that can detect and track airborne targets like aircraft and ballistic missiles, known as the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR). The radar plugs into a mobile command and control center the Air Force can use in theater. Fielding the 3DELRR system has been a long-running saga for the service, which booted previous contractor RTX from the program and offered a new deal to Lockheed Martin in 2022. Lockheed’s AN/TPY-4(V)1 radar is now planned to replace the legacy TPS-75. But the program is still experiencing schedule hiccups owing to testing and production delays, the report says. Last year’s DOT&amp;E report found that developmental testing was slated to begin in 2Q FY24, but this year’s report now projects it will begin in 2Q FY25. The report found similar delays for IOT&amp;E, previously set to begin in 3Q FY25 but now is set for 1Q FY26. The Air Force and Lockheed Martin did not immediately respond when asked about the schedule slips.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-weapons-tester-highlights-delays-for-b-52-3delrr-radars/	2025-02-03T13:19:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/B-52-and-RAAF-F-18-Talisman-Sabre-2023-scaled-e1691500489687.jpg
Missile Defense Agency asks industry for American ‘Iron Dome’ concepts	Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS). (Northrop Grumman image) WASHINGTON — The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has issued a call for industry ideas on how it can implement President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 'Iron Dome for America' Executive Order — a surprisingly fast turn around on a Pentagon program. The Request for Information (RF) comes just four days after Trump's order mandated Pentagon development of a comprehensive 'shield' to repel any aerial attack on the US homeland. The RFI asks interested vendors to show and tell relevant capabilities by Feb. 28. The request to industry is structured to be open to a wide range of ideas, as it seeks details on what capabilities can be 'delivered or demonstrated' in two-year 'epochs': not later than Dec. 31, 2026; Dec. 31, 2028; Dec. 31, 2030 and 'beyond' Dec. 31, 2030. MDA is 'conducting market research to assist in the identification of innovative missile defense technologies (system-level, component level, and upgrades) architectures, concepts, and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to detect and defeat the threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks,' the RFI elaborates. 'MDA desires to collaborate with Industry on potential concepts to deploy and maintain a next-generation missile defense shield that will deter and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland and guarantee its secure second-strike capability,' it adds. The list of technologies of interest reads as a cut-and-paste of the Trump executive order: Interestingly, the RFI indicates MDA would take charge of deploying the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), rather than the Space Development Agency (SDA). The fate of the HBTSS — which uses a medium-field-of-view camera optimized to provide high-fidelity missile tracking capable of providing targeting coordinates to anti-missile interceptors — has been the subject of a years-long tug-of-war between the two agencies. MDA originally developed the sensor to help target its new Glide Phase Interceptor for knocking hypersonic missiles out of the sky. But SDA effectively killed the HBTSS program after the first two test satellites were launched last February, absorbing some of the technology into its own designs for new 'fire-control capable' infrared sensors. Thus, the Trump executive order breathes life back into the HBTSS program, and MDA has re-claimed control of it in the RFI. As things stand today, however, SDA has no plans to integrate the two HBTSS sensors into its Tracking Layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture — which begs the question of once HBTSS is developed how will it be deployed and operated so as to work with SDA's Tracking Layer satellites and ground systems? Another unanswered question is which Defense Department organization will operate the future space-based and directed-energy interceptors to be developed by MDA as part of the Iron Dome plan. The Ground-Based Interceptors that make up the sharp end of the Defense Department's Ground-based Midcourse Defense System are 'administered' by MDA (to include funding for upgrades) but the Army has operational control in support of US Northern Command. Further, both the Air Force and now the Space Force provide support functions to the overarching system. That long-standing arrangement also will apply to the Next-Generation Interceptor replacement program. However, US Space Command is now responsible under the Unified Command Plan for operations in space, with its 'area of responsibility' defined as extending from 100 kilometers above the Earth to, in theory, infinity. The command also serves as the Joint Force Global Sensor Manager, and operates the current Space-Based Infrared System constellation of missile warning satellites. And while the Space Force supplies the bulk of personnel to SPACECOM to conduct operations, the other services also all provide space specialists and capabilities. The defense community may not have to wait for answers. Under the executive order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has until March 28 to submit 'a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield' — a task that is being spearheaded by John Hill in his role performing the duties of the assistant secretary of defense for space policy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/missile-defense-agency-asks-industry-for-american-iron-dome-concepts/	2025-02-03T11:44:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Hypersonic-and-Ballistic-Tracking-Space-Sensor-Northrop-Grumman-image-.jpeg
Saudi Arabia increases defense spending to $78B in 2025	The GAMI stand seen at World Defense Show 2024. (Agnes Helou/Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has allocated $78 billion for defense spending in 2025, up from $75.8 billion spent in 2024, Governor of the General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI) Ahmad Al-Ohali said in a statement Saturday. 'The Kingdom allocated approximately $78 billion to the military sector in the 2025 budget, which constitutes 21% of total government spending and 7.1% of Saudi Arabia’s gross product,' he said, according to the statement. The statement further noted that the Kingdom has witnessed a 4.5 percent annual defense growth since 1960, adding that it has become the fifth largest defense spender worldwide and the largest in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, historically one of the largest defense importers worldwide, is concentrating heavily on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, which was launched in 2016. It aims to decrease the Kingdom’s dependence of the oil sector and boost other sectors based on national production. Vision 2030 has a set goal of localizing 50 percent of all defense spending by 2030, and has been pushing defense firms to open regional headquarters in the Kingdom. 'I am really confident that by 2030 we will reach 50 percent [localization], [even] more than 50 percent,'Al-Ohali told Breaking Defense in February 2024. The localization rate of military industries reached 19.35 percent at the end of 2023, according to the statement. 'The Authority's vision is to develop a sustainable military industries sector that enhances the readiness of military equipment and contributes significantly to the national economy,' Al-Ohali said on Saturday, according to a translated post on X. GAMI, which is the contracting authority for the Saudi MOD, launched in October 2023 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' section on its official website with the goal of pointing international firms to areas of opportunity to invest in the Kingdom. During his speech on Saturday, Al-Ohali highlighted that there are 74 opportunities within Saudi supply chains for military industries, 'identifying 30 opportunities as a priority, representing about 80% of the total future expenditures on supply chains,' per the post on X.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saudi-arabia-increases-defense-spending-to-78b-in-2025/	2025-02-03T11:27:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/426321683_2247560928782093_3567854556366620292_n-e1707316197608.jpg
Rep. Bacon: Enough talking about defense innovation. It’s time to make choices and move out.	Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., makes his way a House Republican Conference meeting in the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, October 19, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) As we begin the 119th Congress and a new presidential administration, a narrow window of opportunity exists to accelerate Department of Defense technology development and deliver a decisive advantage to the United States as it confronts mounting security challenges in the twenty-first century. As chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Cyber, IT, and Innovation, I believe we must take this opportunity to act with urgency to prepare our military to win the future. But first: We in Congress, the executive branch, and industry must stop hiding behind the word 'innovation.' We must move beyond innovation theater and recycled talking points about technology transition. We need real warfighting capabilities, clear-cut ways and means to achieve them, and streamlined resourcing to make it happen on a timeline relevant to the speed of battle and pace of technological change. The time to admire the problem has passed. Now is the time to procure and produce. As I learned in my 30-year military career, success in any complex task depends on starting with a well-defined desired end state. It may sound simple, but without explicit objectives, we cannot achieve useful results. I implore the new DoD leadership to state quickly and plainly the biggest operational challenges the armed forces must solve. Flowing from these objectives, the department must clearly define the priority capabilities and supporting technologies our warfighters require to deter and — if necessary — defeat adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran. To deliver results, Congress must have a clear, unambiguous, and prioritized demand signal in areas like biotechnology, quantum, directed energy, nuclear command and control, missile defense, and more. Armed with these prioritized operational needs, capabilities and technologies, Congress will be able to work collaboratively to authorize and resource the actions necessary to deliver. If ongoing research and development is duplicative, or if it does not aim to solve an operational challenge posed by great power competition, DoD must reassess whether these taxpayer research dollars can be better spent. Ruthless prioritization and focus must be the order of the day. Once our direction of travel is set, DoD must effectively partner with industry and academia to develop and field critical technologies at increased speed and reduced cost to the US taxpayer. If industry is already committing private capital towards critical technologies, the department must focus resources elsewhere and avoid duplication of effort to maximize the power of government and commercial research investments working in tandem. There is absolutely a role for bespoke DoD research and development, particularly for specialized military problems for which there is no commercial market. This is where the military service research labs and national laboratories excel. But, unlike the recent past where DoD was the leading investor in science and technology, the paradigm has shifted. US commercial investment now vastly exceeds the US government in dollars spent on research and development. DoD must harness this and leverage it as the strategic national asset that it is. And Congress can help ensure taxpayer dollars are being invested in essential military R&amp;D, while leveraging the billions of dollars invested by industry for internal R&amp;D that can also help solve military problems. Time and time again, DoD and Congress reinvent the wheel with strategies and roadmaps for critical technology areas, and what do we really have to show for it? America can no longer afford the time and expense of producing pages and pages of strategies, pilot programs, and technology demonstration and experimentation efforts, with no meaningful follow-on production contracts or capabilities delivered to warfighters at scale. This cycle must end. In this moment we need clearly defined operational problems to solve, explicit capabilities developed to meet those challenges, clear-cut funding and contracting mechanisms, and a culture that is willing to move fast, take risks, and deliver solutions. Fortune favors the bold and it’s time to get to work. Don Bacon is a US representative for the 2nd District of Nebraska and Chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Cyber, Information Technologies and Innovation.

Eyal Zamir, well known to industry, named Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff	The Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir (Center), in mid-January signing the first contract under the U.S. aid package given during the recent war. (Israel Ministry of Defense.) JERUSALEM — Israel’s Minister of Defense Israel Katz has tapped Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir to be the new Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, the government here announced Feb. 1. Zamir will take up his post after serving for two years as Director General at Israel’s Ministry of Defense, a role in which he interfaced regularly with the Israeli defense industry. He will replace Herzi Halevi as Israel’s top officer. Halevi, who assumed his role in January 2023, announced on Jan. 21 that he stepping down; as the commanding general during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas, Halevi had come under increasing pressure over the military’s failures to protect Israel from the attack. 'I congratulate Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir on his appointment as the 24th Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces. I have known Eyal for many years, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF forward in the face of the challenges ahead,' Halevi said in a statement. 'In the coming weeks, we will complete a professional and high-quality transfer of command over the IDF.' It was not clear from the statement if Halevi’s desire to leave in March may be moved up now that a successor has been appointed. Zamir was born in 1966 and joined the IDF in 1984, serving in the Armored Corps during the First and Second Intifadas. We was eventually named the commander of the 36th Division, which includes the IDF’s 7th Armored and 188th Armored as well as Golani Infantry, making it one of the most powerful, and tank heavy, of the IDF’s regular divisions. In the last decade and a half Zamir served as Military Secretary to the Prime Minister, and later as head of IDF Southern Command. During his time at Southern Command, he faced off against increasing threats from Gaza in 2018 when there were increased protests along the Gaza border fence. Given those high profile roles, he was seen as a candidate for Chief of Staff twice before: he lost out to Aviv Kochavi in 2018 and then Halevi in 2023. As a consolation prize, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff under Kochavi and then moved to the Defense Ministry in 2023. In that role, he played a key role in the IDF’s formulation of the Momentum multi-year plan. This plan was supposed to streamline the IDF’s ability to confront Hamas and Hezbollah in case of a ground war, making the IDF more effective and lethal in multiple domains using the latest technology — though the nature of the conflict since Oct. 7 has raised questions about whether that approach was the correct one. Zamir’s background in the armored corps is unique for a chief of staff. Halevi, Kochavi, Benny Gantz, Moshe Yaalon and Shaul Mofaz were paratroopers, while Gadi Eizenkot and Gabi Ashkenazi came from Golani infantry backgrounds. Industry may find someone who is very open to their new ideas. Zamir played a key role in many of the defense industry deals since the beginning of the war, such as procuring more munitions and interceptors for Israel’s air defenses, and investing in 'Blue and White' Israeli local industries to produce material. One of the most recent deals Zamir played a role in was the first contract signed under the new US aid package, which includes, which a dedicated $5.2 billion allocation to strengthen Israel’s air and missile defense systems. The CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries, Boaz Levy, put out a statement in the wake of Zamir’s appointment, saying 'We would like to thank Maj. Gen. (Res.) Zamir for the fruitful cooperation during his tenure as Director General of the Ministry of Defense, which helped lay additional foundations for ensuring the security of the State of Israel.' Zamir is believed to have beaten out two other top officers for the role, both of whom quickly issued statements of support. IDF Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, said 'I have no doubt that he will excel in this role, demonstrating the necessary combat leadership and strategic vision given the current challenges. I will assist my commanders in the preparation and transition process as needed, and I wish Eyal a smooth and successful entry into this important position.' Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai, the IDF’s head of the ground forces, also congratulated Zamir. 'From my many years of acquaintance with Eyal, I can attest that he is an experienced and excellent officer, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF successfully through the many challenges of this time,' Yadai said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/eyal-zamir-well-known-to-industry-named-israeli-defense-forces-chief-of-staff/	2025-02-03T00:22:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Zamir_center.png
With Foreign Military Financing paused, Lebanese forces wait on promised funds	The Lebanese Army is deployed on the ground as search operations continue at the site of the israeli strike in Basta, Central Beirut. According to the rescue teams on the ground, this bombing killed at least 15 people and around 35 are still missing. November 23 2024. (Photo by Nael Chahine / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) (Photo by NAEL CHAHINE/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As the Lebanese Armed Forces try to keep up their end of the ceasefire deal, a large pot of funds meant to enhance their equipment is tied up in Washington. At the end of the Biden administration, there were public reports the State Department planned to shift $95 million in Foreign Military Funding (FMF) from Egypt to Lebanon. The office of Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, R-Fla., who chairs the House appropriations subcommittee in charge of foreign aid, confirmed to Breaking Defense that the Biden team successfully shifted that money. But the funds are now held up as part of a broader State Department freeze on foreign aid ordered by Trump administration Secretary of State Marco Rubio. FMF is money the US government gives to other nations in order to build up their national security capabilities. FMF is required to be spent only on US-made goods, meaning the money from Washington flows out to foreign capitals and then back into the US defense industry. While FMF totals for many countries are relatively small, 'a little can go a long way,' according to Tressa Guenov of the Atlantic Council. 'It is one tool as a bulwark against influence from adversaries and competitors who may be looking to also sell their wares to key partners that may be under pressure from lots of different power sources from around the world,' Guenov, who served principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs from 2022 to 2024, told Breaking Defense. At a tactical level, she also noted that getting countries onto American kit helps with interoperability, especially with counter-terrorism and border security issues many of these countries are facing. In the case of Lebanon, the Biden team wanted to show support for the new government formed just weeks ago, and to provide military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces as they try to secure territory formerly held by Hezbollah and, later, by invading Israeli forces. Transferring that money from Egypt’s standing FMF pot to Lebanon was seen as the easiest way to get that aid underway. 'Additional FMF will further enable the LAF to secure the South Litani area, implement UNSCR 1701, and signal strong U.S. commitment to advancing the U.S.-brokered agreement to partners who may be considering increasing assistance to the LAF,' a State Department official told Breaking Defense in early January, speaking on background before the Biden administration left office. 'Supporting the LAF to exert sovereignty across all of Lebanon will constrain the malign activities of Hizballah and their Iranian backers both in Lebanon and their destabilizing activities across the globe.' However, one of Rubio's first moves after arriving in Foggy Bottom was 'initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda,' according to department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce. While the scale of the global assistance pause is different from previous administrations, it’s not unheard of for a new administration to pause and review foreign security assistance programs when coming into office. The first Trump administration did so under then-secretary Rex Tillerson, and when the Biden administration came into office, it froze sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of a review. It's also unclear exactly how much FMF is actually available to be frozen. According to Diaz-Balart’s office, the total FMF appropriated for FY24 was $6.1 billion. But with the confusion about the budget — the government is operating under a continuing resolution, essentially stretching FY24 out six months — it is possible that a significant portion of that $6.1 billion has already been spent. And because FMF is essentially a loan, it’s possible that countries that received FMF dollars already aren’t able to spend them under the freeze. Asked for clarification on the status of FMF deals, a state department spokesperson said, 'We are reviewing all foreign assistance funds to ensure they are aligned with American interests. During this review period, all foreign assistance funding mechanisms with the exception of programs with waivers, are paused. National security is and will remain a top priority.' Ironically, that $95 million for Lebanon actually would still be flowing if it was tagged for Egypt. That’s because Rubio carved out an exception for 'foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and administrative expenses, including salaries, necessary to administer foreign military financing,' according to the BBC. Guenov noted that a 'loss of such support can really be a sore spot in relationships,' and raises the risk that if a freeze lasts a long time or FMF broadly is cut, other countries, such as China or Russia, could move to fill the void. 'There are other competitors who offer, sometimes, cheaper, more quickly available equipment, which come in with deals for countries that provide an alternative to the US,' she said. 'And certainly that’s something we want to avoid.' As to FY25, the Biden administration requested $9.04 billion in security assistance funds through State, with roughly $6.08 billion of FMF included; should Congress finally pass an FY25 budget those totals will likely change, even if the freeze is lifted by then. Meanwhile, Foreign Military Sales cases, where the US government acts as a seller of US-made weapons to a foreign partner, are moving forward. The first FMS case approved under the Trump administration was announced Friday, a deal with Japan for Standard Missile 6 weapons, with an estimated price tag of $900 million.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/with-foreign-military-financing-paused-lebanese-forces-wait-on-promised-funds/	2025-01-31T12:45:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250108_LAF_beirut_GettyImages-2185633357-e1736362566933.jpg
Addressing risk and intellectual property rights in the FLRAA supply chain	The Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) team show Col. Matthew Scher, the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade commanding officer, what his Soldiers can expect from the FLRAA in the 3rd Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment hangar Sept. 9, 2024. A tiltrotor aircraft, FLRAA will have the hybrid capabilities of planes and helicopters. (Photo by Spc. Charles Clark, 25th Infantry Div.) Risk is a program killer, most recently leading to the demise of the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft that planned for a new platform in addition to a greenfield engine. In contrast, its program-mate under the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program – the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) – is taking an iterative path that places a reliance on mature and high-TRL systems already flying on the the Apache, Black Hawk, and Chinook, including an upgraded but established powerplant, to augment development of new, advanced capabilities such as launched effects. There’s something else noteworthy about the FLRAA program – it will introduce a tiltrotor to the Army’s aviation fleet for the first time. That in of itself will open new paths to risk throughout the defense industrial base as suppliers design, build, and support systems for FVL, while also creating new opportunities for technology insertion into an aging fleet. 'The last developmental rotorcraft [in the Army was] about 40 or so years ago,' said FLRAA Project Manager Col. Jeffrey Poquette. 'So, yes, there are challenges and at the forefront are the industrial base and supply chain risk. This was highlighted during COVID, how fragile the supply chains are – everything from cars to electronics. On the defense side, we’ve seen it with ammunition and now with aircraft, which is a very complex weapon system with a lot of components. 'I wouldn’t say that there are unique challenges particular to a tiltrotor. A tiltrotor is a kind of rotorcraft, a helicopter is a kind of rotorcraft, and both of them have complex supply chains that we have to manage carefully. Ensuring a resilient supply chain has been at the forefront of this program for many years now. We’ve stood up a supply chain risk management team that looks at everything from the raw materials to finished products and subcomponents [at] the lowest level in the supply chain.' In addition, a relatively recent DoD-wide acquisition capability called 'consent to subcontract' gives project managers and contractor officers greater control over subcontracts that their prime contractors award to their lower-tier subs. In the case of FLRAA, Bell is the prime. The FLRAA tiltrotor is now in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase where the critical design of the aircraft will be finalized, leading to development of aircraft prototypes for testing. (Bell photo) 'When Bell wants to subcontract with a supplier, they have to prove out a number of things, and one is supply chain resilience and risk level,' said Poquette, noting areas of particular concern that include whether suppliers rely on raw materials that can only be sourced from outside the U.S., and if they’ve developed multiple sources of supply within their own lower-tier suppliers. 'My team then assesses it and before I sign off on that consent, we take a look at supply chain risk management.' FLRAA’s Milestone B decision attained in mid-2024 was, in part, due to the program’s risk posture at that point. The tiltrotor is now in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase where the critical design of the aircraft will be finalized, leading to development of aircraft prototypes for testing, ultimately informing a Milestone C decision in 2028 about production of fieldable aircraft. 'Supply chain risk management is key to a healthy production line,' said Ryan Ehinger, senior vice president and program director, FLRAA Future Long Range Assault Aircraft/V-280 Valor at Bell. 'Aviation component lead times are long and requalification/switching costs for making changes mid-production are high. The government and industry collectively have done a tremendous amount of work over the last decade to reduce risk and inform the requirements, and the current EMD phase is all about further maturation of the digital models, finalizing engineering hardware and software designs, maturing the sustainment artifacts, and driving toward a successful weapon system critical design review as the next major program milestone. 'Bell takes pride in the internal vertical integration of many key components and final assembly, but it is a team of industry leaders spanning many layers of the supply chain that complete the weapon system. All parts are important, and each supplier should feel the weight of program success on their shoulders and an accountability to the warfighters who need this affordable and sustainable capability. We are all working together in EMD, developing myriad systems and components in parallel for integration into our models and assembly and test against the requirements set.' In addition to risk reduction, the disposition of Intellectual property rights for FLRAA systems is another supply chain issue – who owns what and for how long, and the Army’s desire to prevent vendor lock on systems so new capabilities to address evolving threats can be more quickly spiraled in via the application of the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA). The Army says it doesn’t want to own or control all the IP, only where it fits with the Army aviation mission, especially as it relates to sustainment. 'IP for the Army is focused around logistics functions like training, maintaining, sustaining,' said Poquette. 'We have the heritage of wanting to be able to do that without reliance on contractor support, especially where the Army operates deep in areas that are considered hazardous. So how did we do that? 'Rather than ask for specific IP, we presented to the contractors what it is we wanted to do. We did that in hundreds of use cases. We need to be able to develop training materials and manuals, we need to be able to change them when it’s time to change them. We need to be able to instruct and train on how to do maintenance. What we did was incentivize the contractors during competition to provide the most that they could in order to meet those use cases. Once we had a winner in the competition, we signed Bell up to provide all that intellectual property,' he said, adding that this has been an effective way to get access to the appropriate amount of IP that the Army needs while still protecting the creators of that IP. Such strategies around MOSA, intellectual property, and data rights for FLRAA’s long-term sustainment are a significant shift that will impact how suppliers have traditionally operated their businesses. Said Ehinger, 'With some of these new initiatives, suppliers that are able to provide the best value in a competitive environment will do well and suppliers that fail to adapt will see fewer opportunities. A key element of this requires collaboration between industry and government to understand associated intellectual property and data rights, what is needed for long-term organic sustainment, and how industry can help facilitate that. Customers are rightfully passionate about their ability to sustain their platforms over the long term. MOSA is going to be a game changer in terms of enabling affordable upgrades to mission systems. 'As an industry we are at a unique time where we can create a truly new weapon system leveraging the latest in manufacturing technology to yield improvements in affordability and quality. Part of this is due to the advancement in machinery, as well as how the digital thread and software has matured to allow fewer steps in the transition from engineering to manufacturing to assembly and inspection, all leveraging the same source data and reducing the opportunity for defective data. The industrial base is advancing to embrace this and, from a supply chain perspective, those that are able to thrive in this environment of model-based definition and maintain the integrity of the digital thread are at a clear advantage.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/addressing-risk-and-intellectual-property-rights-in-the-flraa-supply-chain/	2025-01-31T12:42:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/DVIDS-FLRAA-photo-for-Bell-Poquette-scaled-e1738355079836.jpg
The sky is not falling: Why Trump may not need the space council anyway	US President Donald Trump watches the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, lifts off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 30, 2020. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Since the inauguration of President Donald Trump to his second term, close observers of American endeavors in space seem to be wringing their hands over the potential dis-establishment of the National Space Council. The council, established in the late 1980s but dormant for many years before its 2017 revival by an executive order by Trump and continued through the Biden years, was designed to '[synchronize] the nation’s civil, commercial, and national security space activities to advance the broader priorities' of the United States in space, according to a Biden-era fact sheet. But media rumors suggest Trump could ax the council, egged on by lobbying from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, according to Reuters. That, in turn, has prompted concerns related to how 'we need a National Space Council to chart our future in outer space.' There are several layers to this argument, but the long and short of it is that it’s overblown. It may be the case that Trump simply does not need a space council to pursue his administration’s strategy for American space leadership for the next four years. Here’s why: The President already has the policy framework and strategy for American spacepower from his first term. The second Trump administration does not need another year long space posture review to decide where we are going when we have the National Strategy for Space and all the SPDs developed during the 2017-2021 first term. It can be argued that the National Space Council has already met its objectives for the administration, and now its up to the President and his new team to execute these directives and strategy across civil, commercial, and national security space as soon as possible. RELATED: Space Force zeroed out funding for in-space mobility in FY26 budget request, sources say The National Strategy for Space was never fully implemented, neither were the Space Policy Directives (SPDs). These should provide the framework for American excellence in space and all departments and agencies tasked within these should be held accountable with timelines and budgetary support from OMB and Congress. That will be hard enough dealing with Congressional opinions and ideas despite having majorities in both Houses. No need to bury the president in excess policy discussions when that homework has been done. The existence of a National Space Council will not prevent 'rogue agencies doing what they want.' I know this from experience. In the last Trump administration, there were many departments and agencies that would use the implementation guidance coordination process as means of 'resistance' to the president’s strategy and policy directives. While many people complain about how the president is looking for senior appointments to run the departments and agencies who are 'loyal', the fact is that each of these people serve at the pleasure of the president, and their jobs is to execute his policies, once the discussion period is complete. To avoid providing additional means for resistance to policy directives from continuing, recruiting those who are of the same mind is key. It might be that some at the highest levels think that the time for discussion is over and the time to move out is now. I for one believe this to be the case. The relationship between Trump and Elon Musk has not 'politicized space.' I have written on this topic of 'politicizing space' before. The reality is space policy has always been a political undertaking, both nationally and internationally. Apollo was a geopolitical decision by John F. Kennedy. Not everyone in the US government was on board and did what they could to kill the effort. The Space Shuttle and space station were both political decisions. Many have argued that if the Russians weren’t engaged for the International Space Station, NASA might not have had a vote to continue the project. Cancelling the Constellation project to send astronauts back to the moon and to Mars, started by President George W. Bush, was a political decision that even President Barack Obama’s own party members in Congress were not totally happy with. RELATED: &#8216;Changes' expected in ISR satellite operations to sort NGA, Space Force roles, official says Decisions in the future regarding civil and national security space will continue to generate political mobilization. It is an area of great emotion, passion, and strategic need. Space is only politics free in science fiction. Musk is a very outspoken proponent of going to Mars. This is not a new thing. Musk was a huge advocate of this when Obama was in office as well as during the Biden administration. The difference between Trump and Obama with the Biden administration is while Obama and Trump sought to enable commercial space technology such as SpaceX for commercial crew, cargo, and other capabilities, the Biden administration was perceived as overly restrictive. While some regulation is vital to safety of property and the environment, too much is hindering to American leadership in space. It only makes sense that Musk would ally with Trump given his stated position to extend American 'manifest destiny among the stars.' Given that is Musk’s dream as well, this is a not an unusual business and personal relationship between an industry figure and the president. There are other voices included in the space policy world, Newt Gingrich, Bob Walker, Jared Issacman, and many more are also part of this discussion and will be joining the Trump administration’s space policy team, in the case of Issacman. Keeping all these realities in mind, might help people understand that while a national Space Council is something that should be supported, there is some sound logic behind why, at least in the Trump administration, such an institution is not necessary for the second term. The objective now is to get moving. Get the Space Force armed and ready to defend the nation’s critical space infrastructure out into cis-lunar space, and to see the 'stars and stripes planted on the planet Mars.' Let’s get going!

‘More work to be done’ to lower barriers to tech-sharing for AUKUS Pillar II, Australian official says	The crew of the USS Asheville assemble on the casing of the submarine during a visit to HMAS Stirling in Rockingham, Western Australia. (Australian government) WEST 2025 — The AUKUS nations have made progress in loosening regulatory barriers when it comes to the exchange of defense technology for the alliance's Pillar II initiative, but an Australian official said much more red tape still needs to be cut. 'If we're going to step into this endeavor, we've got to be committed to creating opportunities to accelerate and getting technology into the hands of our warfighters,' Commodore David Frost, naval attache in the Royal Australian Navy, told an audience here at the West conference on Thursday. 'That can only be achieved if we knock down many of the barriers to that, one of which is the licenses that are required for us to share.' Frost was referencing licenses still withheld under the Excluded Technology List (ELT), a list that, as its name suggests, identifies tech that's still controlled by onerous export rules like the US government's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). In August the US approved new ITAR rules to speed along AUKUS-related tech sharing, but experts and lawmakers have called for the alliance to go further. Frost suggested that's been in the works. 'So Australia, and particularly in Washington, with the State Department, with the Pentagon, with the Navy, we've been very focused on that excluded technology list to make sure it's as minimal as possible so we can get at sharing that technology. Now are we there yet? No, we're not,' he said. 'We need to focus on that so there's more work to be done.' Related: AUKUS ITAR changes not much help for Pillar 2 tech: US Studies Centre experts Frost said that narrowing down the excluded tech list will help strengthen not only Pillar II efforts — which include capabilities such as hypersonics, autonomy, AI and other advanced weapons — but also would give small businesses the opportunity to showcase their capabilities. 'We are committed to creating an environment where not just the clients who have the ability to operate in an ITAR environment, because they have resources and people that just do that as part of their business, but small backyard people, the SMEs [small and medium size enterprises] that have really good technology that can be shared and get into the hands of the warfighter,' Frost told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the event.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/more-work-to-be-done-to-lower-barriers-to-tech-sharing-for-aukus-pillar-ii-australian-official-says/	2025-01-31T07:15:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/20230314ran8562933_0001-scaled-e1678829734251.jpg
Army launching self-propelled howitzer competition in mid-February, after globetrotting evalution tour	A photo of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (US Army) The service plans to host a competition that will kick off with the release of a Phase I request for proposal in mid-February, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean said in a Wednesday email. 'Phase I is the ‘get to test’ phase which includes further testing of mature platforms, and it will not be a vendor downselect — competition in this phase remains critical,' Dean added. Instead, the Army is planning to pick an unspecified number of companies to proceed and award Phase I contracts around the July to September timeframe. Those vendors will then participate in additional 'competitive evaluation testing' that will run through fiscal 2026. RELATED: Army anticipates return of repaired logistics vessel prototype by month's end 'To support current and future operations, next generation artillery must deliver precise and effective fires at range and be able to mass fires to support operations,' the two-star general wrote in response to questions. 'It is not an either/or, but both.' 'The ability to mass fire is not just the ability to fire rapidly (rate of fire), but also the ability to load, move, emplace, fire, displace, reload, and re-emplace/refire at a pace that supports the needs of the supported force,' he added. While the Army continued work on associated munitions under the ERCA banner, it was torn over whether to relaunch development of a new platform or pull an existing one from industry. To help find that answer, the service went on an international roadshow in recent months, visiting a handful of companies from Europe to Asia to the Middle East — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems. In early December, Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team leader Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks said those evaluations were going well with early findings indicating that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation.' 'We’re very pleased with what we’re seeing so far, and even some on the autonomy side,' the one-star general told an audience at an Association of the US Army event on Dec. 3.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-launching-self-propelled-howitzer-competition-in-mid-february-after-globetrotting-evalution-tour/	2025-01-31T05:23:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Extended-Range-Artillery-Cannon-ERCA-Army.jpeg
Don’t force Pacific Island nations to choose between us or China, says UK Royal Navy admiral	China's Premier Li Qiang shows the way to Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare after they observed their national anthems during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 10, 2023. (Photo by ANDY WONG/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) WEST 2025 — Western countries should avoid pressuring Pacific Island nations from making a binary choice between working with China or the United States and its allies, an admiral from the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy warned, citing the massive maritime might the Chinese could bring on smaller countries. 'The way in which global trade is interconnected at the moment means that China has a trump card of maritime trade that no other nation on the planet’s got,' Rear Adm. James Parkin, who is responsible for overseeing the development of the Royal Navy’s technologies, told attendees at West in San Diego on Wednesday. Parkin specifically cited China’s shipbuilding infrastructure, which is consistently rated as the best in the world when measured in number of ships built per year. The Chinese government 'passed a law that every merchant ship can be changed to be a state-owned vessel in era of combat,' Parkin said. 'So, as well as the silhouettes of warships versus warships … there’s another 10,000 state-owned Chinese vessels which could be brought to bear in an era of conflict.' More specifically, he said China could use its fleet to create an 'almost universal maritime trade embargo' which would have immediate consequences for smaller, secluded Pacific Island countries. US Coast Guard and Navy leadership often talk publicly about the assistance they strive to provide to smaller island nations in the Indo-Pacific as a means of military diplomacy. They also warn those same nations about the coercive tactics the Chinese have used: offering money and aide up front, but then later calling in a debt to gain access to useful ports and other resources. 'The [People’s Republic of China] has resorted to corruption, bribery, and personal threats to advance its influence in the [Pacific Island countries],' according to the Pentagon’s 2024 report on China’s power. 'In March 2023, outgoing Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo criticized the PRC for its widespread bribes of Micronesian officials and reported PRC officials made direct threats to his personal safety.' Although US military officials don't directly ask these countries to pick sides in the way Parkin stated, they do stress the importance that these nations and others view the United States as its partner of choice over China. Asked about this, Parkin said, 'I think if you look at the different levers of power, the diplomatic, the industrial, the military and the economic, in times of peace, people don't connect to those elements.' 'What my points are reflecting is that in time of conflict, clearly, the military element of those four levers of powers is much more important,' he said, 'but if the other three levers have already been locked down, then we may not get the answer we want when it comes to the way in which other independent nations may choose to go.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/dont-force-pacific-island-nations-to-choose-between-us-or-china-says-uk-royal-navy-admiral/	2025-01-30T14:07:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230721_china_solomon_GettyImages-1517817161-scaled-e1689946587637.jpg
Sweden’s new $1.2B donation to Ukraine includes drones, missiles and boats	Swedish and Ukrainian flags on a balcony in Kiev, Ukraine. (Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — Sweden today announced a 13.5 billion SEK ($1.23 billion) military aid package to Ukraine and Moldova, the 18th support package Stockholm has announced for Kyiv’s aid. Among the key components of this package is approximately $90 million for the production of long-range missiles and drones, which aims to bolster Ukraine’s offensive capabilities, according to the announcement by the Swedish government and its coalition party on Thursday. The package also includes donations of 16 CB90-class fast assault boats, 1,500 anti-tank TOW missiles and 200 anti-armor AT4 weapons. The aid package also includes 23 naval weapons stations and one million rounds of ammunition for the combat boats, to support Ukraine's naval capabilities. 'This is also a signal to our other allies that we need to prepare for the fact that Europe will have to take greater responsibility for the support to Ukraine,' Defence Minister Pål Jonson said. Approximately 45 percent of the military aid package for Ukraine, amounting to $544 million, is money being set aside for the Swedish Defense Material Administration to buy more equipment for Ukraine’s needs from European defense industries. Decisions on where to spend that money has been made in consultation with Ukraine, and deliveries will happen within the next 24 months, Jonson's spokesperson told Breaking Defense. In addition, $181.5 million will be sent through the 'Danish model' to Ukraine's defense industry, and another $72.6 million will be sent to funds such as the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) and the British International Fund for Ukraine (IPU), which finance the purchase of military equipment. The decision to include AT4s for Moldova is notable, as it reflects Stockholm’s broader strategy of supporting regional stability beyond Ukraine’s borders. Moldova, a non-NATO member state, is viewed by regional experts as the next potential target for Russian aggression should Moscow win out in Ukraine. 'Increasing our engagement with countries within the EU’s Eastern Partnership, such as Moldova, is a key part of Sweden’s policy to constrain Russia. This policy aims to constrain Russia’s influence, freedom of action and ability to do harm,' Jonson said on X. 'Moldova is a target of repeated Russian influence campaigns, and it is in Europe’s security interest to help Moldova get stronger and safer.' Ukraine dictates the needs and short delivery times are crucial, according to the government press brief on Thursday. In 2025, Sweden will be allocating $58 million towards the education and training of Ukrainian soldiers, demonstrating a long-term commitment to enhancing Ukraine’s military capabilities through education. As of today’s announcement, Sweden has contributed a total of approximately $5.62 billion in military support to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly three years ago, according to a government summary.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/swedens-new-1-2b-donation-to-ukraine-includes-drones-missiles-and-boats/	2025-01-30T12:05:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/sweden-ukraine-flags-scaled-e1738261497904.jpg
Germany’s Diehl Defence receives 4-nation IRIS-T Block II development contract	Concept art of the future IRIS-T Block II short range, air-to-air missile (Diehl Defence) BELFAST — German weapons manufacturer Diehl Defence announced today that it has been contracted to lead development and production of IRIS-T (InfraRed Imaging System – Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled) Block II air-to-air missiles on behalf of program partner nations Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The company said in a statement that the Block II contract was originally signed by Germany’s federal office for armed forces equipment, information technology and in-service support (BAAINBw) at the 'end of December' 2024 and was 'realized in the shortest possible time.' It added, 'The IRIS-T Block II contract marks an important milestone for the future of IRIS-T,' but did not disclose a contract value, quantities of Block II weapons on order or delivery dates. Neither Diehl nor the BAAINBw responded to requests for comment by press time. The Diehl statement did not explain the defining features of the Block II upgrade, sharing only that the missile will be 'improved continuously and will continue to set benchmarks with new capabilities in its original air-to-air role.' As noted by the manufacturer, IRIS-T is a European short range, air-to-air missile, with the in-production Block I developed in collaboration at an industrial level by Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden. 'The seeker assisted radar proximity fuze and the large warhead give the missile a remarkable anti-missile capability,' states achieved Diehl company literature. Capable of striking enemy fighter jets and intercepting air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles, the weapon was designed as a successor to the US Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile and has been in production since 2005. To date, over 5,000 units have been delivered. The weapon is integrated on a range of fighters jets including the Swedish Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon, US platforms like the F-5E, F-16, EF-18, and South Korea’s KF-21. More broadly, the IRIS-T family also features the IRIS-T SL (surface-launched) missile equipped for Ground Based Air Defense (GBAD) systems. It is a core part of Ukraine's air defense. A total of 11 IRIS-T platforms, split between SLS (short) and SLM (medium) types, have so far been delivered by Germany, according to a military aid factsheet. As Breaking Defense previously reported, Germany plans on taking deliveries later this year under a six IRIS T-SLM fire unit acquisition. Diehl also unveiled the newest addition to the IRIS-T collection at the Berlin Airshow last year. The in-development system will be capable of 'covering ranges of up to 80 km,' it said at the time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/germanys-diehl-defence-receives-4-nation-iris-t-block-ii-development-contract/	2025-01-30T11:01:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/2024_12_Pressemitteilung_IRIS_T-scaled-e1738251614684.jpg
Northrop to sell training services unit to Serco in $327M deal	In this photo illustration, the American multinational aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Northrop Grumman is selling off its training services business to Serco for $327 million, as the prime contractor restructures its defense systems division and focuses its business on innovation. The transaction is expected to close mid-year 2025, the companies said in a statement announcing the deal. 'We continuously evaluate the portfolio to ensure that we are investing in the businesses that are core to achieving our strategic vision. This includes accessing any gaps that may emerge over time or businesses that may make sense to exit. With this in mind, we've decided to exit our training services business that is part of defense systems segment,' Northrop CEO Kathy Warden said during an earnings call this morning. 'This is an important capability for our customers, and we expect the team to continue to deliver world class training services under new leadership, allowing us to focus on our core business.' The sale will grow Serco’s revenue in North America to beyond $2 billion and its workforce by about 1,000 employees, adding mission training services and software for satellite ground stations to the company’s portfolio, Serco said in a news release. Alongside the sale of training services, Northrop has transferred its strike and surveillance aircraft services business from its defense systems division to its aeronautics unit, a move that puts aircraft sustainment in the same portfolio as aircraft development and production. The realignment will allow for a 'more seamless development and sustainment of next generation aircraft' in aeronautics while focusing the defense systems portfolio on strategic deterrence systems like the Sentinel, advanced weapons and missile defense, said Northrop Chief Financial Officer Ken Crews. Northrop’s fourth quarter earnings provided few surprises, with Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners calling it a 'clean, event free quarter from Northrop.' Warden, however, did provide some new details on usually-quite-secretive programs like the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system and the services’ next-generation fighter jets. Northrop is continuing to meet milestones on the Sentinel contract, even as the Air Force 'paused work on some small infrastructure efforts in the command and launch' as it considers how to restructure the program in the wake of massive cost overruns, Warden said. Last year, the Pentagon determined that it would continue the program despite an 81 percent increase in cost, and the Air Force is considering reopening pieces of the troubled ground infrastructure portion of the contract up for competition. Asked about the Air Force and Navy’s next-generation fighter programs, Warden specified that Northrop is 'not a prime, but we are a contributor to the program through mission systems' on the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance program. For the Navy’s F/A-XX program, where Northrop is competing as a prime contractor, the company continues to monitor the effort and 'would be excited to be selected,' she added. The company has not built either program into its financial guidance. Last year, Gen. Thomas Bussiere, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, said that the service may need to accelerate or increase its planned buy of B-21 bombers. Asked today whether an accelerated buy would affect pricing of the aircraft, Warden was noncommittal. 'We would work with the Air Force to look at when those units would come into the contract, and obviously we are accumulating more and more actual performance to help inform discussions with them about the right pricing,' she said. 'It would be premature for me to comment on where we expect that to land.' Warden praised the Trump administration for its attention to missile defense issues through its support of an Iron Dome system for the United States, saying that Northrop is 'well-positioned to support that architecture.' She also said the company looks forward to engaging with the Department of Government Efficiency headed by Elon Musk. 'I believe we all see that there is room for cost efficiency in the way that we work together between industry and government, and so we've embraced the opportunity to share some of our observations and ideas, and are starting to do that,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/northrop-to-sell-training-services-unit-to-serco-in-327m-deal/	2025-01-30T10:07:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/northrop-logo-phone-scaled-e1699982995194.jpg
Elbit to supply Israel with $80 million in EW and protection suites for F-16s	The F-16I has been in service for 20 years with the IDF, and several squadrons fly the warplane. (IDF) JERUSALEM — The Israel Ministry of Defense is acquiring $80 million in 'advanced self-protection suites' for Israel's F-16I aircraft, the latest in a procurement blitz in the wake of the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. The Ministry of Defense made the aquisition announcement on Monday, saying the F-16s will 'be equipped with cutting-edge technologies to ensure maximum protection in complex combat scenarios.' The ministry did not specify how many F-16Is will be equipped, nor did it say which squadrons flying the F-16I will get the upgrade. However, photographs distributed by the ministry showed planes from the 107th squadron, with an orange crescent emblazoned on its tail and the 201st squadron, known at The One, which has a '1' on the tail. The IAF has two other F-16I squadrons: the 253rd, which first integrated the warplane, and the 119th 'Bat' squadron. The Israeli Air Force has flown F-16s since the 1980s, including the F-16I since it entered service in 2004. The new protection suite includes an 'Electonic Warfare (EW) system providing advanced threat disruption capabilities, ⁠Infra-Red (IR) Missile Warning and Launch Detection System for early identification of airborne and ground threats and Advanced chaff and flare dispensing system for protection against guided missile,' the ministry said. The procurement of the new systems for the F-16s is part of a much larger process the Ministry of Defense has embarked upon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. Israel was already acquiring new heavy lifter helicopters and refuelers. It had also just taken delivery of four new corvette warships and was upgrading its air defenses. However, the war has highlighted the need for Israel to acquire a large number of new systems for a much larger number of forces and platforms. One part of this process was underlined by the Nagel Commission, empaneled in the summer of 2024 to look at force building needs. 'This process joins a series of strategic deals promoted by the Israel Ministry of Defense under Director General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir to strengthen production independence in Israeli defense industries and reduce dependency on external factors. This is to ensure the IDF’s qualitative military edge and support its current and future operational needs under all conditions,' the ministry said in its statement. Zamir is reported to be on the short list for the new Chief of Staff as Israel’s Minister of Defense Israel Katz looks for a replacement for Herzi Halevi, who recently said he is resigning. Elbit Systems has secured several EW and self-protection suite deals in recent years. In 2024 it was awarded $175 million to supply them for Embraer C-390s and Airbus H225M helicopters for an unnamed NATO country. It has also been contracted to provide EW to the German air force for CH-53 helicopters, and also for the Netherlands Gulfstream G650 aircraft, in deals in 2023 and 2022 respectively.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/elbit-to-supply-israel-with-80-million-in-ew-and-protection-suites-for-f-16s/	2025-01-30T09:46:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250130_f16i_inflight_IDF-e1738257717105.png
Army secretary nominee pledges focus on aviation after Black Hawk collides with airliner	Emergency response units assess airplane wreckage in the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan Washington Airport on January 30, 2025 in Arlington, Virginia. An American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided with a helicopter while approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In the wake of last night’s tragic accident involving a civilian aircraft and US Army helicopter that has left dozens dead, service secretary nominee Daniel Driscoll kicked off his confirmation hearing vowing to focus on aviation. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to all involved in last night's tragedy, which occurred a few miles away from this hearing room. If confirmed [I’ll work to ensure] this never happens again,' Driscoll told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during his opening statement. The committee met hours after American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army UH-60 Black Hawk collided in the air near Washington National Airport, on the outskirts of the nation’s capital. The commercial aircraft — inbound from Wichita, Kan. — was carrying 64 people, while the helicopter was flying a training mission with three soldiers from the 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir, Va. There are no presumed survivors and the National Transportation Safety Board is slated to lead the investigation. 'It's an accident that seems to be preventable, for what we can tell [right now], that should not happen. I think of focus from the top down, on a culture of safety, there are appropriate times to take risk and there are inappropriate times to take risk,' Driscoll said in response to questions from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH. 'I don't know the details around this one, but [if] confirmed, and working with this committee to figure out the facts, I think we might need to look at where is an appropriate time to take training risk, and it may not be near an airport like Reagan.' Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed the accident this morning in a pre-taped video release, noting that the soldiers were conducting an annual proficiency training flight. 'It was a fairly experienced crew, and that was doing a required annual night evaluation. They did have night vision goggles,' Hegseth said. 'The 12th aviation battalion, as of now, is granted a 48 hour operational pause on contingency missions as what happened is reviewed and a senior level Aviation team, an investigative team from our aviation safety center was deployed last night.' While last night’s accident didn’t take center stage at the start of today’s confirmation hearing, Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., kicked it off with a moment of silence. Last night's deadly crash comes in the wake of several years of intense scrutiny over Army aviation. In April 2023, the Army leaders announced a service-wide aviation stand down following a pair of deadly helicopter accidents that claimed the lives of a dozen soldiers. That stand down grounded all Army aviators, except those participating in 'critical missions.' 'The safety of our aviators is our top priority, and this stand down is an important step to make certain we are doing everything possible to prevent accidents and protect our personnel,' then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said in a release. 'During this stand down, we will focus on safety and training protocols to ensure our pilots and crews have the knowledge, training and awareness to safely complete their assigned mission.' But the accidents kept coming, as did the scrutiny. According to an online Army newsletter [PDF] about aviation mishaps that was released this month, things got worse in fiscal 2024. 'FY24 will be a year that Army aviation looks back on in hopes of never repeating,' the newsletter begins. 'After years of a steady decline in mishap rates per 100,000 hours beginning in 2006, FY23 saw a twofold increase in mishap rates from FY22’s record low 0.50 Class A mishaps per 100,000 hours. Then FY24 produced a Class A flight mishap rate almost four times greater than FY22, with a rate of 1.90.' More specifically, it notes that last year was the 'most' Class A flight mishaps since FY14 and the 'worst' Class A flight mishap rate per 100,000 hours since FY07. 'The most obvious trend in the FY24 mishaps was the AH-64 [Apache] fleet being overrepresented with nine of the 15 Class A flight mishaps,' the Army newsletter continues. 'Eight of the AH-64 mishaps were attributed to human error, with two of those being attributed to maintenance errors. The final AH-64 mishap was a bird strike.' In FY24, there were also three UH-72 Lakota Class A mishaps, and one-off mishaps with the fleet of UH-60 Black Hawks, the CH-47 Chinooks and the Beechcraft C-12 Huron. There was also a Class A environmental event that damaged over 40 aircraft and a C-12 Class A aircraft ground mishap during maintenance operations. In April 2024, before the fiscal year ended, the Army announced an Aviation Safety Stand-Up with no pause in operations. 'During this stand up, aviation units will execute targeted training that we've really been deliberate about crafting while continuing to fly missions,' said Brig Gen Walter Rugen, then the director of Army aviation. 'Again, for our overarching goal to build enduring readiness and proficiency in our force. 'We assess that the recent accident increase would be better mitigated by focusing more on specific training topics to better get at targeted areas that are contributing to many of our safety issues,' he later added. 'So, more training, more focused training.' While President Donald Trump’s pick to be 26th Army secretary is relatively unknown, with a limited social media presence, he seemingly has support from both sides of the aisle. Driscoll, who previously served as an advisor to now-Vice President JD Vance, is a graduate of Yale Law School, former Army soldier, and has spent time working in the private equity arena. In a rarity for Washington, he arrived at the committee with a bipartisan show of support: Sens Markwayne Mullen, R- Okla., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Ct., introduced Driscoll at the start of the hearing. 'I spoke to Dan a number of times in the course of his preparing for his appearance here today, and those conversations convinced me that he is willing to work on the basis of collegiality, to be transparent and open with this panel with the Congress and our colleagues,' Blumenthal said during his introduction. The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI., also seemingly threw his support behind the nominee to lead the Army saying he brings 'integrity, intelligence and the experience of the young officer leading soldiers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/washington-dc-aviation-airport-crash-black-hawk-army-secretary-safety/	2025-01-30T08:16:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/dca-crash-scaled-e1738253107889.jpg
Saudi defense giant SAMI appoints new CEO	Visitors check out the booth for Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) at the Dubai Airshow in 2023. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Saudi Arabia’s government-owned defense giant has appointed Thamer AlMuhid as its new Chief Executive Officer, five months after previous CEO Walid Abukhaled stepped down, the company's board of directors announced today. 'In his role as CEO, Eng. AlMuhid will lead SAMI's mission to develop cutting-edge technologies, manufacture world-class products, and forge strategic partnerships,' according to a statement from Saudi Arabian Military Industries. The company said AlMuhid served earlier in several executive positions from CEO of Saudi Chemical Company to the vice chairman of the board of directors of the National Academy of Military Industries. As CEO of SAMI, one of AlMuhid's primary responsibilities will be to push SAMI to realize Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 goal of localizing 50 percent of defense production in the country. RELATED: Saudi Arabia reveals strides in local defense production as it races towards ambitious 2030 goal AlMuhid will be the third SAMI CEO since the organization's founding in 2017, after German national and former Rheinmetall executive Andreas Schwer, and Saudi national and former Northrop Grumman executive Walid Abukhaled. 'I’m extremely proud to say since the inception of SAMI, we became one of the top 100 defense companies in the world,' then-CEO Abukhaled told Breaking Defense in an interview at the World Defense Show in Riyadhi in February 2024. 'Whether it's a vehicle land vehicle, a futuristic UAV that is a concept, some C4I systems, C2 systems, smaller versions of UAVs, converting a manned boat to unmanned boat — we've done it, it's us. The shift is already happening.' SAMI recently highlighted a number of its achievements over the last year, including launching the first locally developed combat management system in Saudi Arabia and expanding the size of its workforce of 71 percent nationals.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/saudi-defense-giant-sami-appoints-new-ceo/	2025-01-30T08:10:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231113_SAMI_dubai_airshow_HELOU-scaled-e1699907382425.jpg
Breaking down how the Pentagon could spend $200 billion extra	On March 11, 2024 the Pentagon and military services presented their fiscal year 2025 budget requests. (Graphic by Breaking Defense, original images courtesy DVIDS, Getty) The president has recently reiterated his commitment to 'peace through strength,' and the Congress is hard at work to make that happen. Initial press reports indicate that Congress could increase defense spending through the reconciliation process by as much as $200 billion, or $100B per year for fiscal 2025 and 2026, above the Biden-proposed defense topline request of $849.8B. With the FY25 NDAA already passed, normally, any additional funds would be added by the appropriators. However, if these funds are added through reconciliation, then it may be that the authorizers, led by Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., as opposed to the appropriators, who will have greater control in deciding where these funds will be allocated. More money for the Pentagon is an inherently good thing: The department needs not just the money it has asked for, but whatever extra Congress can churn up. But given that DoD has only one confirmed Trump appointee, the Congress will need a guide to determine where this money should go. Fortunately, a written guide already exists in the form of Wicker’s May 2024 plan, appropriately called 'Peace through Strength.' Of course, that plan was written with a different potential topline increase in mind, so a 'new math' will be needed when considering how to spell the potential increase. This 'new math' will have three factors to consider: Wicker’s core plan, fixes for inflation, and what we can call the DOGE transformation. First, let’s start with Wicker’s original plan, which was for a $110 billion increase over two years, or $55 billion of additional funding per year. To start with nearly 85 percent of this $55 billion (Table 1) would go towards Defense/COCOM agencies, the Air Force and the Navy. What is striking is how little funding is allocated to the Army, Marines and the Space Force. While Wicker’s plan is not broken out by appropriation, some careful guesses based upon the descriptions of the individual items shows that this plan allocates over 91 percent of the funding for the three investment accounts (Table 2) and only about 8 percent for operating the force. With over $14 billion allocated in the continuing resolution for nuclear submarines, money that was set after Wicker’s plan was released, the $3.2 billion allocated in the Wicker plan for the Virginia-Class submarines could be reallocated and the ground forces should be running over to the Congress to get a piece of it. With $110 billion of the $200 billion now accounted for, let’s look at inflation. Right now, the military is limping along under a six-month long continuing resolution that my colleague at AEI Elaine McCusker calculates wastes billions of dollars per month. Additionally, inflation has eaten away at least 3 percent of the Pentagon’s buying power, which seems small unless you actually do the math and realize that this is almost $25 billion, or $2 billion per month in decreased readiness and capabilities. In FY24, due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the Pentagon’s topline was about $847 billion, so the Biden administration FY25 request of $850 billion is a 'cut' when inflation is taken into account. Assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the defense budget in FY25 would need to be about $25 billion higher just to have the same buying power as in FY24. Looking forward into FY26, the Pentagon’s topline would need to add another $30 billion to maintain its buying power. Therefore, roughly $55 billion in spending authorized ($25 billion in FY25 and $30 billion in FY26) under reconciliation will be eaten up by simply keeping up with inflation. It’s not ideal, but it is what is realistic. The third bucket of funding is what remains of the $200 billion, which is $35 billion. And if the Trump administration is serious about DOGE and transforming the Department of Defense, then the Congress should allocate these funds to the Deputy Secretary of Defense nominee, Stephen Feinberg. These funds will enable the administration to immediately change the arc of defense procurement. The funds should be used to execute a 180-degree pivot away from exquisite, large, and costly platforms towards a future of mass production and mass customization. This would manifest itself as a full embrace of autonomy in the air, a massive embrace of autonomy at sea, and a new information technology backbone. If Ukraine can produce four million drones per year, certainly, with $35 billion per year, every year starting in FY26, the United States can change the arc of its defense industrial base and boost the efforts of the non-traditional defense firms. There seems to be bipartisan agreement that more money is needed for defense. This is a once in a generation opportunity. With Wicker clearly in the driver’s seat, this $200 billion added through reconciliation will enable the nation to truly achieve 'peace through strength.' It simply needs to follow the path set before it. Retired US Army Maj. Gen. John G. Ferrari is a senior nonresident fellow at AEI. Ferrari previously served as a director of program analysis and evaluation for the service.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/breaking-down-how-the-pentagon-could-spend-200-billion-extra/	2025-01-30T05:59:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240311_budget_day_gfx.png
Japan picks Textron T-6 for JASDF training fleet	A T-6A Texan II takes-off from Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, June. 10, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Harrison Sullivan) SYDNEY — The Japanese military plans to buy Textron's T-6 as part of its effort to modernize its pilot training fleet, the American plane-maker said in press release. Textron's Tuesday announcement did not disclose how many of the Beechcraft T-6 Texan IIs the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would buy, but said the agreement also includes a comprehensive ground-based training system, training for instructor pilots and aircraft maintainers, and long-term logistic and sustainment support. The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II will replace the Fuji/Subaru T-7 aircraft that has been Japan's basic trainer. RELATED: Chinese military delegation make rare visit to Japan, experts see pre-Trump prep The move continues Japan's strong tendency to buy American weapons, not surprising given its status as a treaty ally, and one that faces a surging Chinese military in the region.

The budget did not include the cost or the number of aircraft to be acquired. Breaking Defense has reached out to the Japanese Ministry of Defense for comment. There are more than 1,000 Beechcraft T-6s in service in 14 nations. In the Indo-Pacific, Japan's air force will join the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the Royal Thai Air Force, and the Vietnam Air Defense Air Force flying T-6s.

‘Considerable’ effects: How the Osprey groundings hit one Navy wing	A CMV-22B Osprey inside a hangar at a US Navy base in San Diego, Calif. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense.) WEST 2025 — The three-month grounding of the Pentagon’s V-22 Osprey fleets last year had 'considerable' impact on the Navy's aviators and crews at a time when the service is transitioning to the Osprey as its primary aircraft for ferrying personnel and cargo, a deputy commodore of an Osprey wing here in San Diego told reporters. 'VRM-30 lost two deployments [on the aircraft carriers] Teddy Roosevelt and the Lincoln,' Capt. Andrew Beard, deputy commodore of the Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Wing, told reporters on Monday ahead of the West 2025 exposition. 'You had pilots and air crewmen who were banking on going away, getting lots of experience [and] getting qualified … Instead of doing that, they sat here and couldn’t train, they couldn’t fly,' he continued. VRM-30 is the Navy’s first CMV-22B Osprey squadron as the service transitions away from the legacy C-2A Greyhounds. VRM-50, based in San Diego, and VRM-40, based in Norfolk, Va., are the other fleet replacement squadrons focused on training new aviators and enlisted crews to operate the Osprey. Beard compared the situation to when an individual is sidelined for an extended period of time due to a medical incident, losing training time and flight hours as a result. The difference, Beard said, is that the squadron can mitigate that risk by pairing them with more senior personnel who can monitor them. But due to the fleet-wide grounding, even senior personnel had to spend time getting back up to the standard while junior crewmen had to continue waiting their turns to be cycled back into operations. 'I would say some of the junior folks probably didn’t fly in an aircraft for about five months. That’s considerable — due to no fault of their own,' Beard said. But the fleet has been dealing with a series of safety pauses going back to August 2022. The longest downtime, the roughly three-month pause Beard discussed, followed a November 2023 crash off the coast of Japan that killed eight airmen. After the most recent issue in December, Naval Air Systems Command cleared the V-22 fleets to continue flight operations under specific restrictions which were put in place following a brief pause implemented earlier that month. At that time, NAVAIR said a predetermined flight hour threshold for the aircraft’s gearbox would determine how it could operate, specifically the restriction implied newer gearboxes were more susceptible to problems. But the command decline to disclose a specific number for that threshold. A spokesperson for NAVAIR declined to comment when asked about Beard’s comments. 'Right now, our primary focus is on getting the [detachments] formed [and supporting] the carrier schedule. And we are keenly focused on doing that,' Beard said. 'That has become a challenge because of the recent interim flight clearance and the restrictions based on the gearboxes that are going on.' One of the restrictions in place under the interim flight clearance includes never being further than 30 minutes from a landing area. That poses particularly difficult challenges for the Navy, which operates its Ospreys over blue water ocean, compared to the Marines and Air Force who are usually closer to shore. Beard said the detachment currently aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) is unable to fly on certain days based on where the carrier is in the western pacific. But he also said that flight crews ultimately have some leeway to act as they see fit if circumstances demand it. 'All of our crews know and train to if there’s — if you’re in extremis and there’s a rock and it’s flat.

To be ready for China in 2027, think new software, not ships: Navy tech officer	The Navy is working to digitize its infrastructure and operations. (Graphic by Breaking Defense, original images via Getty and DVIDS) The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) 'has tasked us with being able to close that kill chain against the PRC, our peer competitor in the western Pacific, no later than Jan. 1, 2027,' Chief Technology Officer of Task Force Hopper, Lt. Artem Sherbinin, said during a panel discussion here at the West naval conference. 'New warships &#8230; are not coming. New aircraft are not coming in that timeline. &#8230; But software is,' he said. 'Software delivery to ships is impacting the Red Sea fight today. We are updating those ships at sea and making them more lethal.' RELATED: Crowded waters: Who's doing what in the international hotspot of the Red Sea Sherbinin is in a key position for any focus on software, as the task force he's on is primarily aimed at enabling AI and machine learning integration across the service. His mention of 2027 is likely a reference to what's known as the Davidson Window, the time at which the US says Chinese leader Xi Jingping has told his military he wants the capability to invade Taiwan, should he decide to. (Xi reportedly told US officials he never made such a mandate.) US Navy CNO Adm. Lisa Franchetti highlighted the 2027 deadline in her 2024 navigation plan, dubbed Project 33 [PDF]. Closing the kill chain refers to the process of using a myriad of sensors to detect, locate, identify and track targets before attacking them with the most effective measure available. Better software, updated constantly, can keep the US ahead of its enemies, Sherbinin suggested. RELATED: To kill the kill chain: How Space Force could use AI to avoid &#8216;operational surprise' on orbit 'Software closes the kill chain faster and tightens that OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) Loop, because software cycle times and software production times and software deployment and delivery times are much faster. So, the rate of change is faster in the world of software and AI, as opposed to the world of large platform-centric warfare,' he said. 'Artillery shells still matter. Tomahawk still matters. Standard Missile Twos and Sixes still matter,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/to-be-ready-for-china-in-2027-think-new-software-not-ships-navy-tech-officer/	2025-01-29T14:06:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/230105_navy_digital_gfx.png
Poland adds long-range strike to its F-35 fleet with AARGM-ER missiles	Polish officials signed off on the procurement of the AARGM-ER missile on Jan. 28, 2025. (Bartosz Glowaki/Breaking Defense) WARSAW — Poland this week signed a $745 million agreement to purchase 200 AARGM-ER (Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missiles – Extended Range) missiles, produced by Northrop Grumman. The weapons, which are to be used on Poland’s fleet of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, are scheduled to be delivered between 2029 and 2035. At Jan. 28 signing ceremony, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence, called the deal a 'breakthrough purchase' that will allow Poland to 'effectively use all the capabilities of these most modern aircraft.' The range of the weapon is over 200 km, giving Poland a long-range standoff system which can push back on the anti-access, area-denial air defenses of a potential foe — Russia, though it was not named directly by Maj. Gen. Ireneusz Nowak, general inspector of the Polish Air Force. An A2AD system 'is nothing more than a network of anti-aircraft systems based on medium- and long-range missiles, which are dangerous for our aircraft. The F-35, which, combined with its stealth [technology], will now have armament that allows the elimination of the control radars of these anti-aircraft systems, will be the right tool to do this job, which may not, let's hope, wait for us, but must be ready for it,' Nowak said. 'We are joining the club, one could say, of an exclusive nature of users of the AARGM-ER missile &#8230; the United States, the Netherlands, Finland and Australia. And here we can say that once again Poland is becoming a leader in implementing modern weapons, but it is also acquiring capabilities that will raise its rank and position in the Central-Eastern Europe region,' the general added. 'So this is a very significant purchase, and in my opinion this purchase brings not only operational capabilities, combat capabilities, but also re-establishes Poland's position in the region.' The US approved the potential Foreign Military Sale of the AARGM-ERs in April 2024. At the time, the approval was for 360 of the missiles with an estimated price tag of $1.275 billion. However, FMS announcements are often larger than final deals when completed. Poland is considering future purchase of advanced weapons for use on the F-35, including the JSM anti-ship or land attack cruise missiles, GBU-53/B StormBreaker air-launched precision-guided glide bombs, as well as new AIM-120D AMRAAM or Meteor BVRAAM missiles, Lt. Col. Łukasz Treder told Breaking Defense last summer. Treder, part of the F-35 implementation team for the Polish Air Force, said the missions that the jet will perform are secret and will depend on NATO declarations and Poland’s national requirements. However, he did not 'using these aircraft … for Quick Reaction Alert missions would be a waste of their combat potential.' The first F-35A Husarz for the Polish Air Force (AZ-02) flew on Dec. 2, 2024. The roughly one hour flight took off and at NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas, located next to the Lockheed Martin plant where the fighters are built. The second Polish F-35A (AZ-01) flew one day later, and the third (AZ-03 flew on December 17. The first pair of jets then arrived at Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Nebraska on Dec. 23. The two aircraft will be used to train Polish fighter pilots and maintainers to use the newest generation jets. Overall, six F-35s are to be delivered to Poland in 2025, with another 14 scheduled for 2026, followed by four each in 2027 and 2028 and the final two in 2029. The Air Force’s 85th Fighter Group, a tenant at Ebbing ANGB, will conduct the F-35 pilot training for the Foreign Military Sales program. 'The arrival of Poland’s first F-35s is a significant milestone for our state, the nation and our allies who will train on this fifth-generation fighter at Ebbing Air National Guard Base,' said Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas adjutant general.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/poland-adds-long-range-strike-to-its-f-35-fleet-with-aargm-er-missiles/	2025-01-29T12:15:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Poland-AGM-88G_1-scaled-e1738172353464.jpg
Army anticipates return of repaired logistics vessel prototype by month’s end	The Army's Maneuver Support Vessel-Light. (Vigor LLC photo) WASHINGTON — After needed repairs sidelined the US Army’s new logistics ship for nearly a year, the service anticipates receiving the vessel back by month’s end before finally launching into a testing series. Designed to replace the aging Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8), the Army tapped Vigor Works to produce the initial Maneuver Support Vessel-Light (MSV-L) prototype. But after the vessel was delivered to the service in early February 2024, it began experiencing mechanical issues en route to Camp Pendleton and was turned to the company for evaluation and repairs. 'The prototype vessel’s repairs to its cooling system were completed at the OEM’s [original equipment manufacturer’s] site in Washington state,' a Program Executive Office for Combat Support &amp; Combat Service Support spokesperson wrote in an emailed response to questions by Breaking Defense. 'Repair is complete; expect the vessel to be returned [in] January 2025,' the Army spokesperson later added. The repair check totals $200,000, the service said, and the delays testing the new vessel in open waters did not halt work on subsequent boats. Right now, the Army is moving forward with the production of a second MSV-L, while also awarding deals for the company to build three more. In the meantime, the service is working though the logistics associated with getting that first MSV-L prototype into the US Indo-Pacific theater by the April-June timeframe to resume experimentation and follow-on test activities. And while the service didn’t expand on what that may include, last year a two-star general leading the 8th Theater Sustainment Command provided some insights. 'Everything that we can knock off that list we will do in the archipelago … because that allows us to do the tests in the environment that the vessel will operate in ultimately,' Helwig added. 'It’s a great opportunity to really kind of get the vessel, then see it in the environment that, ultimately, it’ll operate in.' While the Trump administration could potentially shake up foreign policy and national security priorities, for now preparing for a military contingency against China in the Indo-Pacific remains a chief focus. For the Army, that means looking for ways to sustain the force in the Indo-Pacific theater and making sure its fleet of existing vessels, the new MSV-L, unmanned vessels, and a possible MSV-Heavy are all ready to go. Part of that work centers on finding new avenues to maintain and repair vessels abroad, and the service put this to the test as its contribution to the Pentagon’s recent Regional Sustainment Framework initiative. Rolled out in mid-2024, the Pentagon plan called on the service to first focus on the Indo-Pacific region and finding ways to sustain equipment abroad. Steven Morani, the acting assistant secretary of defense for sustainment, told reporters on Jan. 17 that services are conducting pilot programs, or 'pathfinders,' to help the department work through some of the contractual relationship questions. 'What we try to do is look at those workloads that were already established starting with the systems that the services are operating regionally already,' he explained. 'We also looked at programs where you had foreign military sales of equipment and you had arrangements in the theater where companies, both US and allied, are doing that repair and expanding that. We’re working through some of the data rights issues for systems.' For the Army’s 'pathfinder' in the Indo-Pacific region, its Logistics Support Vessel-3 — the USAV General Brehon B. Somervell — underwent repairs in South Korea late last month instead of returning stateside, Lt. Gen. Heidi Hoyle, the Army’s deputy chief of staff for logistics (G-4), explained in early January. That move, the three-star general explained, saved the crew from traveling 9,000 nautical miles over 38 sailing days just to get back to the US West Coast. 'We did this operation in Korea, it was five days, we have now proven that we can work with our partners and allies for ships to conduct maintenance forward in the battle space,' Hoyal added. Maj. Gen. Michael Lalor, the commander of the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, worked on the contract piece of that work and said the Army is now 'actively renegotiating that and expanding' similar deals in the region and around the globe.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-anticipates-return-of-repaired-logistics-vessel-prototype-by-months-end/	2025-01-29T11:01:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/MSV1-scaled-e1677702737147.jpg
Blockchain, big data and genAI: US Army uses novel tech to track billions in Ukraine aid	An airmen double-checks a shipment of aid bound for Ukraine in 2022 (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Marco A. Gomez) WASHINGTON – With foreign policy in flux, new Army contracts in question, and humanitarian aid frozen, including to Ukraine, there’s never been more pressure on the Pentagon to prove that military aid to Kyiv — almost $70 billion to date — is being managed efficiently and accountably. The lion’s share of that burden falls on Army Materiel Command which oversees everything from arsenals building cannon barrels, to warehouses of equipment being transferred under Presidential Drawdown Authority, to an international distribution network spanning private companies, NATO allies, and frontline Ukrainian brigades. American logisticians are rightly famous for their ability to move 'iron mountains' of equipment around the world. But their proficiency at keeping track of it is patchy, as the Pentagon's own Inspector General has pointed out in several recent audits of aid to Ukraine. So making sure the iron mountains arrive in good condition at the right place and time requires managing a mountain of paperwork. Nowadays, most of that data is virtual — but hardly all. 'Inside of the Army, I would say near 100 percent of that data is automated,' said Chris Hill, AMC’s chief data and analytic officer. That is, he told Breaking Defense in an interview, the information is automatically, digitally transmitted from database to database without needing a human to laboriously re-key it. But everybody else’s data? Not so much. Kyiv’s post-Soviet institutions are still struggling to implement modern business process automation services such as SAP, said Lt. Col. Colby Smithmeyer, a senior AMC analyst. So, he told Breaking Defense, 'data we’re getting from the Ukrainians, it could be coming from a phone call from a liaison officer, it could be an Excel spreadsheet in digits, or it could be a printed-out Excel spreadsheet.' Standard Defense Department data systems were never built to tame such a mad menagerie of different sources. So soldiers and civilians across AMC have innovated, improvised, and on occasion outright kludged together a digital toolkit including big-data analytics, generative artificial intelligence, and, in their most recent experiment, blockchain. 'It’s pretty important we maintain visibility, accountability, and auditability of those specific pieces of equipment,' said Pat Sullivan, a civilian Highly Qualified Expert at the command, in an interview with Breaking Defense. 'We have to maintain that full end to end [visibility] in a contested environment, [so] we can see it and trace it and track it all the way through.' RELATED: Telemaintenance and stockpiles: Army Materiel Command takes its own lessons from Ukraine Any given combat vehicle, box of ammunition, or pallet of supplies may begin its journey in one of AMC’s own arsenals, another government agency’s warehouse, or a contractor’s factory, officials explained in interviews. Then the aid has to be handed off to the military transport units and/or private shipping companies that physically move it overseas, overseen first by US Transportation Command, which handles inter-theater movements, and then by US Army Europe and Africa, a four-star theater command. Only then does it reach the Ukrainians. As a shipment moves through the system step by step, each of those actors needs to be able to see what’s coming to them next. Then, once they receive it, they need to update everyone else that it’s arrived intact and in the proper hands, plus when and how they’ll send it on. So AMC needs a system where all the authorized actors — but no one else — can read and modify the data relevant to them — but not anything else. To track all these transactions securely, AMC is testing a technology best known for cryptocurrency: blockchain. Like crypto, after all, information on military aid needs to be accessed securely by authorized users around the world who don’t share a single, centralized database (and who may not entirely trust each other). 'It proves traceability by creating an immutable record of transactions that allows DoD to track these assets,' said Maj. Matthew Goyette, who led a blockchain pilot exercise. 'It does away with all of the manual processes, the Excel sheets, the PowerPoints, the calls, the emails. The data is cryptographically hashed into that ‘block’…for select parties to see at the exact level you want them to see it at.' Officials declined to say when the pilot began and how long it lasted, but they did say AMC tapped expertise on blockchain from a host of partners in and out of government: Defense Logistics Agency, Air Force Research Lab, public-private digital manufacturing hub MXD, and contractor SIMBA. But they couldn’t just copy-and-paste existing commercial solutions, which notoriously consume a lot of processing power and electricity, Sullivan and Goyette emphasized. Instead, they built a slimmed-down blockchain that only stored encrypted keys to the logistics tracking data, rather than putting all the files in the blockchain itself. What’s next? 'We’ve proven out the initial pilot and we’re determining with leadership how we scale [up],' Sullivan said. The technology’s future at AMC will depend on finding funding, he acknowledged. But he’s optimistic because the command has been investing resources and high-level attention into a lot of digital projects, of which blockchain is just the latest one. Much of that investment has been driven by the demands of suppling Ukraine. With its vast logistical responsibilities, Army Materiel Command has been keenly interested in better data management for years. But 'once the Russians invaded [Ukraine], it really lit a fire under this,' Hill said. 'We went over there with algorithms that were not really ‘AI.’ I would call them ‘advanced analytics,’' he told Breaking Defense. 'We decided we’ve got to bring more AI in this, [and] about a year ago, we started really getting into the generative space.' While chatbots are infamous for 'hallucinating' made-up information, intensive study reassured the Pentagon that GenAI can be constrained to cite only authoritative government data, instead of random Reddit posts about putting glue on pizza. Once suitably tamed, Large Language Models show a remarkable ability to digest and organize what’s called 'unstructured' data: information that’s interspersed through a passage of ordinary English text, rather than carefully categorized and labeled in a 'structured' database. This capability comes in especially handy for AMC, because the Presidential Drawdown Authority orders specifying what aid to give Ukraine are, in fact, unstructured. Instead of sending out precisely formatted files that load seamlessly into military logistics databases, the White House issues PDFs. At first, Army personnel simply had to sit down, read through every order line by line, and hand-type all the relevant information into the proper fields in AMC databases, explained Lt. Col. Joseph Lavalle-Rivera. But manual data entry is notoriously labor-intensive, slow, and prone to error, and the drawdown orders were just too big, and the schedule too tight, to do it all by hand. Even in early orders, Lavalle-Rivera said, 'you would have 200 items with 12 to 15 different fields associated with each.' That’s easily over 2,500 individual entries per drawdown order — and they just kept growing. Next AMC tried to automate the data entry by writing traditional, non-AI code to search the drawdown orders, extract the data, and upload it. This worked better but only briefly, because traditional IF-THEN-ELSE software struggled to parse even minor formatting changes from one PDF to the next. 'The format constantly changes, and every time they change the format, add a new piece of data, or whatever... it immediately breaks [the code],' Lavalle-Rivera told Breaking Defense. 'Even changes of an additional tab, extra lines, can throw things like that off.' So rather than constantly hand-write and rewrite code to parse the PDFs, AMC turned to GenAI. At first that didn’t work well either. On the upside, the LLM didn't 'hallucinate' and add made-up data, because it was restricted to answering based on what was actually in the official documents. On the downside, it often omitted data that was actually there, because the algorithm initially interpreted items marked 'classified' as things it wasn't allowed to tell its user about. It took Lavalle-Rivera 'about a week of messing with it' before the LLM would give a full and accurate answer, he said. 'A lot of that comes down to the prompt engineering. &#8230; There’s more of an art to it than you’d think.' Once the LLM was tamed, and its outputs double-checked, it has provided an efficient way to turn unstructured Presidential Drawdown Authority PDFs into structured data that’s digestible by Army Materiel Command’s big-data system. That system is a variant of the Army-wide Vantage platform, but modified to allow easier input of non-US data from partners like Ukraine. The command calls it APAS, the AMC Predictive Analytics Suite — 'predictive' because it not only tracks the flow of arms and supplies but tries to forecast what Ukraine (or US units) will need next. 'If you need ammunition and you’re in eastern Ukraine and you have to go through the process of requesting that, getting a Presidential Directive, having that get funded, acquiring the ammo, shipping it, etting it there — that’s quite a long timeline,' Hill told Breaking Defense. '[Hence] the importance of predictive analytics: I’ve got to know when I’ve got a problem a couple of months out so I can work that now.' The US Army is learning a lot about the challenging logistics of modern war as it supports Ukraine, added Smithmeyer. Starting out, he said, 'we didn’t have a good idea for a lot of these consumption [rates] because we didn’t have a good baseline.' Take the rate at which M777 howitzers wore out their gun barrels, he offered by way of example. 'The rate at they were firing was unlike anything we have seen certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan.' Ukraine is pouring ever greater quantities of real-world battle data into Army Materiel Command’s analytics, Smithmeyer said. 'Now we’re tracking the maintenance status of the [Ukrainian brigades in theater, we’re tacking the consumption of supplies in theater,' he told Breaking Defense. '[That] is building a lot of data sets that now we can use…As we collect more and more data, we’re able to get better and better predictions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/blockchain-big-data-and-genai-us-army-uses-novel-tech-to-track-billions-in-ukraine-aid/	2025-01-29T09:27:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Hi-res-220320-F-QD007-0103C-scaled-e1738164097982.jpeg
F-35A crashes in Alaska, pilot ejects safely	Two F-35A Lightning II aircraft fly over the Alaska Range en route to their new home at the 354th Fighter Wing, Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, April 21, 2020. (US Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Adam Keele) WASHINGTON — A US Air Force F-35A crashed at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement from the base. The jet’s pilot ejected safely and was taken to Bassett Army Hospital for evaluation but was deemed to be in stable condition. The crash occurred at 12:49 p.m. local time near the base’s air field and within its fenceline. Video circulating on social media showed the jet tumbling in free fall with its landing gear down just before impact, as what is presumably the aircraft’s pilot floated toward the ground with a parachute deployed. The stealth fighter exploded on impact and is likely a total loss. Emphasizing that it’s 'premature to speculate' about what led to the crash, Air Force Col. Paul Townsend, commander of the 354th Fighter Wing at Eielson, told reporters that 'the pilot was executing standard procedures and executing their respective mission, and essentially experienced an in-flight malfunction' before declaring an emergency and safely ejecting. The aircraft was in a 'landing phase' after conducting a 'local training event,' Townsend said. Eielson is located in the interior of Alaska, about two dozen miles southeast of the city of Fairbanks. The 354th Fighter Wing is 'the northernmost fighter wing in the world,' according to the wing’s website. The first F-35s were delivered to the base in 2020. Russ Goemaere, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), said in a statement to Breaking Defense that 'The JPO will support the Air Force in the investigation of the mishap. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our warfighters.' F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin said in a statement that the company is 'aware of the F-35 incident at Eielson Air Force Base. Safety is our priority, and we are standing by to support the United States Air Force as needed.' The Eielson F-35 crash is the second for the stealth jet in a year. A short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B developmental test jet previously crashed into a hillside in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in May 2024, adding strain to the program’s limited test fleet. The pilot involved in that mishap safely ejected as well. A full investigation will be carried out into the crash, and results could take months, if not longer, to become public. 'We are confident in the capability of that platform as the US’s premier fifth-generation fighter,' Townsend said of the F-35, stressing that the crash investigation will 'uncover' any contributing factors to the incident. 'But right now, I can stand and say that I have full faith in the capabilities of the F-35A.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/f-35a-crashes-in-alaska-pilot-ejects-safely/	2025-01-29T07:49:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/eielson-f-35-scaled-e1738163481700.jpg
Military services need to ‘sync up’ Replicator software, Navy official says	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. (U.S. Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WEST 2025 — As the Pentagon approaches its two-year deadline to get thousands of autonomous systems operational as part of the Replicator initiative, two Navy officials recently urged the services and the Pentagon to do more to coordinate their efforts, especially when it comes to software used on the systems. 'We do need to sync up on some of these solutions, right? Whether it's autonomous software, C2 [command and control] software, fight from the [Maritime Operations Center] MOC collaborative, heterogeneous software, we do need to do that,' Director of the Integrated Warfare (N9I) office, Rear Adm. Christopher Sweeney, said on a panel at AFCEA West on Tuesday. 'I can't have every fleet commander buying their software or their robot. I mean, some of that can happen, obviously, but we do have to settle up,' he later added. Commander of Naval Information Warfare Systems Command, Rear Adm. Elizabeth Okano, said on the same panel that to implement such an 'enterprise level' strategy, not only do Navy fleet commanders have to work together, but the services as a whole must do so too to truly make Replicator a multi-domain operation. Right now, that's not happening as much as it should, she said. 'We're not organized correctly,' she said. 'We're not incentivized to work collaboratively together.' She explained that certain program managers are rewarded on cost schedule performance, not 'on connecting the dots and saying, ‘Hey, you know what? This information is really good, and not only is this information good, but I'm going to figure out a way to unlock my information and give it to them [the other services] in a way that's meaningful for somebody else.' Chris Brose, chief strategic officer at defense firm Anduril, added that the wider government should be more 'assertive' in tracking the software capabilities involved in Replicator. To do so, Brose envisioned something like 'government reference architecture' that serves as a database that keeps track of all the various software the Pentagon is buying and how it will all work together. 'This needs to be something where the government is actually a bit more assertive on some critical things that will set those conditions, from a software perspective, how all of these capability comes together, sort of across that entire mission element, from automatic target recognition to mission level autonomy to the algorithms underlying it, to the different behaviors,' he said. 'All of those different things I believe need to be governed by something like a government reference architecture. Something where the government can have confidence in how these pieces are coming together.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/military-services-need-to-sync-up-replicator-software-navy-official-says/	2025-01-29T06:45:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/5356116-scaled-e1738101657589.jpg
Iran’s ‘Gaza’ drone makes military exercise debut	A model of Iran's Gaza UAV at DIMDEX in Qatar in March 2024. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) over the weekend offered a fresh look at what appeared to be an operational long-range drone dubbed 'Gaza' as it took part in a military exercise there. Iranian news reports said the unmanned aerial vehicle, whose bodyframe resembles the American-made Predator or Reaper drone, weighs over three tons and has a wingspan of 22 meters (72 feet). (For comparison the American MQ-9 Reaper UAV has a 66-foot wingspan.) The Gaza is claimed to have a range of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and can carry a payload up to 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds) — which could purportedly include 13 missiles. Samuel Bendett, an AI and unmanned systems expert at US-based CNA research organization, said those stats should be viewed with skepticism, at least for now. 'Any capability that is advertised has to ultimately be proven — so it remains to be seen if this particular drone can actually deliver on this capability,' Bendett told Breaking Defense. The Gaza, which was in development long before the most recent conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, was on display at Qatar's DIMDEX show in March 2024. At the time, representatives at Iran’s stand told Breaking Defense that the Gaza is a medium-altitude, low-endurance (MALE) UAV, equipped with satellite communication capabilities and has a maximum flight altitude of 35,000 feet. An airborne synthetic aperture radar meant to detect surface and underwater targets can also be equipped on the platform, they said. If the drone is as capable as adverstized, analyst Ryan Bohl said he could see it having a 'greater tactical impact on Iran's near abroad in places like Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan' as opposed to presenting a real threat to Iran's regional enemy, Israel, 'which has a sophisticated air defense network and the ability to shoot down slower moving drones like this which have to travel a great distance.' That said, Bohl, senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the RANE network, told Breaking Defense that if the drones were utilized 'against the Israelis or against the United States and Gulf Arab partners in the case of an all-out regional war, they would be a notable angle to conduct near abroad strikes on US forces in Iraq, Syria or the gulf.' Bohl said the drones could also see some success in the export market, whether to smaller aligned groups like the Houthis in Yemen, or to the Russian military, which the US says has used other, smaller Iranian drones throughout the conflict in Ukraine.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/irans-gaza-drone-makes-military-exercise-debut/	2025-01-29T04:06:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/429765236_724472513004242_5343046013244468278_n-e1709577273996.jpg
MQ-25 will fly in 2025, fly off carriers in 2026, says Navy’s air boss	A Boeing unmanned MQ-25 aircraft rests aboard the flight deck aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77). (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Brandon Roberson) WEST 2025 — The US Navy’s top operational aviator says he’s confident the service will have its new unmanned aerial tanker flying this year and operating off aircraft carriers in 2026, characterizing it as a key point in paving the way for future next generation aircraft. 'We will fly MQ-25 in 25. You can quote me on that. We will fly that platform in 25 and get that thing on a carrier in 26 and start integrating [it],' Vice Adm. Daniel Cheever, commander of Naval Air Forces, told an audience here at West in San Diego. 'That unlocks the future of manned-unmanned teaming.' 'We’re going after that thing in a big way so we can do manned-unmanned teaming off an aircraft carrier and that is a different world. It opens up the future of sixth-gen collaborative combat aircraft and everything that comes after it,' he continued. The MQ-25, also dubbed Stingray, is an unmanned tanker designed to refuel the strike fighter fleet while performing a secondary intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance mission. Its fielding is also expected to relieve pressure on the service’s F/A-18s which have had to act as aerial refuelers in the meantime, taking them away from strike missions. Boeing won the initial contract in 2018 to design and produce the aircraft, a bid that was strengthened by previous prototypes on the ultimately abandoned Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program. At that time, service officials said the aircraft would reach initial operational capability — Pentagon nomenclature effectively signifying the aircraft is ready for fielding — in 2024, but program hiccups have pushed that date into fiscal 2025. Boeing has previously conducted test flights with its prototypes, but Navy officials have targeted 2025 for its own test flights with the aircraft. Cheever, who the Navy also refers to as the 'Air Boss' because he is the most senior operational aviator, expressed confidence in the Navy’s ability to integrate MQ-25 into the air wing despite the operational challenges associated with unmanned technology and landing any aircraft onboard a carrier’s flight deck. 'I don't see a lot of issues bringing it together,' he said. 'I’m just going to turn the weapons tactics instructors loose, and they will exactly figure out how to operate this thing seamlessly in a manned-unmanned teaming [environment].' 'So, [I’m] pretty excited for that, because we need that capability and we need it this year to start flying,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/mq-25-will-fly-in-2025-fly-off-carriers-in-2026-says-navys-air-boss/	2025-01-28T13:58:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/mq-25-12.20.21-2-scaled-e1738099987404.jpg
Space Force plans 18 NSSL launches in 2025, including on ULA’s Vulcan	U.S. Space Force Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, Space Launch Delta 45 commander, and Assured Access to Space program executive officer, takes a tour of Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., Oct. 31, 2023. (U.S. Space Force photo by Senior Airman Tiarra Sibley) SPACE MOBILITY 2025 — The US Space Force is planning 18 launches under its current National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 program in 2025, along with four small launches carrying payloads under 400 pounds, according to Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, the program executive officer for assured access to space. That includes, she told to the third annual Space Mobility Conference in Orlando, Fla., missions to be conducted by United Launch Alliance's Vulcan heavy lifter — despite the fact that the Space Force has yet to certify the rocket to carry NSSL payloads following a problem during its second qualifying launch in October. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Panzenhagen said that of those 18 planned launches, 11 were slated for Vulcan and seven for SpaceX's Falcon 9. Col. Jim Horne, senior material leader for launch execution systems whose shop is overseeing ULA's certification process, said during the media briefing that the Space Force is 'still working through' the problem that caused a nozzle on one of the solid rocket boosters to fall off. The service is 'targeting mid-February' for being able to give the all clear to Vulcan, 'depending on how some of the anomaly investigation activities go.' Panzenhagen further noted that the service is planning to begin launches under the next phase of the NSSL program, called Phase 3, in 2025. Those would be under Phase 3 Lane 1, which covers launches to easier to reach orbits, payloads with less mass, and missions that are not absolute must-gos. Lane 1 launch providers also face fewer 'certification requirements,' she said, including only having to complete one successful launch meeting Space Force requirements. For example, while she said that all the data has yet to be collected and analyzed, Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket is expected to become Phase 3 Lane 1 certified. New Glenn made its maiden launch on Jan. 16. 'The early indications are that the payload got to where it needed to be. So, as we're going through the data, something still could be flagged where we would say, &#8216;Wait, this doesn't fully count. But the early indications are that it does look like for our purposes it was a successful launch,' Panzenhagen elaborated. Panzenhagen said that the 'launch cadence' at both the service's Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and the Western Range at Vandenberg SFB in California will be higher in 2025 than in 2024. 'I would expect 2026 is going to be higher as well. We've been going up pretty steadily in about a 25-to- 30 percent increase per year, and I think we'll continue to increase at that rate, or at least the next couple years,' she said. This 'ops tempo' is worrying for the Space Force, Panzenhagen said, because of personnel shortfalls. At the moment, she explained, the number of billets being funded is based on the launch rates for 2017. 'We've implemented automation, we've re-looked at processes and streamlined a lot of things, but it does continue to be a stressing ops tempo when it comes to manpower,' she said. Panzenhagen said her focus going forward is 'resiliency' across her portfolio, which includes launch vehicles, range infrastructure and capacity, and base security. 'I want resiliency in the different types of launch vehicles that we have, so, if you have a fleet running anomaly, you have other launch vehicles that you can look to other families and launch vehicles. I want resiliency across companies so, God forbid, if a company has a strike or a serious financial issue that would prevent them from continuing operations, I have other options. Resiliency across supply chains, because if something happens in another sector, we want to make sure that they continue to launch,' she said. The Space Force also is working to increase the number of launches at both ranges by speeding payload processing, Panzenhagen explained. 'One bottleneck is payload processing facility. So, we are very fortunate to get a congressional add in 2024 that will go towards expanding payload processing capacity on the Western Range. We are hopeful to get an add in 2025 to do something similar in the Eastern Range. We're using an innovative acquisition strategy called the commercial solutions opening to be able to quickly obligate those funds and get that capability realized,' she said. Likewise, Panzenhagen noted, the service has been working to improve base security, including beefing up cybersecurity. 'We're really investing in defense at the two space ports — whether it's physical security, cybersecurity, just across the board — and we're exercising all these things too to make sure that you know when the bad day comes we know how to react and we know how to react quickly, and, ideally, we know how to mitigate,' she said. In the end, Panzenhagen said, it all comes down to ensuring that the warfighters can do their job of deterring adversary aggression. 'I see our ability to deter based on the launch capacity we have, our readiness, our resiliency, because ultimately, we have a deterrent effect when the adversary knows that,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/space-force-plans-18-nssl-launches-in-2025-including-on-ulas-vulcan/	2025-01-28T13:21:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/231101-F-GJ070-1007-scaled-e1738086977356.jpg
Air Force moves forward with next-gen engine work, raises GE, Pratt contracts to $3.5 billion each	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) WASHINGTON — The US Air Force is moving ahead with development of a next-gen fighter engine following awards to manufacturers GE Aerospace and RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney, according to contracts announced by the service Monday evening. The awards, issued under the service’s Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, raise the total potential value of contracts previously issued to both companies from $975 million to a new ceiling of $3.5 billion each. No funds are being issued at the time of the announcement, the contract notice says, and work is planned to wrap up in July 2032. The NGAP program is expected to produce the engine that will power the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, though the effort to field the sixth-gen jet is currently paused pending a decision on the way forward by the Trump administration. GE and Pratt are expected to fabricate full-up engine prototypes as part of the NGAP competition, where current plans call for eventually eliminating one of the vendors from the running. A representative for GE did not respond to a request for comment by press time. A Pratt spokesperson told Breaking Defense today that the company 'is working closely with the U.S. Air Force to execute on and meet NGAP program commitments. Our program remains on track for major milestones and we look forward to delivering for our customer.' According to fiscal 2025 budget documents released last year [PDF], the Air Force plans to spend about $1.3 billion through FY27 to complete development of the NGAP engine, with following work likely aimed at further assessments and readying the engine for production. The program draws from efforts by both companies under the Air Force’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), which developed prototype engines for the F-35. The Air Force axed the AETP program in 2023. By delivering better performance for features like thrust and fuel efficiency, the 'adaptive' engine technologies underlying both the NGAP and AETP efforts could herald a revolutionary leap in propulsion, officials have said. It’s not clear exactly where the two companies are in the development process. During an earnings call in October, GE CEO Larry Culp said the company was 'nearing completion of the detailed design' for the firm’s NGAP offering, known as the XA102. And in February 2024, Pratt announced that its NGAP offering, dubbed the XA103, completed a 'critical assessment' that 'move[s] the program closer to completing its detailed design review.' The FY25 budget documents say that detailed design will be followed by 'engine fabrication,' meaning both vendors could soon fashion their physical engine prototypes. The exquisite NGAP powerplant has been identified by former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as a potential source of cost savings for the NGAD fighter, whose projected price of several hundred million dollars per copy could prove prohibitive. Among other changes that could be made to the fighter, reducing the complexity of its engine could be one option to make the aircraft more affordable, Kendall said. Internal Air Force analysis recently validated the requirement for a manned, sixth-gen fighter, Breaking Defense previously reported. And remaining budget concerns could be ameliorated by a potential surge in defense spending championed by top Republicans on Capitol Hill. The NGAP contracts were issued amid what could be a total freeze on awards by the Army. As of Tuesday morning, an Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the service’s contract awards are continuing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/air-force-moves-forward-with-next-gen-engine-work-raises-ge-pratt-contracts-to-3-5-billion-each/	2025-01-28T12:47:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-R1-scaled-e1718985449640.jpg
Super Puma resurgence provides updraft for Airbus Helicopters annual order growth	Airbus Helicopters is under contract to manufacture 12 newly configured H225M Caracal helicopters for Dutch Special Forces (Airbus Helicopters) BELFAST — A much-needed spike in demand for Super Puma heavy-lift helicopters helped Airbus Helicopters deliver strong annual results in 2024, with the company’s product line recording gross orders, overall, of 455 rotorcraft across the year — a 10 percent increase compared to 2023. The Super Puma family (comprising civil and military H215/M and H225/M variants) recorded a total of 58 orders, a welcome uptick after a difficult 2023 where Airbus failed to secure a single order for the line. At a military level, 2024 orders for the Super Puma included The Netherlands and Romania. Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even told reporters during an annual results call on Monday, 'It's really a strong performance [from the Super Puma], confirming that this helicopter is really well positioned and meeting well the demand of our customers.' He added, 'We are committed to the product, and I'm optimistic that we'll be able to continue this positive trend in the year to come.' Even also said that a contract with Iraq for a dozen H225M helicopters is now 'in force.' 'I see a good momentum in the [Middle East] region for the years to come,' he said, referring to potential new business not just for the H225M program, but also H145M light-twin and NH90 multirole helicopters. A standout performer in terms of 2023 business, drawing 186 orders, the H145M saw demand marginally drop off to 114 aircraft last year. At the other end of the spectrum, the embattled NH90 multirole helicopter did not receive any orders in 2024, with the H160 medium utility type gaining only four. Even said he was not 'at all disappointed' by the H160 low order total because the company is 'committed to the market for the long term' and stressed that aircraft performance has so far exceeded customer expectation. The military version of the H160 has a long future ahead, as it is under development to support France’s Light Joint Helicopter program, comprising of 169 aircraft. On a lack of orders for the NH90, he similarly said that assessment of the multirole rotorcraft is based on a 'long-term' market view and that priorities for the program include improving fleet availability rates, reducing maintenance workload issues and preparing for a production ramp up. The NH90 has been troubled by delivery delays, poor availability rates and contract cancellations, with an Oslo court, for example, set to begin proceedings, this year, relating to Norway's decision to terminate a contract for 14 aircraft. On a more positive note for helo-maker NHIndustries, in June 2024, the company announced the launch of the NH90 Block 1/Software Release 3 upgrade, backed by Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy which covers integration of the new Link 22 datalink, Leonardo’s LEOSS-T Electro-Optical gimbal, sonar equipment and 'additional weapons integration,' according to the manufacturer. 'Im really optimistic about the future of this helicopter,' added Even. His perspective chimes with Axel Aloccio, NHIndustries CEO, who drew on similar plans last year and said that 'commercial opportunities' amounting to sales in the region of '50 to 100' aircraft, are in play. Broadly speaking, Even shared that the military helicopter market remains 'stable,' adding, 'we all know the geopolitical context and the decision of many countries to increase defense budgets.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/super-puma-resurgence-provides-updraft-for-airbus-helicopters-annual-order-growth/	2025-01-28T11:39:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/unnamed-4-scaled.jpg
Denmark strengthens Arctic defense with $2B package for naval vessels, drones	HDMS Triton from the Royal Danish Navy's Thetis-class frigate fleet, patrols the waters of Greenland (NATO) BELFAST — Under a new Arctic and North Atlantic security agreement, Denmark says it will spend 14.6 billion kroner ($2.04 billion) to bolster defense in the region, based on the acquisition of new naval vessels, long-range drones and improved space capabilities. The pact was struck in 'close collaboration' with Greenland and the Faroe Islands, Denmark’s autonomous territories, according to a Danish Ministry of Defence statement. 'We must face the fact that there are serious challenges regarding security and defence in the Arctic and North Atlantic,' said Denmark’s Minister of Defence Troels Lund Poulsen in the statement. 'For this reason, we must strengthen our presence in the region. That is the objective of this agreement, which paves the way for further initiatives already this year.' Copenhagen said the spending pledge covers the purchase of three Arctic naval vessels capable of carrying helicopters and drones; two long-range drones with the 'ability to conduct surveillance over large areas at great distances;' and increased situational awareness through additional satellite 'capacity.' A fleet of four Danish patrol vessels currently protect the waters of Greenland year round, operating under the country's Joint Arctic Command based in Nuuk, according to NATO. A second Arctic and North Atlantic security agreement is also set to be finalized in the 'first half' of 2025. Copenhagen did not disclose any equipment details related to the forthcoming agreement, but said it will focus on 'strengthening deterrence and defence in the region.' The renewed effort to beef up Arctic capabilities follows a flurry of comments from US President Donald Trump threatening to buy Greenland and increase tariffs on Danish goods. Trump also said that he could not rule out taking the territory or the Panama Canal by force. Earlier this month, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pushed back on the military force takeover idea, telling local broadcaster TV 2 'I don’t have the imagination to imagine us getting there.' Frederiksen met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte today, but amid the growing tension between the US and Denmark, the alliance took the unusual step of advising press ahead of the meeting that there will be 'no media opportunity.' Frederiksen also met today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Previewing the 'whirlwind day of international diplomacy', Politico said it was an attempt, on Frederiksen's part, to prevent Trump's push for Greenland. Such efforts follow on from Poulsen announcing in December a separate $1.5 billion Greenland defense spending package covering two inspection ships, two long-range drones and two additional dogsled teams. Greenland, the world’s largest island, declared self-rule after a referendum in 2009 but defense and foreign policy remain under the control of Denmark. Situated between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, the US holds a strategic interest in the island, and as rising temperatures cool Greenland's glaciers, new shipping lanes are expected to open, likely leading to increased military competition. Existing Russian capabilities across the Arctic already threaten freedom of navigation for Washington and NATO allies. The US also operates the Pituffik Space Base from Greenland. According to a US Space Force factsheet, the base is the DoD’s 'northernmost installation' and is responsible for missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance missions. It also notes those operations depend on 'the solid-state phased-array radar operated by the 12th Space Warning Squadron (12 SWS) and Satellite Command and Control through the Pituffik Tracking Station operated by the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, Detachment 1.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/denmark-strengthens-arctic-defense-with-2b-package-for-naval-vessels-drones/	2025-01-28T11:14:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/231130-patrolling-greenland-1-e1738070582646.jpg
A shipbuilding action plan for the Trump administration	USS Pierre (LCS-38) at Austal USA's shipyard in Mobile, Ala., as it prepares for launching into the water. (Photo courtesy of Austal USA) As the Trump administration’s national security team takes office, shipbuilding will clearly be a top priority for the Pentagon, the National Security Council, and even the president himself. The reason for this focus is simple. China is leveraging its booming commercial shipbuilding industry to expand its military capabilities, whereas shipbuilding in the United States is virtually a monopsony, with the US Navy being the near-exclusive customer. While our warships have quality that our competitors simply cannot match, it will be increasingly difficult to dominate the seas if we lack the quantity of ships that are needed. There are immediate opportunities for the incoming administration and Congress to move the needle on shipbuilding. Use the tools at hand. Any plan to improve shipbuilding must begin with a bottom-up review of the root causes of the differing challenges within each program. This need not be an extensive reform of major acquisition authorities, which could take years to design and implement. Instead, the focus should be assessing what can be done under current contractual and statutory authorities to address the problems specific to each program or each shipyard — whether that pertains to people, facilities, supply chain, process, or something else. While working on that review, the upcoming budget should prove shipbuilding is a top priority. The Biden administration and Congress unleashed billions of dollars of investment in the submarine and broader shipbuilding industrial base, attacking fragility in the supply chain, difficulties in workforce recruiting, and opportunities with advanced manufacturing. But more needs to be done, including raising wages for shipyard workers to compete with other employers, and investing in modernized shipyard infrastructure. Most importantly, this process of thinking about how to use authorities at hand and making changes must begin immediately, in order to justify a larger shipbuilding budget. Friends can help. The strengths of American naval technology are being challenged by China’s hyperscaling of shipbuilding capacity. While the US barely registers in the world market as a commercial shipbuilder, the good news is that our allies — particularly South Korea and Japan — make up the balance of the world’s shipbuilding capacity not currently serviced by China. Our Navy is significantly short of the number of logistics vessels that it needs for worldwide operations, to say nothing of what would be required during a conflict. Leveraging our allies’ commercial shipbuilding capabilities is a clear opportunity, but how to do so is less straightforward. President Donald Trump himself seems on board with this idea. In an early January interview, Trump said, 'We used to build a ship a day. We don’t build ships anymore. We want to get that started. And maybe we’ll use allies, also, in terms of building ships. We might have to.' The president will certainly demand that a plan to capitalize on US and allied shipbuilding capabilities will be a win for America, which will mean wins for key stakeholders: the Navy, shipbuilders, shipyard workers, and suppliers. Helping them all come out ahead is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity for the incoming administration to convene partners in industry, labor, Congress, and the Navy to hammer out a plan this year. Get real about how much ships cost. Each year, the president’s budget tells Congress that a certain number of ships can be bought for a precise amount of money. The point has been reached where those numbers are wrong more often than they are right. We must restore realism in budgeting for ship procurement. And it’s not as if this is an impossible thing to figure out: Analysts outside the Navy, particularly the Congressional Budget Office, are right far more often than they are wrong. For years, ships have been budgeted at a lower costs than they can be produced. This means the Navy is asking Congress each year for additional funds to complete ships already under construction. Congress has lost its patience for these follow-on costs, and this practice must end. A renewed emphasis on budgeting to independent cost estimates, rather than rosy scenarios, could produce sticker shock. But it is preferable to the current trap of not reliably fulfilling promises to buy each ship at a transparent price. Get the right people in the right seats. While not a sexy, high-level job, there is no position more important to shipbuilding reform than the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition. This official will be responsible for building and executing the plan to reform shipbuilding, and there is no alternative to having a Senate-confirmed official in the seat as soon as possible. The president should nominate, and the Senate should confirm, a fully qualified candidate by this summer. It’s not just the Navy. It’s America. Finally, and most ambitiously, the administration and Congress must look beyond the Navy as the source of, and solution to, our nation’s eroding maritime industrial strength. The shipbuilding industrial base is a subset of the defense industrial base, and the defense industrial base is a subset of the American industrial base. Creating policies for the Department of Defense to help shipbuilders is good; whole-of-government efforts to invigorate manufacturing are better. All levers of government power must be put on the table to maximize the impact of the renewed focus on shipbuilding. That includes renewed focus on national workforce training programs — not just those at the waterfront — and examining how grants and tax credits can incentivize industry investing in its own renewal. Addressing the shortfalls in America’s maritime industrial base is not the only action that needs to be taken to improve our military capabilities to match the challenges to our security, but the remedies are unique. Maximizing our military advantages in other domains or capabilities requires approaches focusing on accelerating technology adoption, removing red tape, or sometimes simply increasing production rates (read: more funding). But shipbuilding is different than the rest of America’s arsenal. Solutions to this problem will not be found in disruptive start-ups, an organizational change, or simply writing bigger checks and expecting a different outcome. Instead, the common thread among these recommendations is that rethinking the business of shipbuilding offers a more promising outcome for our economic, political, and military strength. But we have to start now.

Iranian official says Tehran has purchased Russian fighter jets: Reports	A Russian Su-35 flies near an American F-16 on Sept. 23, 2024 in what US officials called an unsafe manuever. (Department of Defense video) BEIRUT — In what appears to be another sign of the tightening of relations between Iran and Russia, a senior Iranian military official reportedly confirmed that Tehran has completed the purchase of Russian Sukhoi SU-35 fighter jets. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen. Ali Shadmani was quoted by an Iranian news outlet as highlighting the deal, according to Reuters and Russia's TASS news agency. 'Whenever necessary, we make military purchases to strengthen our air, land, and naval forces. &#8230; The production of military equipment has also accelerated,' Shahdamani said, according to Reuters, though he did not say how many jets had been purchased or for how much. He warned that 'if the enemy acts foolishly, it will taste the bitter taste of being hit by our missiles, and none of its interests in the occupied territories will remain safe,' pointing at Tehran’s regional enemy, Israel. In November 2023 Iranian officials reportedly finalized the deal with Russia. Shadmani's comments came just days after Tehran and Moscow inked a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty, to boost cooperation in many domains, including defense. Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, was circumspect about Shadmani's reported comments. 'Seeing will be believing in the case of the Su-35 and Iran. Given the number of false starts, early reports, rumors, and even misinformation about the matter, seeing the plane in Iran will be the truest indication that the deal has gone through,' Ben Taleblu told Breaking Defense. He said that such reports regarding training, payment or notes of a finalized deal 'are designed to manage expectations about the Russia-Iran relationship while politically helping Tehran bolster its battered deterrence.' But should the planes enter Iran's service, Ben Taleblu said they would significantly enhance Iranian territorial defense, particularly after the regime’s long-range air defenses, 'which were also Russian provided, were damaged or destroyed by Israeli airstrikes last year.' Iran currently operates a number of Russian warplanes including Su-24 MK and Mig-29 A and outdated US-built fighter jets including the F-4 and F-5E. The SU-35, introduced in 2014, is a singleseat 'primarily air superiority fighter, but with [a] secondary air-to-ground capability,' according to a US Army database. The purchase will make the Islamic Republic more of a hybrid warfighter in the Middle East, posing 'an additional layer of challenges for those seeking to land an uncontested blow against the regime’s nuclear or military infrastructure.' Still, he said, the planes 'will not revolutionize Iran’s long-range strike capabilities overnight given the regime’s emphasis on unmanned systems and the time needed to train Air Force personnel.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/iranian-official-says-tehran-has-purchased-russian-fighter-jets-reports/	2025-01-28T09:54:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250128_DVIDS_russian_su35_8669046-scaled-e1738086120412.jpg

‘What the f— is going on?’ Confusion, uncertainty in industry as Army contracts seemingly halted	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) WASHINGTON — The defense industry is in a state bordering between confusion and panic, following what could be a pause awarding new Army contracts as the service reviews its plans under the Trump administration. The fear among industry now is that this move is just the first in what would amount to a Pentagon-wide halt on new awards, for an indefinite period of time. Word of some sort of freeze on Army contracts began circulating late Friday, and by Monday evening was moving quickly through industry, the Hill and the Pentagon — but with a lack of certainty from anyone about what, exactly, was going on. That includes inside the Army, where as of Tuesday morning different officials seemed unsure what the guidance meant. In a statement, Army spokesperson Ellen Lovett said, 'Army contracting activities continue to move forward. As is customary, the Army is currently conducting a review of existing solicitations and awards of contracts to ensure that our programs are aligned with the incoming leadership’s policies and directives. We remain committed to transparency and being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.' However, that clashes with information from a well-placed Army source who told Breaking Defense that the service is 'pausing and reviewing' contracting activities and outgoing solicitations. The source couldn’t say how long this may last and it wouldn’t be responsible for the service to put an 'X-day pause' in place, especially if conditions change with a new leadership team in place. (Bloomberg reported late Monday that it could last as long as several months.) 'It’s a bit of a pause and review, excluding things directly tied to readiness, modernization and people,' the Army source said this morning, noting it 'touches all aspects of the requirements and contracting process.' However, the source did not detail what sorts of programs would fall into the readiness category. The confusion seemingly stems from the way the news was circulated amongst the service and then to industry. According to multiple sources, the guidance came down in an email as opposed to a formal memo, leading to uncertainty among program managers about how and when to implement it. As of press time, it’s unclear who penned the email or to whom it was originally sent, but that hasn’t stopped word of it from ricocheting around the Army community. There is 'certainly confusion, escalating to concern,' said one industry source, one of several who spoke to Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity. 'Especially among companies who were about to get something, or been told they have something, or even been selected but now don’t know if the money will come.' Or, as a second industry source asked Breaking Defense during a Monday call, 'What the f— is going on?' According to six industry and military sources who have seen it, the email states that there is 'Direction from the Secretary of the Army's office to immediately hold' on awarding all contract or Other Transaction Awards (OTAs), all solicits and requests for information, any funding association related to grants and any Congressional notifications. 'We are working with leadership to get additional direction as to the timeframe and may come back to you for impacts to mission,' the email says, before concluding with a final note: 'If you have an action that supports the Southern Border, please report up through your chain of command and we will seek permission … to move forward.' A second Army source familiar with contracting and requirements, noted that the relationship between the Army and the defense industrial base is a vital part of enacting the President's vision for lethality across the DoD. 'As we receive updated guidance on how to orient our effort, we are proactively evaluating ways to create decision space for the administration in support of new strategic priorities,' the source told Breaking Defense. 'Receipt of new guidance is an opportune time to evaluate the effectiveness of our existing contracting effort with the DIB, and is a necessary step in ensuring our resources are fully aligned to the department’s highest priorities. 'In the context of this review, some existing contracts may be modified or cancelled and others may be increased,' the source added. 'This level of agility is vital to ensure our Army is responsive to and in full support of achieving peace through strength,' In the meantime, industry is standing by for official contracting memos to drop while also circulating one from the director of the Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Laura Potter, one source dubbed the 'DEI memo.' Dated Jan. 21, that document, a screengrab of which was viewed by Breaking Defense, notes that ongoing solutions, requests for proposals, grants and notices of funds 'may not reflect' new administration priorities. It goes on to task the Army’s acquisition office with reviewing all those contracting options, establishing an 'operational planning team' to review all solicitations and grants and make recommendations. 'Immediately identify and recommend freezing or suspending' all contracting items related to DEI, critical race theory, climate change, transgender and abortion polices, it adds. At press time, Army public affairs had not immediately confirmed the existence of that Potter memo, but one service source said it sounded like one that went out. The big question swirling now is whether this is a service-specific issue or one that is going to spread elsewhere. As of Monday evening, multiple industry sources said they had not yet seen similar language for the departments of the Air Force and Navy, and both services, unlike the Army, awarded new contracts on Monday. However, a third industry source said they’ve been told that similar direction could come down from the Navy and Air Force in the coming days, and a fourth source said that Air Force direction could come as early as today. Spokespeople for the Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Asked whether the service was pausing new contract awards or solicitations, an Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the service continues to award contracts. When asked about a contracting hold Monday afternoon, a Pentagon spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense said, 'unfortunately I don’t have anything for you on that' and pointed out that the standard daily DoD contacts were announced. If a larger freeze on contracting is coming, it may be part of a push by the Trump administration writ large to halt federal spending and review it. The State Department issued guidance to that extent, effectively freezing foreign assistance money with a few key exceptions, such as Foreign Military Financing for Israel and Egypt. And according to a memo viewed by Breaking Defense, the Department of Energy issued guidance hours after Trump’s inauguration that 'any announcements or awards regarding procurement opportunities and contracts are to be put on hold,' including requests for proposals, request for quotations and contact negotiations — effectively the same guidance sent down by the Army. (DOE manages the nuclear warheads stockpile and works with the Navy on nuclear reactor issues.) Industry, meanwhile, is scrambling to figure out just exactly what is going on. 'Uncertainty doesn’t benefit anyone except our adversaries,' the second industry source said. 'Industry is spending time now trying to adjust to rumors when we should be absolutely dedicated to the national security mission. 'We need to get after our adversaries. This is absolutely unhelpful.'

Trump’s Iron Dome for America calls for space-based interceptors	Israel's aerial defense system Iron Dome destroys rockets fired from Southern Lebanon in Haifa, Israel on September 23, 2024. (Saeed Qaq/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON – A new executive order from President Donald Trump calls for greater investments for a multilayered homeland air defense system, including a requirement for the development of space-based interceptors. On the campaign trail in June, then-candidate Trump stated his desire to 'build a great Iron Dome over our country, a dome like has never seen before, a state-of-the-art missile defense shield that will be entirely built in America.' On Monday night, Trump signed an executive order to that effect titled 'The Iron Dome for America'. The order gives Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth 60 days to develop a plan to defend the homeland against 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.' 'Over the past 40 years, rather than lessening, the threat from next-generation strategic weapons has become more intense and complex with the development by peer and near-peer adversaries of next-generation delivery systems and their own homeland integrated air and missile defense capabilities,' the EO reads. Among the mandates in the executive order: Once plans for homeland defense have been sorted, the Pentagon is then to look at theater defenses. That includes to defend forward-deployed US force but also to 'increase and accelerate the provision of United States missile defense capabilities to allies and partners.' The fiscal 2026 budget request should take into account this EO, per the language, although the order itself does not contain any budgetary estimates. In an interview with Breaking Defense last week, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., expressed a belief that money that is obligated for defense during the reconciliation process could be used for such an Iron Dome for America construct. 'Israel is a small state about the size of New Jersey, so Iron Dome for Israel is much different from Iron Dome for America,' Wicker said. 'But a missile defense shield with a large satellite, a space-based component, that's going to be expensive, but it's a must, and it happens that the president feels some urgency in getting that done.' The actual Iron Dome currently in existence is an Israeli air defense system designed by Rafael, primarily to counter short-range rockets, small drones and artillery shells. The system is the lowest-tier of a broader, layered air defense network which also includes the middle-tier David’s Sling and higher-level Arrow defense capabilities. Rafael is also working on a directed energy version of Iron Dome known as Iron Beam, which executives have said may be active in 2025. But Iron Dome has become synonymous with Israel’s defense in a way the other systems have not, and as a result has become almost a shorthand for 'national air defense systems.' While many Israeli air defense capabilities have been built with American development dollars, those systems have not flowed back to the US in any meaningful way. And based on the Trump's previous pledge, these systems are going to be American-made. In a note to investors, TD Cowen analyst Roman Schweizer said the EO will likely 'require tens of [billions of dollars] to develop and field, and we see it as a massive expansion of existing programs of record as well as the development and fielding of nascent systems &#8230; We see this as very positive for a number of existing programs.' So while the EO may be short on details, there are some options to look at. The Pentagon already has air defense missions and plans in the works, including the National Capital Region Integrated Air Defense System designed to shield the Washington, DC area from incoming aerial threats, and includes systems like the Norwegian National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS). The Army is also leading the charge to set up a new air defense construct on Guam slated to include the service’s answer to Iron Dome dubbed the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC) Increment 2 system, as well as a C2 system called the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS), the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS) radar and more. The Army has directed energy capabilities under development like the IFPC High-Energy Laser and IFPC High-Powered Microwave. The Marine Corps is also working on mobile system called the Marine Air Defense Integrated System (MADIS), which uses a truck-mounted Iron Dome launcher with Tamir interceptors, and teams them up with a Common Aviation Command-and-Control System (CAC2S) and a mini battle management control (BMC) system, along with the AN/TPS-80 Ground/Air Task Oriented Radar (G/ATOR). Other possible components could include an over-the-horizon-radar (OTHR), designed to help spot low-flying, modern cruise missiles that can hug the curvature of the earth to evade detection. The US is planning a joint Canadian procurement to field new OTHR with an eye toward the Arctic as an anticipated vector of attack for adversaries like Russia. After originally planning to begin buying the radars in fiscal year 2024, the Air Force deferred the OTHR procurement out to FY26 to focus on 'risk reduction' activities in the meantime, the service told Breaking Defense in July. A public timeline released by Ottawa calls for an Arctic OTHR system to be operational by 2028 as part of a twenty-year and $38.6 billion CAD modernization project for NORAD. 'Canada and the US are committed to ensuring interoperability in its OTHR initiatives — and we are in active and constant dialogue to ensure alignment in our plans,' the Canadian Defence Ministry told Breaking Defense in July. 'Canada will continue to work closely with the United States to bolster NORAD’s ability to detect threats earlier and more precisely and to respond effectively.' Speaking on a quarterly earnings call hours after the EO dropped, RTX CEO Chris Calio sounded bullish of the potential for his firm under the new guidance. 'Look, as you know, we're a major partner in Israel's Iron Dome today. I suspect in the US, you're going to probably need to evolve that to address different types of potential threats, perhaps longer range strikes, protection of infrastructure. But again, layered, integrated air and missile defense systems are core to us. It's the bedrock of Raytheon, and they are, you know, among the best at it. And so we're ready to engage on this as it takes shape over this study period. 'We view this as a significant opportunity for us, something right in our wheelhouse.'

Closing the Arctic High North communications gap	Launched in 2024, the Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission (ASBM) satellites built by Northrop Grumman fly in a highly elliptical orbit to provide comprehensive coverage of the High North. (Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman) A groundbreaking partnership between Space Norway, the U.S. Space Force (USSF), Space Systems Command (SSC), Northrop Grumman, Viasat, and the Norwegian Armed Forces is redefining satellite communications in the Arctic, or the 'High North,' marking a significant milestone in delivering critical military and commercial communications to one of the most hard-to-reach locations on Earth. The Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission (ASBM), launched on August 11, 2024, from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, addresses the rapidly changing dynamics in the Arctic. As polar ice recedes, new sea lanes are opening, reshaping global trade routes and intensifying the region’s strategic significance. This shift has brought the High North to a new level of competition at the top of the world, with military and commercial activities increasing dramatically. 'As military forces conduct more operations in the Arctic area—whether that is submarines, surface vessels, aircraft and drones, or land forces in cold-weather environments—the need for communications has skyrocketed,' said Troy Brashear, vice president of Northrop Grumman’s Satellite Missions. 'At the same time, it’s hard to get communications up there, especially space-based communications.' Historically, the Arctic has posed significant challenges for military operations due to its harsh climate, difficult terrain, and logistical challenges. Those problems are compounded by the limitations of traditional geostationary orbit satellites which, due to Earth’s curvature, struggle to provide full coverage at high latitudes. Intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) in the High North has been particularly impacted by the orbital limitations of the present satellite communications infrastructure. A lack of connectivity in the Arctic has also resulted in a shortage of long-range, long-endurance unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) that can operate in the high latitudes. These lead to significant gaps in the ability of the U.S. and partners to react to potential threats. Communications for the Polar Region To address these challenges, Northrop Grumman, in partnership with Space Norway and the USSF, developed a two-satellite constellation designed to fly in a highly elliptical orbit, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the High North. Leveraging the proven GEOStar-3 satellite bus, each satellite hosts multiple payloads, including an X-Band payload for the Norwegian Armed Forces, a Ka-Band payload for satellite communications provider Viasat, and a Norwegian radiation monitor payload developed by a Norwegian company called Integrated Detector Electronics AS (IDEAS). Together, these payloads will enhance connectivity for a wide range of activities, from air travel to shipping and fishing to allied military operations above 65 degrees North latitude. An aspect of this mission is the USSF’s Enhanced Polar System Recapitalization (EPS-R) payload, which provides protected, anti-jam military satellite communications coverage to U.S. forces in the Arctic. Designed, built, and integrated by Northrop Grumman—which has been building protected MILSATCOM payloads for more than four decades—the EPS-R payload represents a pioneering approach to combining military and commercial capabilities on a single platform. The secure payload interface effectively isolates EPS-R from the rest of the satellite, paving the way for future hybrid military-commercial systems and significantly reducing the cost of distributing capabilities. 'This is the first time a secure U.S. government MILSATCOM payload has been integrated onto a commercial satellite, let alone with an international partner,' said Blake Bullock, vice president for Military Space Systems at Northrop Grumman. 'Thanks to the vision of our international customers and the U.S. Space Force, this innovative approach not only meets critical communications needs but also significantly reduces costs.' ASBM’s 24-hour coverage expands connectivity, including potential platforms like Northrop Grumman’s multi-intelligence MQ-4C Triton, a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft system, which could provide a strategic advantage in this vital region. (Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman) Enabling Collective Security in the High North ASBM’s successful launch underscores the importance of international collaboration in addressing the unique challenges of the High North. As this region becomes increasingly contested, reliable communications across all warfighting domains—air, land, sea, space, and cyber—are more critical than ever. ASBM’s 24-hour coverage expands connectivity, including potential platforms like Northrop Grumman’s multi-intelligence MQ-4C Triton, a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aircraft system (UAS), which could provide a strategic advantage in this vital region. Triton, operated by the U.S. Navy and Royal Australian Air Force, is particularly well-suited for operations in the High North. Its multi-intelligence capabilities, including signals intelligence (SIGINT) and a multifunction active sensor radar, enable it to track, classify and monitor targets across vast maritime areas. Triton’s ability to operate at altitudes above 50,000 feet and cover areas up to 4.2 million square nautical miles in a single flight makes it a critical asset in the region, especially as nations like Norway seek to enhance their unmanned aerial surveillance capabilities. 'The integration of ASBM with platforms like Triton is a game-changer for Arctic operations,' said Rho Cauley Bruner, Northrop Grumman’s program director for Triton. 'Triton’s high-altitude operations allow it to perform ISR missions effectively in the High North, providing essential data to support anti-submarine warfare and other strategic objectives.' As the High North increases in strategic importance, the U.S., Norway, and their allies will now have connectivity through ASBM, enabling future widespread ISR capabilities and serving as an important enabler for allied communications between warfighting domains. Looking ahead, the integration of military payloads on commercial satellites sets a precedent for future partnerships, enabling the U.S. and its allies to share costs and resources more effectively. With ASBM and high-altitude multi-sensor ISR platforms, Northrop Grumman and its partners are not only meeting today’s communication demands but also paving the way for a more connected and secure future in the High North.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/closing-the-arctic-high-north-communications-gap/	2025-01-28T05:24:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Northrop-Grumman-24-0522-mtr-ASBM_0209-COMP-v3-scaled.jpg
Lockheed hit by $2B in charges on 2 classified programs	A sign for Lockheed Martin Corp. stands outside the company's headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S., on Friday, Nov. 16, 2012. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — Higher than expected engineering costs and other difficulties forced Lockheed Martin to book $2 billion in losses on two classified programs in 2024, with a $1.7 billion hit occurring in the final quarter of the year, the company said in results today. The world’s largest defense contractor recorded total year end losses of $1.4 billion on a classified program in its missiles and fire control (MFC) portfolio as well as a $555 million overrun on a program in its aeronautics division, Lockheed said in a news release. Of that sum, the MFC program logged a $1.3 billion charge in the fourth quarter, with the aeronautics program incurring a $410 million charge during the same period. The MFC program losses stem from a contract where Lockheed can be reimbursed for costs during the initial phase of the program, but where follow-on contract options are locked under a fixed-price deal that holds Lockheed responsible for paying costs above a certain threshold. Lockheed estimates that all options exercised over the 'next several years' would be performed at a loss to the company, with the first $100 million charge occurring in the first quarter of 2024. 'During the fourth quarter of 2024, the company again assessed the likelihood that additional options may be exercised and now believe it is probable that all options will be exercised based on performance to date, future requirements of the program, discussions with the customer and suppliers, and anticipated customer funding, among other factors, resulting in the recognition of additional losses,' Lockheed said in a release. When Lockheed executives first disclosed the hit to the MFC program in April, CEO Jim Taiclet characterized the program as a long-running franchise that will deliver a strong return on investment after going through a period of teething pains, while Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave said the effort was expected to become profitable on an annual basis around the 2028 timeframe. Meanwhile, Lockheed described the impacted aeronautics program as a fixed-price incentive fee contract involving 'highly complex design and systems integration.' The company conducted a review of the program due to undisclosed near-term milestones and trends experienced in the fourth quarter, and recorded losses based on 'higher projected costs in engineering and integration activities that are necessary to achieve those forthcoming milestones,' it said. Because of the classified program losses, Lockheed's target earnings per share for 2024 amounted to $22.31. It recorded $5.3 billion in free cash flow for 2024. Net sales increased 5% to $71 billion. '2024 was another successful and productive year for Lockheed Martin,' Taiclet said in a statement accompanying results. 'Our 5% sales growth and record year-end backlog of $176 billion demonstrate the enduring global demand for our advanced defense technology and systems.' The company expects net sales of about $73.7 billion to $74.7 billion in 2025, with a free cash flow target of around $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/lockheed-hit-by-2b-in-charges-on-two-classified-programs/	2025-01-28T04:31:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/lockheed-logo-scaled-e1724445352572.jpg
Not on the same wavelength: Trump inherits spectrum fight between DoD, commercial industry	USS Ramage (DDG 61), equipped with the Aegis Weapon System. (US Navy photo) WASHINGTON — When newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth finally sits down in his Pentagon office, a complicated but consequential problem will be among those piled on his desk: What to do about the ongoing war over the electromagnetic spectrum. For years the Defense Department and commercial providers have tussled over usage of mid-band spectrum — between 1 GhZ (gigahertz) to 6 GHz usage, which makes up the 3.1-3.45 and 3.5 GHz S-band — widely considered to be the 'Goldilocks' zone of the spectrum. The DoD long has contended that this part of the spectrum band is essential for its various satellite communications, radars and navigation systems. However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike. The issue: spectrum space cannot be used by both parties at the same, and crowding too many broadcasters into nearby frequency bands causes interference that would have a crippling effect on critical warfighting missions, current and former DoD officials tell Breaking Defense. Commercial industry, on the other hand, says the DoD’s concern is overblown. 'It is a zero sum game. There is finite spectrum, and the physics of the spectrum, about the desirability of the lower [3 GHz band] both for our target acquisition radars and for 5G, this makes it very difficult,' John Sherman, former DoD chief information officer and now dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University, said in an interview. While it may seem the Trump administration has more pressing issues to tackle in its first month, industry is expecting to get a real sense of where the new government is going on this issue with a Feb. 13 meeting of the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). And if past statements from Trump appointees hold, the Pentagon may find itself on the back foot as it seeks to defend its spectrum turf. Here’s what you need to know about the fight over spectrum, key players and where the Trump administration may be leaning. The spectrum debate is hardly a theoretical one. The systems that rely on it are being used regularly by US forces around the world, said one defense official involved in the issue, speaking on background. The Navy’s Aegis AN/SPY radar, for instance, operates on the 3.1-3.5 GHz S-band. US ships in the Red Sea are currently 'using critical spectrum for radars to make sure drones and missiles are not striking their vessels or commercial ships. The military uses spectrum in Ukraine to thwart Russian missiles aimed at Kyiv and elsewhere. In the domestic United States, service members use the spectrum to train for overseas deployment,' the defense official told Breaking Defense in an email. That’s why, the defense official said, DoD 'must maintain spectrum access where and when needed to meet security objectives. Both international and domestic regulations regarding telecommunications and information and communication technologies (ICTs) must support this end state.' It technically would be possible for the DoD to move its signals from the 3.1-3.5 range frequencies so they can be given to commercial industry, but Sherman said that amounts to a massive undertaking that would require replacing countless US military radar systems, costing 'hundreds of billions' of dollars and creating a major security risk as the Pentagon scrambles to replace systems. Though the spectrum may be finite, there could be ways to share parts of it, or at least part of the time — an idea the Pentagon has suggested it’s not totally against. In fact, a prototype methodology for spectrum sharing was agreed way back in 2015 between NTIA and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates commercial spectrum use, for sharing of the 3.55 to 3.65 GHz band, otherwise known as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS). The CBRS supports a wide range of wireless communications, including keyhole markup language files that are used to store and display geographic data. That agreement was modified last summer, with input from the Navy, to expand spectrum access to the civilian side for high-speed internet services. The DoD last April announced that it is undertaking a study, along with the NTIA, which coordinates federal agency spectrum use, on what is called 'advanced dynamic spectrum sharing' with wireless providers in that band. The announcement came less than a week after release of a heavily redacted Pentagon report finding that — and echoing the defense official who spoke to Breaking Defense — any sharing scheme would need to ensure DoD has first dibs on access and strictly control other usage to avoid interference with military activities. It is unclear, however, how long that study might take, and similar technical reviews in the past have taken years. Lockheed Martin delivered the final Phase 1 Initial Prototype 5G testbed variant for the Open Systems Interoperable and Reconfigurable Infrastructure Solution (OSIRIS) to the U.S. Marine Corps at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. (Photo Credit: Lockheed Martin) The FCC and the NTIA are the two organizations with responsibility for setting US spectrum policy, and governing which users get access when to what bandwidths for what functions. Within NTIA, it is the Office of Spectrum Management that sets the regulations for spectrum allocations to federal agencies, as well as certifying that government equipment meets the necessary standards to comply with those regulations. In addition, there are two other interagency bodies that coordinate federal agency spectrum use. The Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) is made up of most of the spectrum using agencies, including each of the military departments, according to the group’s website. The IRAC, which also has a liaison function with the FCC, is chaired by NTIA and is primarily a technical body. It meets monthly. The second body is the Interagency Spectrum Advisory Council (ISAC), a top-level policy group composed of the principal members of each federal department that have an oversight control over spectrum use. It provides advice to NTIA and ensures 'that all decisions made by NTIA, including those involving representations to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), take into consideration the diverse missions of the Federal Government,' according to NTIA’s website. DoD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence both have seats on this council; for DoD it is the chief information officer who participates. The ISAC charter calls for a minimum of four meetings per year. DoD 'does have a little bit of a priority' in these groups, because it can 'play the national security card' in decision making that then requires secret-level discussions, said one government official on background— before rushing to add that the department 'rarely' takes such action. Within the FCC, the Office of Engineering and Technology 'develops and administers Commission decisions regarding spectrum allocations' for commercial telecommunications companies whether they use satellites, ground stations, ships or airplanes as broadcast platforms, according to the commission website. None of the relevant agencies, including the National Security Council, responded on the record for this report. The trouble comes when the NTIA and the FCC disagree on spectrum usage, which has long been the case regarding DoD’s hold on mid-band spectrum. At the working level, there are cooperation practices that are designed to avoid such disagreements in the first place, the government expert said. In the event that there is 'already an existing federal allocation,' then the FCC must consult with NTIA and unofficially discuss any plans they might have for commercial use of frequencies within or nearby that spectrum band, the expert said. The NTIA most often would then put together a technical group to undertake a study to see if there are compatibility issues and determine if spectrum sharing is possible between federal and non-federal users. The FCC, in turn, shares draft proposals for new rules for commercial spectrum allocation with the NTIA for unofficial comment prior to FCC publication. Further, the NTIA, DoD, and even Pentagon agencies and military departments can comment in public once an FCC proposal is officially sent to the Federal Register. Another government official told Breaking Defense, there is a 'formal memorandum of understanding' between the NTIA and the FCC that clearly defines 'coordination procedure when it comes to domestic rule makings.' That MoU, the first government official said, is an official legal document [PDF] that specifies that the NTIA administrator and the FCC chair meet on a quarterly basis. If there are disagreements that cannot be resolved at the staff level, the idea is that these would be elevated to the principals to work out. That document was signed in September 2022, following a GAO study in 2021 that found that there was no 'clear' path for resolving high-level disputes between NTIA and the FCC and what processes existed were 'chaotic.' 'If those meetings don't resolve them, they would go up to the White House, to the Executive Office of the President,' the expert added. But even if the president wants to get involved, the nation’s leader doesn’t have control over the FCC, meaning even the president is limited in their ability to resolve any disputes. When a DoD dispute with the FCC remains unresolved after being fanned all the way up the chain of command, a last ditch effort for the NTIA is to go to court to block FCC action. The agency 'can actually sue,' the first government official said, or make filings in lawsuits by other parties. This is what has happened in the long-running Ligado case, although the experts said such action is almost never taken. 'In 24 years, [Ligado is] the only case I can recall of that happening. It's extremely rare,' a second government official said. Staff Sgt.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) With the change in administration, it is not beyond the pale that the entire effort to find a way to share the Goldilocks spectrum could be scrapped. During Donald Trump’s first administration, the FCC leaned heavily toward the camp of wireless providers in the long-running spectrum wars — for example, controversially granting telecommunications firm Ligado a license to use spectrum over the vociferous objections of DoD, NTIA and a bevy of federal agencies that doing so would imperil the accuracy of GPS signals. Trump's recently appointed FCC chair, Brendan Carr, has been supportive of the wireless broadband industry's campaign to widen its access to the spectrum. In 2020, Carr, along with the rest of the FCC, voted to support Ligado’s application, and he was a vocal supporter of opening up spectrum for economic benefits. Further, the composition of Congress has changed and with it the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that traditionally has been strongly in DoD’s camp regarding spectrum access issues. In particular, former Sen. Jim Inhofe, R.-Olka., was unrelenting in fighting the FCC decision on Ligado. By contrast, current chair Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Missl, supported the FCC and Ligado during his previous tenure as chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Furthermore, the spectrum battle is showing to be not only a conflict between agencies or government bodies but is also becoming a partisan issue. Republicans recently announced they want to include wireless spectrum adjustments in their upcoming reconciliation package that would reinstate the FCC’s spectrum auction authority. However, Democrats contend that the revenue in the package should be used for communications investments instead of offsetting other spending, Broadband Breakfast reported.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/not-on-the-same-wavelength-trump-inherits-spectrum-fight-between-dod-commercial-industry/	2025-01-27T12:10:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/USS-Ramage-DDG-61-guided-missile-destroyer-Aegis-e1678391103574.jpeg
Space Force zeroed out funding for in-space mobility in FY26 budget request: Sources	Astroscale US is building a prototype satellite for refueling other satellites on orbit under a Space Force contract worth $25.5M. (Graphic: Astroscale US) ORLANDO, Fla. — The Space Force this year decided against including any new money in its initial fiscal 2026 budget request for in-space servicing mobility and logistics, according to two former senior government officials who had been involved in the process, despite strong support for such an investment from lawmakers and officials then serving in the Biden administration. Both the National Space Council and the Office of Management and Budget had been pushing the service to reinstate some funds for those efforts as the Biden administration wound down, according to those sources, but the Space Force declined to do so. The Space Force declined to comment for this report on the FY26 budget request. As it has yet to be approved by the new Trump White House, it's possible funds for space mobility have been or could be added back as the budget request worms its way through the administration before heading to Congress later this year. The Space Force could have quite a pot of money to disperse, as Air Force undersecretary Melissa Dalton reportedly said earlier this month that service officials 'successfully advocate[d] for $87 billion of additional topline,' apparently in reference to additional money requested for the next several fiscal budgets. 'While it is up to the next administration to determine where the ’26 budget will land, you have a compelling foundation for them to consider,' Dalton said, according to Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. On the eve of the third annual Space Mobility Conference here — originally launched in 2023 as a brainchild of US Space Command — supporters of Defense Department investment in technologies to enable what SPACECOM calls 'dynamic space operations' are facing a recent cooling of near-term interest from senior Space Force officials. Even SPACECOM, which previously has been vocal in calling for urgent funding for the mission, may now be looking at capabilities such as satellite refueling and repair, new propulsion systems, and in-space manufacturing as far future goals post 2040 rather than immediate needs. That said, at the Space Power conference in December, SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting noted that the ability to 'maneuver without regret' is number six on his Integrated Priorities List of needs. '[I]t's vital that given the threats we now see in novel orbits that are hard for us to get to, as well as the fact that Chinese have been testing on orbit refueling capability, that we need some kind of sustained space maneuver,' he said. The service added space 'mobility and logistics' to its 'core mission' basket in 2020, and in 2023 established the Servicing, Mobility and Logistics Office under Space Systems Command's Assured Access to Space program office. The mission area was funded by congressional plus-ups until 2025, when the service asked for $20 million, which was approved in the FY25 National Defense Authorization Act. Currently, projects related to mobility and logistics largely have been small, experimental research efforts. For example, in September 2023 the Space Force's public-private Space Enterprise Consortium awarded the American arm of Japanese startup Astroscale a $25 million contract to build a prototype satellite designed to refuel other satellites on orbit. More broadly Trump officials are working with Republicans in Congress on a significant increase in the Pentagon's top line for FY25, but how much of that will go to the Space Force is anyone's guess, much less where specific funding requests land.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/space-force-zeroed-out-funding-for-in-space-mobility-in-fy26-budget-request-sources/	2025-01-27T10:04:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/image002-1-e1705506491937.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: New SASC chair sets sight on $200B defense boost, major acquisition reform push	Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., raises his right hand during his ceremonial swearing-in with Vice President Kamala Harris inside the Old Senate Chamber in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, January 3, 2025. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The new chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee has two goals as he takes the gavel in 2025: boost defense funding by about $200 billion in the Republican’s reconciliation package and pass a sweeping acquisition reform proposal in the next defense policy bill, he told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview. If successful in getting a plus-up for defense, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., suggested the money could be used to help fund an Iron Dome-like missile shield over the United States — one of President Donald Trump’s stated defense priorities — as well as to make key investments in areas such as shipbuilding, submarines and the Air Force’s next-generation fighter. 'I hope and believe that President Trump's pledge to restore peace through strength so that we can avoid conflict is going to be followed through with adequate funding,' Wicker said in a Jan. 23 interview. 'At the same time, it is a magnificent opportunity to make the Defense Department and defense procurement more efficient and modern.' Wicker’s office confirmed to Breaking Defense that the SASC chairman is pursuing a parallel strategy to enact his two priorities. The first goal is getting buy-in from Trump and GOP leadership on a substantial funding increase for defense in the reconciliation bill currently under negotiation. The second involves using the fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act as a vehicle to pass Wicker’s acquisition reform vision, laid out in December as the Fostering Reform and Government Efficiency in Defense (FORGED) Act. The budget reconciliation bill, which uses a special procedure that allows bills to avoid filibuster and pass with a simple majority, could include funding for Trump priorities like tax cuts and border security and is targeted to go to the president’s desk in April. (House Republicans are expected to discuss the reconciliation bill during their annual meeting in Miami early this week.) RELATED: New No. 2 House appropriator: Reconciliation bill going to be ‘heavy lift’ Wicker — who has argued that US defense spending should grow to 5 percent of GDP — and House Armed Services Committee chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., are hoping to make the case to GOP leadership that additional money for defense should be included as part of the legislation. 'It would not be outside the realm of possibility to make it $100 billion a year [for defense] for the next two years,' Wicker said. 'That would start to get us where we want to go.' A plus-up of that size — over a 10 percent increase from what Wicker's committee marked up for the FY25 NDAA — could be used to accelerate the construction of warships, amphibious ships and submarines, he said, as well as to start development of an American Iron Dome missile defense shield, an investment that Wicker acknowledged will be a technical challenge as well as a costly expenditure. 'Israel is a small state about the size of New Jersey, so Iron Dome for Israel is much different from Iron Dome for America,' Wicker said. 'But a missile defense shield with a large satellite, a space-based component, that's going to be expensive, but it's a must, and it happens that the president feels some urgency in getting that done.' It could also help fund continued development of the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, which faces an uncertain future due to budget constraints as the service balances other expensive modernization projects such as the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system and the B-21 Raider bomber. As Breaking Defense first reported, the service recently concluded a study that validated the requirement for a manned sixth-gen fighter, but has left the incoming Trump administration to make the final decision on whether to continue or cancel the program. In 2024, 'we agreed reluctantly to do a bit of a pause to let the experts take another look at whether NGAD should be manned. And the answer came back after the election with the vengeance, absolutely yes,' Wicker said. Wicker’s defense acquisition plan largely sailed under the radar when it was released in late December, as Congress was racing to pass a last-minute government funding extension. But if enacted, it could radically reshape the Pentagon’s contracting apparatus by injecting new policies meant to ramp up competition, make the acquisition process more agile and responsive to changes in threat, and untether nontraditional defense firms and commercial companies from some of the most onerous Pentagon contracting procedures. 'I haven't gotten a lot of pushback from the big guys. The folks that would like to innovate and participate as startups are wild about it,' Wicker said. 'I think [the primes] would agree that there are too many steps along the way that could be eliminated. But then the little guys — the guys with a new idea, the Elon Musks of the future — see this valley of death, and it's real to them.' One of the FORGED Act’s biggest shifts would make commercial procurement processes the default contracting method for the Pentagon, making defense-specific contracting procedures used by bespoke weapon systems like fighter jets and aircraft carriers the exception rather than the rule. The hope is to make it easier for companies that manufacture consumer products to do business with the Pentagon without having to go through the onerous process of proving they meet government standards for commercial goods. RELATED: Incoming SASC head lays out acquisition reform vision In a potentially even more radical change, the bill proposes making all nontraditional defense firms subject to commercial procurement rules, even if they are selling defense-specific products like missiles or drones. Because nontraditional defense firms have largely funneled their own research and development dollars into bringing a product to the market, unlike most defense products that are developed primarily with government funding, the report accompanying the FORGED Act argues that nontraditional companies should be exempt from rules that would force them to 'stand up federal units with separate infrastructure' — a cost burden that might prevent them from continuing to invest their own capital into R&amp;D in the future. The legislation would also require the Pentagon to transition from a structure where program executive officers manage a given weapons program, into one where a 'portfolio acquisition executive' or PAE has oversight over a group of related capabilities and can make tradeoffs among those weapon systems as funding, requirements and schedule evolves. Under that construct, the services would push some of their requirements and programming staff into the PAE offices, as well as designating representatives from the operational community who would offer insight from the perspective of the troops would use the new weapon in the field. In what could be another controversial move, it directs the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) to co-chair a Joint Requirements &amp; Programming Board, which would 'provide analysis, set agendas, and lead debate' on defense acquisition policy measures but be purely advisory in nature, according to the report. The legislation would strip the JROC of its responsibility to validate joint requirements, with the organization instead tasked with 'reviewing' requirements. So far, industry organizations have yet to weigh in on the specifics of Wicker’s plan. In December, Aerospace Industries Association President Eric Fanning said the organization was reviewing the proposal and looked forward to working with Wicker moving forward. 'As the voice of the American aerospace and defense industry, we welcome Senator Wicker’s continued focus on strengthening the defense industrial base and reforming defense acquisition,' Fanning said then. 'Senator Wicker’s proposal, along with the Department of Government Efficiency, offers a real opportunity to unleash innovation and get new weapons and equipment to the warfighter faster.' While Wicker's office is still early in the process of determining the legislative strategy for the reform proposal, senate aides said some of the FORGED Act will likely appear in the Wicker’s chairman’s mark of the FY26 NDAA, while more contentious changes will have to be dealt with in the committee’s markup process, where they will be offered as amendments to the policy bill and voted on after debate. 'This is not a Wicker-only effort,' one GOP aide said, adding that both Republicans and Democrats have historically been invested in acquisition reform. 'So ideally, we are going to have a full team effort on the committee here.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/exclusive-new-sasc-chair-sets-sight-on-200b-defense-boost-major-acquisition-reform-push/	2025-01-27T09:02:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/roger-wicker-scaled-e1737995435127.jpg
Will S. Korea’s drama cause problems, or savings, for Poland’s large weapon buys?	In a file photo, officials from Poland and South Korea, including the previous Polish defense minister, shake hands during the announcement ceremony of a major new arms agreement between the two countries. (Polish MoD) WARSAW — On Dec. 3, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law, a move that critics widely viewed as an internal coup attempt. Since then, political uncertainty has gripped South Korea, with Yoon’s fate to be determined and interim leadership guiding Seoul. It has the Indo-Pacific region watching carefully. But Yoon’s move also reverberated deeply 4,800 miles away in Warsaw, where Poland has spent several years tying itself to South Korea’s defense industry. The political ramifications, and subsequent impact on the won — which hit a five year low versus the dollar in January, as the political crisis continued — have raised two key questions about whether Poland’s major investments could be impacted. First, could there be any benefit to Poland's big Korean buys if the won stays depressed? And second, is there any concern in Poland that they may not be able to get everything they want from the Koreans, given the big arms deals were signed under an administration that seems likely to be replaced sometime in 2025? For now, everyone involved is putting on a brave face that business is normal. But Marek Świerczyński, head of security and international affairs desk at the Polityka Insight center for policy analysis based in Warsaw, told Breaking Defense that 'The question is how this crisis will affect the functioning of the Korean economy, including the defense sector, and what long-term effects it will have on both sides.' 'The longer this crisis lasts, regardless of possible ‘profits’ on the currency, the worse for the future of strategic cooperation between Poland and South Korea. Let us remember that the Koreans' competitors are not sleeping,' Świerczyński said. 'Despite the Korean side's quick assurances that nothing is changing in relations with Poland, this situation is a cold shower for Polish decision-makers.' Over the last decade, South Korea has worked to make itself into a global arms exporter. Those efforts do seem to be paying off: The combined operating profit forecast for 2024 of the four major defense companies, three of which have major deals with Poland, was estimated at 2.114 trillion won, according to local reports from financial information company FnGuide. Hanwha Aerospace is projected to have operating profits rise 94.65 percent year-on-year to 1.35 trillion won. In 2022 Hanwha Aerospace signed export contracts for K9 self-propelled howitzers and K-239 Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers with Poland. Hyundai Rotem, driven by its K2 tanks, is projected to see an operating profit to surge by 116.66 percent to 455.1 billion won. The company delivered 84 K2GF tanks to Poland under its first contract last year and plans to deliver an additional 96 tanks this year. KAI is anticipated to have an 11.28 percent increase in operating profit at 275.4 billion won. It is also set to include development earnings from the FA-50PL, a customized variant for Poland, which will begin deliveries at the end of this year. All told, Poland has signed over $16 billion worth of contracts with South Korean firms since the start of 2022. However, many of those deals are being broken down into tranches, which are negotiated individually over time. Which gets to question number one: Could Poland take advantage of the weakened won as it is negotiating future tranches, and save some zlotys in the process? Speaking on background, a representative for a number of Korean firms in Poland downplayed concern, saying that while the companies are monitoring the situation, 'there is probably no such thinking at all' that the won situation will impact Poland’s plans. That is, at least in part, because Poland isn’t buying things in Korean currency. In a statement to Breaking Defense, the Ministry of National Defense said that 'payments for military equipment obtained from the Korean direction are made in US dollars, in accordance with the adopted schedule for the implementation of contracts.' Given that the deals are not done in Korean currency, the Polish Ministry of State Assets (MAP) said in a statement that 'when contracting deliveries, the purchasing power of the won is not so important. In turn, the division of the order for a given equipment into individual tranches depends on the agreements between the parties to the contract and depends on the capabilities of the manufacturer as well as the needs of the ordering party.' 'It should therefore be assumed that there are no mechanisms for pre-emptive purchase of Korean currency or overpayment at its lower exchange rate. However, it should be recalled that there were cases of repayment of tranches, e.g. for the Wisla air defense systems (the Polish name for Patriot systems), if there were funds available for use in the MND budget at the end of the year. However, the current situation, at the beginning of the new budget year, is different,' Świerczyński said. 'Of course, it is always better to buy something cheaper than more expensive. If, as a result of the prolonged crisis, the South Korean currency maintains a low exchange rate, then in a sense we can benefit from this.' The second question then: Is there concern South Korea’s internal political situation will impact delivery, whether because the won’s crash raises prices in the supply chain or because a new government could cancel contracts? Asked that question, the defense ministry replied that 'the MND does not comment on the political situation in other countries.' MAP responded that there should be no real issues: 'From an industrial point of view, the agreements contain appropriate provisions regarding cooperation, not directly related to the current internal political situation in both countries. The Polish side has not received information that could indicate that the current situation in [South] Korea may have any negative impact on business relations built on the basis of long-term agreements. 'Of course, the development of events in Seoul is being closely monitored,' the statement reads. The industry representative emphasized that in South Korea there is bipartisan support for defense equipment exports to Poland, and that the companies themselves are dedicated to making deliveries happen on time and on budget. 'These companies have a very high level of responsibility, even culturally old-fashioned, and for them obligations are sacred. So, there are no threats, nothing there negatively affects production,' the representative said. 'But of course everyone is following the development of the political situation in South Korea with the hope that this crisis will end as soon as possible.' Świerczyński, for his part, agreed that defense exports are a non-partisan priority for Korea. But, he cautioned, 'the political earthquake that was the attempted coup and its consequences must have an impact on the institutions and the people functioning in them. Let us recall that the Korean Ministry of National Defense was headed by a close confidant of the compromised president, who is no longer a minister. We do not have a full picture of the purges, but we can imagine what a crisis of trust exists within the institution, which was somehow subordinate to the president. 'All this does not create a favorable landscape, and the problem that can be seen in Seoul with stabilizing the situation does not inspire optimism,' Świerczyński stressed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/will-s-koreas-drama-cause-problems-or-savings-for-polands-large-weapon-buys/	2025-01-27T06:45:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/poland_korea.jpg
General Atomics aeronautics CEO calls on DOGE to speed acquisition, cut FMS red tape	American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) should take steps to speed up the defense acquisition process and reduce barriers to foreign military sales, the chief executive of General Atomics’ aeronautical systems division said in a new letter. 'Within GA-ASI’s own export market, poor US Government (USG) policy and sluggish bureaucratic decision-making has opened the door for competitors like China, Turkey, and Israel to win important international customers,' Linden Blue wrote in the Jan. 24 letter addressed to DOGE head Elon Musk and released by the company today. 'Sales lost to these competitors while we waited on some USG action means less funding available for re-investment into R&amp;D and modernized manufacturing infrastructure. 'Bold leadership is needed. Past reform efforts, often supervised by the very organizations most in need of reform, have failed. DOGE has the potential to drive meaningful change, and we are ready to help where we can,' he said. Blue’s letter comes about a week after L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik sent a letter to Musk laying out his ideas on how to reduce Pentagon bureaucracy, including by eliminating certain government accounting rules as well as reducing regulations that require defense contractors to submit detailed pricing data. At the time, Kubasik's letter — which also directly criticized the outgoing Biden team — seemed an outlier. With General Atomics now following suit, it could signify a trend in which others in industry now race to get their own takes in front of DOGE. RELATED: Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon’s DOGE to wow The agency (not a Department, despite the name) was formally established on inauguration day, with the White House issuing an executive order establishing the Department of Government Efficiency. The order renamed the existing US Digital Service as the US DOGE Service and tasked it with 'modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,' specifically by improvements to software, networks and IT systems. While the Defense Department waits to see how DOGE could seek to overhaul existing processes or systems, defense contractors have begun soliciting Musk with their own ideas for reform. In his letter, Blue calls for setting time limits on Defense Department milestones for larger acquisition programs, specifically suggesting that the length of time between when a program’s requirements are first defined and a product's initial operational capability be capped at five years. He criticizes a culture of 'buck-passing' in the foreign military sales process, stating that greater accountability is needed across the State Department, Pentagon and military services to ensure an administration is meeting its security cooperation goals. That can be accomplished by instating 'clear lines of authority and responsibility, time limits for decision-making, and a modern IT system to track the distribution and expenditure of billions of dollars (entirely funded by foreign customers) in the US FMS administrative fund account,' he said. Finally, Blue recommends revamping the US government’s current interpretation of the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement that governs the export of missiles and uncrewed aerial system, arguing that the US should focus its attention on 'focus on missile technology tied to weapons of mass destruction rather than UAS.' The MTCR has been a longstanding concern of General Atomics, which has held that the US’s current posture is too restrictive, and has resulted in stricter controls for drones than exist for other military aircraft, including advanced, lethal capabilities like fighter jets. (On the way out the door the Biden administration issued guidance loosening the interpretation of MTCR, but primarily for space-related technologies.) 'We should counter the unfair market advantages gained by foreign suppliers not subject to self-imposed MTCR limitations. Further, we must objectively balance the prioritization of technology security with that of arming allies and partners (using their own money!) for future conflicts and increased burden-sharing,' he wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/general-atomics-aeronautics-ceo-calls-on-doge-to-speed-acquisition-cut-fms-red-tape/	2025-01-27T02:00:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/doge-logo-scaled-e1734035776699.jpg
Trump nominee Pete Hegseth confirmed as defense secretary	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth testifies during his Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on January 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth to be the next secretary of defense tonight by the narrowest of margins, with Republicans relying on a tiebreaking vote from Vice President JD Vance to clear one of Trump’s most controversial nominees after weeks of questions about his fitness to lead the Pentagon. The nomination prevailed in a 51-50 vote after Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell joined Democrats to vote against Hegseth. Hegseth, a Fox News host and National Guard veteran, has faced a rocky road to the top defense job since being tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the Pentagon in November. In the following weeks, allegations of sexual misconduct and whistleblower reports alleging that Hegseth abused alcohol while on the job at Fox News and as the former president of Concerned Veterans for America threatened to topple his nomination. Hegseth has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and has pledged to stop drinking if named secretary of defense. Although Hegseth’s nomination appeared to be on steady footing after his Jan. 14 confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questions about Republican defectors arose after new allegations surfaced about Hegseth’s previous marriage. Senators received an affidavit Tuesday, a redacted copy of which was obtained by Breaking Defense, in which Hegseth’s former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, claimed that Pete Hegseth’s aggressive behavior caused his second wife to fear for her safety and form an escape plan. Hegseth’s second wife, Samantha Hegseth, told NBC News — which was first to report on the affidavit — that there had been no physical abuse in her marriage, while Hegseth’s lawyer denied the allegations. On Thursday afternoon, Alaska’s Murkowski became the first Republican to state she would vote against Hegseth, noting her enduring concerns about Hegseth’s judgement, his comments about women in combat, and questionable financial management of the veterans organizations he previously led. 'I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense, and must be prioritized without compromise. The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth’s nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook,' she said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. Collins, who represents Maine, released a statement declaring her intent to vote against Hegseth shortly afterwards. 'While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job,' she wrote in a statement on X. Both Murkowski and Collins on Thursday joined Democrats in voting against a procedural move to bring Hegseth’s nomination for a final vote, which succeeded 51-49. However, questions swirled around whether McConnell and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who both voted to advance the nomination on Thursday, would join Murkowski and Collins to vote against Hegseth during the final vote — potentially torpedoing Hegseth's nomination. Minutes after the final vote began, Hegseth posted his response to Danielle Hegseth's allegations, addressed to Tillis, on X. 'I dispute Ms. Dietrich’s characterization of me as being abusive to my ex-wife Samantha or having an alcohol abuse problem,' Hegseth wrote, referring to his former sister in law. 'I have been very open about how I have used alcohol in the past to deal with the demons that I experienced from my time in Iraq and Afghanistan, as countless of my fellow veterans have. However, this something I have overcome.' 'My ex wife Samantha has also been explicit in both court filings and in her public statement to NBC (and I believe her FBI interview) that were was no physical abuse,' he wrote later in the letter. Shortly afterward, Tillis announced on X he would support Hegseth's nomination. 'From the beginning, I have been clear about my position: if President Trump’s nominees were reported favorably out of the relevant committees, I would support their confirmation on the Senate floor absent new material information about their qualifications,' Tillis wrote. 'Once Pete Hegseth’s nomination was sent to the floor by my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I conducted my own due diligence, including asking tough questions of Pete and I appreciated his candor and openness in answering them.' During Hegseth’s nomination hearing last week, Republicans praised Hegseth’s focus on readiness and lethality and repeated Hegseth’s claim that the allegations against him were baseless smears. Sen. Joni Ernst — a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor who was the most visible SASC Republican holdout on the nomination — announced hours after the hearing that she would support Hegseth’s defense secretary bid. However, SASC Democrats hammered Hegseth about his comments on women in combat and said he didn’t meet the standards of character or job performance necessary to run the nation’s largest employer. SASC voted 14-13 along party lines on Monday evening to report the nomination out of committee. In a floor speech on Tuesday, SASC top Democrat Sen. Jack Reed raised concerns about Trump’s firing of Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan earlier this week and said Hegseth’s confirmation could further destabilize the US military should he support efforts to purge military leaders who do not align with Trump’s politics. 'Our servicemembers, since the birth of this country 249 years ago, have taken an oath to the Constitution,' Reed said. 'Their mission is to protect the country and all of its citizens and the ideals this country was founded on, which should endure no matter who is President or what political party is in power. Mr. Hegseth's idea of meritocracy, however, seems to be that servicemembers should pledge fealty to a President who will be in power for only four years and fit the ideas of a party that only half of this Nation supports. 'There is no faster way to undermine the lethality and morale of our Nation's military&#8211;and support of the Nation's citizens for it&#8211;than to inject politics into the system,' he said. SASC Chair Roger Wicker, in a Thursday floor speech following Reed’s, said Hegseth had been a victim of a smear campaign and false media reports. He acknowledged Hegseth is an 'unconventional' nominee, like Trump as president, but added that fresh ideas could shake up the Pentagon bureaucracy. 'That may be what makes Mr. Hegseth a good choice. He’s not beholden to the status quo and he’s open to new ideas,' he said. 'His experience in the line of fire and his servicemember advocacy make at least one thing clear. Pete Hegseth will put the men and women of our military first.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trump-nominee-pete-hegseth-confirmed-as-defense-secretary/	2025-01-24T18:51:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/hegseth-confirmation-scaled-e1736870161374.jpg
ChatNC3: Can the US trust AI in nuclear command, control and communications?	An Air Force Global Strike Command unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launches during an operational test Oct. 29, 2020, at Vandenberg AFB, Calif. (US Air Force photo by Michael Peterson) WASHINGTON — As the US military experiments with AI for everything from streamlining contract documents to coordinating global operations, there’s one area that’s remained off-limits: nuclear command and control. Perhaps that's not surprising, given the obvious fears of a WarGames-like accidental apocalypse. But what if the Pentagon at least let AI help in nuclear crises, in a contained and limited way, by using algorithms to process incoming intelligence on a potential strike more quickly, giving the human beings involved — and ultimately President Donald Trump — precious additional time to make the most difficult decision imaginable? Last fall, no less a figure than the four-star chief of nuclear forces, Gen. Anthony Cotton of US Strategic Command, argued publicly that 'advanced AI and robust data analytics capabilities provide decision advantage and improve our deterrence posture.' This morning, that question of even a limited use-case for AI was the dividing line in a public debate, hosted at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, between two experts on systems of military command. On the 'yes' side, saying the US nuclear enterprise should give AI a chance, was former Pentagon official and House Armed Services staffer Sarah Mineiro, who’s also worked at AI-enthusiast defense-tech upstart Anduril. On the 'no' side, saying the risks are just too great, was Paul Scharre, a former Army Ranger who led a DoD working group that established policies on autonomy in weapons systems and recently published a book on AI in conflict. Now, no one on either side of today’s debate was arguing the US should let AI decide whether or not to launch a nuclear strike, let alone suggesting a computer should have the ability to launch a nuclear weapon without human authorization. (Do you want Skynets? Because that’s how you get Skynets.) Even Chinese President Xi Jinping, notoriously averse to arms control, has seemed amenable to discussing AI 'risks' with the US. But, contrary to Hollywood depictions of giant war rooms filled with dramatically lit screens, real-life military operations centers can be clunky, antiquated, and labor-intensive, reliant on staff officers manually entering information or relaying it verbally over secure phones. That can be true even when it comes to what’s called 'nuclear command, control, and communications.' NC3 systems used floppy disks until 2019, and operations still ultimately rely, not on anyone pressing the proverbial 'button' — no such button exists — but on verbal orders from the President that cascade down the hierarchy of human officers. So while everyone wants a human being to make the final call, could AI perhaps help streamline and secure the process? If AI can be trusted to help analyze all sorts of other military intelligence data, like satellite imagery and intercepted messages, the US should use it to aid nuclear decision-making as well, argued Mineiro. Once an ICBM is in the air, she noted, it takes at most half an hour to reach its target. That’s dangerously little time to make the decision whether or not to fire back, and every minute spent figuring out what’s actually happening is one minute less to make the crucial judgment call. 'AI tools and techniques can actually help to expand the decision space for the human decision maker …when you are analyzing petabytes of data that are going to impact millions of people's lives,' Mineiro said. 'If you can crunch [numbers] and do that pattern recognition, classification and determination, flight path determination, any quicker … you should absolutely do that. 'At the end of the day, this ends up being an optimization question,' she said. 'It’s … allowing computers to do what computers do best, and let humans do what humans do best.' But there’s a practical problem with letting AI crunch the numbers for NC3, responded Scharre: No one has the right numbers to crunch. No nuclear weapon has been used in combat since 1945, back when they had to be dropped by propeller-driven planes. 'What is the training data set that we would use for nuclear war? Thankfully, we don't have one,' Scharre said. The lack of nuclear wars is a good problem to have, of course, but it is a real problem for nuclear decision-making — even for human analysts looking for 'indications and warnings.' AI algorithms require mountains of data in order to shape themselves into effective analysts, and are notoriously 'brittle' when faced with problems outside the data set that they were trained on. 'Humans can flexibly respond to novel conditions, and AI can't,' Scharre said. 'AI systems are terrible at adapting to novelty. If they are presented with a situation is outside of the scope of their training data, they are effectively blind and unable to adapt.' As a result, he said, 'a nuclear crisis is exactly the kind of situation we would expect an AI system to fail catastrophically.' Especially insidious, he added, is the possibility that the AI early-warning system would predict outcomes accurately under peacetime conditions, only to go haywire and 'hallucinate' like ChatGPT when a crisis created conditions it had never seen before. Such a track record could lull humans into a false confidence that they can just trust the computer and stop paying attention or thinking for themselves. That’s a well-known phenomenon known as 'automation bias,' which had led to fatal accidents in wartime, commercial aviation, and even on the highway. 'Humans can over-trust AI with catastrophic consequences,' Scharre said. 'We've seen this in other areas, like in self-driving cars, which drive very well in some settings, but then, suddenly and without warning, have driven into concrete barriers, parked cars, fire trucks, semi-trailers, pedestrians, causing fatal accidents.' Unlike an NC3 AI trying to identify a nuclear strike in progress, Scharre added, self-driving cars have abundant real-world data to train on, and yet they still make the occasional lethal mistake. That rate of error may be tolerable when the worst outcome is a car crash, he said, or even a conventional airstrike hitting the wrong target, he said, 'but it is nowhere near reliable enough for applications that require zero tolerance for failures, and that's what we need in nuclear command and control.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/chatnc3-can-the-us-trust-ai-in-nuclear-command-control-and-communications/	2025-01-24T10:24:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240708_minuteman_launch_6406505-scaled-e1720469241527.jpg
Why Ukraine’s all-drone, multi-domain attack could be a ‘seminal’ moment in warfare	A D-21 reconnaissance and combat ground robotic complex is pictured during an event organised by JSC Ukrainian Defense Industry (UkrOboronProm) to mark the Defence and Industrial Complex Employee Day, Kyiv region, northern Ukraine. (Photo credit should read Pavlo_Bagmut / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images) FARNBOROUGH, England — Ukraine successfully pulled off an all-drone, multi-domain attack on Russian positions near Kharkiv in December, an official speaking at the International Armoured Vehicle (IAV) conference disclosed this week, in what they are calling the first-ever such operation. Addressing delegates under the Chatham House Rule at Defence iQ’s IAV event here, the official described how the operation exclusively featured weaponized uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) and first person view (FPV) attack drones and did not feature any crewed platforms or boots on the ground. UGVs conducted the full spectrum of mission sets including surveillance, mine clearance and direct fire, supported by uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), the official stated before explaining how the 'tactical air-land operation' represented the first instance of an 'uncrewed battle fought by one side' in the ongoing war. Reflecting on the attack, which appeared at the time as merely a 'footnote in daily reporting,' the official went on to describe it as a 'seminal moment in the changing character of conflict.' Warning 'Ukraine faces today what [NATO] could face tomorrow,' the speaker went onto describe how Ukraine’s military continues to place a premium on attritable technologies to create combat mass,' before adding: 'Ukraine has made the most of turning industrial disadvantage into a furnace of innovation.' The December attack was confirmed by the National Guard of Ukraine, with a spokesperson at the time describing how 'dozens' of uncrewed equipment had been used to conduct an assault near Lyptsi, equipped with machine guns and munitions. Exact types of UGVs and FPV drones used during the attack were not disclosed but a defense source informed Breaking Defense that ground vehicles included the 4&#215;4 ‘Ratel S’ which was developed through the Ukraine Government’s Brave1 Defence Innovation Forum. Ukraine has been trying to use drones in as many mission sets as possible, Paul Clayton, director of industrial partnerships at UGV manufacturer Milrem Robotics, told Breaking Defense at the show. Clayton described a visit in July to Ukraine, where the military showed off how UGVs were being employed for 'first strike' missions with '10 or more UGVs on an objective and achieving victory because they overwhelmed an enemy, getting inside their OODA loop.' 'If [Russian forces] destroyed one [UGV], another will come in,' he added before suggesting UGVs are being specifically used to disrupt or destroy command and control nodes. But Clayton also warned of limitations facing UGVs in Ukraine. 'The winter-mud season critically impacts tactical, operational and even strategic operations. Mud severely limits off road mobility, rendering wheeled vehicles virtually interoperable and hampering tracked vehicles under extreme conditions. Additionally, Clayton described how UGVs were vulnerable to the enemy’s advanced EW and jamming capabilities. RLEATED: Inside Ukraine, startups try to edge Russia in the electronic warfare race 'These pose significant challenges to [uncrewed] operations including their control and effectiveness,' he stated before also suggesting UGVs must use fortified positions to take cover during missions. 'Drone-operating frequencies are constantly shifting. Intelligence and EW teams must remain vigilant to detect and counteract newly adopted enemy frequencies. A decline in jammer effectiveness must be swiftly identified and addressed,' he added. Since 2022, a total of 15 THeMIS UGVs, produced by Milrem, have been used by the Ukrainians for cargo, casualty evacuation and demand. But Clayton suggested 'additional orders are coming' for anti-tank, indirect fire and direct fire capabilities, as well as intelligence-gathering, communications relay and engineering. The executive said it’s his aspiration to have more than 200 UGVs operating in Ukraine by the end of the year, fulfilling a variety of intelligence-gathering and combat roles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/why-ukraines-all-drone-multi-domain-attack-could-be-a-seminal-moment-in-warfare/	2025-01-24T07:45:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/ukraine-UGV-scaled-e1737666918181.jpg
UK awards Rolls-Royce $11B nuclear reactor ‘Unity’ contract	Concept art of a future UK Royal Navy Dreadnought Class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (Rolls Royce) BELFAST — British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce has received its largest ever contract from the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), valued at $11.1 billion, for the design, manufacture and support of Royal Navy nuclear submarine reactors. The new eight-year deal, dubbed by London in a statement today as a 'Unity' contract, will enhance the UK’s continuous at sea deterrent (CASD) and strengthen the AUKUS trilateral partnership. Maria Eagle, UK minister for defence procurement told lawmakers, 'It's a contract that will help Rolls-Royce operate in a more integrated and efficient way, driving efficiencies, reducing waste, saving more than £400 million, and delivering on the government's commitment to provide value for money for the taxpayer.' UK Defence Secretary John Healey said in the MoD statement, 'National security is a foundation of our government’s plan for change, and this is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the UK’s nuclear deterrent, which is our ultimate insurance policy in a more dangerous world.' Britain's deterrent is singular in nature, meaning its nuclear strike capability is submarine based only, as opposed to the ability to deploy ground or air launched weapon systems like other nuclear powers. CASD is currently supported by a fleet of Royal Navy Vanguard Class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) fitted with Trident 2 D5 missiles, but will be replaced by four new Dreadnought Class vessels in the 2030s. The future submarine program is expected to cost £31 billion (38.4 billion), excluding a £10 billion contingency fund. Each of the new Dreadnought Class platforms will also be armed with Trident weapons and four Spearfish medium-range torpedoes. In a supporting statement, Rolls-Royce noted that the Unity contract will include 'continued support of the build and commission of Dreadnought Class submarines and the beginning of the previously announced SSN-AUKUS contracts.' The manufacturer has committed to expanding its nuclear reactor production facility in Derby, England, equivalent to 'almost double' the size of the current site, as a result of demand from the Royal Navy and AUKUS, according to a company statement. In 2023, the UK awarded AUKUS Detailed Design and Long Leads (D2L2) phase contracts, amounting to £4 billion to Rolls Royce and British manufacturing counterparts BAE Systems and Babcock. The funding was allocated to support design and prototyping activities and to enable contractors to acquire long lead items for future UK submarines due to replace Astute-Class (SSN) vessels from the late 2030s. New Royal Australian Navy SSNs are set to follow from 2040 on, before which the US will deliver three Virginia-class types to Australia and potentially an additional two units. Canberra is replacing Collins-class diesel-electric subs. SSN-AUKUS vessels are set to be integrated with technology from all three partner nations. They are also based on a next generation design from BAE Systems. The firm and Australia's ASC Pty were selected in March 2024 to manufacture the Australian set of subs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/uk-awards-rolls-royce-11b-nuclear-reactor-unity-contract/	2025-01-24T07:08:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/rr-signs-landmark-unity-contract-with-uk-ministry-of-defence-content-img.jpg
Boeing to log $1.7B in defense program losses in fourth quarter	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation.

The flight is to support an initial evaluation by the USAF of the KC-46A's integrated mission system suite as well as its ability to conduct worldwide navigation, communication and operation. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — Boeing expects to log a $1.7 billion loss across several defense programs when it announces its fourth quarter 2024 results next Tuesday, the company said, meaning the company will have incurred almost $5 billion in losses on defense programs for the full year. Boeing’s total year end charges of $4.9 billion on its troubled portfolio of fixed price weapons contracts is the largest-ever loss for its defense unit, up from losses of $4.4 billion in 2022, according to figures from Boeing financial disclosures compiled by Breaking Defense. The newly revealed fourth quarter charges include a $800 million loss on the KC-46 tanker, reflecting what the company said were higher-than-estimated manufacturing costs. Boeing attributed part of that loss to the September strike of its Seattle-area machinist union, which resulted in a seven week production halt on jetliners such as twin-aisled 767 from which the KC-46 is derived. It also included a $500 billion loss on the T-7 Red Hawk trainer programs due to higher estimated production costs starting in 2026, Boeing said in a statement. EXCLUSIVE: Air Force reworking approach for T-7A Red Hawk, delaying production by 1 year The company will also record losses on the Air Force One replacement program known as VC-25B, the Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone and NASA’s Starliner, Boeing said, although it did not provide exact figures for those programs. 'Although we face near-term challenges, we took important steps to stabilize our business during the quarter including reaching an agreement with our IAM [International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers]-represented teammates and conducting a successful capital raise to improve our balance sheet,' said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg. 'We also restarted 737, 767 and 777/777X production and our team remains focused on the hard work ahead to build a new future for Boeing.' RELATED: Boeing's defense unit logs massive $2 billion in losses for third quarter Fixed price contracts, which hold the company responsible for covering all costs over a certain threshold, have long been the bane of Boeing's defense unit, which has seen costs of programs like the KC-46 and MQ-25 skyrocket due to supply chain problems, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and labor issues. Boeing executives have repeatedly stated that the company will no longer bid on development contracts that use a fixed-price structure. Altogether, Boeing’s defense unit is set to report revenue of $5.4 billion for the quarter, as well as an operating margin of negative 42 percent, Boeing said. Earlier this month, the Air Force announced it had delayed Milestone C for the T-7 by a year and that it would allocate additional funds toward incentive agreements with Boeing to address issues that were not originally envisioned when the plane’s fixed-price development contract was negotiated. In September, Boeing announced the departure of Ted Colbert, who has led its defense unit since 2022. The planemaker has not announced a full-time successor, with Steve Parker, the defense division's chief operating officer, taking on the acting CEO role.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/boeing-to-log-1-7b-in-defense-program-losses-in-fourth-quarter/	2025-01-23T14:52:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
Despite high-profile exits, most Defense Business, Innovation Boards intact	Former Defense Innovation Board chair Michael R. Bloomberg speaks at the board’s fall meeting, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Oct. 17, 2022. (DoD/ Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — The new Pentagon leadership has not taken steps to dismiss members of the Defense Business Board and Defense Innovation Board, but there was a spate of resignations before President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term on Monday. A Pentagon spokesman told Breaking Defense today that there was no announcement on a broader shakeup on those two boards 'at this time.' However, he noted several recent resignations. For the Defense Business Board — a collection of private sector executives appointed by the Secretary of Defense for business management advice — Chairwoman Deborah Lee James, the Obama-era Air Force Secretary, resigned effective Monday, along with Sally Donnelly, Oscar Munoz, Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah and former US Central Command Chief Joseph Votel. 'Board Vice Chair, Ms. Linnie Haynesworth, will serve as acting chair until a new board chair is appointed,' the spokesman wrote in a short statement. 'No new members have been appointed at this time.' Over on the Defense Innovation Board — an advisory group focused on emerging technology and innovation — Chairman Michael Bloomberg stepped aside effective Jan. 14. Other recent resignations also included LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, former House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry and retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen. So far, Acting Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses has not yet appointed new members to the DIB, the spokesman said, meaning six members remain. While the Pentagon has not disbanded these two boards, the Department of Homeland Security terminated similar boards this week. Such boards have also acted as political volleyballs in the past. In December 2020, with just over a month left in office, Trump’s Pentagon swapped out nine members of the Defense Business Board, which has traditionally been non-partisan, with loyalists; similar moves happened at other advisory committees around the department. By February 2021, then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered hundreds of Pentagon advisory board members to resign, a move that essentially purged the Trump administration's last-minute appointments.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/despite-high-profile-exits-most-defense-business-innovation-board-members-intact/	2025-01-23T13:22:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/7467530-scaled-e1736885904170.jpg
OpenAI’s $500B ‘Stargate Project’ could aid Pentagon’s own AI efforts, official says	An 149th Intelligence Squadron airman conducts training in a computer training lab at Mather Field, California Dec. 2, 2023. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — If OpenAI can actually implement its Stargate Project to build $500 billion-worth of AI infrastructure in the US, one of the major beneficiaries may be the US military. 'It depends on how much of that they devote to gov[ernment] cloud and AI cloud,' said Roy Campbell, chief strategist for the Pentagon’s High Performance Computing Modernization Program and deputy director for advanced computing in the undersecretariat for research &amp; engineering. And if the Defense Department can get a slice of Stargate’s computing power, he told Breaking Defense, it could bypass a major bottleneck for its current high-tech ambitions. 'We really don’t have the footprint inside [DoD], the in-house capabilities, to answer all the questions, so we’re really going to have to ‘phone out’ to all these assets' that the private sector is building, Campbell told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Potomac Officers’ Club annual defense R&amp;D conference. What Stargate will build, precisely, is still a little vague. Announced in a high-profile press conference Tuesday at the White House, featuring newly elected President Trump, the Stargate Project will be a new company created to develop that 'AI infrastructure' to train and operate ever-larger artificial intelligence models, including new data centers and the electrical power to run them. Managed by OpenAI and Japan-based Softbank, Stargate will also draw funding from computing giant Oracle and UAE-based investment firm MGX. OpenAI will also provide technology to the new Stargate company, along with Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Oracle. 'We will begin deploying $100 billion immediately,' OpenAI's launch announcement said. 'The buildout is currently underway, starting in Texas, and we are evaluating potential sites across the country.' The ambitious half-trillion project is aimed at commercial customers: Neither the White House press conference nor the OpenAI announcement mentioned national defense. But it could also help DoD solve its own AI dilemma. For over a decade, the Pentagon has placed ever-bigger bets on artificial intelligence to achieve a wide array of goals, from streamlining procurement contracts, to analyzing intelligence data, to coordinating all the services’ disparate forces over land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace, a concept called CJADC2. But with over three million troops to pay, train, equip, and keep supplied around the world, even the nearly trillion-dollar DoD budget can’t keep up with AI’s exponentially growing hunger for computing power. Cutting-edge Large Language Models and other generative artificial intelligence tools require so much electricity, in fact, that industry is looking to nuclear power. By one calculation, OpenAI’s flagship ChatGPT burns almost three times as much energy per query as Google Search, and it consumes enough power per year — over 226 gigawatts — to charge three million electric cars (or 186 time-traveling DeLoreans). Meanwhile DoD is already straining to meet its own computing needs. That includes just figuring out how to implement AI by running field experiments with battle command networks, swarming drones, and other autonomous systems. At last year’s Autonomous Warrior 24 in Australia, for instance, as well as similar events stateside, 'they have to bring the supercomputer out to the test site,' Campbell told the conference today. 'The amount of data that has to be pulled off of all of the [test] assets and annotated, that has to be crunched overnight to be able to make sense of what happens, is phenomenal.' RELATED: Don’t blow the budget on ChatGPT: Army CIO sounds alarm on big bills for GenAI As more and more military AI moves from the proving ground to the battleground, Campbell continued, that kind of supercomputing power may become necessary in the warzone as well. While AI can sift inhumanly large amounts of information at superhuman speed, experts warn it can also be 'brittle,' prone to breaking down or producing nonsense results — 'hallucinations' — when exposed to new inputs that are sufficiently different from the data it was trained on. That means AI algorithms can’t be trained once and used indefinitely: They have to be constantly updated and retrained on new data. 'If you encounter something new in the battlefield, you may have to retrain, which then begs the question of, how much do I need in my Forward Operating Base?' Campbell told the conference. 'I may only have hundreds of kilowatts of capability in that Forward Operating Base,' he said, rather than the megawatts required to train and retrain a cutting-edge AI model. To meet future power demands, the Pentagon is looking at smaller, safer nuclear power plants to provide one to five megawatts of power in a compact or even truck-transportable package. But where long-range, high-bandwidth connections are available — and as long as a savvy adversary doesn’t jam them — then forward-deployed forces may be better off referring their AI problems to supercomputing clusters back in the US, Campbell said. That would include not just DoD’s own high-performance computing assets, he emphasized, but the larger capabilities in the private sector. That's where Stargate could come in, providing computing resources beyond the Pentagon's capability. Of course, that assumes Stargate pans out. Within a day of OpenAI’s high-profile announcement, which featured newly inaugurated President Trump, no less a figure than Trump ally and multi-billionaire Elon Musk publicly dissed Stargate’s backers, claiming they did not having adequate cash. 'They don’t actually have the money,' he said on his social media network X.com, known before he acquired it as Twitter. 'SoftBank has well under $10B secured,' Musk said of one of OpenAI’s three major partners on the project. 'I have that on good authority.' OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promptly shot back that Musk was 'wrong,' while the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, said 'I’m good for my $80 billion.' But a close reading of the Stargate press conference at the White House suggests the partners did scramble to quintuple an initial $100 billion proposal in just a few weeks, under pressure from Trump. 'Mr. President, last month, I came to celebrate your winning and promised that we will invest $100 billion,' said Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son. 'And you told me, ‘Oh, Masa, go for $200!’ Now I came back with $500 because, because this is the — as you said yesterday — this is the beginning of golden age of America.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/openais-500b-stargate-project-could-aid-pentagons-own-ai-efforts-official-says/	2025-01-23T13:11:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240919_DVIDS_northcom_computer_8201957-scaled-e1726767561824.jpg

Fearing US ‘hostility,’ Russia could ‘escalate early’ in a space conflict: RAND	Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during his visit at the Vostochny cosmodrome on April 12, 2022. (Photo by Yevgeny Biyatov/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Russia's 'inflated' fears of a potential US first strike in space, as well as Moscow's increasing 'risk tolerance' present challenges to US efforts to keep the peace in the heavens, a new Space Force-commissioned think tank study finds. The study published today by RAND, 'Emerging Factors for U.S.-Russia Crisis Stability in Space' authored by summer associate Cheyenne Tretter, further warns US policymakers and diplomats that Russia's 'relative restraint' regarding the space domain in the conflict in the Ukraine war should not be expected in any future conflict in the West. RAND's research work was commissioned by the Space Force's Chief Strategy &amp; Resourcing Officer Lt. Gen. Shawn Bratton, and was conducted within the RAND Project AIR FORCE Strategy and Doctrine Program as part of its fiscal year 2023 project, 'Crisis Stability in Space.' The key problem, the study finds, is that Moscow's hyper-suspicious view of US military intentions in space are driving Russia's military to a more aggressive and hair-trigger stance, but also raising barriers to bilateral communications aimed at ratcheting down conflict risks and/or finding ways to de-escalate once a crisis is underway. 'Russia's fears about U.S. incentives for early escalation in the space domain and perceptions of U.S. hostility heighten the potential for misperceptions of U.S. actions in space. Russia's emerging approach to escalation management—a cost-imposition strategy based on the belief that escalation can be controlled—might further reinforce perceived incentives to escalate early,' the study states. Indeed, there is a school of thought among Russian analysts that is highly concerned about US threats to the space-based elements of Moscow's nuclear deterrent and the possibility that Washington plans to use space to conduct a disarming attack to deprive Russia of its retaliatory capability, the study adds. The author makes two key recommendations:	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/fearing-us-hostility-russia-could-escalate-early-in-a-space-conflict-rand/	2025-01-23T09:37:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_putin_rocket_GettyImages-1239929978-scaled-e1726593428608.jpg
UK unveils first locally built Boxer armored vehicle	The $6.15 billion UK Boxer 8&#215;8 armored vehicle program, covers the acquisition of 623 vehicles (Breaking Defense) IAV 2025 — The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) unveiled the first British-manufactured 8&#215;8 Boxer armoured vehicle at Defence iQ’s International Armoured Vehicle (IAV) conference in Farnborough this week, the first time in over a decade the UK has locally produced an armored vehicle. Minister for Defence Procurement and Industry, Maria Eagle MP announced the news on Tuesday, claiming it to be the 'leading Boxer variant currently in the market' and suggesting British-manufactured Boxers could be made available for international customers in the future. Made by RBSL, which is a joint venture between Germany's Rheinmetall and the UK's BAE Systems, and under licence from the ARTEC consortium of KNDS and Rheinmetall, Boxer vehicles are being constructed for the British Army’s Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) program of record. The MIV is a £5 billion ($6.15 billion) program with a requirement for 623 platforms. In 2023, the then Conservative government said that it had allocated funding for 1,016 vehicles from a total requirement of 1,305. The UK MoD did not respond to a request for comment on current vehicle projections at the time of publication. Variants on order from the UK include infantry carrier, specialist carrier, command post carrier and an ambulance type. 'Boxer is the mould for the types of partnerships we want to build through the forthcoming strategic defense review [due to be published later in 2025],' Eagle stated before confirming defense partners manufacturing in the UK is a 'win-win' solution. The news follows comments made at IAV in 2024 by MoD officials who voiced frustration with Boxer manufacturers regarding supply chain delays. Local manufacturing of Boxer in the UK falls in line with the Anglo-German 'Trinity House Agreement on Defence' signed in October 2024 which encouraged bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Drive units and mission modules are being manufactured in Telford and Stockport with support from KNDS UK. Platforms are expected to enter service by the end of 2030 with a first batch of Boxers comprising 540 platforms, RBSL officials confirmed to Breaking Defense. UK manufacturing facilities are also expecting to build additional bridging, artillery and mortar Boxer variants in the future. Martyn Williams, Senior Responsible Officer, Mechanised Infantry Programme &amp; Director Boxer Strategic Pipeline said in a statement: 'The first UK-manufactured Boxer rolling off the production line is a landmark moment for the British Army and Defence in delivering Boxer and restoring full Armoured Fighting Vehicle manufacture back into the UK. 'It also reflects a strong partnership between the UK and Germany under the Trinity House agreement. This milestone exemplifies the upcoming Defence Industrial Strategy as we deliver world-class military vehicles whilst driving prosperity and growth across the UK.’ The Boxer displayed at IAV featured Kongsberg’s RS4 remote weapon station although a 12.7mm weapon system was not integrated on the vehicle. The British Army is also considering integration of the larger RS6 remote weapon station in the future, equipped with a 30mm cannon. According to Will Gibby, managing director of RBSL, the local build of Boxer is the first time the UK has manufactured an armoured vehicle since the Terrier armoured engineering vehicle by BAE Systems. That vehicle's production line in Newcastle, England, was shutdown in 2013 after orders came to a halt. Speaking to Breaking Defense at IAV, Gibby confirmed RBSL has manufactured a total of four Boxers to date with another four currently undergoing factory acceptance tests. An additional 48 platforms are scheduled to be manufactured over the course of 2025 in command post, special carrier, ambulance and infantry carrier variants, he added. Gibby also explained how RBSL is 'looking at capacity [to support] international pipelines', similar to Boxer vehicles being manufactured in Australia and destined for service in the German Armed Forces. 'We want to increase and develop new variants in the UK,' he added before referencing opportunities in Germany via the Trinity House agreement as well as potential sales into the Middle East. According to an MoD statement provided to Breaking Defense, the Boxer is an 'all terrain, highly protected armoured fighting vehicle that can be rapidly adapted to suit various military missions, roles and scenarios across many theatres of operations.' 'The purpose of Boxer is to rapidly transport soldiers and mission systems to and around the battlefield, enabling them to conduct their special-to-arm roles. In addition, Boxers can be rapidly reconfigured, meaning that through its life, its capabilities can evolve,' the statement added. The UK’s Boxer variant is derived from a series of lessons learned from similar designs adopted by Australia, Germany, Lithuania and the Netherlands. The British Army's ambition of delivering a warfighting division by 2030 is based around the delivery and entry into service of Boxer, new Challenger 3 main battle tanks and Ajax armored fighting vehicles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/uk-unveils-first-locally-built-boxer-armored-vehicle/	2025-01-23T08:33:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-10.12.35-e1737637603661.png
LCS-10 to be first ship this year suited with lethality, survivability upgrade	USS Gabrielle Giffords in the South China Sea in 2020. (US Navy photo.) WASHINGTON — The Littoral Combat Ship Gabrielle Giffords (LCS-10) will be the first in the class to receive a series of upgrades this year focused on improving the ship class' lethality and survivability, according to the Navy officer overseeing the program. US Navy Capt. JJ Murawski told attendees last week at the annual Surface Navy Association symposium that the upgrade package, formally called LCS Lethality and Survivability, will initially only be installed onboard Independence-class variants. Murawski said that the second phase of the program will consider installing the package on Freedom-class variants but that funding has not yet been programmed into the future years. The upgrades include integrating the Naval Strike Missile onto the ship, installing a version of the service's electronic warfare program dubbed SEWIP Lite and a decoy-launching system called Nulka. The upgrade also includes a new common combat management system. The Navy's fiscal 2025 budget justification documents state the service will upgrade ships in the order they are scheduled for regular maintenance, meaning that Manchester (LCS-14) and Charleston (LCS-18) should also receive the upgrades in FY25. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor working with the Navy to install the capabilities onboard the Littoral Combat Ships. While not formally listed as part of the L&amp;S program in the service's budget documents, some LCS have recently been spotted with the company's Mk 70 Payload Delivery Systems, a vertical launching system that allows the ship to expands the portfolio of missiles the ship can employ.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/lcs-10-to-be-first-ship-this-year-suited-with-lethality-survivability-upgrade/	2025-01-23T07:52:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Giffords-e1640100556837-scaled.jpg
As Trump orders troops, airlift assets to border, long-term impact is unclear	US Army Reserve soldiers receive an overview of Washington D.C. as part of the 4th Annual Day with the Army Reserve May 25, 2016. The event was led by the Private Public Partnership office. (U.S. Army/Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is sending 1,000 Army soldiers and 500 Marines to the Southern border, alongside military aircraft as the Pentagon moves out on its new orders to bolster its presence near Mexico. 'This is just the beginning,' Acting Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses wrote in an announcement. 'In short order, the department will develop and execute additional missions in cooperation with DHS [the Department of Homeland Security], federal agencies, and state partners to address the full range of threats outlined by the President at our nation’s borders.' There are already roughly 2,500 military personnel along the border supporting the US Customs and Border Protection mission, so today's announcement brings the total up to around 4,000 troops deployed on American soil. Following the announcement, a senior defense official and military official briefed reporters in the Pentagon on the plan. Those additional troops are already enroute, they said, and will be helping out with the ongoing missions and emplacing barriers. Aircraft including C-130s and C-17s are also on their way to help deport individuals being detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Other assets, such as drones, are also under consideration to be sent to the border, the senior military official added, as are additional troops. Several news outlets have reported that the number of personnel could soar towards 10,000, but the military official said no final decision has been made yet. Pentagon leaders have not yet had to pull troops away from other missions outside of the US for this one or trade future mission readiness, the military official added. However, if the Trump administration decides additional personnel are needed along the Southwest border, that may become a factor for consideration, the military official added. Today’s announcement comes as Trump begins enacting a series of campaign promises. Just hours after being sworn in as the 47th president on Monday, for example, he issued a presidential action declaring a national emergency on the Southern border and then an executive action calling on the Pentagon to clarify the military’s role 'protecting the territorial integrity of the United States.' In that order, he gave the secretary of defense 10 days to deliver a Unified Command Plan tasking US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) with the border mission. Then, following delivery of that plan, NORTHCOM head Gen. Gregory Guillot will be given an additional 30 days to craft a commander’s estimate of just what it will take to seal the border. 'President Trump directed action from the Department of Defense on securing our nation’s borders and made clear he expects immediate results. That is exactly what our military is doing under his leadership,' Salesses wrote in his memo.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/as-trump-orders-troops-airlift-assets-to-border-long-term-impact-is-unclear/	2025-01-22T16:50:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Pentagon-for-Aerojet-Rocketdyne-AUSA-2023.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: Viasat bid protest at heart of DoD investigation of SDA head Tournear	Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear (R) addresses the audience at the Space Foundation's 2024 Space Symposium. (Space Foundation) WASHINGTON — While the Department of the Air Force has not revealed the impetus behind its unusual Jan. 16 announcement that Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear has been placed on administrative leave, Breaking Defense has learned that the move is related to an ongoing bid protest by Viasat over an recent SDA contract award. According to several sources involved, Tournear allegedly stepped afoul of DoD contracting procedures in the runup to SDA's Aug. 16 award of two prototype agreements worth approximately $424 million in total to York Space Systems and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, a subsidiary of Terran Orbital, out of a field of eight competitors. For the award, each contractor was tasked with building 10 Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) – Gamma variant prototype space vehicles. (Terran Orbital was bought by Lockheed Martin in October.) SDA has explained that the Gamma satellites will not be part of the operational Transport Layer of data relay satellites, but instead are related to the agency's efforts to develop fire control capabilities for missile defense and the experimental FOO Fighter program. Viasat protested the award in September in the US Court of Federal Claims, alleging its offering was unfairly weighted and that its competitors were improperly given a helping hand in the bid process. The protest has resulted in a re-evaluation of the awards by the Department of the Air Force and SDA. The exact nature of Tournear's purported misstep is unclear, as is its precise relation to the protest case. He is not named in publicly available court documents reviewed by Breaking Defense, nor has there been any public indication that Tournear is being accused of any criminal violation of the Procurement Integrity Act, which lays out ethical constraints for federal government officials involved in buying goods and services. The Defense Department implements the act through the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), directives related to ethics and acquisition. Compliance is overseen by individual DoD agencies and the military departments that hold procurement authorities. An SDA spokesperson referred all questions to the Department of the Air Force. An Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Tuesday that the department had 'no releasable information' as to the reason for Tournear's administrative leave. The decision to place Tournear on administrative leave while an investigation is undertaken was made by then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli, the Air Force spokesperson said. Calvelli today declined to comment for this report. Viasat did not respond to request for comment about the proposed relook of the contract awards; both York and Lockheed Martin declined to comment and referred questions to SDA. A number of key members of Congress were also briefed on the issue, sources said, but the Hill has been basically silent about the issue despite long-standing support for SDA and Tournear personally among House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. 'The Committee was informed that Dr. Derek Tournear has been placed on investigative administrative leave pending the results of an investigation. While this process plays out, we expect the Space Force and SDA will continue to fulfill its vital mission,' a HASC spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Tuesday. While the decision to sideline an official was not necessarily out of line with DoD precedent, the move to publicize the decision via a Department of the Air Force press release was highly irregular, according to a handful of former and current government officials and long-time industry players. And that has raised speculation about the possibility of politics at play as the change-over in administration begins. Two observers with no skin in the game called the timing of the announcement, coming on the last working day at the Pentagon before President Donald Trump's inauguration, 'suspicious.' It is an open secret in industry circles that Tournear was being considered for a role under the Trump administration, with sources saying he had been in the running for Calvelli's post — and, according to one source close to the deliberations, also was a contender for replacing Frank Kendall as Air Force secretary. (Trump on Jan. 16 nominated the second-in-command at the National Reconnaissance Office, Troy Meink, for the SecAF job.) Both Kendall and Calvelli were appointed by President Joe Biden but also have had long careers in government under administrations of both political stripes, and both had voiced a willingness to stay on in the second Trump Pentagon. Tournear was named SDA director in 2019, under the first Trump administration. Viasat's Sept. 23 protest was filed in claims court rather than with the Government Accountability Office because the award for prototypes was made under Other Transaction Authority, rather than the FAR, which governs acquisition of major DoD programs of record. The lawsuit alleges that SDA unfairly overvalued the bids from Tyvak and, in particular, York, while undervaluing Viasat's offer. Further, Viasat made a claim that SDA gave assistance that could be read as potentially unethical to its competitors. 'Indeed, SDA provided detailed comments to both Tyvak and York on how they could improve their proposals. Also, during their in-person negotiations meeting, SDA spoon-fed Tyvak the exact change it needed to make to receive an award,' according to a court filing by Viasat. On Dec. 2, the US Attorney General's office filed a document with the court saying that the Defense Department and SDA intend to take 'corrective action' regarding the award, including re-evaluating the bids. According to the document, the initial corrective option offered by DoD and SDA would: The document further stated that 'SDA will also mitigate any issues arising from ex parte communications between SDA personnel and bidders before establishment of the competitive range.' One of the ways a federal procurement official can violate the Procurement Integrity Act is by providing 'inside information' to one bidder that is not available to others. The government filing explained that should the re-evaluation result in a decision to re-award York and Tyvak, then SDA will 'lift the stay' on the current OTA awards, and issue any modifications deemed necessary. And if the decision is instead to make an award to another firm, then one or the other of the current awards would be terminated and a new one to the new vendor issued. The government on Jan. 3 provided the court with an update on SDA's corrective action plans, but the details were put under seal. A further update is due on Jan. 27. So, it's possible that a different course of action could be taken with regard to re-evaluating the earlier awards; for example, only re-evaluating one of the winners as opposed to both.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/exclusive-viasat-bid-protest-at-heart-of-dod-investigation-of-sda-head-tournear/	2025-01-22T13:32:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240411_space_symposium_tournear_space_foundation-e1712859283861.jpg
Japan inks deal with Shield AI for sea-based V-BAT drones	Civilian contractors embarked with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit conduct a V-BAT drone flight at Colonel Ernesto Rabina Air Base, Tarlac, Philippines, Oct. 4, 2022. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Manuel Alvarado) WASHINGTON — The Japanese navy has agreed to buy an undisclosed number of V-BAT drones from American firm Shield AI, bolstering the service’s sea-based awareness through what the company claims is Tokyo’s first maritime-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform. Inked as a direct commercial sale, the deal announced by Shield AI today does not include expected quantities or dollar values. The firm expects to deliver the first of the vertical takeoff and landing V-BATs 'later this year' as part of 'a planned multi-year buy' for the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), a company spokesperson told Breaking Defense. 'Japan is a vital ally in the Indo-Pacific and critical to regional deterrence efforts, and this partnership strengthens Japan's ability to respond effectively to crises and ensures they are equipped with a reliable and proven platform for maritime ISR missions,' Shield AI President Brandon Tseng said in a company press release. The drone buy, which Shield AI claims will yield the first ship-launched ISR platform for the JMSDF, underscores an increased focus on the seas by Japan amid rising tensions with China. According to the company spokesperson, the V-BAT specifically is 'the first-ever Group 3 ship-based ISR platform that was awarded following a competition for procurement (i.e., not a company owned/company operated (COCO) deployment).' Shield AI has been marketing the V-BAT after acquiring the rights to the drone by buying a company called Martin UAV in 2021. The V-BAT drone has been selected by the US Coast Guard for maritime surveillance and has reportedly proved effective against dense electromagnetic warfare waged on the battlefield in Ukraine. The V-BAT now will even be manufactured abroad after Shield AI recently announced a joint venture with the Indian company JSW Group to build the drone in India. Shield AI currently manufactures the V-BAT at its production facilities in Dallas, Texas. The deal with the JMSDF announced today includes a partnership with an undisclosed 'local entity,' the company spokesperson said, though they noted that the drones will still be produced on American soil.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/japan-inks-deal-with-shield-ai-for-sea-based-v-bat-drones/	2025-01-22T13:18:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/v-bat-scaled-e1737578082522.jpg
Israel’s Chief of Staff Halevi resigns over Oct. 7 failure	Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi attends a ceremony marking Memorial Day for fallen soldiers of Israel's wars and victims of attacks at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl military cemetery on May 13, 2024. (Photo by GIL COHEN-MAGEN / POOL / AFP) (Photo by GIL COHEN-MAGEN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) JEURSALEM — Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi announced his resignation in a Tuesday letter to Israeli Minister of Defense Israel Katz. Halevi will be leaving his role on March 6, meaning he will leave his command after the first phase of the recent hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas, which began Sunday and is expected to last 40 days. 'I informed the Minister of Defense today (Tuesday) that by virtue of my recognition of my responsibility for the IDF's failure on October 7th, and at a time when the IDF has significant achievements and is in the process of implementing the agreement to release our hostages, I have requested to leave my role,' he said in a statement. 'Until then, I will complete the IDF’s inquiries into the events of October 7th and strengthen the IDF's readiness for security challenges.' Katz accepted the resignation and noted that he expressed appreciation for Halevi. Katz thanked Halevi 'for his contribution to the IDF throughout his years of service as a fighter and commander, and for his part in the IDF's great achievements in the difficult war that was forced upon us,' according to a statement from his office. Katz promised an orderly succession process in the coming month and a half. The selection of a chief of staff can be a complex process, and in the midst of an ongoing multi-front war in a politically charged atmosphere with ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel’s leaders will have to scramble to complete the process. Halevi is the highest-ranking officer to resign over the Oct. 7 debacle in which more than 1,000 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage. Other officers who have resigned due to the conflict include the head of IDF Military Intelligence Maj. Gen. Haliva, who left in April 2024, saying he would always carry the pain of the war; Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, the head of the Gaza Division which was tasked with defending the border on Oct. 7, who resigned in June; and the head of the IDF’s Southern Command Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman who resigned Jan. 21, in an announcement that appeared timed with Halevi’s own decision. Further key officials and officers have left or asked to leave, though not in direct connection to Oct. 7. For example, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, the IDF’s Deputy Chief of Staff had his tenure extended during the war, but asked to end his role in February. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in early November, but not because of failures on Oct. 7. The 23rd chief of staff, Halevi was tapped for the role in September 2022. His appointment was approved in late October 2022 and he assumed his role in January 2023. He came with an illustrious background, having led the Paratrooper’s Brigade during the 2009 war in Gaza and having served as the head of IDF Intelligence and Southern Command. At the time, it was assumed he would face tough tests in the new job because of Israel’s multi-front challenges facing Iranian-backed proxies. Halevi’s resignation was widely expected in circles that follow the IDF. Rumors that he would resign began spreading in the fall of 2024, though the war effort seemed to quiet that idea. Sentiment around his resignation is mixed. For instance, days before his resignation, Israel’s left-leaning Haaretz included an op-ed demanding the 'beleaguered army chief must not resign.' On Tuesday, however, Yaakov Katz, author of 'Israel vs. Iran: The Shadow War' and a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, wrote on X that 'IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi finally did what he should have done months ago — taken responsibility for the failures that led to October 7. His resignation will have political consequences but they are secondary. What’s important is the message he is sending to troops — the IDF code is based on personal accountability.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/israels-chief-of-staff-halevi-resigns-over-oct-7-failure/	2025-01-22T12:21:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/GettyImages-2152178444-scaled-e1737571629216.jpg
Army kickstarts possible recompete of Microsoft’s $22 billion IVAS production deal	The Army recently received the new IVAS 1.2 prototype for a series of tests. (US Army) WASHINGTON — The US Army is taking the next step in recompeting its multi-billion dollar mixed-reality goggle production contract with an official ask to industry to send in viable options. The service published its new Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next request for information today, giving interested companies until Feb. 26 to respond with their solutions for the combat-suitable heads-up display. 'IVAS provides soldiers and squads a single platform for increased lethality, mobility, and situational awareness necessary to achieve overmatch against current and future adversaries,' the Army wrote in the release. 'It is a ‘fight first’ system with the benefit of rehearse and train capabilities.' While the RFI doesn’t guarantee the service will recompete its current 10-year production contract with Microsoft valued up to $22 billion, it does kickstart such a process after surveying the market last year. Microsoft did not immediately respond to questions about the new RFI today but has previously said it will throw its hat in the ring. Anduril founder Palmer Luckey has also teased development of a new mixed-reality device, though it is not clear if this would be a partnership with Microsoft. Massachusetts-based Kopin has also said it's interested in completing, while companies like Palantir may also be eyeing a bid. One industry source closely following the program welcomed today’s RFI, saying it signals that the Army is ready for a new approach and has seen 'competitive/superior' technology on the market and is ready to move forward. Initially pitched as a game changer for the service, the current IVAS contract is based around Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 heads-up display. The idea was a single device soldiers could use both in combat (including under the cover of darkness) and for virtual training. However, reports began emerging in 2021 about problems with the device, followed by a scathing Pentagon inspector general report that detailed soldiers complaining of discomfort, dizziness, nausea, and system reliability. Service leaders publicly stood behind the program at first, before they began tempering expectations and splitting the program up into three initial versions — the 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 iterations of the goggles. (The service has acquired 5,000 1.0 units, with plans to acquire an additional 5,000 1.1 units for limited use.) It then billed the new 1.2 version as the make-or-break upgrade — an iteration to correct past problems, in part, by transitioning the device from a helmet-like display with a 70-degree field-of-view, to a hinged, flat design with a 60-degree field-of-view that soldiers can flip up. But while the service worked with Microsoft on the redesign and testing, it also began teasing an IVAS Next initiative. After attending Army-led industry days and one-on-one meetings with the government last year, a trio of industry sources independently told Breaking Defense they were preparing for a new open competition to decide who wins a lucrative contract to produce the headset. In tandem, Army leaders began taking inventory of all of their night vision devices to help decide just which units need what and help define IVAS Next requirements for an upcoming competition, one service official told Breaking Defense last year. Specifically, members of the from the 75th Ranger Regiment were tasked with running IVAS 1.2 through the ringer alongside dedicated night vision systems like the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENGV-B) and another system dubbed PVS-14, the official told Breaking Defense. 'They’re going to provide the best feedback in terms of, here’s what the ENGV-B can provide versus a PVS-14 versus the capability inside of IVAS,' the official said. The goal is for those Rangers to provide a 'more mature look' at how they use night vision while also answering questions about the ideal IVAS form factor, battery needs and more.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-kickstarts-possible-recompete-of-microsofts-22-billion-ivas-production-deal/	2025-01-22T12:04:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/7941063-scaled-e1691079418376.jpg
Trump says Europe should pay more for Ukraine. What if they bankrolled American weapons?	A Ukrainian soldier waits for orders near artillery shells for the M109 artillery self-propelled vehicle on the front line, in the direction of Bakhmut, where clashes between Russia and Ukraine continue to take place, in Donetsk Oblast, Ukraine on January 22, 2024. (Photo by Ignacio Marin/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON and BELFAST — In his first public comments on Ukraine since taking office, President Donald Trump said last night that he was still evaluating whether the United States will continue military support to Kyiv, but either way, Europe will need to step up its own contributions. But could more European defense spending mean investment in American weapons? 'We’ll look into that,' Trump said when asked whether the US would turn off the tap of weaponry to Ukraine. 'We’re talking to [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. We’re going to be talking with President [Vladimir] Putin very soon. And we’ll see how it all happens. We’re going to look at it very soon. One thing I do feel, the European Union should be paying a lot more than they’re paying.' 'The European Union should equalize,' he added. 'We’re in there for $200 billion more than the European Union. I mean, what are we, stupid? I guess the answer is yes. Because they must think so.' Figures from the Kiel Institute, a German think tank, indicate that from the start of the conflict through to October 2024, the US lagged behind Europe on spending for Ukraine, by $37.5 billion. Even so, US spending is hugely significant and uncertainty leaves Kyiv waiting with baited breath for what the White House will do. But as recently as last week, an outgoing senior US official told reporters that there were people on Trump's team who supported continuing military support for Ukraine — if there was a way to save the US taxpayer from bearing the brunt of it. The now-former official offered a pitch that seems at first brush very on-brand for Trump: Call on Europe to pay for American support. The idea is that Trump can continue authorizing drawdowns of in-stock US military equipment such as munitions, vehicles and small drones, allowing the speedy transfer of materiel to Kyiv and sustaining pressure on Russia, the official said. But instead of using US funds to backfill Defense Department stocks, Trump can get European allies to foot the bill — a solution that benefits US defense contractors without raising the ire of voters who are skeptical of additional financial support to Ukraine. 'You get to go out and say, we're continuing to support Ukraine, and the Europeans are paying for it,' said the official. 'The Europeans have the cash. They don't have the stuff. That's the problem, is they've run their stocks down, and they don't have anywhere near the production capacity. … It's going to have to be the American defense industry who is continuing to power the fight, if Ukraine is going to stay in it.' Whether such an idea is feasible is unclear. Analysts Breaking Defense spoke with broadly agreed that US pressure could force European countries to bankroll additional military aid packages for Ukraine, but not all believe that US defense firms would be the major beneficiary of those deals due to global industrial base vulnerabilities and political pressures for Europe to fund domestic suppliers. 'It might not normally be realistic, but if the alternative is a cutoff of American support, then it becomes far more of a possibility,' said Jacob Parakilas, research leader for defense strategy, policy and capabilities at RAND Europe. 'As a function of geography and history, European nations — especially those on Europe's eastern flank — are more likely to see Russia's invasion of Ukraine in more existential terms than the US. So while the idea of sending money to a much richer ally in order to buy weapons for a third party might not pass the laugh test under normal circumstances, if the alternative is ceding victory to Russia, it might well become politically feasible (depending of course on exact terms and various other details).' Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Belgian based economics think tank, said that Europeans would have to 'step up their support of Ukraine if the United States wasn't there,' but also stressed that the size of the US defense industrial base poses a fundamental problem for the bankrolling idea floated by the senior official. 'People are starting to understand in Europe that the US defense industrial base would be way too small to rely on in case of peer conflict,' he explained. 'I think there's a strong sense emerging, I hope at least, that, Europe must further develop its domestic' industrial base. Wolff also said that when production of select weapon systems are considered, European output outpaces the US. 'If you take artillery shells for example, Europe is producing more,' he shared. 'My understanding is, even in the area of tanks, Europe is producing more than the United States, which still has relatively small capacities&#8230;.there's no reason to believe that Europeans cannot further increase their domestic production in other weapon systems, and that includes, of course, air defense missiles,' which Ukraine continues to plead with military aid partners to deliver urgently. Tim Lawrenson, a European defense expert, said that without having insight to the thinking of 'prime ministers and presidents' across Europe, it is difficult to offer a perspective on how realistic the European bankrolling US military aid for Ukraine plan might be, but it would certainly play into a narrative, striking a chord with 'some parts of Europe,' that Trump will work from a 'transactional approach' regarding transatlantic relations. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Trump has been critical of US aid to Ukraine and has repeatedly said that he would stop the war by brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, raising concerns in Kyiv that it could be forced to accept unfavorable terms. However, since the start of the new year, there have been signs that the administration is not going to rush into a settlement right away. Two Trump advisers told Reuters last week that the administration now believes it may take months or even longer to negotiate an agreement. In a Truth Social post today, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia if Putin does not come to the negotiating table. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, has shed little light on what the Pentagon’s approach on Ukraine will be under his leadership. In written responses made in advance of his nomination hearing on Tuesday last week, Hegseth said he would 'ensure that the Department of Defense plays a key role in the whole-of government effort to support the President’s Special Envoy for Ukraine-Russia' but did not directly answer questions about whether the Pentagon should continue providing security assistance to Kyiv. During the hearing, Hegseth said he would provide his 'best guidance' to Trump matters such as Ukraine, but did not elaborate. RELATED: SASC pushes forward Hegseth's nomination for defense secretary Whether Congress moves forward with additional Ukraine funds will likely be determined by Trump’s approach, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican on the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. 'It's going to be up to President Trump, what he wants to do. He obviously wants to try to end this war, which obviously we would all like to happen,' he said. 'What I am convinced is that President Trump will not allow — not allow — Ukraine to be another Afghanistan.'

Goldwater-Nichols do-over? Mitchell Institute calls to reinstate service chief’s acquisition powers	A F-35B fighter jet assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 262 (Reinforced) lands aboard amphibious assault carrier USS Tripoli (US Navy) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department has been unable to adequately prepare for great power competition with Russia and China due in large part to the inability of service chiefs to prioritize funding and other resources away from today's needs to those of tomorrow, argues a new policy paper from the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. It's a problem that would require a significant restructuring of the Pentagon chain of command and one that the institute calls on the incoming Trump administration — no stranger to pursuing big changes — to fix. 'Deficiencies of the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Reform Act (GNA) are a root cause of under-resourcing our critical warfighting forces. This legislation restructured the DOD, resulting in a bureaucratic structure that severely restricts the ability of the services to prioritize long-term strategic threats in favor of the immediate, non-combat demands of the combatant commands and civilian defense bureaucracy. Consequently, there is a pervasive pattern within the military of neglect of long-term defense procurement strategies and requirements,' the paper, 'A Call for a New NSC-68 and Goldwater Nichols Reform,' states. In addition, the paper argues, 'organizational misallocation of priority is not only limited to short- versus long- term planning needs but also service equities.' The result has been that the Pentagon has not been able to properly fun its pivot to the Indo-Pacific theater, which the paper asserts requires a shift in resources from the Army to the Air Force, Space Force and the Navy. 'Instead, the service shares of the defense budget remain static, and DOD’s leadership continues to approve Army investments in duplicative capabilities — for example, the Army’s $60 – 70 million-a-shot long-range surface-to-surface missiles for long-range strikes, which the Air Force could conduct with far more cost-effective capabilities,' the paper says. The key to fixing the short- vs. long-term priorities problem is 'repositioning the service chiefs within the chain of command while taking steps to preserve the ability of U.S. forces to conduct joint operations.' Service chiefs need to be able to set future requirements and ensure that funding is allocated to fulfill those requirements with kit and personnel resources, the paper elaborates. The authors — Richard Andres, Mitchell non-resident senior fellow, along with retired Air Force generals Michael Moseley and Larry Stutzriem — further maintain another reason for the failure to reformulate US forces to face peer competitors is stultification and inefficiencies caused by 'over centralization' of the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD). 'A full-scale review of the array of bureaucracies connected with OSD should be accomplished with an eye to shifting missions and authorities toward the services. Emphasis should be placed on enabling strategic decision-making that prioritizes the acquisition of capabilities based on an honest assessment of cost-per-effect and the deployment of forces geared toward addressing the challenges of great power competition,' the paper says. The paper makes four recommendations:	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/goldwater-nichols-do-over-mitchell-institute-calls-to-reinstate-service-chiefs-acquisition-powers/	2025-01-22T06:08:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/7394130-scaled-e1692372210861.jpg
