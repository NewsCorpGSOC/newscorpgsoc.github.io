Hegseth orders ‘disestablishing’ of Office of Net Assessment	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the 'disestablishing' of the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment, a key office responsible for high-level strategic analysis, according to a memo obtained by Breaking Defense. The memo, dated March 13 and signed by Hegseth, directs the Pentagon’s Performance Improvement Officer and Director of Administration and Management to reassign all civilian employees to other 'mission critical positions' inside the department, while military personnel will return to their service to receive new billets. Simultaneously, the Pentagon’s top acquisition official is directed to 'ensure that the necessary steps are taken' by department contracting authorities to terminate 'all ONA contracts awarded for ONA and ONA-related requirements.' A number of DC think tanks and research organizations will likely be impacted by these cancelled contracts. However, it appears ONA will live on in some manner: the memo directs the deputy secretary of defense to provide a plan in 30 days to rebuild the office in a manner 'consistent with [Hegseth’s] priorities.' The Pentagon did not directly return a request for comment. At roughly the time this story was published, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell sent out a public statement that said 'This decision ensures that our resources are focused on the most pressing national security challenges while maintaining accountability and efficiency.' Founded in 1973, the Office of Net Assessment is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon’s internal think tank due to its role providing classified, long-term strategic-level studies on threats, trends, risks and opportunities that could shape the geopolitical environment 20 to 30 years in the future. Jim Baker, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, took over ONA in 2015 following the retirement of Andrew Marshall, its founding director who was often referred to as the 'Pentagon’s Yoda.' The Washington Post reported in 2015 that Baker’s appointment reflected then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter’s interest in receiving assessments related to near-term threats as well as the long-term studies the office was known for. On Feb. 7, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, (R-Iowa), sent a letter to Hegseth questioning whether the office’s purpose was still necessary and asking for information related to ONA’s production net assessments since 2007 and the last decade of contracts. 'I remain concerned that ONA is not performing its mission for the taxpayer and has engaged in financial waste,' he wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/hegseth-orders-disestablishing-of-office-of-net-assesment/	2025-03-13T15:08:49-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
Who’s Who in Defense: Michael Waltz, National Security Advisor (NSA)	Responsibilities As the 29th U.S. National Security Advisor, Waltz is a key aide to President Donald Trump, advising him on national security issues and foreign policy. In his new role, Waltz leads the National Security Council, which is tasked with coordinating multiple federal agencies. Historically, the job of the NSA can be either high or low profile, but it demands quick pivots and cool-headed thinking under the threat of any volatilities. Perhaps the most well-known NSA remains Henry Kissinger, who left an indelible mark on U.S. foreign policy while serving under President Richard Nixon (1969 &#8211; 1976). Quote 'Iran will continue to stoke unrest because they want to destroy Israel. Making concession after concession to Iran is actually what is destabilizing the situation.' Stated Priorities Political Career Military Service The first Green Beret elected to Congress, Waltz served in the Army and National Guard for 27 years, retiring as colonel in the Army Special Forces. He was deployed to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa while on active duty (1996-2000), and served in the National Guard (2000-2025). Business/Private Sector Public Service Prior to joining the private sector, Waltz worked in the Bush administration, serving as defense policy director for Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. He also served as a counterterrorism advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney and helped create a funding and strategy for counternarcotics in Afghanistan and South Asia while working in the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics. Early Years Michael George Glen Waltz was born in Boynton Beach, FL, on January 31, 1974, and was raised in Jacksonville by his mother. Both his father and grandfather were chiefs in the Navy. Education Graduated from Virginia Military Institute with a B.A degree in International Studies. Named an honor graduate. Personal In 2021, Waltz married Julia Nesheiwat, an American academic and a former military intelligence officer. During the span of her career, she has held senior national security and economic policy positions under the administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, becoming his 10th Homeland Security Advisor in 2021. She and Waltz live in Boynton Beach. Awards Waltz received four Bronze Stars while serving in the Special Forces during combat tours in Afghanistan, the Middle East, and Africa.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/whos-who-in-defense-michael-waltz-national-security-advisor-nsa/	2025-03-13T12:55:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Michael_Waltz_featured.png
NRO, MDA pulled out of annual DC Satellite conference due to travel restrictions	The DC Convention Center on Mt. Vernon Square, NW, hosted the Satellite 2025 conference this month. (Photo by Gerald Martineau/The The Washington Post via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — This week's Satellite 2025/GovMilSpace show appears to be the latest defense conference impacted by the Trump administration's Feb. 26 executive order restricting 'non-essential' travel by federal officials and the sweeping cost-cutting spree being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Officials from the National Reconnaissance Office and the Missile Defense Agency had planned to exhibit, but cancelled last minute following the executive order, spokespeople confirmed to Breaking Defense. However, officials from other Pentagon-based agencies — including the Space Development Agency and the Defense Innovation Union — made scheduled appearances on stage, a reflection of the confusion that has swirled around what is and isn't allowed under the executive order. The National Reconnaissance Office's Director's Innovation Initiative, a research and development program aimed at leveraging commercial capabilities, canceled a planned exhibit prior to the satellite show's launch on March 10, an agency spokesperson confirmed. The office is housed at NRO headquarters in Chantilly, Va. 'The presence of NRO’s Director's Innovation Initiative at Satellite 2025 was curtailed in accordance with the latest Executive Order and DoD guidance regarding conference attendance and non-essential travel,' the spokesperson said. Likewise, the Missile Defense Agency's Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer office, headquartered in Huntsville, Ala., also canceled its planned exhibit, with a spokesperson citing the DOGE-related ban on non-essential travel and freezes all use of federal credit cards, While not defense related, NASA's Space Communications and Navigation program office staffed an information booth for the first two days of the show, but abruptly shut it down on the third day. The program office is headquartered at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio but also has local support officials at NASA's Space Operations Directorate. A spokesperson from the NASA Space Communications and Navigation program did not respond by press time to a request for comment about the rationale for the booth's closure. It's unclear if the NRO and MDA attendance was impacted at all by a March 5 memo [PDF], signed by Darin Selnick who is performing the duties of the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, which limits any charges above one dollar on government-issued civilian travel charge cards. In general, government agencies usually are required to pay an upfront fee to register an exhibit space at a trade show — although neither NRO nor MDA was able to confirm if that was the case for Satellite 2025/GovMilSpace. An official at Access Intelligence responsible for booking exhibitors at the show did not return a request for comment about the issue by press time. The non-existence of the NRO and MDA exhibits did not go unnoticed by satellite communications industry officials in attendance at the show, exacerbating fears about how future military trade shows could be affected. That the NRO office is local enough to not require travel costs but still pulled out may raise eyebrows. Attendance by Air Force and Space Force officials and military personnel at the annual Air &amp; Space Forces Association (AFA) Warfare Symposium held March 3-5 in Colorado was sparse, due to travel restrictions imposed by the Department of the Air Force. Further, as first reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, the Air Force Materiel Command’s Life Cycle Management Center has canceled its annual industry seminar, called Life Cycle Industry Days, planned for July 28-29 in Dayton, Ohio. The service cited the Feb. 26 executive order as driving the decision.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/nro-mda-pulled-out-of-annual-dc-satellite-conference-due-to-travel-restrictions/	2025-03-13T12:36:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/dc-convention-center-scaled-e1741893124216.jpg
FCC launches new Council for National Security to counter threats from China	Telecommunication tower with mesh dots, glittering particles for wireless telecommunication technology (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr announced today the launch of the Council for National Security within the agency aimed at fending off foreign bad actors, particularly China. 'Today, the country faces a persistent and constant threat from foreign adversaries, particularly the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],' Carr said in a news release today. 'These bad actors are always exploring ways to breach our networks, devices, and technology ecosystem. It is more important than ever that the FCC remain vigilant and protect Americans and American companies from these threats.' The council will be headed by Adam Chan, a former associate at the Boyden Gray PLLC law firm, per the release. Today’s announcement outlines three focus areas for the council. The first is to reduce the US’s dependencies on foreign adversaries regarding tech and telecommunications supply chains. Second is to 'mitigate' the US’s vulnerabilities to surveillance, espionage and cyberattacks. Lastly, the council will 'ensure' that the US outpaces China in its race to develop and deploy 'critical technologies' such as 5G, 6G, artificial intelligence, satellites and space, quantum, robotics, autonomous systems, and the internet of things. The FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are the two organizations responsible for setting US spectrum policy, and governing which users get access when to what bandwidths for what functions. The FCC regulates commercial spectrum usage while the NTIA is responsible for advocating for spectrum usage for military departments. The announcement comes against the background of a tug-of-war between commercial providers and the Defense Department over usage of key parts of the spectrum, specifically between the 1 GhZ (gigahertz) to 6 GHz range, which makes up the 3.1-3.45 and 3.5 GHz S-band — widely considered to be the 'Goldilocks' zone of the spectrum. The DoD has contended that this part of the spectrum band is essential for its various satellite communications, radars and navigation systems. However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike. When it comes to the fight over the spectrum, John Sherman, former DoD chief information officer and now dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University, previously told Breaking Defense that 'it is a zero sum game' for the DoD. 'There is finite spectrum, and the physics of the spectrum, about the desirability of the lower [3 GHz band] both for our target acquisition radars and for 5G, this makes it very difficult,' he said. Carr is viewed as someone who supports the commercial sector over DoD on the spectrum fight. While there are likely a multitude of reasons as to why Carr is making this move, including the recent attacks on the US telecommunications sector facilitated by Chinese threat actor Salt Typhoon, supporters of the Pentagon may look at today's news with a wary eye.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/fcc-launches-new-council-for-national-security-to-counter-threats-from-china/	2025-03-13T11:30:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_antenna_network_GettyImages-1306156001-scaled-e1660843825841.jpg
New bill would create commission to investigate state of American shipbuilding	The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), front, passes the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush (CVN 77) as it departs Norfolk Naval Shipyard after completing a 10-month regularly scheduled extended carrier incremental availability. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Steven Edgar) WASHINGTON — Three House lawmakers today introduced legislation to establish a congressional commission to 'investigate the condition of the U.S. maritime industry and impediments to its growth.' The bill, dubbed the 'Save Our Shipyards Act,' is co-sponsored by Reps. Mark Green, R-Tenn., Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Don Davis, D-N.C. If passed into law, the bill would establish a 'national commission on the maritime industrial base.' 'With a laser focus on the needs of the American military, the commission will develop actionable policy recommendations to revitalize our maritime industrial base,' according to a statement from the lawmakers. The state of American shipbuilding was pushed into the spotlight last week when President Donald Trump announced during an address to Congress the establishment of a new White House office focused on the subject. Green is the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security while Davis and Kiggans are both members on the House Armed Services Committee. Historically, legislation related to national security rarely receives standalone votes on the House floor. Rather, members submit their legislation as amendments to the annual defense policy bill. When asked about a path forward, a spokesman for Green told Breaking Defense, 'With bipartisan support, and a broad recognition of this crisis on both sides of the aisle, we are exploring all options. This includes a standalone vote as well as an amendment to the must-pass NDAA.' Even if the legislation is passed, congressional committees occasionally face stumbling blocks in their early days from a somewhat unlikely source — the lawmakers who established them. Such was the fate of an independent commission that lawmakers established in 2022 to offer policy recommendations for the US Navy’s force structure. That commission severely lagged in starting its work due to some lawmakers failing to appoint their respective commissioners. Separately, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and other lawmakers have been touting their own shipbuilding-focused legislation, dubbed the 'Ships For America Act.' That bill, among other things, would create a maritime czar inside the executive branch oversees shipbuilding issues that touch both the Pentagon and the Transportation Department. Notably, that legislation also had explicit support from former Rep. Mike Waltz, who is now Trump’s national security advisor.

Don’t let ‘efficiency’ result in looser standards for defense contractors	U.S. Army Reserve soldiers receive an overview of Washington D.C. as part of the 4th Annual Day with the Army Reserve May 25, 2016. The event was led by the Private Public Partnership office. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker) Christopher Kubasik — CEO of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. and Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association — recently published an open letter to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), recommending the elimination of Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) in the name of efficiency. It’s a clever attempt to position a traditional defense contractor as an ally of new thinking, but it comes with a big caveat: Eradicating these standards would only promote more Pentagon waste. As Kubasik explains, Congress established Cost Accounting Standards to protect taxpayers from misallocated costs or unreasonable expenses in military contracts. This remains true today. CAS are a set of accounting principles used to price certain government contracts — specifically, what are known as 'cost-based' contracts. These are contracts that are priced based on the actual or expected cost of performing the work. Without CAS, contractors could essentially charge the government whatever they want — regardless of actual costs incurred. Kubasik argues that Cost Accounting Standards are duplicative because contractors are already required to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), suggesting that they 'replace' CAS. But Cost Accounting Standards serve an entirely different purpose than GAAP. GAAP provides the basis for financial reporting at the highest level, the 30,000-foot view of a company’s financial performance, including its cash flows and profitability. GAAP are enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to protect investors — so that they have a full understanding of a company’s financial position, including assets and liabilities. GAAP exists to provide financial information about companies so that investors and creditors can make informed decisions before investing or extending credit to companies. The SEC does not concern itself with the minutiae of contract costing — or the process through which companies determine how to charge the government on cost-based government contracts. In fact, the government established Cost Accounting Standards in 1970 because the General Accounting Office (now known as the Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress) concluded that GAAP were inadequate for determining how companies allocate costs to relevant government contracts. This reality has not changed, and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are inappropriate for companies to use in determining the costs that should be charged to government contracts. In contrast, Cost Accounting Standards provide contractors with criteria to measure and assign costs to specific contracts. It outlines how to allocate costs between government contracts and non-Federal work — guidance that is still absent from GAAP. Cost Accounting Standards are also the mechanism through which the government recoups funds when contractors do not consistently apply established cost accounting practices, charging the government for unreasonable costs. The ability to recover taxpayer dollars improperly charged by contractors is vital to effective oversight, without which inefficient spending abounds. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles do not enable the government to recoup such costs. One need only confer with recent history to understand the importance of Cost Accounting Standards. In 2020 the Defense Contract Management Agency reported over $3.1 billion in CAS compliance issues in active litigation with contractors. That amount did not include informal disputes that had not yet ripened into litigation. Far from pesky red tape, the Cost Accounting Standards enable the government to hold contractors accountable for wasteful spending. So while Pentagon contractors may claim that they find CAS to be burdensome, they provide the government critical insight into the costs of performing a government contract. Without these standards, the government, on behalf of American taxpayers, would not be able to meaningfully challenge contractors when they engage in overcharging. Efficient spending requires contractor accountability. The Pentagon cannot monitor performance on military contracts without visibility into contractors’ cost expenditures. The government not only uses this cost information for current contracts, but also to price future contracts. Absent the cost information provided by Cost Accounting Standards, the government is at the mercy of contractors to provide accurate and complete contract cost information without accounting gimmicks. There is no doubt that the absence of these standards would result in increased contract costs. Without Cost Accounting Standards, the Pentagon loses much of its ability to hold contractors accountable for unreasonable expenses borne by the government, increasing military spending in both the short and long-term. Eliminating these standards would be irresponsible, resulting in potentially billions of dollars in wasteful spending at the expense of taxpayers.

A nuclear Poland? Logistics, political challenges ahead of potential Warsaw deal	A general view taken on March 7, 2025 shows MPs listening to the speech of Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk on the situation in Ukraine at the plenary hall of Poland's parliament in Warsaw. (WOJTEK RADWANSKI/AFP via Getty Images) WARSAW and WASHINGTON — Last week, Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk stood in front of the parliament and gave a speech on the state of European security. And in it, he made eyebrows all across the world raise up with a declaration that his government was open to joining up with a nuclear security effort proposed by Paris. 'We must also look more boldly into the future when it comes to arms technology. We are seriously talking to the French about their idea of a nuclear umbrella over Europe,' Tusk said. 'It is high time for Poland, using not only the resources it has, but also its own experience, experience on the battlefield, Ukrainian experience, to look more boldly at our possibilities concerning the most modern weapons. 'At the moment — I say this with full responsibility — purchases of conventional weapons, the most traditional ones, are not enough.' It’s an extraordinary statement, but one that experts say should not be a full surprise, given Poland’s longstanding fears about Russia, its aggressiveness in rearming since the Ukraine invasion, and the clear signals from Washington that the NATO alliance may not be as iron clad as believed for decades. Artur Kacprzyk of the Polish Institute of International Affairs says the timing of Tusk’s comment reflects real world politics. 'It is possible that a national nuclear option is being floated by the Polish government to convince the U.S. not to weaken security guarantees for Poland at the time when the Trump administration seeks a reset with Russia and indicated it would cut military presence in Europe,' Kacprzyk told Breaking Defense. 'Poland’s history makes it very clear why they are concerned that the people they align with, and the people they rely on for protection from Russia, will abandon them,' Jon Wolfsthal, a former US government official now with the Federation of American Scientists, told Breaking Defense. Tusk’s comments are likely 'a signal of concern — maybe to motivate the United States, but clearly designed to play on the French and perhaps the British. But I think it’s also an open, transparent signal for concern in trying to figure out how they protect themselves.' Added Marek Świerczyński, head of the security and international affairs desk at the Polityka Insight center for policy analysis based in Warsaw, 'Tusk's declaration that ‘Poland must reach for the most modern possibilities also related to nuclear weapons and modern unconventional weapons’ … must be recognized that it is the most far-reaching [nuclear statement] because it comes from the prime minister, in parliament and at a time of rebuilding the European security order.' It doesn't appear the issue is going away anytime soon. On Thursday, Polish President Andrzej Duda, a political opponent of Tusk, called for the US to base nuclear weapons on Polish soil. But analysts tell Breaking Defense that the issue comes with major logistical, and geopolitical, hurdles. In the early 1960s, the Polish Army was equipped with two Soviet nuclear-capable weapons, the 8K11 and 3R10 missiles. Due to their low accuracy, they could only be effectively used as carriers of 3N14 nuclear warheads. Twelve of the MiG-21PFM aircraft delivered to Poland were also adapted to carry nuclear weapons. In the mid-1960s, Polish-Soviet talks resulted in an agreement to build three nuclear weapons depots inside Poland, based on Soviet plans, each equipped with two nuclear weapons stores. According to initial plans, they were to store 178 nuclear warheads, which were to be carried by 8K11 and 3R10 missiles. Construction of the depots began in 1967 and was completed in January 1970. Then the depots were transferred to the Northern Group of Soviet Forces, which was to take care of the charges until the outbreak of war with NATO, in which case control was to be transferred to the Polish Army. According to disclosed data, in the mid-1980s they stored 14 500-kT warheads, 83 10-kT warheads, two 200-kT bombs, 24 15-kT bombs and 10 0.5-kT bombs. In 1991, Poland announced that they would remove the nuclear capable delivery systems from their weapons inventory. Still, questions inside Poland about whether it benefits them to have nuclear weapons in country has persisted. They only gained energy after the Ukraine invasion, when Poland launched a dramatic reinvention of its armed forces. Tusk’s statement isn’t even the first time a recent prime minister raised the issue: In June 2023, then-Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki declared his interest in hosting nuclear weapons under the NATO umbrella. But the push has new energy given the events of the last few weeks: the dramatic White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the statements from European leaders that they can no longer rely on America as a partner, and Trump’s further statements that he may not feel obligated to protect NATO nations in case of a conflict. According to a Feb. 21 poll, 52.9 percent of surveyed Poles supported the idea of Poland having its own nuclear weapons, with 27.9 percent against. Support for the nuclear option is likely to increase if Poland’s security environment deteriorates further, especially if Russia scores a victory in its war against Ukraine, and the US reduces its military presence in Europe and commitment to NATO. Donald Tusk, the leader of Civic Platform (PO) opposition alliance, speaks during election convention in Katowice, Poland on October 12, 2023. This year's parliamentary elections will be held in Poland on October 15th. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense emphasized that Tusk’s statement was fairly broad, and details are fairly scant. Świerczyński noted that 'we must first know what we are talking about, and unfortunately both President Emmanuel Macron's proposal and Prime Minister Donald Tusk's statement do not make this task any easier.' At a base level, though, Świerczyński feels Tusk made a mistake even talking publicly about the concept. 'It is not like partners, competitors or — most of all — enemies would look on idly at some hypothetical-theoretical ‘Polish nuclear program,’' he said. 'In this sense, I am angry with the Prime Minister for talking about it at all, because these matters are so sensitive that it is better to talk about them as little as possible and do as much as possible — quietly, without bragging or even showing the effects, although this is difficult for a politician.' What a French nuclear umbrella for Poland would look like is unclear. A former defense official, speaking on background, told Breaking Defense that 'In Europe, the United Kingdom and France, which possess relatively small nuclear arsenals, would be hard-pressed to replace the backstop provided by U.S. conventional and nuclear forces on behalf of the continent absent a different approach to requirements or costly changes in force diversity and size.' In theory, Wolfsthal said, 'France has nuclear subs, so potentially those could be at the disposal of Europe, and if you put French troops on the border with Russia that means France is committed to protect those troops, and that’s a tripwire.' But, he emphasized, such a shift would require a radical posture change for France. As first reported by Breaking Defense, the F-35 was certified to carry and deploy the B61-12 tactical nuclear weapon in October 2023; Poland is currently in the process of procuring 32 of the stealth fighters, which will all be delivered by 2029. However, the F-35 isn’t qualified to carry any French nuclear weapons, so teaming up with Paris would likely require alternatives — whether bringing old Mirage 2000s back into service or having some of France’s limited nuclear-capable Rafales stationed inside the country. While Tusk did not rule out a domestic nuclear effort, Poland developing its own nuclear program is almost surely unrealistic, according to Kacprzyk, both for logistical and geopolitical reasons. 'While Poland could perhaps produce first explosive nuclear devices within a few years of a determined effort, it would take much longer to obtain a credible nuclear arsenal,' he said. 'Risks would be related to the detection of such a nuclear program by Russia and allies alike.' 'While pursuing nuclear weapons, Poland would have to contend with the risk of Russia using force to prevent such a program from being successful,' Kacprzyk added. However, he noted that if Poland sees risk at being abandoned by the US, Warsaw would 'be at high risk of Russian aggression anyway.' Added Wolfsthal, 'If NATO’s in shambles and Poland says we need a nuke, wherever they build it, those become instant targets. It becomes very unstable and very volatile very quickly.' And how Poland’s allies might react is also unclear. In theory, Warsaw could face sanctions or isolation for violating the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), but realistically, Poland would be taking action in conjunction with other European nations. By acting jointly in the future, European countries could pool their knowledge, resources, and infrastructure and make it more difficult for Russia to try to forcibly prevent nuclear weapons programs' Kacprzyk observed. But the political fallout would be wide, said the former Pentagon official, because 'a decision by even one of our democratic allies or partners to actually cross the nuclear weapons threshold is not something the NPT is likely to be able to survive.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/a-nuclear-poland-logistics-political-challenges-ahead-of-potential-warsaw-deal/	2025-03-13T07:29:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/tusk-speech-poland-e1741872542639.jpg
Iron Drone Raider is at the cutting edge of autonomous drone defense	The array of counter unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) in the global defense marketplace share a common limitation. Almost all of them require a human in the loop to be effective. Iron Drone Raider does not. It represents a new generation of autonomous defense in which detecting, classifying, and defeating hostile drones is executed more efficiently, more cheaply and more persistently than ever. The Iron Drone system comes from Ondas Autonomous Systems (Nasdaq: ONDS), a newly organized defense tech competitor in the drone defense space. The system leverages the Israeli expertise of Ondas' subsidiary, Airobotics, in developing fully autonomous drone systems, and includes features that were integrated under the real-time pressure of combat. The Iron Drone system is provided in the USA by another Ondas' subsidiary, American Robotics, which specializes in complex drone operations in military and civilian environments. Development of the Iron Drone system began in 2016 and accelerated following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict in 2023. For much of the year that followed, scores of hostile drones were intercepted in the greater Tel Aviv area where Airobotics is located. The consistent round-the-clock threat of drone attacks and the need to take them down without collateral damage reinforced the Iron Drone Raider team’s conviction that an autonomous approach to CUAS is essential. 'We saw that the traditional contractors in defense were having a hard time here in Israel to maintain the agility to keep up with combat. The enemy is very agile, industry is not,' says Meir Kliner, CEO of Airobotics and President of Ondas Autonomous Systems. As in Ukraine, the threat to populated areas in Israel from both long and short-range drones quickly mutated from remotely controlled, radio frequency (RF) linked UAVs to pre-programmed and autonomous air vehicles capable of navigating to and striking targets without command and control. Opportunities for drone detection and mitigation narrowed with correspondingly shorter interception timelines and increasing probability of collateral damage. The Iron Drone system is a response to these realities, a platform that offers persistently-aware, human-independent, reusable and low-collateral drone defense without relying on RF sensing for detection or defeat. Iron Drone Raider System Ready to Deploy 24/7. Agile, Autonomous &amp; Modular The Raider drone is the core of the Iron Drone system. It is a high-performance interceptor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) derived from high-speed racing drones. The eight-pound (4 kg), eight-rotor UAV can launch from the surface to intercept hostile rotary-wing or fixed-wing drones at ranges out to a few miles at drone racer speeds while carrying a 2.2-pound payload. The primary payload is a ballistic net which Raider uses to capture Class-1 UAS. The Raider interceptor is deployed from a ground-based box which can hold up to three Raiders to respond to multiple hostile drones. The system integrates adjacent ground-based radar engineered to detect and identify low-altitude drones at ranges out to several miles. Iron Drone can also leverage networked sensors to increase detection ranges. When an incoming drone is detected, the Raider launches from the box and rapidly flies to the target area using ground sensor guidance. It autonomously shifts to its own onboard micro-radar, thermal and optical sensor-based guidance once the threat is in close proximity. It then identifies the target using proprietary computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Raider locks on to the target and dynamically maneuvers into position to fire its net at close range with the adversary drone. The net incapacitates the drone which falls to the ground. An optional net-parachute slows its descent to reduce impact risk over populated areas and preserves the hostile UAV for examination for intelligence or other purposes. Raider provides live video as the entire sequence unfolds autonomously, obviating the need for human-actuated launch and intercept control, significantly shortening response time. Following the interception, Raider returns to the launch site, lands in a predetermined place, is retrieved and undergoes simple maintenance. It is fitted with a new net or other payload, and placed back in its launch pod where it is recharged and ready for reuse. 'We believe we have developed the most mature, robust and combat proven CUAS system currently in the defense market. The system presents next the level of drone autonomy, with no need for human intervention for detection, capable of maneuvering and intercepting small and medium drones no matter how they navigate,' Kliner says, adding that in addition to its instantaneous readiness, the Iron Drone system yields cost benefits from eliminating active remote pilots to lowering the training burden for system operators. 'Within the box you have a couple drones. You just need to plug it into [24 volt] power and it works,' vice president of marketing, Eitan Rotberg, explains. 'You don’t need to charge batteries, you don’t need to add the payload. The drones are ready to go and they’re well-trained.' A network of Iron Drone systems can be deployed to military bases, front-line operating areas/forward command posts, borders or to protect critical infrastructure. Small in size, they can travel with forces in the field on platforms from Humvees and helicopters to manned or autonomous maritime vessels. Already integrated with sensor and command-control systems from leading integrators, the Iron Drone Raider system is agnostic, ready to plug and play with new sensor and C2 system providers in as little two weeks. Its modularity extends to payloads with kinetic options for CUAS and other missions now in development. Raider components can also be sourced from multiple providers and can be Blue-UAS certified to meet U.S. requirements. 'It’s pretty impressive what you can do with this drone,' Kliner affirms. 'It opens a lot of options.' Proven in Israel, Poised To Produce and Deploy in America As it gains combat experience and sees expanded production in Israel, the Iron Drone system is poised to expand to new markets. In the US, Ondas’ American Robotics expects to engage technology partners to support demand for defense and homeland security markets. Iron Drone’s flexibility has been recognized in the Middle East where a major military and a renowned defense contractor placed orders for the system in 2024. It is already operational and proving itself daily, generating feedback that goes directly to the Israeli developer, Airobotics. Eric Brock, chairman and CEO of Ondas Holdings (Nasdaq: ONDS), the parent company of Ondas Autonomous Systems, has guided the growth of Ondas’ drone business since it acquired American Robotics in 2021 and Airobotics in 2023. Ondas’ vision has been to perfect Iron Drone in Israel before introducing it to the U.S. defense market. 'It was actually a blessing to develop this from the urgency of need, from combat pressure,' Brock reflects. 'Now, as we’ve gone operational, we’re devoting resources to bring this technology to other markets.' In addition to Iron Drone, Ondas Autonomous Systems is providing an intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) drone system called Optimus to the public safety, first-responder, defense and commercial security markets. The dual-use Optimus System operates with the same level of autonomy as Iron Drone while undertaking aerial monitoring, inspection and other missions, providing overhead awareness for public safety and critical infrastructure or for homeland security and military installations. Optimus is in-use in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates’ largest and most populated city, with its police force. In the US, Optimus has already undergone a multi-month trial with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation Aeronautics Division and is being demonstrated in a large Northeast US city for major public safety operators. The system was also recently ordered by an important utility on the East Coast to help monitor and secure its infrastructure. A major Middle Eastern military has likewise begun deploying Optimus to secure military bases and sensitive border locations. Ondas Autonomous Systems’ early success with Optimus represents a feature which very few other CUAS providers can leverage – parallel commercial and defense revenue streams. Moreover, Iron Drone Raider and Optimus are complimentary systems, offering militaries, governments and municipalities the opportunity to combine autonomous drone based awareness with autonomous counter-drone defense. Iron Drone Raider System in Flight Tracking Hostile Drone. Iron Drone Raider will be progressively introduced to the United States defense market throughout 2025, As part of the effort, American Robotics will deploy its Iron Drone Demonstration Team to showcase Iron Drone to DoD in upcoming CUAS evaluation exercises and to potential defense industry partners with which the modular system can form comprehensive, layered counter drone solutions. 'We expect to have the Iron Drone Demo Team meeting with various U.S. customers in April,' Brock affirms. The team recently conducted a demonstration in Germany and more are planned. Ondas’ CEO affirms that as part of its outreach American Robotics looks forward to working with a variety of sensor and command-control providers in the US this year. In tandem with Optimus, American Robotics is in the process of establishing domestic Iron Drone production facilities and preparing to scale the system for the American market. As part of the process, it has adopted Palantir’s 'Foundry' enterprise resource platform to organize its operations and build out its supplier network. Utilizing Foundry further expands the integration potential of Iron Drone across traditional and emerging industry primes and presages U.S. market partnerships which American Robotics plans to announce in 2025. Ondas Autonomous Systems also envisions a broader production ecosystem with sufficient capacity to produce hardware for other providers to meet the scale that the growing global counter-drone market &#8211; valued at approximately $1.6 billion in 2023, projected to grow at a 27.8% CAGR to reach $14.9 billion by 2032 – will require. As the market expands, Ondas will continue to refine and diversify Iron Drone Raider, progressively improving its proprietary AI-based autonomy, organic navigation capability, and payload options. As Meir Kliner says, Iron Drone is the first of a new breed of smart CUAS solutions that effectively cut response times, cost, and command complexity. Iron Drone Raider is 'the intelligent counter-UAS drone that can operate in denied environments with precision and accuracy'.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/iron-drone-raider-is-at-the-cutting-edge-of-autonomous-drone-defense/	2025-03-13T06:24:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Breaking-Defense_Main-Image.jpg
Amid ceasefire talks, Baltic defense leaders worry: What will Putin do with his battle-hardened army?	A Russian Il-76MD90A(E) large transport aircraft sits on display at Dubai Airshow 2023. (Tim Martin / Breaking Defense) BELFAST — In the days before a US- and Ukraine-endorsed ceasefire proposal was on the table, defense leaders from two other countries on the Russian border sounded the alarm that even if Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a deal, the reprieve may only allow Moscow to further consolidate its military and industrial might, and use it again in Ukraine or elsewhere. 'A lot will depend on what the peace talks' deliver, but 500,000 Russian troops will be battle-hardened and unlikely to want to return to civilian life earning $100 a month, Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's minister of defense told Breaking Defense. Likewise the Lithuanian minister of defense, Dovilė Šakalienė, recently warned that Russia's aggressive investment in its military-industrial complex was not just meant for Ukraine, but for 'expansion plans that Putin is voicing himself. Both Pevkur, who spoke to Breaking Defense at the Munich Security Conference last month, and Šakalienė, who spoke to several reporters at the Lithuanian embassy earlier this month, cited Putin's ambition to grow the military to 1.5 million troops, even as it loses thousands on the frontlines with Ukraine. That will include the standing up of new brigades and divisions close to Estonian and Finnish waters, Pevkur said. Russia's 'force posture will be around 50,000 to 60,000 troops,' said Pevkur. 'So we all understand that this is a totally different situation compared to today. Of course the risk assessment will go up, and we need to answer this with a very clear message &#8230; higher defense spending, more troops on the ground.' That investment will be necessary to match Russia's own, Šakalienė said and added, Russia's 'military capability is growing.' 'Even whilst waging full-scale war in Ukraine, they are able to replenish their losses on the battlefield,' she said. 'Their military industry capacity is growing, and the speed of production — both ammo and weapons — is growing. Chinese support is sufficient and consistent, and it's very helpful in their military capability building.' She said Russia is estimated to be spending some 40 percent of the federal budget, or around 9 percent of the country's entire GPD on its military forces, though she acknowledged financial figures coming out of Moscow may be unreliable. But if they're approximate, she said, that's more of an investment than Russia would need to maintain its war with Ukraine. Pevkur and Šakalienė's comments echo those made last year by the chiefs of defense of several Baltic and Nordic nations in interviews with Breaking Defense, some of whom predicted NATO had a three-to-five year 'window' to build up their militaries to deter Russia or, if necessary, defend against an attack. RELATED: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing &#8216;window' to prepare for Russia Alina Polyakova, president and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, agreed that in any post-war era, Europe will be 'dealing with, [a] battle-tested Russian army, a battle-tested navy and air force, and one that is also equipped, perhaps not with the most sophisticated, exquisite weapons, but with mass capabilities in the automated space in particular, and Europe doesn't have any of this.' 'Europe hasn't invested in drone capabilities, swarm capabilities in the air, in the sea and the ground,' she said. In Pevkur's view, Europe's readiness to prepare for a future Russian attack will be shaped by NATO's new capability targets, set to be announced in the summer, and the urgency with which member nations can rise to them. Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Christopher Cavoli 'knows what is needed to defend the countries and to protect the people,' he said. 'For politicians, it is an obligation to explain to its population, to people, why we need to spend more on defense. Again, when this war will be over in Ukraine, Russia will have hundreds of thousands of troops ready to fight today — not tomorrow, today.' Polyakova said that there is an 'easy fix' for Europe to gain a competitive edge over Russia, regarding drone or aircraft mass capabilities: greater industrial investment. If 'we're talking about Europe's ability to defend itself and deter what happens in the post-war [era], Russia is going to be far more capable and it takes a long time to build tanks,' she explained. Instead, Europe can manufacture drones 'really quickly' and not a lot of training is required, added Polyakova. 'This is what Europe should be investing in now, their capabilities in the automated, future force readiness space. Ukraine is in an incredible position to provide all those capabilities. &#8230; They have the know-how and ability to build, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of drones that they could potentially, when there's peace and stability, export to every single NATO country.' Last year Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said the nation had produced over 1.5 million first-person-view drones in 2024 alone, according to the Kiev Independent.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-ceasefire-talks-baltic-defense-leaders-worry-what-will-putin-do-with-his-battle-hardened-army/	2025-03-13T04:27:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231114_dubai_russia_transport_MARTIN-e1699953553596.jpg
Saildrone, Palantir partner to use AI to streamline USV manufacturing, operations	Saildrone will deploy 20 of its Voyager USVs in support of 4th Fleet's Operation Southern Spear. (Photo courtesy of Saildrone.) WASHINGTON — National security tech giant Palantir and unmanned maritime tech firm Saildrone today announced a strategic partnership focused on utilizing artificial intelligence to bolster Saildrone's 'manufacturing, supply chain, and fleet operations.' 'Leveraging Palantir’s sophisticated manufacturing and AI tools will allow us to streamline manufacturing and radically enhance fleet capabilities,' said Richard Jenkins, Saildrone’s CEO. 'While others make promises about tomorrow's technology, we face complex global threats today. This partnership with Palantir ensures we deliver solutions today that outpace tomorrow’s threats.' Saildrone, a California-based company, has made a splash in recent years with the US Navy through its eponymously named, bright orange USVs which specialize in unclassified intelligence collection and data processing. Between the Navy and various civilian federal agencies, the company’s drones have been used for tracking narcotics trafficking, illegal fishing operations and compiling oceanographic data, among other things. The company in February announced it had begun a new iteration of operations in coordination with US 4th Fleet, dubbed 'Southern Spear.' That operation will focus on using unmanned and autonomous vehicles to 'support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking while learning lessons for other theaters,' according to a Navy officer overseeing the activities. The announcement also follows Palantir in December unveiling its 'Warp Speed' initiative, a 'manufacturing operating system' aimed at using AI to 'gain an advantage in dynamic production scheduling, engineering change management, automated visual inspection for quality, and more,' according to a company statement. Anduril Industries, L3Harris, Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA), and Shield AI were all included in Palantir's initial cohort for the initiative. 'We built Warp Speed to accelerate the organizations at the forefront of American reindustrialization — from the factory floor to the open ocean,' said Emily Nguyen, Palantir’s head of industrials. 'Saildrone is delivering the future of maritime AI, and we are extremely proud to provide software that supports the sustained competitive advantage of their USVs.' Palantir today is slated to host the sixth iteration of its artificial intelligence conference, dubbed AIPC. Investor’s Business Daily reported Palantir’s stock had climbed on Wednesday amid a 'sudden gloom' for other AI stocks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/saildrone-palantir-partner-to-use-ai-to-streamline-usv-manufacturing-operations/	2025-03-13T02:30:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250109-St-Thomas-200W-Radar-Voyagers-6741-scaled-e1738750883331.jpg
Shield AI names former Splunk CEO as new chief executive	The Shield AI logo is seen during defense industry exhibition in Kielce, Poland on September 3, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Shield AI has named former Splunk CEO Gary Steele as its new chief executive, with the autonomy firm’s co-founder Ryan Tseng stepping down and transitioning to the role of president. Steele, currently Cisco’s president for go-to-market, will take the reins at Shield AI on join its board of directors on May 13, the company announced today. With Tseng at the helm, Shield AI has grown from a small San Diego-based start up to one of the Pentagon’s so-called 'defense tech unicorns,' the name given to nontraditional defense firms that have received Silicon Valley backing and a stream of Defense Department contracts. Tseng founded Shield AI in 2015 with his brother Brandon, a former Navy SEAL who is currently the company’s president. 'Among my most important responsibilities has always been ensuring Shield AI is led by the absolute best person for the role,' Ryan Tseng said in a news release. 'Over the past year, with the demand for autonomy solutions at scale and the growth of our aircraft business, it became unmistakably clear that Shield AI required a leader with not only deep software expertise but proven experience scaling technology organizations. Gary Steele is the best leader for the next chapter of our growth.' Shield AI’s product list includes Hivemind, an artificial intelligence system that can pilot drones, and the V-Bat drone, which it produces in Dallas after acquiring original manufacturer Martin UAV in 2021. The company also contributed software that allowed the modified F-16 known as the X-62A VISTA to fly under AI control as part of DARPA’s Air Combat Evolution program. Last week, Shield AI announced the completion of a $240 million F-1 strategic funding round, which raised the company’s valuation to $5.3 billion. While a relative newcomer to the defense industry, Steele spent more than 30 years as a leader in the technology sector, leading Splunk before its acquisition by Cisco for $28 billion in 2024. He was previously CEO of cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, taking the company to its initial public offering. 'There is growing demand for advanced autonomy from defense industry leaders, and we also see an opportunity to expand beyond traditional defense applications to benefit larger commercial enterprises,' Steele said. 'I am proud to join this team and help bring this tremendous opportunity to bear, in partnership with Ryan and Brandon.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/shield-ai-names-former-splunk-ceo-as-new-chief-executive/	2025-03-12T13:10:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/shield-ai-scaled-e1741809329928.jpg
DAF seeks industry feedback to strengthen Platform One DevSecOps, cloud management	Members of the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam operate cyber systems using a Enhanced communications flyaway kit during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3 and Architect Demonstration Evaluation 5 at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July, 12, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Amy Picard) WASHINGTON — The Department of the Air Force is turning to industry to shore up Platform One, the software development program created by the Air Force and used DoD-wide to create, integrate and launch software. According to the solicitation posted today, the DAF is looking for vendors, technologies and system integrators to provide 'dual-use commercial products and/ or services' for cloud management and infrastructure for the platform’s development, security and operations (DevSecOps). DevSecOps is a framework that incorporates security practices into all phases of the software development cycle. 'Ideal solutions should be effective for workloads operating across multiple AWS [Amazon Web Services] GovCloud accounts; however, preference will be given to solutions which are agnostic of cloud service providers,' the request for information states. The RFI also states that industry solutions 'at a minimum' should be capable of managing, sustaining and deploying distributions of Kubernetes — the open-source container arrangement platform that automates the deployment and management of containerized software, otherwise known as packages of software that contain all the files needed to run an application independently of other software components in any environment, according to Amazon Web Services. Further, solutions should be compatible with Platform One’s Big Bang, the DoD’s 'trusted' open source DevSecOps platform which can cut the time it takes the department to approve software from years to 90 days utilizing authority to operate, or ATO, procedures, according to Platform One’s website. 'Product vendors should anticipate the need to include integration services within this effort either internally or in partnership with a systems integrator. System integrators without a vendor partnership will be considered if leveraging commercial and/or open-source tools in accordance with all applicable licenses,' the RFI reads. This effort to bolster Platform One comes after the Pentagon has affirmed its commitment to accelerating software development, as seen in a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week. As Breaking Defense previously reported, the memo directed the Pentagon to adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), a streamlined method for procuring software programs bespoke to DoD requirements, as the preferred method for software development. Interested parties are to respond to the solicitation by March 31, per the RFI.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/daf-seeks-industry-feedback-to-strengthen-platform-one-devsecops-cloud-management/	2025-03-12T12:51:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230719_DVIDS_GIDE_computer_6733217-e1689799401542.jpg
DIU to start field testing quantum sensors in tough conditions	Air Force Research Laboratory scientists work on various technical platforms to accelerate quantum research and development of connected ultra-secure quantum communication to provide the best benefits to the Department of the Air Force and the warfighter. (US Air Force photo / Keith Lewis) WASHINGTON — While quantum computing hogs the hype — and the venture capital — military officers and officials increasingly see the biggest near-term possibilities in quantum sensors. Measuring the same kind of microscopic motion as atomic clocks, quantum magnetometers, gravitometers and more could help frontline forces navigate when GPS is jammed or hunt targets without conventional radar and sonar. But first, they have to work reliably outside the lab. To make that happen, the Pentagon’s outreach arm to Silicon Valley, the California-based Defense Innovation Unit, has just announced a slew of contracts to field test a dozen different quantum sensing systems. (This is similar to but separate from an ongoing DARPA effort to harden quantum sensors). The 18 vendors announced so far — another one or two might yet emerge from ongoing contract talks — include defense titans Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, established military-and-commercial players Honeywell and Leidos, upstart Anduril and a long list of smaller companies, many of them providing a single critical component to a larger team. 'It’s a good mixture of traditional primes, non-traditional defense, as well as emerging and startups and small business,' said Air Force Lt. Col. Nick Estep, DIU’s portfolio manager for emerging capabilities, in an exclusive interview with Breaking Defense. Using its preferred Commercial Solutions Opening process, DIU issued its initial solicitation just 10 months ago in May, sorted through more than 70 proposals, and got the most promising firms on contract, with many already at work. 'I would say roughly a dozen meaningful field tests are going to occur by the end of the fiscal year. &#8230; Some of these will be on small autonomous systems; some will be on manned aircraft; some will be ground tests.' DIU calls its project Transition of Quantum Sensors (TQS) because it’s working closely with DoD Quantum Tech Director John Burke, the Air Force, Navy and potential military users with the intention to identify mature technology, ruggedize it, test it, fix the inevitable glitches and hand it over to procurement programs for real-world operational deployment. 'I'm a scientist by trade,' said Estep, an electrical engineering PhD who’s worked in both academia and the National Reconnaissance Office. 'Our inclination is to optimize for as long as possible and build the best sensor you can possibly build in your lab. &#8230; It may have had some amazing performance for like five seconds in the lab when everyone stopped and held their breath, [but for the military] you can't deploy with five grad students and expect ideal thermal, moisture, and environmental conditions.' Traditional Pentagon procurement tends to perfect technology in ideal conditions, only to discover practical problems when it first goes to the field. Far better, the DIU team believes, to put an 80 percent solution in the field ASAP and find those flaws, and fix them, early on. For any given quantum sensor, Estep explained, 'we need to ruggedize it, integrate it with the controlling subsystems into a meaningful package, and answer: &#8216;How would we deploy it? How are we going to show functionality?' Because there's a lot of gremlins that pop out in that process. To do that, you have to learn a lot.' Trial and error is inevitable with new technology, he said, so he’s not expecting the first test articles to perform like the final product. 'These early field tests, we're not expecting them to hit the end operational objectives right away,' Estep said. 'Some of these I would expect to take several iterative cycles' over months or years. He emphasized, 'we expect to have some pretty notable outcomes even in 2025.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/diu-to-start-field-testing-quantum-sensors-in-tough-conditions/	2025-03-12T12:00:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/DVIDS-quantum-photo-scaled.jpg
Additional defense funds in reconciliation bill ‘may not be enough’: SASC chairman	Vice Chief of Naval Operations Jim Kilby and other services vice chiefs provide testimony at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee-Subcommittee for Readiness of the Joint Force at the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C., May 16, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist William Spears) WASHINGTON — With the Pentagon increasingly likely to be locked into a yearlong continuing resolution for the first time ever, the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee said today that Congress may need to beef up the amount of funding it is pursuing for defense through a parallel process known as budget reconciliation. The House on Tuesday passed a stopgap spending bill expiring on Sept. 30 that would provide $892.5 billion for defense in fiscal 2025 — slightly higher than FY24 levels but below the $895 billion permitted by the Fiscal Responsibility Act. And while that gap may not seem huge by Pentagon standards, SASC Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss. is seizing on it to make the case that even more money needs to be added during the reconciliation process. 'The real flaw in in the CR that we'll be voting on later this week is that it doesn't provide enough money, regardless of the anomalies and the tiny plus ups here and there,' Wicker said during a SASC readiness subcommittee hearing today. 'Based on what is in this continuing resolution, $150 billion in the reconciliation bill may not be enough, and I'm hearing some comforting words from the administration, that they realize that too.' The House and Senate have each passed separate budget resolutions, kickstarting a path for Republicans to enact a laundry list of Trump administration funding priorities through a process called reconciliation, which allows the majority party with control of Congress to pass legislation without the threat of filibuster. The Senate budget resolution includes an additional $150 billion for defense, while the House version includes $100 billion. Wicker noted that the Trump administration has been aggressive in its goal of driving down government spending, adding that 'we all want fiscal responsibility.' However, he said, an additional boost to reconciliation funding for defense may been needed to address threats from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Wicker, a defense hawk, has advocated for the United States to raise defense spending to 5 percent of its gross domestic production. Last year, as the committee’s top Republican, he pushed SASC to adopt an NDAA that would have supported a $923 billion defense topline (in conference, the House and Senate committees agreed on a lower funding level that would conform to FRA restrictions). In February, he told Breaking Defense that he hoped to secure a total $200 billion increase for defense in the budget reconciliation process, with funds to be used in FY25 and FY26. A continuing resolution is typically a stopgap that extends funding at prior-year levels for a short period of time. To try to mitigate negative impacts to the US military, the yearlong CR under consideration includes some additional funds — including $8 billion for US Central Command and US European Command, as well as plus-ups to certain shipbuilding programs. It also includes language meant to give the Pentagon additional flexibility, such as a provision that would allow the department to start certain new programs — a practice typically forbidden under a CR. While the House was able to pass the CR Tuesday evening in a mostly-party line vote, Senate Republicans will need support from a handful of Democrats in order to meet the 60 vote threshold that allows the Senate to proceed to a final vote on a bill. On the precipice of a March 14 deadline to pass a spending measure and avert a government shutdown, SASC members from both sides of the aisle groaned about the prospect of voting for a full-year CR. 'From a readiness standpoint, none of us think this is helpful,' said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who leads the readiness subcommittee. 'What would be worse, in my view, is a government shutdown.' Later in the hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he agreed with Sullivan's statement but thinks a short-term CR would have been preferable than a full year measure. 'Why do we have to accept, you know, half-assed over catastrophic?' he asked. A panel of the military services’ No. 2 officers told lawmakers that they were still working to understand the impact of the CR. Army Vice Chief of Staff James Mingus said the 'degree and severity is unknown,' with much dependent on the specific language of the bill and whether it contains 'anomalies,' or exceptions to CR-related funding restrictions. Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said the services’ readiness accounts 'are most vulnerable under a CR or sequestration,' and that 11 ships are at risk for missing maintenance availabilities under a full year CR. For the Air Force, a yearlong CR without anomalies would have $4 billion impact to readiness, said Lt. Gen. Adrian Spain, the services’ deputy chief of staff for operations. Mingus and Kilby said the services would benefit from greater budget flexibility, specifically for items such as drones or counterdrone systems, that would allow them to obligate funding more quickly or transfer that money to other systems if threats changed. Gen. Christopher Mahoney, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, cautioned that, while anomalies and budget flexibility are helpful, there is only so much the Marine Corps could do with a smaller budget. 'If there is only so much top line from which to flex … we're going to rob from one account to pay for another,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/additional-defense-funds-in-reconciliation-bill-may-not-be-enough-sasc-chairman/	2025-03-12T11:49:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/8910837-scaled-e1741804006931.jpg
Awaiting Space Force certification, ULA says future missions could aim to baffle Chinese watcher sats	ULA launches its Vulcan rocket on Oct. 4, 2024. (Screengrab via ULA livestream) WASHINGTON — United Launch Alliance (ULA) CEO Tory Bruno is positioning the Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle for future national security missions, including sneaking satellites past Chinese watching eyes, even as the company continues to wait for a Space Force decision on whether the rocket can be certified to carry today's payloads. Bruno told reporters today that Vulcan already is optimized for 'exotic orbits for the government' and could provide services like 'directly injecting [a spacecraft] into geosynchronous orbit.' At the same time, he added, ULA has 'a set of investments that are around extending the life of the upper stage, which would allow us to fly different kinds of trajectories&#8230; 'There are other things we can do for them [the US government] that are useful in national security, I might even say confounding for Chinese threats in space, that are enabled by a longer lived upper stage.' Such a fuel-heavy upper stage could be used in rapid, long-range maneuvering to outfox hostile satellites, Bruno explained. 'If I have longer duration, I can go to a different place. If I have longer duration, I can do unusual trajectories that would obfuscate where my destination is, which becomes a challenge for an adversary who wants to surveil or interfere with that spacecraft,' he said. 'Then they have to either find it and or position a hostile asset next to it. When they have a plan to do that, it's a big deal for an adversary because spacecraft can't carry very much propellant and still have useful payload.' But before any of that can happen, the Space Force needs to give Vulcan Centaur the thumbs up to carry currently manifested payloads under the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. To do that, a launch provider needs to demonstrate two successful flights of its launch vehicle before receiving certification by the service to fly critical NSSL missions. While Vulcan first flight last January passed the certification tests, its second certification flight in October did not. That flight suffered 'an anomaly in one of the two solid rocket motors where we lost the nozzle,' he explained, although the Vulcan nonetheless managed to achieve 'a perfect orbital insertion,' Bruno said. 'So, that was all good, but I do prefer that all the parts of my rocket leaders stay attached where they're supposed to be,' Bruno added. ULA's investigation discovered that the problem was due to a manufacturing error, he said. 'We have isolated the root cause appropriate corrective actions, and those were qualified and confirmed in a full-scale static firing in Utah last month. So, we are back in continuing to fabricate hardware and at least initially, screening for what that root cause was, which was a manufacturing defect of one of the internal parts of the nozzle insulator,' Bruno elaborated. A spokesperson for Northrop Grumman, which supplies the solid rocket motors for the Vulcan Center, declined to comment. Bruno said that ULA submitted the findings of the investigation to the Space Force about a month ago for review, noting that 'typically, it's not a very long process.' A spokesperson for Space Systems Command’s Assured Access to Space office told Breaking Defense today that a decision is still pending. 'We have been working with ULA very closely over the last several years to complete NSSL certification of their Vulcan system. The teams have made tremendous progress, and we are close to a decision,' the spokesperson said. In November, ULA and the Space Force said that the two NSSL program launches manifested on Vulcan for launch last year, USSF-106 and USSF-87, were expected to lift off early this year after having been postponed due to the investigation of the second flight. A senior Space Force official said in January that the Space Force was 'targeting mid-February' for being able to give the all clear to Vulcan, and noted that the service is planning 18 total launches under the current NSSL Phase 2 program: 11 on Vulcan and seven for SpaceX’s Falcon 9. While a recent report to Congress from the Air Force, first reported by Bloomberg, criticized ULA's overall performance as 'unsatisfactory' and suggested that the Space Force may shift some of its planned Vulcan launches to SpaceX, Bruno punched back that the report was out of date and not accurate even at the time of its writing in January. 'I saw it before it was leaked, and I don't normally talk about improperly leaked reports, but I'm going to make an exception this time. When that was written it was inaccurate. As we sit here today, it is certainly overtaken by events,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/awaiting-space-force-certification-ula-says-future-missions-could-aim-to-baffle-chinese-watcher-sats/	2025-03-12T10:51:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241004_ULA_vulcan_launch_GRAB-e1728045585388.png
Exploit America’s commercial strengths to mobilize weapons production	A row of Guided Bomb Unit 32s lie on a munitions assembly conveyer at Langley Air Force Base, Va., March 5, 2013. The productions section of the Munitions Flight is responsible for providing munitions to the flight line. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Kayla Newman/Released) During his recent confirmation hearings, Steve Feinberg, the nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense, observed that more companies must be integrated into the defense industrial base to produce the scale of weapon systems the United States needs to deter conflict. He’s right, and a good place to start would be missiles and munitions. As officials have repeatedly pointed out, even though the Pentagon spent close to $30 billion on missiles and munitions last year, its inventories of critical munitions are depleted. While some of this shortfall was driven by US support for Ukraine, the problem is a larger one, rooted in the way that we design and produce munitions in the first place. The term 'munition' covers conventional ammunition, such as the bullets and mortars used by ground troops, up to the Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) used to shoot Russian tanks, and the missile interceptors that help to protect Israeli airspace. There are three specific steps that DoD leaders can take to ensure that the American military has access to the munitions needs to deter conflict and if necessary, prevail in war. Prioritize weapons that are scalable and adaptable over perfect, bespoke systems. Pentagon leaders need to ask themselves: Can this missile be produced in the numbers needed and can it be quickly modified when enemies develop countermeasures? Traditional weapons development emphasizes peak performance over flexibility, resulting in overly specialized, difficult-to-produce munitions that depend on often-obsolete custom components and narrow production pipelines. Defense suppliers cannot surge production of these weapons, and while we could afford this artisan approach when the United States was the dominant military power, that is no longer the case. The creativity of America’s adversaries also challenges the traditional DoD reliance on stockpiling, which risks obsolescence as threats evolve. Future conflicts will require adaptable, rapidly deployable weapons rather than rigid, slow-to-produce systems. Adopt new ways of designing and producing munitions. The DoD should design modular weapons that use widely available commercial or government off-the-shelf components and take advantage of advanced commercial manufacturing processes. The US military’s reliance on bespoke parts produced by dedicated defense contractors limits production capacity. Modular designs facilitate the integration of new technologies and reduce the chance of supply chain disruptions and obsolescence. To build modular weapons, the DoD should pursue contract manufacturing, where a weapon could be designed by defense experts but then assembled at multiple commercial facilities. This approach would leverage America’s considerable commercial sector advantages. The US contract manufacturing industry is thriving, generating combined annual revenues of over $85 billion. Contract manufacturers operate on scales that dwarf normal defense needs and produce a wide range of goods across various industries, from consumer electronics to medical devices. These products often overlap with the software and digital systems that comprise a majority of a modern weapon’s cost. Hence, these firms could assemble modular weapons except for classified software and warheads, leaving those final steps to be completed at a DoD depot before delivery. Contract manufacturers can achieve cost advantages by using widely available parts and investing in productivity improvements like automation. They can maximize the use of a factory (and amortize large capital expenditures) by enabling the same workers and machines to build millions of computers one month and pivoting to building another product, like dialysis machines, the next. During WWII, the United States relied on commercial manufacturers to meet wartime production needs. Germany, by contrast, suffered from excessive weapon specialization, which impeded mass production. Make the best use of America’s digital strengths. Small, loosely organized militaries can quickly field precision weapons without a sophisticated industrial base because their munitions draw most of their capability from commercial digital systems. Houthi terrorists use commercially derived drones to assist their home-built missiles evade ships in the Red Sea. Modern weapons are increasingly software-driven and digital capabilities often dictate a weapon’s effectiveness. Cruise missiles are essentially computers with warheads, their effectiveness tied to electronic warfare, flight control, navigation, and target updates. The good news is that the US leads in digital technologies. Future weapons can be 'born digital' by incorporating commercial off-the-shelf components and software. Unlike traditional hardware-centric designs, software-defined weapons allow for real-time updates, improving adaptability and resilience against enemy countermeasures. These digital attributes also allow for much faster and continuous weapons testing — a process that traditionally can take years. By using digital platforms, DoD can streamline the testing and deployment of adaptable, cheaper weapons. A magazine of inflexible high-performance weapons risks leaving the US military underprepared for future conflicts, particularly against China. Using widely available commercial components and building on US manufacturing and digital strengths, the DoD could field a complementary family of weapons that can be rapidly produced, deployed, and updated. By embracing a new paradigm that values scalability, adaptability, and digital innovation, the United States can produce more affordable weapons and ensure that America remains a formidable force in an increasingly complex and uncertain geopolitical security environment. Bryan Clark, Dan Patt, and Nadia Schadlow are all senior fellows at the Hudson Institute.

Italy’s Leonardo forecasts $6.6 billion ‘upside’ from new wave of European defense spending	The M-346, produced by Leonardo, shows off some of its weapons options at the 2023 Paris Air Show. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) BELFAST — As Europe races toward 'strategic autonomy' in defense, Italian manufacturer Leonardo expects to generate new business in the region of €6 billion ($6.6 billion) should its home market and other European Union (EU) countries increase defense spending by a single GDP percentage point. Based on financial analysis carried out by the company, the percentage point shift is estimated to return between €2 to €3 billion from Italy alone, matched by a further €2 to €3 billion from the rest of the EU, according to Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani. He told investors during an industrial plan update today that in the case of Rome, a 1 percent GDP increase would amount to a defense budget jump of around €20 billion, roughly half of which would be reserved for procurement. 'Normally, one third of that procurement is captured by Leonardo,' he explained. An EU single percentage point increase would amount to additional procurement funding worth between €18 billion to €30 billion, drawing a return of up to €3 billion for Leonardo, set against the company’s current 4 percent capture rate for the bloc as a whole, shared Cingolani, adding that the forecasted figures exclude future export orders. He said that geopolitical threats and the urgent requirement that Europe rely less on the US are driving increases in defense spending and toward 'a new normal in which governments will reinforce critical infrastructure using innovative technologies.' 'We have to make our defense effective because we know that after the wars in Europe, that we have to protect ourselves much more than in the past, especially if the relationship with the NATO alliance will change and the Americans will give less effort in protecting Europe,' he said. A rearmament frenzy has gripped Europe in the wake of pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has publicly cast doubt on the NATO alliance and threatened not to come to the defense of any NATO nation who wasn't spending enough on defense. The EU has pledged a new $843 billion ReArm package over four years in a bid to beef up the continent’s ammunition, air and missile defense, artillery systems, drones and missile capabilities, while France and Denmark have recently announced accelerated rearmament plans. RELATED: Amid US-European strain, Lithuanian defense minister cements ties with US industry &#8216;giants' To deal with the changing geopolitical landscape, Cingolani called for 'stronger alliances' and 'industrial synergies,' while stressing that since the launch of Leonardo’s five-year industrial plan last year, a number of high profile partnerships have been launched. Those include an agreement with Turkey’s Baykar to form a drone technologies joint venture and collaboration with Germany’s Rheinmetall to develop a future main battle tank and infantry fighting vehicles based off the Lynx platform. In the long term those new initiatives, together with the launch of Leonardo’s space division last year, are forecast to deliver €5.4 billion in new business, according to Cingolani. Charting growth more broadly, he also said that Leonardo orders are expected to reach €26.2 billion in 2029 — the end of the five year plan — equivalent to an almost 6 percent uptick compared to €20.9 billion in orders recorded for 2024. Leonardo is a key industry player involved in the British, Japanese and Italian-led Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) sixth-generation fighter. Cingolani suggested that despite the deterioration security picture in Europe, it is 'not realistic' to expect entry to service of the aircraft to be brought forward from a projected timeline of 2035 on account of technology challenges. He noted, however, that 300 GCAP aircraft are expected to be sold, in addition to 10 prototypes set for development. The future fighter is slated to replace UK Royal Air Force and Italian Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons as well as Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-2 combat jets. Regarding mergers and acquisitions, Leonardo is progressing with five new leads, added Cingolani, though he did not provide additional detail.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/italys-leonardo-forecasts-6-6-billion-upside-from-new-wave-of-european-defense-spending/	2025-03-11T14:29:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/IMG_4965-scaled-e1713255621953.jpg
Space Systems Command reviewing expensive legacy programs for possible commercial shift	Space Force Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy (Image: Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's primary acquisition command is reviewing a number of its high-dollar legacy programs to consider whether there are now alternative commercial options for achieving the missions — starting with a new satellite constellation for keeping tabs on the heavens, according to a senior Space Systems Command (SSC) official. Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy, military deputy at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration, told the Washington Space Business Roundtable today that he signed off last week on an 'acquisition decision memorandum (ADM)' instructing a team to undertake an analysis of commercial options for obtaining new space situational awareness capabilities to monitor geosynchronous orbit (GEO). Further, he said that more ADMs are in the works, 'hopefully' as soon as next week, on programs ranging from satellite communications to ground systems. 'We basically had our team look for the last couple of weeks at many of our programs, looking for anything that looks like it could use some commercial competition. And so it's a whole host of them,' Purdy said. 'There are several programs that are slow, &#8230; traditional, expensive, and there's a potential that there might be commercial opportunities for each one of those,' he elaborated. 'And so we're going to have [the acquisition community] go out there, hopefully go out with some RFIs, and understand what's possible &#8230; in the requirements trade off space — something that we've not traditionally done very well.' The idea, Purdy stressed, is to find potential alternatives for 'getting us out of one-off, billion-dollar systems into a proliferated architecture.' For example, he later told reporters that SSC will be looking at commercial alternatives to the Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability (DARC), a trio of ground-based radar facilities designed to track satellites and dangerous space junk in far away orbits with more precision. The Space Force on Feb. 20 announced it is wrapping up construction at the first site in Western Australia. The other two sites will be located in the United Kingdom and the United States. 'We're proceeding with DARC, although I'm going to look at: &#8216;Hey, are there commercial solutions at DARC? Any one of them?' We're looking to ask the question. We may or may not find anything,' Purdy said. He cautioned, however, that with DARC and all other big ticket, legacy acquisition programs, a key to allowing commercial solutions will be a willingness on the part of the Space Force to down-scope requirements. 'We're going to have to roll back requirements,' he said. 'I mean, a lot of these most expensive systems, they have key requirements that are driving expense and time.' Purdy explained that while rigorous performance requirements may be 'what the operator wants' for any particular program, it is the job of the acquisition community to provide them with commercial options that may necessitate requirements 'trade offs' to obtain lower costs and more rapid availability for critical capabilities. Purdy explained to reporters that US Space Command 'has been eager for the unclassified capability' for keeping better tabs on adversary birds in the GEO belt. China, in particular, has been operating satellites in GEO that often closely shadow US and allied satellites apparently taking images and monitoring their operations. Further, he said, international governments/vendors also have been 'clamoring to provide' such capabilities to the US Space Surveillance Network, which incorporates ground-based radars and telescopes, as well as satellites with on-board sensors. The Space Force last March issued a request for information (RFI) about a new GEO constellation of highly maneuverable satellites carrying electro-optical cameras. The satellites, in essence, would be a successor to the Space Force's Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) constellation first declassified in 2014, and its follow-on called SILENTBARKER developed in tandem with the National Reconnaissance Office. 'So many companies responded back to SSC on that particular one,' Purdy said. 'So, I've asked the team to go in there and clean those [RFI responses] up and get me a commercial analysis on what kind of capabilities could we provide on what timeline and what cost compared to any existing programs of record.' The next step will be for SSC to 'provide options' to the Space Force, he said. 'We'll see if that's of interest to them — are these requirements trade offs of interest or not?' Meanwhile, Purdy is fretting the potential for workforce reductions among the Space Force acquisition corps as a result of Elon Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts. In response to questions from reporters, he explained that the majority of the Space Force acquisition workforce is civilian, including a host of civilian contractors. 'If we end up losing a lot of civilians, that will be a problem on the acquisition side. We're a heavily acquisition force, so a lot of our system program offices have civilians for continuity purposes, and it will impact us in a pretty great way,' Purdy said. Another issue is that because the Space Force is a small service, it will be hard to simply fill in for lost civilians with military personnel, he said, especially as the service already is struggling to meet operational needs. 'Now sometimes we can be efficient and not do some work, but a lot of this work is required at different levels in the hierarchy,' Purdy added. 'And until we get rid of that requirement, then we're &#8230; basically going to be delayed. And that's the key. Is that if we're getting rid of the people, we need to get rid of the requirements.' He further noted that rather than start with laying off civilians on 'probationary status,' his preference would be to look at voluntary separations and retirements — especially because there are a lot of civilians in the Pentagon workforce who are nearing retirement age. 'So, I wonder, hey, can we go down that route,' Purdy said. 'But, you know, I'll do whatever leadership wants.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ssc-reviewing-expensive-legacy-programs-for-possible-commercial-shift/	2025-03-11T13:11:00-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-3.30.29 PM.png

Army releases Unified Network Plan 2.0, honing in on multi-domain fighting, zero trust	The ultimate goal of the Army's Unified Network is to give soldiers the same network capabilities while deployed as they have at posts, camps, and stations. (Photo courtesy of the US Army.) WASHINGTON — After months of anticipation, the Army has released the second version of its Unified Network Plan, building off of the 2021 iteration that aimed to collapse its 69 enterprise and tactical networks into a single, shared one by 2027. The service’s updated plan, also known as AUN 2.0 and released late last week, reiterates the 1.0 version of paving the way for a unified network but creates a clearer focus on preparing the Army for multi-domain operations. Since the first plan, AUN 2.0 says, 'a confluence of emerging technologies and events has transformed the world into a multidomain, persistently contested information environment that demands a far more data-centric approach to harness the power of the Army Network to fight and win.' It's an approach previewed by Gen. Jeth Ray, of the Army's G6 office, in December. 'It's gonna enable multi-domain operations. That's gonna be the key basis of what it's all about. [It will also] chart this road map of where we're going for the unified networking by 2027, but then it's also gonna talk about the critical enablers that's required for that multi-domain operation by Army 2030,' Rey said then at the Army’s technical exchange meeting in Savannah, Ga. (The 1.0 version had aimed for a multi-domain ready force by 2028, a timeline that has since been pushed back.) 'AUN 2.0 is going to be new guidance on how the warfighter actually approaches and accelerates and operationalizes the unified network across the board and the Army campaign plan,' he said. According to the new published plan, there will also be a sharper focus on creating data centricity through zero trust principles — the principle of 'never trust, always verify' philosophy that operates under the assumption that the network is always compromised. 'We look at it as where we're converging all of our networks from disparate networks into this condition of what we call underpinned by zero trust. We're bringing all those networks together so that when you leave from one installation to another installation, we don't have to do massive amounts of paperwork just to get you onto that network,' Rey explained in December. Within the AUN 2.0 plan there are five lines of effort: These are designed to be carried out within three phases, the plan explains, with all phases being completed by 2030. 'As with command posts, the network and data must be agile, adaptable, and able to rapidly move to the point of need even in a denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited bandwidth (DDIL) environment. Whereas past network strategies homed in on perimeter defense and hardware, the AUNP 2.0 is focused on common principles and standards to centrally deliver and manage the network and data,' the new plan reads.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/army-releases-unified-network-plan-2-0-honing-in-on-multi-domain-fighting-zero-trust/	2025-03-11T08:03:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/The-ultimate-goal-of-the-Armys-Unified-Network-is-to-give-soldiers-the-same-network-capabilities-while-deployed-as-they-have-at-posts-camps-and-stations.-e1697476883722.jpg
GOP stopgap funding bill boosts defense funding over FY24 levels	WASHINGTON, DC &#8211; NOVEMBER 02: (L-R) U.S. House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) leave after a news briefing at the U.S. Capitol on November 2, 2023 in Washington, DC.(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — House Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal 2025 includes $892.5 billion for defense, boosting the defense topline about $6 billion above the FY24 spending limits but slightly below the $895 billion forecasted for this year. Backed by President Donald Trump, Republicans are supporting a CR that runs until Sept. 30 rather than banking on lawmakers’ ability to push through individual appropriations bills for FY25. Congress has until the end of March 14 to pass a spending bill before the government shuts down. The proposed CR, released Saturday and set to be taken up by Congress this week, includes an additional $8 billion for Central Command and European Command, specifying that the funds be used for 'only for U.S. military operations, force protection, and deterrence.' The language stipulates that this funding cannot be expended until 30 days after the defense secretary provides the congressional defense committees with an execution plan. It also makes some changes to bring shipbuilding funds roughly in line with the levels requested by the Navy in FY25, with some notable exceptions. Namely, Arleigh Burke-class destroyer procurement was boosted to $7.9 billion — potentially adding a third destroyer — while Constellation-class frigate procurement was reduced from about $1.1 billion to $233 million. It also cuts funds for the Medium Landing Ship program, while increasing funds for ship to shore connectors. Total procurement spending remained roughly flat at $167 billion from the Defense Department’s FY25 request, while research and development dropped slightly from $143 billion to $141 billion, according to calculations done by JP Morgan analyst Seth Seifman. The bill also 'appears to allow new start programs to proceed, which is not typically the case under a CR,' Seifman said. In a note to investors this morning, Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners noted that the bill 'is not a traditional continuing resolution' that simply funds the government at prior year levels, offering the administration 'far more flexibility' to spend certain funds. 'We expect this act, or something very close to it, will be passed by Congress,' Callan wrote. The House Rules Committee is expected to take up the bill this afternoon to decide the terms under which the measure will be brought to the House floor tomorrow. With a 218-214 split in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson may only be able to lose one Republican vote if all Democrats vote against the bill. Senate Republicans, who hold 53 seats, will need some Democrats to vote in favor for the bill for it to pass procedural hurdles that require a 60-vote threshold. Whether or not Democrats will do so is unclear, with House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries posting on X social media outlet, 'We are voting no' and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer yet to publicly lay out a strategy for the Senate Democrats. Democrats have called out defense related cuts, which included a $185 million cut to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation programs and a $140 million cut to the NATO Security Investment Program, as well as cuts to military construction that will force the service 'to pick and choose projects to fund,' according to a fact sheet released by Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/gop-stopgap-funding-bill-boosts-defense-funding-over-fy24-levels/	2025-03-10T12:15:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_rep_mike_johnson_GettyImages-1770847690-scaled-e1709241354686.jpg

Turkey’s Aselsan tests laser counter-drone system, part of Steel Dome project	Aselsan’s counter drone high energy laser GÖKBERK (Aselsan) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Aselsan has tested successfully a mobile laser weapon system, dubbed GÖKBERK, against first-person-view (FPV) drones, the company said today in a statement. GÖKBERK detected, automatically tracked, and destroyed FPV threats in different scenarios. The firm said that the system will play a 'critical role in Türkiye’s national air defense system, Steel Dome.' Aselsan 'continues to take important steps in the field of directed energy weapons, one of the new generation technologies. Previously proven effective against rotary- and fixed-wing kamikaze drones, GÖKBERK now showcased its advanced capabilities by detecting, autonomously tracking, and eliminating FPV drones across multiple test scenarios, demonstrating exceptional speed and precision in engagement,' according to the statement. The system uses an electronic jammer to enable the 'soft kill' of drones, and an electronic laser for 'hard kills' of FPVs of multiple sizes, including mini UAVs, micro UAVs and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Steel Dome is Turkey’s layered air defense system in development by Turkish firms to protect the air space against all types of threats, at a time demand on missile defense systems have surged in the Middle East due to latest conflicts in the region. 'The Steel Dome is very promising system. All nations want to have this kind of system,' Ahmet Akyol, president and CEO Aselsan, told Breaking Defense last month at the International Defense Expo in Abu Dhabi. He added that Aselsan 'can provide this solution for Turkey and for allied countries right now,' Akyol said. 'So in Turkey, this is in progress. Every year we are delivering new systems of the Steel Dome concept, and it will be beneficial for our region.' The firm distributed a video showing GÖKBERK composing of laser system, camera and thermal camera mounted on a vehicle and eliminating multiple types of drones. 'All major subcomponents of GÖKBERK have been designed and produced domestically, reinforcing Türkiye’s defense industry autonomy,' according to the company’s statement. The firm added that the new system will be deployed to military bases, airports, power plants and oil refineries protection.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/turkeys-aselsan-tests-laser-counter-drone-system-part-of-steel-dome-project/	2025-03-10T11:36:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/ASELSAN_GOKBERK-scaled-e1741627832120.jpg
Lockheed eyes two-year timeline to pick new F-35 cooling system	A US Air Force F-35A Lightning II assigned to the F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team performs a practice aerial demonstration prior to the Warriors Over the Wasatch Air Show at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, on June 28, 2024. (US Air Force photo by First Lieutenant Nathan Poblete) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Selecting a highly-anticipated upgrade for the F-35’s incumbent cooling system may take as long as two years to play out as manufacturer Lockheed Martin weighs options from Collins Aerospace and Honeywell, according to the company’s program manager. 'There's a few folks that have already presented some options to us now. That's going to take us, I think, about the next 24 months or so to really go through those options,' Chauncey McIntosh, Lockheed’s vice president for the F-35 program, told Breaking Defense Monday in an interview on the sidelines of the AFA Warfare Symposium. Lockheed is examining 'all offerings that are out on the market today to make that decision and go through [them]. So it’s not going to be a quick choice, it’s going to be one that’s driven by data' that ensures the company is 'getting the right thing' to support future needs, McIntosh added. 'So that's kind of the time frame that I think we're on, but as we go through, that could either accelerate or decelerate,' based on what the company learns. Collins and Honeywell are so far the only companies to have publicly thrown their hat in the ring for a new cooling system. Lockheed will run the competition, Breaking Defense previously reported, setting up a lucrative opportunity for an eventual winner that would provide parts to retrofit likely a bulk of the roughly 1,000 F-35s currently in service and manufacture the system for future aircraft. Officials say a new cooling system, formally known as the Power and Thermal Management Unit (PTMU), is needed to support forthcoming upgrades that are expected to make the jet run even hotter than it does now. In the near term, an enhancement to the stealth fighter’s Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine is expected to enable a suite of upgrades known as Block 4. Beyond Block 4, a new cooling system will be needed to work in tandem with the engine upgrade, the F-35 Joint Program Office has previously said. Regardless of how a competition for the new cooling system proceeds, time is of the essence. A previous request for information from the JPO said the government expects a new cooling system solution should be ready to field in roughly the 2032 timeframe. According to a May 2024 Government Accountability Office report [PDF], the F-35 program could start delivering post-Block 4 upgrades as soon as 2029. That timeline, the watchdog found, means that 'if the thermal management system upgrades come after 2029, post-Block 4 capabilities will also be delayed.' Remarking on the need to keep various requirements in sync, McIntosh said, 'We're gonna let the data drive us while knowing we're on a timeline to insert that engine along with the PTMU out in the future.' Honeywell supplies the incumbent cooling apparatus, known as the Power and Thermal Management System (PTMS), which is responsible for other critical tasks like providing emergency electrical power — and is offering an upgrade to the existing design. Collins, a subsidiary of RTX, is looking to unseat Honeywell by introducing a new offering dubbed the Enhanced Power and Cooling System (EPACS). Both Honeywell and Collins say their candidates meet an objective set out by the JPO: a capacity for 80 kilowatts of cooling. Honeywell touts its approach, which the company’s Defense and Space President Matt Milas shared with Breaking Defense following the results of digital modeling, as less risky, due to the fact that it retains much of the PTMS’s current 'footprint' with largely mature technologies. Collins, on the other hand, is pitching the EPACS as an alternative solution to meet the F-35’s needs, which the system’s chief engineer Matt Pess recently told Breaking Defense is being developed with the goal of 'leav[ing] as much margin in the system and as much flexibility in the system as possible.' Breaking Defense also toured the company’s facility and viewed the EPACS prototype in action last year. 'We looked at the total box of things that we were asked about' and worked to 'make sure that we were mission critical itself and make sure that our system would actually hold up to that,' Henry Brooks, Collins president of power and controls, said in a Feb. 27 interview alongside Pess. 'I think that our solution will be a novel one, if you will, for the F-35. It'll enable not only the F-35' but also sixth-generation fighter jets like the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance platform as well as future commercial aircraft designs. Additionally, according to Collins, the EPACS has achieved Technology Readiness Level 6, meaning the system is mature enough to enter into the engineering and manufacturing and development phase.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/lockheed-eyes-two-year-timeline-to-pick-new-f-35-cooling-system/	2025-03-10T10:54:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/8509355-1-scaled-e1721820217290.jpg
Emirati consortium to launch first satellite of Sirb constellation by late 2026, early 2027: Exec	A rendering of the view of the Middle East from Space. (NASA via Getty) BEIRUT — An industry team tasked with launching a small satellite constellation for the United Arab Emirates wants to get its first bird into low Earth orbit (LEO) as early as the end of next year or early 2027, according to a key industry executive. The industry consortium is in the 'last stages' of selecting a launch partner from the three finalists out of an original 10 international entities that had been under consideration, Waleid Al Mesmari, president of the space and cyber tech division of the sprawling Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group, told Breaking Defense last month. EDGE's new space-focused subsidiary FADA is the leader of the consortium, which also includes national entities Space 42, the National Space Science and Technology Center and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. The goal of the project, called Sirb in a reference to the Arabic term for flock of birds, is to eventually put three UAE-made synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites into LEO to 'address the critical need for better environmental and land usage monitoring, data collection and analysis to meet today’s global challenges,' according to the UAE Space Agency. 'The planned satellites will be able to create highly detailed and complex radar ‘images’ of land use, ice cover, surface changes and characterization, with a wide range of scientific, civil and commercial applications,' the agency says in an online fact sheet. But Al Mesmari said the information acquired through the constellation will have have 'defense and national security applications' as well. FADA, which means space in Arabic, was only established in September 2024 as the first endeavor into space by EDGE, a conglomerate of nearly 30 subsidiaries with interests in everything from small arms to unmanned systems to armored vehicles. 'When it comes to establishment of FADA, [it is] to have a sovereign capability that can protect and preserve the prosperous future [of UAE] that has been built over the last 50 years,' Al Mesmari told Breaking Defense. He said that FADA aims to have 'a national capacity building program that can translate, and lead the space technological stack, enabling us to have a sovereign capability at the end.' He added that FADA is one of the companies that will contribute to UAE’s space strategy 2030, focused on localizing technology in UAE. During the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) 2025, during which Breaking Defense spoke to Al Mesmari, FADA said it had launched a 'hyper-smart platform' dubbed TACTICA, which is an AI-based software that 'processes multi-source intelligence- including satellite imagery, signals intelligence, sensor data, and open-source information.' Al Mesmari expected that FADA 'will be a global player [in the space sector] and that's our focus.' He concluded that FADA is 'a vertically integrated company, which means that we will focus on building capabilities across the three streams: space platforms [including] space payloads [and] manufacturing capabilities, remote sensing, [which include] capabilities on the ground with the different applications, [and] space situational awareness or space domain awareness.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/emirati-consortium-to-launch-first-satellite-of-sirb-constellation-by-late-2026-early-2027-exec/	2025-03-10T08:32:47-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250228_earth_from_space_generic_GettyImages-2170815486-e1740757787949.jpg
Amid US-European strain, Lithuanian defense minister cements ties with US industry ‘giants’	Lithuanian Minister of Defense, Dovile Sakaliene, speaks to the press on Jan. 22, 2025 in Vilnius. (Photo by Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As Europe rushes to reasses its reliance on American security guarantees and to dramatically boost military spending, Lithuania's defense minister personally worked to cement ties not only with US policymakers but with another key constituency: US defense contractors. Armed with a red folder containing a veritable shopping list of defense systems and billions of dollars to pay for them, Dovilė Šakalienė said she recently met with executives from major firms, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, RTX and AM General. The meetings, she said, were part of a broader effort to speedily boost Lithuania's defense capability in the face of an ever-increasing threat from Russia — and to draw the influential firms closer to Vilnius. Further Russian aggression beyond Ukraine, including potentially in Lithuania, 'worries us,' Šakalienė told reporters in a roundtable at the Lithuanian embassy Friday. 'That's why we are really pushing forward with our military capability plans, with our defense capacity-building, infrastructure and personnel and acquisitions, from weapons to ammo, building factories, defense industries &#8230; 'And actually all the good talks that I had with defense industry giants in the United States is something that, in my opinion, is a very positive element in our preparation,' she said. 'I'm very happy about it, these meetings. &#8230; We require a lot from them.' Šakalienė said Lithuania has done $2 billion-worth of business with American defense firms in the past three years and has 'need' for 'at least $8 billion' more in 'coming years' — a consequence of Vilnius's decision in January to boost defense spending to 5 to 6 percent of its GDP beginning in 2026. 'And we are happy to build factories together. We are happy to [be] part of [the] supply chain. And that's what we discussed,' she said, adding that the companies have been invited to come to Lithuania to explore on-the-ground opportunities there. 'Actually I feel like the United States defense industry feels that partnership with European countries and specifically with Lithuania is something that is mutually beneficial. We are a market and we are a partner in defense, so I hope it works.' Members of the Lithuanian Armed Forces view a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) of Kilo Battery, 2nd Battalion, 14th Marine Regiment, 4th Marine Division, Marine Forces Reserve, firing during exercise Swift Response 24, Kairiai Training Site, Lithuania, May 9, 2024. (U.S Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Kanoa Thomas) The push to forging deeper ties with US industry also builds off Lithuania's Memorandum of Understanding with Northrop Grumman last year, which involves the manufacturer supporting local suppliers in the production of medium-caliber ammunition for Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). Sakaliene noted that Lithuania already has Europe's largest fleet of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, those made by Oshkosh Defense. Later in the discussion when asked by Breaking Defense exactly what Lithuania planned to spend the money on, Šakalienė held up a red manila folder. 'We want to develop a full-fledged capacity and capability to be able to work very well with the joint NATO forces, with our sister divisions, with capabilities that the United States will be providing, according to regional defense plans,' she said. 'So we are developing our land forces, our air defense, our engineering capabilities, and it's from rockets and air defense systems, artillery systems, helicopters, radars, drones &#8230; and additional enablers.' Sitting beside Šakalienė, Ministry of Defense spokesperson Ignas Grinevičius added, 'And we're paying in advance to get it quicker, as soon as possible.' Lithuania's strategic approach to strengthening business with the US comes amid a decisive shift by the European Union to rearm the continent at pace by investing more in the region's defense industry and while member states and other NATO allies rethink equipment planning decisions in light of Washington's pivot to Russia. In Lithuania, a country of 2.9 million that has been occupied by Russian forces twice in modern times, to even question the idea of US security protection is 'extremely sensitive,' Šakalienė said elsewhere in the talk. She said 'everyone' takes US security guarantees, or aid in the 'worst case scenario' as 'vital,' as a 'life-or-death issue.' Speaking days after the disastrous White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, US President Donald Trump and his top officials and the subsequent freezing of US military aid and intelligence sharing to Kyiv, Šakalienė said there are 'different interpretations' of America's current stance towards European security. She acknowledged that it was all 'quite stressful' for her countrymen, but she at least has been heartened by two factors: the developments have shocked Europe into a keen understanding that they must do more for their own security — for which Šakalienė said Lithuania has been long ahead of the curve — and that at least in his term so far as president, Trump has not said he would not honor America's commitments to the Baltic states. Trump did say last week that if NATO members 'don't pay,' the US would not come to their defense. But the Baltic nations are among NATO members who spend the most on defense by GDP and would presumably be safe from such a threat. As for a potential ceasefire deal for the Ukraine conflict, Šakalienė floated the idea that the West should seize $200 billion in frozen Russian assets (elsewhere reported as €200 billion or $216.7 billion) to use as a 'safeguard' for any agreement. Added Larger European nations are divided over the issue. The UK has consistently said the assets should be unlocked by the West but France and Germany have raised objections, with Paris stressing that any such decision risks breaching sovereign asset immunity and curb EU investments from other foreign powers. Holding those assets in the balance 'could be a very viable and sensible thing to do,' said Šakalienė. 'Putin has not yet tried the method of keeping the agreement, of not violating treaties. So maybe that would be a good safeguard to keep his word for the first time.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-us-european-strain-lithuanian-defense-minister-cements-ties-with-us-industry-giants/	2025-03-10T07:02:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250309_lithuanian_defmin_bigger_GettyImages-2194656497-scaled-e1741537479453.jpg
Deputy defense secretary nominee has ‘clear conflict of interest’ with Ligado lawsuit: Sen. Warren	Nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen A. Feinberg listens to the opening remarks of a Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C., Feb. 25, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is raising concerns with deputy defense secretary nominee Stephen Feinberg’s ties to Ligado Networks, arguing that Feinberg’s family or the private equity firm he founded could financially benefit from the ongoing lawsuit between the communications company and the US government. Feinberg’s Cerberus Capital Management owns about 14 percent of the communications company’s debt and 24 percent of its preferred stock, according to court documents cited by Warren in a March 9 letter to Feinberg, exclusively obtained by Breaking Defense. Ligado, now going through bankruptcy proceedings, is engaged in a $39 billion lawsuit against the US government over claims that officials at the Departments of Defense and Commerce took 'unlawful actions' to, in effect, improperly seize without compensation the firm’s L-band spectrum. That situation could create a 'huge conflict of interest' should Feinberg become the department’s No. 2 official, wrote Warren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'As the second-in-command at the Pentagon, you would have the power to influence the DoD’s posture towards the Ligado lawsuit. If the government loses or settles the case, Cerberus could profit as it ‘would most likely receive some portion of the settlement proceeds,’ according to your responses to my questions for the record,' she stated. Feinberg’s family could also potentially make money from the outcome of the Ligado lawsuit, Warren said, as Feinberg has indicated he could divest his interest in Cerberus through a gift to one or more irrevocable trusts established for his adult children. 'This is a clear conflict of interest, as you could deal your former company — and your adult children — a multi-billion-dollar windfall at the expense of American taxpayers,' she wrote. Warren states that Feinberg can address this issue by amending his ethics agreement to recuse himself from matters related to Ligado and its lawsuit with the Defense Department. She also requests that Feinberg answer a series of questions by March 24 about his financial interests in Ligado, including whether he will divest any holdings in the company and how big a settlement is required for Cerberus to break even on its investment in Ligado. RELATED: Not on the same wavelength: Trump inherits spectrum fight between DoD, commercial industry Feinberg’s nomination could be confirmed by the Senate as early as this week, following a Feb. 25 confirmation hearing where SASC Democrats pressed him on the Trump administration’s planned cuts to the Pentagon’s civilian workforce. He was also asked about ongoing debate over whether the Defense Department be forced to vacate or share the lower 3 GigaHertz band and the 7-8 GHz band with commercial communications companies, responding that the Defense Department’s spectrum position must be protected. 'We need spectrum to defend our country. We also need commercial use of it to develop the technologies that will defend our country,' he said. 'The best solution is sharing, but we have to get it right and make sure sharing can be done without risk.' In an earlier Feb. 17 letter, Warren laid out concerns about Feinberg’s financial interests, stating that his holdings in Cerberus — which owns and invests in a number of defense-related companies, such as Stratolaunch and Navistar Defense — could pose a conflict of interest if not properly divested. In ethics documents submitted on Feb. 18, Feinberg said he would 'divest all of my interests in Cerberus including, but not limited to, my equity interest, carried interest, incentive fees/allocations, and capital commitments' prior to assuming the role of the deputy secretary of defense. He also said 'neither my wife nor I have any financial interest' in the trusts of his adult children and that he would not be the trustee for any of those trusts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/deputy-defense-secretary-nominee-has-clear-conflict-of-interest-with-ligado-lawsuit-sen-warren/	2025-03-10T03:00:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/8885252-1-scaled-e1741566340510.jpg
SDA again postpones launch of first ‘operational’ data relay, missile warning satellites	SDA's Tranche 1 launches are now anticipated to begin in summer 2025, starting with satellites for the Transport Layer. (Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Space Development Agency (SDA) today announced it is again postponing launch of its first-generation 'operational' satellites designed to provide data relay and missile warning/tracking, with a first lift-off now planned for 'late summer.' The launch setback — which represents yet another piece of bad news for the embattled agency — was recently decided by SDA's current leadership, 'in conjunction with' that of the Space Force, an SDA official told reporters today. William Blauser, former deputy head of the department’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), currently is the acting head of SDA, following the Jan. 16 suspension of Director Derek Tournear over alleged mismanagement of a contract award. SDA originally had hoped to begin launching the Tranche 1 Transport and Tracking Layer constellations for its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) stationed in low Earth orbit (LEO) in September 2024. That date was subsequently pushed back a few months to either very late 2024 or early 2025. Tranche 1 will include a total of 158 satellites, according to an SDA fact sheet [PDF]: 126 satellites in the data relay Transport Layer, 28 missile warning/tracking satellites in the Tracking Layer, and 4 'missile defense demonstration' satellites. The first launch will involve Transport Layer birds, an SDA official told reporters today, but the agency is not yet sure how many satellites will go up and whether satellites from all of the three current vendors will be included. Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and start-up York Space Systems all won shares of a $1.8 billion contract award in February 2022. The plan, according to the SDA announcement, is to then undertake one launch per month until the all the Transport and Tracking Layer satellites are on-orbit. 'SDA continues to aggressively work toward the first Tranche 1 launch; however, as we progress through a normal assembly, integration, and testing campaign, with the added challenge of late supplier deliveries, it has become clear additional time is required for system readiness to meet the Tranche 1 minimum viable capability,' the agency said. The SDA official acknowledged that one of the problems pushing back the Tranche 1 launch has been the development of optical communications terminals (OCTs) — an issue highlighted in a recent report from the Government Accountability Office. Laser links are foundational to the workings of the PWSA, which is being designed as a 'mesh' network that uses laser links to rapidly transfer data among themselves — and eventually to ground stations. 'OCT terminals is definitely a challenge,' the official said. 'We're working to continue to help scale that and address any hang ups there.' Other problems have included supplies of propulsion units and vendor difficulties in getting 'approvals' for 'encryption devices,' the SDA official noted. (While the SDA official declined to elaborate on the latter issue, the National Security Agency is charged with approving encryption devices used by the Defense Department and other national security agencies.) Despite the launch delays, the SDA announcement stressed that the agency still intends to be able to provide region-by-region coverage for users in the field early in 2027. 'SDA is committed to completing on-orbit test and checkout of the initial satellites by mid-2026 and delivering the entire initial warfighting capability of the PWSA in early calendar year 2027, consistent with warfighter expectations,' the announcement said. 'SDA’s top priority is to quickly deliver capabilities promised to the warfighter. Launch is a major milestone but one in a much larger path to delivering viable capabilities. Our goal remains to rapidly deliver functional capabilities with a high degree of operational confidence,' it added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/sda-again-postpones-launch-of-first-operational-data-relay-missile-warning-satellites/	2025-03-07T13:18:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Northrop-Grummans-participation-in-SDAs-Tranche-1-Transport-Layer-program-went-from-award-to-passing-Critical-Design-Review-in-13-months.-1-e1741380771871.jpg
NGA suspends Ukraine’s access to commercial satellite imagery	Analysts at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (Photo: NGA) WASHINGTON — The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) has cut off Ukraine's access to commercial satellite imagery collected by the US government, in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to 'pause' the flow of US intelligence and military aid to Kyiv. 'In accordance with the Administration’s directive on support to Ukraine, NGA has temporarily suspended access to GEGD, which is the agency’s primary portal for accessing commercial imagery purchased by the U.S. government,' an agency spokesperson told Breaking Defense today. The NGA shares access to 'map-ready, unclassified imagery' for more than 55 foreign partner nations, as well as with the Defense Department and other US federal agencies via the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery (GEGD) system. However, several industry sources said that their companies have not been blocked by NRO from taking pictures over Ukraine. Nor, these sources point out, historically has the NRO ever used its so-called 'shutter control' power to block sales of commercial imagery abroad. In other words, while GEGD information will no longer flow to Ukraine, the Ukrainian government is still able to purchase information direct from commercial providers — at least for the moment. Satellite imagery company Maxar is the prime contractor for GEGD, and a spokesperson for the company confirmed Ukraine's suspension today in an email to Breaking Defense. 'Maxar has contracts with the U.S. government and dozens of allied and partner nations around the world to provide satellite imagery and other geospatial data. Each customer makes their own decisions on how they use and share that data. 'One of those contracts is GEGD (the Global Enhanced GEOINT Delivery program), a U.S. government program that provides access to commercial satellite imagery that has been tasked and collected by the U.S. government. The U.S. government has decided to temporarily suspend Ukrainian accounts in GEGD,' the spokesperson said. G-EGD has been running since 2011, and ingests unclassified geospatial intelligence from a wide variety of sources for more than 400,000 users domestically and abroad — including from US and foreign commercial satellite imagery providers, through contracts with the National Reconnaissance Office's Electro-Optical Commercial Layer program. 'GEGD is hosted by Maxar, but it ingests data from a variety of sources,' the NGA spokesperson said. NGA is the US Intelligence Community's 'functional manager' for geospatial intelligence, responsible for gathering data from a variety of sensors, fusing that data and providing products such as maps to the US military, POTUS, US civil agencies, and allied/partner nations. NRO is responsible for the US government's fleet of spy satellites, and also for buying commercial satellite imagery for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. 'We take our contractual commitments very seriously, and there is no change to other Maxar customer programs,' the Maxar spokesperson stressed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/nga-suspends-ukraines-access-to-commercial-satellite-imagery/	2025-03-07T10:09:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/NGA-analysts-e1741370246953.jpeg
Hegseth signs memo pushing forward Software Acquisition Pathway expansion	President Donald Trump, Pete Hegseth, US secretary of defense, and Howard Lutnick, US commerce secretary, during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Feb. 26, 2025. (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Pentagon officials are launching forward with plans to expand the use of the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) and throw additional work towards the Defense Innovation Unit, now that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has officially issued new guidance. 'Right now, the way the Pentagon buys software is slow, outdated and filled with bureaucracy. Meanwhile, our adversaries are moving fast' one defense official told reporters today on a phone call. 'This memo is the beginning to fix that [by] cutting red tape, working more with private industry, getting cutting edge software into the hands of our warfighters quickly before the enemy can adapt.' Breaking Defense first reported on the draft memo late last month and the version with Hegseth’s signature, dated March 6, is nearly identical. In it, the newly minted secretary calls on the department to adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway, a practice created in 2020 to accelerate software development by implementing best practices from the private sector. At its core, SWP is a streamlined method for procuring software programs bespoke to DoD requirements. Through the SWP, organizations can deploy capabilities into platforms within six months or less. DoD has previously stated that the goal is to speed this process up into hours or days. Hegseth also directs the use of Commercial Solutions Openings (CSOs) and Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs) as the 'default solicitation' and award avenue for acquiring capabilities. The undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, alongside the DIU director, he adds, now has 30 days to develop and submit an implementation plan on how to best utilize those practices. 'One of the biggest changes is using flexible contracting tools, CSOs and OTAs, to speed up innovation and acquisition and the reason this works better — instead of spending years writing detailed requirements and going through a rigid &#8230; one-size-fits-all process — we can tap into the best tech available right now, prototype it fast and get it to the field quickly, if it works,' the defense official added. 'So bottom line, [we are] cutting out middlemen. Software companies make software, we're going to buy software from software companies.' A second defense official noted that the middleman in that situation isn’t the big defense primes but the 'bureaucratic red tape' that gets in the way of capability development to be accessible to a program of record. That second defense official also noted that there are currently 82 programs in the SWP that range from command and control and decision support to cyber and embedded weapon systems. As the Pentagon crafts the implementation plan, that figure is expected to soar, but the official noted that any change will likely be applied to new programs or ones where there is a 'natural transition point.' 'The implementation plan is going to navigate and clarify these use cases of how to move into the software acquisition pathway,' the second official added. As for how it will impact the service officials tasked with buying weapons, a third defense official said the vision is for them to lean more heavily on DIU going forward. For example, the Army could ask DIU to partner up and let DIU move out on a CSO or OTA. 'We expect an uptick in sort of a demand for DIU projects,' the third official explained. 'The more important way in which this will impact DIU is that we think the real path to scale is to train and educate other acquisition professionals so that they can also use … the model, rather than just relying on DIU to do it for them,' the third official added. One Army leader that viewed a draft version of the memo said his service is always looking for better ways to acquire software. However, he said it is not yet clear how the change will trickle down. 'What I don't want to do is over the constraining on anything,' the Army official told Breaking Defense last month.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/hegseth-signs-memo-pushing-forward-software-acquisition-pathway-expansion/	2025-03-07T10:00:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/hegseth-trump-scaled-e1740762854609.jpg

New Australian submarine industrial base strategy calls for $30 billion AUD investment	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023. A US Navy Virginia-class submarine arrived at HMAS Stirling for a scheduled port visit as part of routine patrols in the Indo-Pacific region. (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Australian government this week released a new strategy document calling for $30 billion AUD ($19 billion USD) in investment to prepare its domestic industrial base to support future nuclear-powered submarines built through the trilateral security pact AUKUS. 'Developing the ability to build, sustain and operate conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines is also one of the most significant industrial undertakings in Australia’s history,' according to the document. 'We plan to achieve an ambitious uplift of Australia’s military and industrial capability, which has never been done under the timeframes of the optimal pathway announced in March 2023.' The strategy seeks to address four 'major hurdles' that the government says it has identified through consultations with industry: uncertainty of demand for goods and services; issues with attracting industrial base investment; regulatory complexity; and workforce shortages. The Australian government will aim to create 20,000 jobs over 30 years through what the document characterizes as a 'whole-of-nation undertaking.' 'The scale, complexity and technology requirements of the program also mean the Australian Submarine Industrial Base will need to work with trusted United Kingdom and United States partners to deliver products and services across the life of the [nuclear-powered submarine] program,' according to the document. As part of the government’s new strategy, it is also launching a pilot program that will have American submarine builder HII work with Australian companies to qualify those companies and their products for incorporation into the Virginia-class submarine program's supply chain. 'HII Australia has been awarded a contract to deliver the pilot program over the next two years, with an initial value of $9.6 million and the option to extend based on achievement,' Australia’s Department of Defence said in a March 6 statement. The pilot will be executed in partnership with H&amp;B Defence, a joint venture between HII and the UK aerospace and defense firm Babcock. 'This contract represents a significant milestone in building a resilient and globally integrated supply chain for nuclear-powered submarines,' said HII President and CEO Chris Kastner said in a statement this week. 'HII has a long history of working with suppliers to ensure they meet the highest standards in safety, security, and performance. We welcome Australian partners to help build out this critical nuclear shipbuilding capability and ensure the long-term success of AUKUS.' In addition to building what has been dubbed 'SSN-AUKUS,' Australia is also expected to purchase, maintain and operate either three or five Virginia-class submarines as part of AUKUS.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/new-australian-submarine-industrial-base-strategy-calls-for-30-billion-aud-investment/	2025-03-07T08:58:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/virginia-australia-scaled-e1723223982442.jpg
Army taps Textron’s Ripsaw M3 for Robotic Combat Vehicle program, sources say	An image of Textron's Ripsaw M3 tech demonstrator. (Textron) WASHINGTON — Textron Systems’s Ripsaw 3 has won the US Army’s latest Robotic Combat Vehicle competition, according to a trio of sources familiar with the program. The service isn’t expected to formally announce that decision until later this month, but vendors have been notified. However, sources inside industry and the Army told Breaking Defense that Textron is the victor. When asked about the decision, an Army spokesperson declined to comment on whether a selection had been made said it is still an 'ongoing competition until awards are finalized.' Textron did not immediately respond to questions about the contract decision, but the company has previously touted its offering. 'The Ripsaw M3 leverages a modular open systems architecture (MOSA) design and common chassis to support a variety of interchangeable payloads from a basic flat-top deck configuration,' the company wrote in a press release last year. 'A rugged and reliable RCV platform, the vehicle is designed to meet Army requirements while preserving transportability and mission versatility.' Under an earlier RCV iteration with three vehicle sizes — light, medium and heavy — Textron’s Ripsaw M5 secured the medium prototyping contract. However, the service changed course and relaunched a new competition for just one RCV size. It then selected Textron, along with McQ, General Dynamics Land Systems and Oshkosh Defense, to proceed and awarded them with a combined total of $24.7 million for the first phase of the project. Each team was then tasked with delivering two RCV prototypes by August 2024 for mobility testing and soldier touchpoints. Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems, told Breaking Defense last year that the service would then use those findings to help select a single company to proceed with Phase II this year, which would mean the winner would be finalizing designs and delivering up to nine prototypes by fiscal 2026. Service leaders would then be set up to decide how to proceed with the program in FY27, according to budget justification documents and previous Army statements. If it’s greenlit to proceed, soldiers could be using the unmanned vehicles the following year. It’s not clear if this timeline still holds today given budgeting plans and a new administration. New Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's call to reallocate billions in defense spending does have a carveout for 'autonomous systems,' but doesn't specifically mention ground vehicles. Also, the vehicle itself is only half the challenge when it comes to the RCV program. Leaders are grappling with just how much autonomy early vehicles will have, the number of soldiers required to remotely control them and what payloads they will carry first. The service is poised to continue working through some of those question marks over the coming years including at Fort Irwin, Calif., this month when RCVs and other autonomous weapons take centerstage at the Project Convergence Capstone 5 event. Alex Miller, the Army Chief’s Chief Technology Officer, also told reporters last month that these new autonomous prototypes will play a significant role in the service’s plans for 'transformation in contact' 2.0 this year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/army-taps-textrons-ripsaw-m3-for-robotic-combat-vehicle-program-sources-say/	2025-03-07T07:30:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/Land-M3-Ripsaw-R-Tech-Demonstrator-scaled-e1695315350508.jpg
Army to soldiers: Get small drones back in the air, don’t worry about the red tape (as much)	A soldier flies a Red Cat quadcopter in this artist's rendering. (Red Cat) WASHINGTON — The US Army is preparing a new memo to clarify the rules for flying — and losing — smaller drones in hopes of convincing soldiers and commanders that they need not fear paperwork so much that they leave the surveillance and weapons systems on shelves, officials told Breaking Defense. In October Breaking Defense reported that in the middle of a drone-dominated revolution in ground combat, some US servicemembers were hesitant to power up smaller unmanned aerial system (UAS), fearful of the seemingly inevitable 'non-expendable property' investigation that would come if a break in communications, dead battery, gust of wind or sturdy tree limb took the UAS out of commission down range. 'If you lose [a drone] or crash it or break it, you have to do this full-on investigation, an investigating officer has to be appointed,' Col. Nick Ryan, director of the Army Capability Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, said in the original report. 'They do a full investigation [and] a report, to determine if the soldier is liable, and if the soldier … has to get docked pay.' One drone, Ryan said then, was known as 'the flying FLIPL and they never wanted to fly it.' FLIPL stands for Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss. To avoid such a fate, soldiers may put themselves at risk in combat zones to recover the platforms, Ryan said. Moreover, the formal investigation can cost more than the drone itself. Greg Besaw, a senior logistics staff officer, told Breaking Defense recently that the service can spend between $8,000 and $9,000 for a sergeant first class to devote their time to each investigation — presumably even for drones that cost a fraction of that. 'Is it worth the cost of the loss to spend this much administrative time, people’s salaries, simply to document a six-step financial liability investigation?' he asked. Today unmanned aerial systems are deemed 'nonexpendable property' and the Department of Defense at large requires property books accounting for everything over $5,000 (that is included in DoDI 5000.64). That's even though the Army says that only UAS in its arsenal without 'sensitive items' that falls under that threshold and has asked the Office of the Secretary of Defense to reexamine that price point. And now Army officials are also clarifying that those property loss investigations, while ubiquitous, aren’t actually always mandatory, and that commanders have more leeway than they might think for simply writing the loss off and saving everyone the hassle. The officials told Breaking Defense they are inking a new All Army Activities (ALARACT) memo, expected within the month, that will make clear there are already other options for 'unretrievable UAS and equipment.' 'That will lay out essentially the requirements for each of these [UAS] and give some examples' for when to just write off the loss in an abandonment memo and when to pursue a formal investigation, according to Sydney Smith, the director of supply policy and programs inside Army headquarters. Smith told Breaking Defense that in cases where it’s clear that negligence or misconduct was not the cause of the UAS loss, the memo will detail each drone’s dollar figure and any sensitive items it contains to help commanders make better decisions on how to proceed. It will also reaffirm details about the rank needed to make such a decision. For example, when a done below $10,000 with non-sensitive items crashes into the woods, then a GS-14 (lieutenant colonel) can sign the abandonment memo instead of launching a FLIPL investigation. If that UAS is below $250,000, then a GS-15 (colonel) can make the call. But anything above $250,000 or with a 'controlled item code,' means a general officer will be called in. 'We’ve had tools for a long, long time that have allowed commanders to not have to go through the onerous process, but when you look at our main regulation on the AR 735- 5 [Army property accountability manual], it puts the liability chapters first,' Smith said. 'It makes people think, ‘Oh, I must do the FLIPL for these things’ … when, in reality, they could do the abandonment order because they’re not able to retrieve [the UAS] because it was lost in a field environment.' Another reason the investigations have become so common in the first place, Smith added, is a cautious culture that has not kept up with the times. 'When we first got the Shadows [UASs], and so forth, in Iraq and Afghanistan, there were occasional cases where something would fly over into other territories and they were exploited,' she said. 'I think that’s where so much of the reticence to just saying, ‘I want to write off a UAS’ came from. And that’s sort of built up over the years. … Our culture [is] almost a presumption of guilt, &#8216;now prove that it's not.’' Beyond the memo, Besaw and Smith are now helping usher in a new edition of that accountability policy manual to be released later this fall. In it, the initial chapters will layout all of the non-liability actions that can be taken, before later sections progress towards that FLIPL investigation. With the memo and the revised manual, both officials said soldiers should feel better about putting drones in the air, as modern combat is increasingly demanding. '[The] problem set of UAS is very different now than it was then' in Iraq and Afghanistan, Smith said. 'The technology is not unusual anymore. 'When you think about the way Ukraine is using UAS &#8230; if we were in that scenario, even if they were expensive, we would be writing a memorandum to say, &#8216;You know, I launched 100 UAS, and 15 came back, and I watched them on a combat mission, and they didn't return.' That would be my relief statement,' she added. 'We have got to get the muscle memory going on that, so that people understand it will be acceptable in the future to do that.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/army-to-soldiers-get-small-drones-back-in-the-air-dont-worry-about-the-red-tape-as-much/	2025-03-07T05:20:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_red_cat_drone_HANDOUT-e1732136676896.jpg
EU space monitoring program moves toward ‘strategic autonomy’	Artist's rendering showing two of the potential dangers of low-Earth orbit. (Getty graphic) AUSTIN, Texas — The European Union is expanding its space situational awareness (SSA) program and pushing toward greater use of commercial capabilities, the latest move in a longterm push for 'strategic autonomy' that could free the continent from much of its dependency on American space tracking capabilities. 'We decided to foster and really accelerate innovation and foster competitiveness of the European industry and startups in the SSA domain, to consolidate a commercial ecosystem,' said Pascal Faucher, Chairman of the European Union Space Surveillance and Tracking Partnership (EU SST). The 15 EU member states whose facilities make up the EU SST network of radars and telescopes 'believe that this commercial ecosystem will contribute, will complement, military sensors from the member states to reinforce our strategic autonomy,' he told the 11th Annual Space Traffic Management Conference sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin on Tuesday. 'And then we have a priority related to synergies — how to best exploit synergies between civil and defense — because we need to be realistic and pragmatic. Our budget are limited,' Faucher added. He explained that while the EU SST currently is funded by the European Commission and the European Union Agency for the Space Program under the EU's collective 'civil program.' 'It means nothing here in the US, but in Europe, it means secure funding,' Faucher said. However, many of the sensors contributed by the EU SST participants are military assets, and the European Defence Fund also is being tapped to help foster commercial SSA innovation within the 27-nation European Union. (Graphic: EU SST) 'We need to, of course, be smart and join forces, avoid unnecessary duplications and maximize our investment in those capabilities for civil and defense,' Faucher said. The EU SST now is being used by 67 different spacecraft operators, he said, most from within Europe but also by some from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Djibouti, Egypt, Israel, Japan, Norway, the Republic of Korea, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. All totaled, the network is keeping a protective eye on 543 civil, military and commercial satellites, Faucher said. Faucher further noted that three more countries are expected to soon begin contributing sensors and funding to the project, although he did not name them. The current EU SST member states are: Austria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain and Sweden. As the program is now entering its eighth year of operations, it is in some ways behind US capabilities — but more advanced in others. The US Space Force at the moment operates the largest network of space sensors, called the Space Surveillance Network. That network is used to provide operators in the US and around the world with warnings about potential on-orbit crashes between satellites and between satellites and dangerous space debris. Meanwhile, the Department of Commerce, via the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), is working to develop a similar civil network and collision avoidance service in order to relieve the ever-growing burden of providing non-military operators with satellite tracking information and warnings. That effort, called the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS), is in its infancy, however. Further, unlike the EU SST program, TraCCS at the moment is envisioned as a voluntary program, with the Commerce Department eschewing any plans to require companies to participate or impose any regulatory measures to require operators provide data on their satellites' whereabouts, or take any sort of precautions to enable them to better ensure their satellites don't endanger others. In contrast, Faucher said the EU SST program requires that users not only 'share their satellites' attributes,' but also plans for any maneuvers. 'We have a case of legacy in SSA data sharing between nations on a daily basis, or upon request through European database. So this is pretty unique,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/eu-space-monitoring-program-moves-toward-strategic-autonomy/	2025-03-06T13:05:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250306_satellites_debris_GettyImages-1359390880-e1741290678844.jpg
Budget impasse risks ‘Doomsday’ plane delay, SNC says	A U.S. Air Force E-4B assigned to the 595th Command &amp; Control Group, Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., flies on a training sortie over the Midwest, May, 15, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Codie Trimble) AFA WARFARE 2025 — A failure by lawmakers to pass a budget for fiscal year 2025 risks delaying the Air Force’s effort to field a new fleet of jumbo jets that can survive nuclear war, according to a company executive involved with the project. Jon Piatt, SNC’s executive vice president for ISR, aviation and security, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the AFA Warfare Symposium on Tuesday that the Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) program is 'fenced off' from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s budget drill, falling into the exempt category of nuclear command, control and communications. However, he said the aircraft conversion effort will be set back if Congress cannot agree on FY25 appropriations and instead opt for a stopgap funding patch known as a continuing resolution (CR) that would freeze funding at FY24 levels for the remainder of the fiscal year. 'I'm ramping up my work. I'm adding new facilities, I'm adding infrastructure, I'm adding cost. That cost has to be carried by someone,' Piatt said. The company is underway with large-scale expansions of efforts to militarize Boeing 747 jumbo jets that serve as a flying command center capable of surviving a nuclear blast, earning the 'Doomsday' moniker for the fleet. The jets SNC is converting will replace older 747 aircraft, dubbed E-4B or 'Nightwatch,' that also regularly transport top military officials like the defense secretary. 'It’s kind of hard to predict' exactly how much the program could be delayed 'until we actually know if we’re going to realize the CR impact,' Piatt said. 'What I will say is it indeed has a ripple effect.' Congress ultimately provided roughly $700 million for the SAOC program in the FY24 budget, but the Air Force is seeking roughly a billion dollars more in FY25 as work gets underway following SNC’s contract win in April 2024. But whether those additional funds will be delivered in FY25 appears increasingly unlikely, as President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson now both back a plan for a full-year CR. The Air Force's request is seeking 'about $1.7 billion in programmed funding for 2025. That’s a lot of people, it’s a lot of subcontractors,' Piatt said, pointing to other complications like a possible disruption in negotiations to procure more 747s, which could raise costs in turn. 'I’m gonna have to put a halt to my hiring, which might impact some of the work we perform.' According to Piatt, SNC is currently constructing a 'baseline digital design' for the firm’s conversion work, which he characterized as the 'foundation' for planned modifications. The efforts will also result in an 'integrated digital environment' that will provide the data models the Air Force needs to carry out sustainment efforts, he said. SNC has a lot to learn about the 747, as Piatt said the company will be 'going through the digital design and discovery phase for at least four-to-five years.' Still, he said, the company is building in the required schedule margin to carry out the work to keep things on track — so long as necessary funding comes through. 'Even though they look similar, every aircraft can be slightly unique to the other. So we're doing all of our scans internally and externally on all aircraft as a baseline configuration, making sure that we're building that comparative database,' Piatt said. 'When we get into the configuration management, there could be minor variations. We're going to discover some differences, and we're building that expectation into our primary schedule. We're not expecting anything that's going to be a major impact on the schedule,' he added. SNC’s work on the SAOC program is somewhat similar to Boeing’s efforts to deliver new Air Force One planes, whose years of setbacks have drawn the ire of President Donald Trump — and the reported threat of cancellation under the Biden administration. Piatt acknowledged that though the SAOC and Air Force One programs have two different sets of requirements, they have 'a lot of commonality.' Nevertheless, SNC has 'not been asked to do anything specific' on the Air Force One program, Piatt said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/budget-impasse-risks-doomsday-plane-delay-snc-says/	2025-03-06T12:12:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/E-4B-scaled-e1741285516879.jpg
It’s time to ditch Virginia subs for AUKUS and go to Plan B	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023. A US Navy Virginia-class submarine arrived at HMAS Stirling for a scheduled port visit as part of routine patrols in the Indo-Pacific region. (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) Earlier this month, the Australian government made its first payment of $500 million toward eventually obtaining US nuclear-powered submarines under the 2021 AUKUS agreement. Because the submarine deal is unlikely to overcome budgetary, organizational, and personnel hurdles, that payment should be Australia’s last. Rather than sacrificing much of its defense program to buy nuclear submarines, Canberra should instead adopt an AUKUS Plan B that would field new defense technologies such as uncrewed systems and hypersonic weapons that would enhance Australia’s security faster, and for far less. Most experts believe funding AUKUS’s nuclear submarine plans will be challenging. Australia’s defense budget this year is almost $35 billion USD, and is planned to rise to almost $63 billion annually by the end of this decade when Australia would begin buying US nuclear submarines. At more than $3 billion per boat, each Virginia sub will eat up five to ten percent of the Australia defense budget that year, assuming Australia can double its defense spending in five years. Already, a former top officer has warned that the submarine pact will 'cannibalize' other priorities and require deferring future surface warships or eliminating some ground units. Another potential stumbling block is what’s needed to manage a nuclear propulsion program. More than 8,000 people work for the US Naval Nuclear Propulsion program. Today only about 680 people work at the Australian Submarine Agency. If Australia wants a sovereign submarine force that isn’t dependent on Washington’s oversight, it will need thousands of additional skilled civilian workers. Military personnel is also a challenge. The Royal Australian Navy (RAN) includes about 16,000 sailors today. Each Virginia-class submarine has a crew of about 130 people, and about 400 sailors per ship to account for training, shore duty, and maintenance. With retention already difficult for the Australian Defence Force, the RAN may be hard-pressed to find and keep the thousand-plus highly-qualified personnel it needs to crew the nuclear sub fleet. Does that mean that the AUKUS deal is dead in the water? Not at all, if leaders take a new approach. As four years of private Nonproliferation Policy Education Center-Hudson Institute AUKUS workshops revealed, the allies can assemble a Plan B. This plan would consist of parts of the agreement’s Pillar One, which is centered on nuclear submarines, and AUKUS Pillar Two, which is focused on emerging defense technologies. The next phase of AUKUS Pillar One would have the United States or the United Kingdom sell Australia nuclear submarines in the early 2030s to bolster Australia’s deterrence. Plan B would cancel this phase in light of Australia’s budget, organizational, and personnel shortfalls. Instead, US and UK subs operating from Australia with RAN sailors and maintained by Australian workers would serve as a sufficient deterrent. The first element of a Plan B is already underway, with US and UK nuclear submarines regularly visiting HMAS Stirling near Perth, including conducting maintenance with a visiting US Navy tender. These visits will become near-continuous as the allies establish the Submarine Rotational Force-West and a permanent maintenance facility during the next two years. Rather than spend more than $13 billion on US Virginia-class submarines, under Plan B, Australia would maintain its current fleet of aging Collins-class subs while investing in, and eventually fielding, other advanced defense technologies through Pillar Two. These innovative projects, which include uncrewed systems, AI, quantum computer science, and hypersonic weapons, could deliver technologies that provide most of what the Virginia-class subs would offer for Australia. For example, Chinese fighters can barely reach Australia and Beijing’s bombers cannot risk unescorted missions. Without an air threat, Australian surface warships, uncrewed vessels, and long-endurance drones like the MQ-9 Reaper could patrol the waters around Australia for Chinese subs and ships (which operated last week off Australia’s eastern waters) at a fraction of the price of Virginia-class boats. Autonomous undersea vehicles like the Ghost Shark or Speartooth could perform some of the offensive missions nuclear submarines would otherwise provide by deploying mines or torpedoes — or weaponizing the vehicle itself. The threat of an unwarned attack on Chinese artificial islands or naval forces in the South China Sea could deter Beijing from armed aggression, especially if China is also confronting US and Japanese forces to the north. Investing in these projects rather than the Virginia-class nuclear submarines would also benefit US and Australian industry. Numerous startup companies in both countries have emerged to exploit the potential of new technologies. These firms could sell to each AUKUS ally as well as to Japan’s government, which plans to double its defense spending but lacks a domestic startup ecosystem. Potentially, the Pillar Two country list could expand to include South Korea, New Zealand and Canada, creating wider markets and greater demand, which in turn would drive the per unit cost down. Of course, uncrewed systems cannot do all the missions of a crewed nuclear submarine, and in the long-term Australia might still benefit from pursuing its own nuclear sub program, SSN-AUKUS. But in the near to mid-term, Canberra should pursue a Plan B that would affordably deliver needed offensive capability, alliance interoperability, and industrial capacity to keep the AUKUS meaningful and vital. Hopefully, this will be on the table during the next discussions between Australia’s government and the new Trump administration.

White House’s OMB skeptical of Navy plan to boost shipyard wages, SASC chairman says	USS Massachusetts (SSN-798), the 25th Virginia-class fast attack submarine. under construction at Newport News Shipyard in Virginia in 2022. (photo courtesy Huntington Ingalls Industries) WASHINGTON — The White House’s Office of Management and Budget has yet to be convinced of the viability of a Navy plan that would boost shipyard wages and accelerate submarine production, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman said. During a fireside chat at the Reagan Institute’s National Security Innovation Base Summit on Wednesday, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he is engaged with the White House on the Shipyard Accountability and Workforce Support (SAWS) proposal, which he sees as a viable path to getting the shipbuilding industry the money it needs to raise salaries and make it more competitive for talent. However, President Donald Trump’s OMB has not yet been sold on the idea, he said, adding that he believes OMB's concerns are rooted in how the proposal stacks up in the office's 'scoring' process, which weighs a proposal's cost against its benefits. 'To take on OMB, they really are the most powerful office in the government, and I learned that long ago,' Wicker said. 'They're very frustrating.' In response, an OMB spokesperson told Breaking Defense of SAWS, 'We agree with the big pay raise, and the money has already been sent. What we are not going to do is pay two or three times for the same thing. We are not going to turn the Gerald Ford carrier into a cost-plus contract.' SAWS, proposed by the Navy last year, would rework certain contract mechanisms for how the Navy pays for submarine and aircraft carrier shipbuilders by essentially allowing prime contractors HII's Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat to shift long-term funding earlier in order to invest in raising wages in the short term. The ebb and flow of labor is always a challenge for the Navy’s prime shipyards, but the commitments the United States has made to the United Kingdom and Australia through the trilateral security pact AUKUS have intensified those pressures for Newport News and Electric Boat in particular. However, the proposal previously came under fire from lawmakers in the fiscal 2025 defense policy bill, approved in December, which criticized the Navy for brokering the plan with industry and without input from either Congress or OMB. Wicker, who took the SASC gavel in January, is supportive of the plan. He said the shipbuilding industry will not be able to meet the Navy’s demand for Virginia-class submarines unless it is willing to pay competitive wages to workers doing a 'very difficult, physical job.' 'In Pascagoula, Mississippi, you can leave the shipyard and work at the Buc-ees 10 miles away and make as much money,' Wicker said. 'It’s a lot easier to work at Buc-ees than welding or being an experienced 15- or 20-year expert in building ship after ship.' Prior to Trump taking office, some shipbuilding companies were cautiously optimistic about how the new administration would receive SAWS, given the first Trump administration’s focus on shipbuilding. '[SAWS] is an innovative approach that increase wages, accelerates submarine production [and] reduces the cost through the [future years],' HII CEO Chris Kastner told reporters in early January. 'It really checks all the boxes relative to how you’d want to get boats under contract. So I think there is some — there could potentially be some more receptivity, because it’s a very innovative approach, and it solves a lot of challenges that we have right now.' During an address to Congress Tuesday night, Trump announced the establishment of a new shipbuilding office inside the White House, which the president said would 'offer special tax incentives' to industry with the intent of bolstering the shipbuilding industrial base. 'This is a president who is finally putting his mouth and his and his advocacy of spending behind a 355 ship Navy,' Wicker said of the new office, adding that he had not been informed of its creation ahead of Trump’s speech. Although Wicker expressed optimism overall for Trump's willingness to back a defense spending hike through the reconciliation process, Congress stares down a March 14 deadline when government spending is set to expire, potentially complicating funding for the Pentagon. Some top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, are backing a full year continuing resolution (CR) that would keep funding at FY24 levels for the entirety of this fiscal year. Trump signed off on the a year-long stopgap during a meeting with Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune last week, and the GOP intends to release the bill text this weekend, Politico reported Monday. Wicker said he was 'very pessimistic' about the prospect of a full year CR, stating it would lock the Trump administration into funding levels decided during the Biden administration and negatively impact new defense programs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/white-houses-omb-skeptical-of-navy-plan-to-boost-shipyard-wages-sasc-chairman-says/	2025-03-06T09:10:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Massachusetts-SSN-798-scaled-1-e1732049923370.png

(Photo by Andre Luis Alves/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Ukraine has taken publicly available AI models, retrained them on its own extensive real-world data from frontline combat, and deployed them on a variety of drones — increasing their odds of hitting Russian targets 'three- or four-fold,' according to a new thinktank report. 'By removing the need for constant manual control and stable communications &#8230; drones enabled with autonomous navigation raise the target engagement success rate from 10 to 20 percent to around 70 to 80 percent,' writes Ukrainian-American scholar Kateryna Bondar, a former advisor to Kyiv, in a new report released today by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'These systems can often achieve objectives using just one or two drones per target rather than eight or nine.' To be clear, Ukraine has not built the Terminator. 'We’re very far from killer robots,' Bondar told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview. But in contrast to the more cautious bureaucracy of the West, she said, 'the Ukrainians are more open to testing and trying anything and everything that can kill more Russians.' The AI in question, Bondar explains, relies on the human to select a target; only then can the AI make the final approach on its own, autonomously flying the last 100 to 1,000 meters. While very limited, this autonomous final approach is still a huge improvement over most drones on both sides of the war, which require a human hand on the controls to guide them all the way to impact. If that human hand is too tired, shaking with fear, or just poorly trained, or if the control signal is disrupted by increasingly omnipresent frontline radio jamming, the remote-controlled drone will crash uselessly into the countryside. For now, Bondar found the vast majority of Ukrainian drones still require human control all the way to the target. Of nearly 2 million put on contract by Kyiv in 2024 — 96 percent of which, incidentally, were built in Ukraine — the report says only 10,000 that definitely used AI guidance, less than half of one percent. (The actual total may be much higher, she cautioned). While 10,000 may seem a lot by the standards of anemic Western peacetime procurement, by some estimates it’s merely the number of drones Ukraine expends in the average month. However, that relative handful of autonomous-final-approach drones has proved so effective in combat that Kyiv now plans to ramp up production drastically. While there’s no publicized target, Bondar estimates that the Ukrainian military wants at least half the drones it buys in 2025 to have AI guidance — an increase from 0.5 percent to 50. If realized, that ambition means deploying about a million AI-assisted drones, each three or four times as likely to hit its target as current remote-controlled models — easily a twelve-fold increase in killing power. In a war of grinding attrition, where drones have replaced artillery, the traditional 'king of battle,' as the main cause of casualties, those numbers could be decisive. Just 13 months ago, this kind of autonomous-final-approach AI was still unworkable on the small, cheap drones that have dominated fighting in Ukraine. Russia had rolled out and then apparently abandoned such a feature on its widely used Lancet, while Ukrainian counterparts were promised products rather than practical weapons. But starting this fall, reports of AI-guided drones began popping up again, this time on the Ukrainian side. How did a country under constant bombardment, with a GDP comparable to Iraq, an arms industry inherited from the Soviet Union, and erratic support from Western allies, manage such a feat? To start with, most of the algorithms guiding Ukraine’s autonomous-final-approach drones are derived from free, internationally available open-source models, Bondar found. That allowed Ukrainians to skip some of the most expensive and time-consuming parts of AI development. From that open-source baseline, Bondar explained, the Ukrainians intensively retrained the models on Kyiv’s own classified, real-world battle data — using datasets tailored not just to current combat conditions but, often, to a specific sector of the front and specific types of drone. 'The frontline is very long &#8230; and the situation is very different on different parts of the front,' Bondar explained. For instance, she said, the infamous Bakhmut sector is now stable and static, with both sides dug in to avoid artillery and drones. In other areas, however, the Russians continue to advance, sending 'wave after wave' of expendable 'Storm Z' troops in small squads across dangerously open terrain. The kind of drone the algorithm is meant for also matters, Bondar noted. High-altitude reconnaissance drones see the battlefield and targets from a different angle and greater distances than the low-flying First Person View (FPV) drones that do most of the actual strikes, for example, so imagery collected by one may not be suitable for training the other. Even the specific type of camera matters. All these factors go to show that in Ukraine, as in machine learning development generally, the right training data is critical to making machine-learning actually learn something useful. In Ukraine, getting the data right required a combination of bottom-up innovation by private sector techies and top-down organization by government officials. The initial outpouring of international aid and domestic innovation after February 2022 had left Ukraine with a bewildering variety of equipment, including information technology. 'They call it a ‘zoo’ of technologies,' Bondar said. 'One warfighter can have 10 different software systems on his tablet or phone.' Some intelligence data comes through official channels from military-operated recon drones, but much of the information is still cobbled together by volunteers combing social media apps like Telegram for reports, photos, and videos of Russian vehicles. 'Now the government is trying to increase interoperability among these systems and integrate them,' Bondar explained. 'They started to address this issue by creating, basically, one universal military dataset.' While much of the data is still uploaded and even labeled by volunteers, they now have to conform to government standards for tags and categories. That better-organized data is then housed on a volunteer-developed but government-run military intelligence system known as Delta. To protect the data, Bondar went on, 'they have created a secure training environment.' Private companies can access the information and create custom datasets tailored to their specific training needs, but the data itself remains on government computers, and it’s on those computers that the algorithms are actually trained. Only the final product, the guidance algorithms themselves, are exported and installed on drones, and even then only in encrypted form so the Russians can’t easily copy captured tech. All of this only works because the Ukrainians limited their appetites for AI, Bondar emphasized, developing lots of small, specialized systems instead of a few mega-projects — a lesson the US defense sector is starting to learn. 'They also started with this idea of creating a huge mega-platform which would cover everything and do everything,' she said. 'They slowly realized &#8230; the current level of AI development allows you to train models on very small datasets.' 'These small models are easier to train, easier to update,' Bondar said. 'They’re way cheaper.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/trained-on-classified-battlefield-data-ai-multiplies-effectiveness-of-ukraines-drones-report/	2025-03-06T08:00:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250305_ukraine_fpv_drone_pilots_GettyImages-2195601382-e1741213707203.jpg
Italy’s Leonardo and Turkey’s Baykar ink agreement for UAV joint venture	Italy's Leonardo and Turkey's Baykar have signed a MoU ahead of developing a UAV joint venture (Leonardo) BELFAST — Italian manufacturer Leonardo and Turkish prime Baykar signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) today in advance of establishing an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) technologies joint venture (JV) together, bidding to take advantage of increasing European market demand. The JV will leverage manufacturing capabilities of both companies across design, development, maintenance and production of drones, with Leonardo’s contribution predominately focused on payloads and mission systems, complemented by Baykar’s wide ranging aircraft portfolio which includes TB2, Akinci, and Kizilelma types, according to a Leonardo statement. The JV is looking to tap into growing demand from the European drone market, valued in excess of $100 billion over the next decade, and will include production out of Italy and Turkey, Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani told media in Rome. He suggested that despite those involved in the Italian, Japanese and UK-led Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) sixth-generation fighter effort still to decide on an adjunct or loyal wingman aircraft, putting forward a wingman 'could be an opportunity' long term for the JV. Baykar’s Kizilelma unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) sits as an obvious candidate for consideration. Cingolani added, 'The three members of GCAP are committed to develop the [multinational] platform, and we are all looking around to see what is the best choice for the software, for the AI, for the adjunct, so we are exploring. We'll see what happens in the market.' Baykar announced flight tests of a third production representative Kizilelma aircraft in September 2024, and it has since completed an aerodynamic system identification test. The self-funded aircraft program was first launched by the manufacturer in 2021, and according to company literature, will become a 'force to be reckoned with, specifically given its aggressive maneuvering capability and stealthiness against radar.' Cingolani said that Akinci will be the first aircraft to be developed by the JV, and 'prototyping' will take shape 'one year from now,' strengthening existing collaboration with Baykar that has already seen Leonardo integrate company payloads on the aircraft. The long endurance UCAV was developed as a successor to the TB2 tactical UAV, which saw success in the early stages of the Ukraine war. In service with the Turkish armed forces, Baykar has signed 11 Akinci export agreements, according to the company. 'I hope the Italian defense system will buy drones coming from the joint venture' but to only rely on that prospect alone would be 'very short sighted,' said Cingolani. He added that the projected $100-billion European drone market, 'clearly goes beyond the national interest.' For Baykar, the JV represents an additional push into the European market and comes on the heels of its acquisition of Italy's Piaggio Aerospace.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/italys-leonardo-and-turkeys-baykar-ink-agreement-for-uav-joint-venture/	2025-03-06T07:36:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/DAN5561-scaled-e1741275412804.jpg
Space-based capabilities are critical to enabling a missile shield for America	Image: Courtesy of L3Harris Technologies. A long-feared threat became a grim reality in April of last year when Iran attacked Israel directly for the first time in history. According to the Israeli Defense Forces, Iran launched hundreds of drones, cruise missiles and ballistic missiles into the heart of the Jewish State. Yet, in a miraculous achievement of modern technology, nearly all of the incoming barrage was detected and intercepted by Israeli and allied forces. Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump took note of the extraordinary performance of the air and missile defense systems that defended Israel on that day. On the campaign trail, he began articulating a vision for a similar system to protect the American homeland. And now that he’s taken office, President Trump has taken a bold step to achieve his vision and deliver on his campaign promise, signing an executive order directing the building of the Golden Dome Missile Defense Shield for America. Our company supports President Trump in setting this important goal for our nation. As the Trusted Disruptor in the defense industry, and with a portfolio of proven capabilities in countering air and missile threats, we’re ready to assist his administration in achieving this goal. We understand what it will take to build a layered missile defense architecture to detect, track and defeat incoming threats. We also recognize the regulatory and bureaucratic roadblocks that must be overcome in order to deliver this crucial new capability for our nation at the speed of relevance. To keep our homeland safe, we need a fundamentally new approach to missile defense – one that leverages commercial business models in defense acquisition; a layered system of space-based sensors; and a robust and resilient defense industrial base with increased capacity. America’s government, defense, science and technology leaders must embrace this new approach to deliver on this national priority. Leveraging Commercial Business Models Ken Bedingfield, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for L3Harris Technologies and President of Aerojet Rocketdyne. First, we must dramatically accelerate the process to acquire and field new defense technologies. Our adversaries are moving at breakneck speed to develop hypersonic missiles and other advanced weapons designed to overcome our current defenses. Our traditional defense development cycle, often spanning many years, no longer serves us. In a November 2024 op-ed, our CEO made the case for fully embracing commerciality in our defense acquisition system by streamlining regulations and eliminating arbitrary distinctions between commercial and non-commercial products as well as traditional and non-traditional contractors. By making commerciality the rule rather than the exception in DOD contracting, our nation will be better able to innovate and rapidly acquire the emerging technologies that are essential for building an American Golden Dome. Industry is already showing what's possible by adopting commercial technologies and agile development practices. At L3Harris, we provide a significant portion of our products to the U.S. military on a commercial basis, and we urge the DOD to broaden its definition of commercial products to continue enhancing the industry’s ability to deliver technology faster and at lower costs. A Layered System of Space-based Sensors Second, we need to reimagine space's role in missile defense. Space-based capabilities are now central to detecting and tracking threats. The Space Force's Low Earth Orbit Constellation exemplifies this, creating a layered defense system that can track hypersonic threats globally and provide integrated deterrence against China and Russia. The DOD should invest in low-risk and proven next-generation technology currently on-orbit, as industry has hot production lines primed to deliver. At the same time, industry must lead the way in advancing engineering technologies that deliver both kinetic and non-kinetic effects from space, adding to our existing ability to intercept missiles with air- and ground-based assets. Hypersonic threats can travel thousands of miles in minutes. A software-based approach across existing and future missile warning and tracking systems creates a more responsive missile defense network. By integrating our own and third-party AI capabilities with our advanced, space-based sensor systems, we're helping military operators make faster, more informed decisions across the entire kill chain. Scaling Manufacturing Capacity Ed Zoiss, President of Space &amp; Airborne Systems for L3Harris Technologies. Third, we must scale American manufacturing capacity. This means not just expanding existing facilities, but also building robust supplier networks and investing in advanced manufacturing capabilities. The goal is to match commercial production speeds while maintaining our capacity to meet the reliability demands of national defense programs. We must be ready to surge production when needed, to include satellites for space-based missile warning and tracking; propulsion for interceptor missiles; and targets for testing new sensors and interceptor capabilities. These changes require significant investment and commitment from all stakeholders in the defense industrial base. At L3Harris, we've already begun this transformation, exemplified by our significant investments and scaling of our Aerojet Rocketdyne business, including new solid rocket motor production facilities we’re building in Arkansas and Virginia in partnership with the DOD. In an age where threats to the homeland are evolving at an unprecedented pace, the United States faces a critical inflection point in our national security. President Trump's recent executive order to accelerate the development of a Golden Dome for America isn't just another defense initiative – it's a proportionate response to a catastrophic threat. No single entity can do this alone. This urgent national challenge demands collaboration across the defense industrial base, national laboratories and government agencies. Whether it’s advanced sensors, satellites, space launch, interceptor missiles or AI-based software to fuse threat data from different platforms and systems, every part of the national defense ecosystem – from new entrants to traditional primes – has unique capabilities that are essential to our collective success. This is about more than modernizing our legacy defense infrastructure. It’s about protecting American citizens and our way of life. Ken Bedingfield is Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for L3Harris Technologies and President of Aerojet Rocketdyne. Ed Zoiss is President of Space &amp; Airborne Systems at L3Harris Technologies. Both have decades of combined experience in the national defense technology ecosystem.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/space-based-capabilities-are-critical-to-enabling-a-missile-shield-for-america/	2025-03-06T05:24:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/600x300Golden_Dome_Graphic.png
Secret Space Force payloads monitor China’s satellite surveillance network, official says	Communications satellite orbiting above Earth (Getty Images/ Adastra) AFA WARFARE 2025 — For several years, the Space Force has had a secretive, orbital tool that can gather information on China’s own network of sensors that monitor American satellites, according to a key service official. Calling the project a 'quasi-operational success,' Kelly Hammett, director of the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (SRCO), said in a briefing with reporters today at the AFA Warfare Symposium that 'situational awareness indications and warning payloads' have been 'collecting all kinds of very interesting data on the Chinese SOSI [Space Observation Surveillance and Identification System] network' — Beijing’s rough equivalent to Washington’s Space Surveillance Network. The space-based monitoring technology was launched as payloads aboard Northrop Grumman’s LDPE-3A spacecraft in 2023, Hammett disclosed. The project was the first from the SRCO to enter orbit, and the Space Force said at the time [PDF] that the payloads would provide 'enhanced situational awareness.' 'These are sensors that can tell whether you're being observed, tracked, targeted, those types of things,' Hammett said. 'And that's a capability that we're trying to drive into the larger Space Force. We've done the prototypes, and it's working.' Although the Space Force has several ways to monitor Beijing’s orbital activities — from the current Space Surveillance Network to the forthcoming SILENTBARKER constellation — many American satellites themselves aren’t able to tell when they’re similarly being watched, Hammett explained. The secretive payloads launched aboard the LDPE-3A aim to fix that problem. However, as a small organization with roughly 50 civilian and 20 military employees, some in at-risk categories like probationary workers, Hammett warned his office could be disproportionately affected by labor cuts that are underway by the Trump administration. 'I’m losing people,' he said, referring to employees who took the administration’s deferred resignation offer and others who left on their own volition. 'And I cannot hire people back because we’re under a hiring freeze, and we’re having to figure out a hiring plan. We can try to hire contractors and FFRDCs [Federally Funded Research and Development Centers], and that’s the vast majority of my workforce because we’ve never been given any additional government employees since the organization was stood up in 2018.' Hammett added the SRCO has about 200 contractors and FFRDC employees that 'supplement' the office’s workforce. 'I have … billion-dollar programs that are run by seven people. If you go to the rest of the DoD, you’ll have a program office of 500 people to run one of those programs,' Hammett said. 'So we're very lean, and we are, therefore, inordinately impacted when we lose one, two, three people' who aren’t able to be replaced.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/secret-space-force-payloads-monitor-chinas-satellite-surveillance-network-official-says/	2025-03-05T13:25:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-AB23479-scaled-e1727101217129.jpg
AST, Kayhan, LeoLabs team to demo capability to reduce Space Force satellite tracking times	LeoLab's space monitoring radar facility in Collie, Western Australia. (LeoLabs) AUSTIN — Three commercial firms have demonstrated a collective capability to help the Space Force more quickly detect and track satellites launched simultaneously into low Earth orbit (LEO) — a growing launch practice that is challenging the service's abilities to spot potential on-orbit crashes. AST SpaceMobile, Kayhan Space and LeoLabs provided space situational awareness data for the five satellites launched Sept. 12, 2024, on SpaceX's Bluebird Block 1 mission to the 18th Space Defense Squadron (SDS), CEO of Kayhan Siamak Hesar told the 11th Annual Space Traffic Management Conference here sponsored by the University of Texas at Austin. AST is a satellite company collaborating with cellular telecommunications firms to create an on-orbit constellation to provide internet services. LeoLabs uses radars around the globe to detect and track satellites. Kayhan has created highly precise software designed to help satellite operators keep tabs on where their birds are in juxtaposition to those of other operators, as well as dangerous space junk. The goal of the collaborative effort was to show that commercial data can help close the time lag between when a satellite is released into orbit from a rocket to when the Space Force can reliably track it and put the trajectory coordinates into the military's catalog of space objects, he explained. That catalog currently is used by the 18th SDS to provide satellite operators with warnings of potential collisions with other satellites and space junk — although the Defense Department is working with Department of Commerce to offload that warning mission to a civilian system run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. That time lag, known as the 'COLA gap,' for collision avoidance gap, is a growing problem for the Space Force as more and more satellite operators are utilizing 'ride share launches' to LEO where multiple birds are lofted together on a single rocket, Hesar explained. Once the rocket makes it safely to space, these satellites, sometimes as many as 100, are released simultaneously. This means that their radar signatures overlap, making it extremely difficult for the radar systems used by the 18th SDS to either identify them or track their trajectories until much later when they have moved farther apart, he told Breaking Defense following his presentation. Thus, it often takes the 18th SDS 'months' to be able to put their tracking data into the public database and/or provide any warnings of potential collisions. 'So basically, those operators are flying blindly, even though they are able to track their own satellites — well, potentially, some of them are not, some of the are,' he told the conference. 'But other operators don't know they exist, and that causes that creates a big risk.' The three space monitoring firms used the 'deployment parameters' about the satellites being carried on the Bluebird mission provided to them by SpaceX, whose Falcon 9 is the rocket most widely used by US satellite operators for ride shares. They then pooled data from the GPS receivers on board the satellites tracked by AST, radar observations from LeoLabs' global network, and ran Kayhan's software to distinguish individual satellites as they broke away from the rocket. LeoLabs' observations also were used to track the five 'spacecraft structure release mechanisms,' which are the devices that decouple the satellites from the launcher, that did not have GPS on board. Hesar told Breaking Defense that the demo was able to reduce the COLA gap from an average of about two months down to a week. The experiment demonstrated the 'great things' commercial space firms 'can do when we collaborate together, and the capabilities that we can bring to the table and also to help the government,' he summed up.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ast-kayhan-leolabs-team-to-demo-capability-to-reduce-space-force-satellite-tracking-times/	2025-03-05T12:55:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/Western-Australia-Space-Radar-opt.jpg
Cutting-edge GPS technology	BAE Systems photo. An all-out sprint is underway between the United States and near-peer adversaries to develop and advance . The most innovative of these systems prevent the jamming or spoofing of Global Positioning System (GPS) signals used to provide positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) to U.S. armed forces in contested environments. Admittedly, it is a race with hurdles, including a growing misconception about the reliability of GPS and whether the military’s highly encrypted signal known as M-code is 'ready for prime time.' Work has been underway for more than two decades to modernize GPS with the more secure, jam-resistant, M-code. However, a recent U.S. Government Accountability Office report suggests technical and manufacturing challenges have delayed the deployment of M-Code. BAE Systems is actively developing and fielding a comprehensive family of M-Code GPS receiver solutions. The company has created security-certified Common GPS Modules (CGMs) that leverage the robust M-Code signal across an all-inclusive GPS receiver portfolio. The portfolio scales from the world’s smallest and lowest-power M-Code GPS for size, weight, and power (SWaP)-challenged applications, to highly robust receivers with integrated anti-jam antenna electronics for exceptionally challenging environments. In addition, ongoing efforts for DIGAR™ production is ensuring the reliability of military GPS systems for aircraft and other platforms operating in challenging signal environments. DIGAR uses advanced antenna electronics, high-performance signal processing, and digital beamforming for better GPS signal reception and superior jamming immunity with both the powerful M-Code and legacy Y-Code GPS signal. The diverse line of M-Code receivers includes the MPE™-M, MicroGRAM™-M, NavGuide™, NavStrike™-M, NavStorm™-M, and SABR™-M. The NavGuide™ handheld is anticipated to begin customer deliveries this year To date, BAE Systems has delivered selective availability anti-spoofing module products to more than 45 countries and has begun delivering M-Code GPS receivers in multiple form factors and levels of capability to the U.S. armed forces and its allies through foreign military sales. Additional M-Code capable receiver form factors are also on the horizon. Customers who have integrated these products into their platforms are at a competitive advantage, as the open-architecture capability can be tailored to solve their most pressing battlefield problems at an affordable price with a short timeline. So, while recent scrutiny of the operational efficiencies of M-Code products provided by defense technology companies is important and necessary, it has underestimated the success and advancements that are rapidly underway. BAE Systems is not only dedicated to maintaining a supply of cutting-edge GPS solutions today, but also proactively overcoming the challenges of a rapidly changing defense landscape for the foreseeable future.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/cutting-edge-gps-technology/	2025-03-05T12:40:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/21-A39-02_GPS_600x300px_Fuller.jpg
Ex-NSA cyber chief warns of ‘devastating impact’ of potential DOGE-inspired firings	NSA cybersecurity Rob Joyce testifies to Congress in 2021 (Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — The former leader of the National Security Agency's unit dedicated to cracking foreign computer systems warned lawmakers today that the potential mass firings of probationary federal employees would have bleak consequences for the country’s cybersecurity posture, especially when contending with malicious cyber activity from the People’s Republic of China (PRC). 'I want to raise my grave concerns that the aggressive threats to cut US government probationary employees will have a devastating impact on [US] cybersecurity and our national security,' Rob Joyce, former director of cybersecurity at the NSA and ex-chief of the agency's elite Tailored Access Operations unit, told the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party. 'At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive, unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,' Joyce said. 'Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent essential for hunting and eradicating PRC threats.' In line with efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), overseen by billionaire Elon Musk, the Trump administration previously ordered a vast swath of probationary employees across several federal government agencies be let go, before apparently pulling back on that directive Monday after a federal judge froze the original order. While the National Security Agency and its military counterpart, US Cyber Command, did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment on the status of probationary employees at their respective organizations, the firings already hit another cybersecurity entity, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency under the Department of Homeland Security, where 130 employees were let go, according to CBS News. The White House National Security Council also did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this report. At today's hearing, Rep. Shontel Brown, D-Ohio, echoed Joyce’s animosity toward the mass firings, saying that 'the recent efforts by the Trump administration and DOGE to reduce the number of government employees actively working on our cyber security defenses are not just misguided, they are dangerous.' Also testifying was Laura Galante, the former director of the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. She specifically emphasized the vitality of CISA’s work in protecting the US cyber missions. 'The work that CISA does and the [cybersecurity] advisories that go out with numerous agency seals on them as a voice from the US government about what needs to be protected, have a powerful message to our allies and to other entities looking for advice on what they need to patch and do in their systems. It's a critical function, and it's something that CISA has made real strides in over the last several years,' she said. 'This will be a significant blow to the people who have come in over the last several years or who have waited on clearances sometimes upwards of a year or more to come in for technically important roles where training is limited on the outside and they’re doing core work to secure US networks,' she added. Apart from the immediate national security concerns the firings pose, Joyce said they will have lasting effects on the national security community’s ability to recruit talent. 'Even if the positions are not eliminated, the pervasive uncertainty and doubt in the current environment is forcing them to seek secure opportunities for families outside national security — we need this talent to win in competition and conflict,' he said. Today's hearing coincided with an announcement by the Justice Department that the US government had charged 12 Chinese 'contract hackers' with allegedly working at the behest of the Chinese government to break into several international targets including 'foreign ministries of multiple governments in Asia, and U.S. federal and state government agencies, including the US Department of Treasury ... in late 2024.' (The Chinese government has consistently denied that it conducts hacking operations.)	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ex-nsa-cyber-chief-warns-of-devastating-impact-of-potential-doge-inspired-firings/	2025-03-05T12:15:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230411_rob_joyce_testifies_GettyImages-1232310976-scaled-e1681235017394.jpg
AI for war plans: Pentagon innovation shop taps Scale AI to build ‘Thunderforge’ prototype	Many operations during US Space Command's March 8-12, 2021 Global Lightning exercise were based in the command's joint operations center. (US Space Command photo: Lewis Carlyle) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s outreach arm to Silicon Valley, the Defense Innovation Unit, has selected San Francisco-based Scale AI to lead what it calls Thunderforge, a prototype project to build AI to speed up large-scale military planning, the company and DIU announced this morning. Scale AI will work with fellow defense tech upstart Anduril, IT giant Microsoft, and other as-yet undisclosed 'global' subcontractors, the company and DIU said. The new AI toolkit will combine Anduril’s Lattice data-sharing system with Large Language Models (LLMs) developed by both Microsoft and Scale AI itself. The first prototype tools will go to the four-star headquarters tasked to deter America’s most powerful adversaries: Indo-Pacific Command, which the Trump administration has identified as its top priority in a new Cold War with China; and European Command, whose decades-long focus on Moscow has been complicated by Trump’s reversal of previous anti-Russian policies. The Thunderforge project is just one piece of a much larger multi-front effort to use AI algorithms, big data, and long-range communications to coordinate US and allied forces across the military 'domains' of land, air, sea, space, and cyberspace. The jaw-breaking official jargon for this mega-project is Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (CJADC2). All the armed services and many defense agencies have been building their own, hopefully compatible pieces of this AI-powered global meta-network, coordinated by Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Officer. (However, the Trump administration is reportedly considering major changes to the role of CDAO, a Biden-era creation). Working closely with CDAO, DIU has played a major role in linking all these efforts to cutting-edge companies in the commercial sector, whose latest and greatest AI tools the military wants to adopt and adapt for its own purposes. RELATED: Tech bros to the rescue? Reagan Institute 2025 scorecard dings Pentagon on ‘scaling’ innovation Those military applications can be remarkably mundane, in stark contrast to the killer-robot apocalypses of pop culture. Planning a major combat operation, or even a peacetime redeployment, requires going through vast amounts of data: latest locations of potential targets, unit readiness reports, transport routes and timetables, the load-carrying capacities of road bridges and seaports, stockpiles of everything from ammunition to spare parts, and on and on and on. Today, much of that data is scattered across multiple, incompatible, and increasingly geriatric computer systems, which means human staff officers have to labor for hundreds of hours to pull it all together, let alone analyze it and calculate an optimal course of action. So the Pentagon is intensely interested in any kind of AI that can accelerate this laborious data-crunching and give everyone at headquarters more time to actually think. 'Today’s military planning processes rely on decades-old technology and methodologies, creating a fundamental mismatch between the speed of modern warfare and our ability to respond,' DIU’s Thunderforge program lead, Bryce Goodman, said on the agency’s blog. 'Thunderforge brings AI-powered analysis and automation to operational and strategic planning, allowing decision-makers to operate at the pace required for emerging conflicts.' Specifically, DIU and Scale told Breaking Defense, Thunderforge will automate many traditional staff processes, assist in drafting plans, and even run AI wargames of alternative courses of action. It will also handle classified information at multiple levels. While today’s announcements didn’t disclose many details, including the amount of funding the government will provide, recent military experiments suggest that the Large Language Models provided by Scale AI and Microsoft will serve two major functions: extracting key details from masses of written reports and other documents — so-called 'unstructured' data, which is notoriously hard for older forms of AI to make sense of — and generating draft planning documents for staff officers to review. But, as Scale emphasized in its announcement, these AI tools will be 'always under human oversight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ai-for-war-plans-pentagon-innovation-shop-taps-scale-ai-to-build-thunderforge-prototype/	2025-03-05T11:38:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Global-Lightniing-Test.jpeg
Combat engineering evolves with autonomy and robotics	(Pearson Engineering photo). Pearson Engineering’s latest developments include solutions that incorporate tele-operation, automation, and autonomy for front-end equipment and engineering mission packs designed specifically for robotic platforms. We discuss autonomous combat engineering with Amish Patel, senior engineer for robotics solutions at Pearson Engineering. Pearson Engineering focuses on the medium tier of RCVs that are in a weight class suitable for combat engineering roles. Which RCVs are we talking about, to execute what combat engineering tasks? What are the combat engineering challenges for this tier of robot? Amish Patel is senior engineer, Robotic Solutions Engineering, Pearson Engineering. The medium tier of RCVs, or the RCV-M variant tier, per the U.S. DoD’s classification, encompasses robotic vehicles that fall within the 10-20 ton weight category. Having a greater vehicle mass is favoured for combat engineering tasks requiring ground engaging front-end equipment. The medium tier of RCV’s is lighter than traditional armoured engineering vehicles. Ground engaging combat engineering equipment for use with these RCV’s will need to be designed to fully utilise the available tractive effort from the host RCV. Example combat engineering tasks could include route proving and clearance, gap crossing, minefield breaching and urban obstacle creation and reduction. Tell us about your enabling technologies and solutions for these robotic platforms – the front-end equipment and tools that help the Army complete a task. Our latest developments include solutions that incorporate tele-operation, automation and autonomous capabilities to front-end equipment and engineering tools designed specifically for robotic platforms. Such developments have been designed to be modular and scalable, allowing them to be mounted onto RCV-Ms from multiple OEMs. Through the use of integrated sensor technologies and digital tools, augmented operator aids can be implemented to simplify tele-operation of front-end equipment and engineering tools. For example, graphical overlays can be used to aid depth perception when teleoperating manipulator arms, increasing operational tempo and reducing mission completion times. Integration with battlefield management systems BMS systems could provide the networking backbone to enable autonomous control of multiple RCV platforms to simultaneously complete combat engineering tasks and missions at pace. Other sensor payloads integrated in the same BMS could also provide RCVs with increased situational awareness to execute tasks with greater precision and momentum. Describe your RCV-Pioneer concept, which involves developing modular, swappable payloads for RCV platforms rather than building the vehicles themselves. How does this capability reduce the time it takes to reduce an obstacle or breach a minefield? RCV-Pioneer provides uncrewed ground vehicles with robotic engineering capability, paving the way for modern combat engineering CONOPS. Leveraging the power of mature artificial intelligence and autonomy will allow for robotic engineering assets to work together as a force multiplier, increasing survivability and freedom of movement. Such technologies will enable UGVs to rapidly interchange modular mission payloads in a matter of minutes, providing vast flexibility for dynamic mission profiles. This increase in the quantity and diversity of robotic combat engineering units in warfare will enable simultaneous execution of engineering operations across the battlefield, creating an unprecedented pace of advancement for friendly forces to counter the adversary with minimal risk to personnel. The use of autonomous systems will allow for advanced analysis of the mission profile, including the ability to rapidly simulate outcomes with a given RCV and MMP combination when applied in different ways. The optimal set of steps to reduce the obstacle or breach a minefield can then be identified and the RCV and MMP subsequently deployed to execute at pace. Describe your views on the need for CONOPS around the employment of autonomous engineering vehicles for combat engineering. Employing robotic engineering vehicles will require a new set of CONOPS to be developed to fully utilise the benefits that robotic platforms can provide. For example, robotic assets could be deployed in an autonomous manner to jointly undertake combat engineering tasks, however a human-in-the-loop may still be required to tele-operate platforms when faced with a scenario that the autonomous system cannot overcome. The C2 networking backbone would also need to be optimised to account for the bandwidth of all robotic assets that are deployed; integrated autonomy would inherently reduce this burden. CONOPS will need to factor in a means by which the humans operating in partnership with the autonomous engineering vehicles are able to understand how the vehicles are executing the mission. This will be important to build operator trust in autonomous systems and limit unnecessary intervention that may hinder progress. CONOPS will need to take account of how the autonomous engineering vehicle behaves if comms to the command centre are lost or the platform is immobilised, temporarily or permanently. What is your perspective on the potential for upgrading existing crewed engineering vehicles to provide autonomous capabilities, such as the M1150 Assault Breacher Vehicle? Pearson Engineering has successfully developed and tested tele-operation kits which can be retrofitted onto existing engineering vehicles, such as the M1150 ABV. One of the main capabilities of the system is that the vehicle can be switched between remote and manual control at the flick of a switch, allowing for fast changeover when used for dynamic mission profiles. Our retrofittable tele-operation kits reduce the burden of operator training through familiarity of existing platforms and provide a safe path to deploy teleoperated assets and remove soldiers from harm’s way sooner. Retrofitting existing crewed engineering vehicles to provide teleoperated or autonomous combat engineering capabilities could be a cost-effective alternative to developing robotic platforms from the ground up. It is an approach that enables combat engineering tasks to be automated and soldiers removed from harm’s way in the nearer term, ahead of advanced RCV’s coming into service. Final thoughts? As technology advances and ground vehicles evolve, we are keeping pace by offering a modern approach to engineering capability in what is quickly becoming a remote and autonomous world. The development of RCV-Pioneer follows the core principles of Pearson Engineering’s approach, providing high levels of equipment flexibility to support mission adaptability. Whilst best known for providing a suite of tools for vehicles such as the Assault Breacher Vehicle, Pearson Engineering’s investment in research and development is seeing us deliver a new generation of capability that will ultimately take soldiers away from the most hazardous tasks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/combat-engineering-evolves-with-autonomy-and-robotics/	2025-03-05T11:11:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Pearson-PXL_20220815_193310994-scaled.jpg
‘This acquisition is no longer required:’ Defense Health Agency cancels $96M wearable solicitation	Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune recently hosted the Director for Defense Health Agency, U.S. Army Lieutenant General Ronald Place and Senior Enlisted Leader for the Defense Health Agency, U.S. Army Command Sergeant Major Michael L. Gragg.(Photo by Michelle Cornell, Naval Medical Center Camp Lejeune) WASHINGTON — The Defense Health Agency has cancelled its effort to buy $96 million worth of biometric ring trackers, according to documentation obtained by Breaking Defense. The DHA did not provide details on why the solicitation, which would gather biometric data on DHA medical professionals, was being terminated, saying only 'This acquisition is no longer required,' per the documentation. The DHA did not respond to requests for comment by press time. However, this appears to put an end to a disputed contract that saw two of the giants in the wearable technology sphere launching protests and accusations at each other over a lucrative department contract. Last August, the DHA put up a notice on the government contracting site Sam.gov, announcing it was going to sole-source a $96 million contract for wearable devices and a 'wellbeing platform' to Ouraring, the US subsidiary of Finnish firm Oura Health. The wellbeing platform refers to a system that takes data from a user’s wearable device, for example a ring, watch or band, and creates a custom plan based on what the user’s biometrics indicate needs improvement. While $96 million isn’t major by Pentagon standards it was a big win for Oura; for comparison, its December series D round of fundraising was $200 million. Related: Pentagon’s $96M wearable contract sparks protest, accusations of vendor preference But it didn't take long for the deal to take a turn. Wearable company WHOOP protested the award to the Government Accountability Office, saying the intent to sole source lacked sufficient information. Shortly after, the DHA wrote to GAO that they were going to cancel the sole source contract and requested that the WHOOP protest be dismissed. (Breaking Defense obtained a copy and verified the protest documents.) After the initial contract was cancelled, another request for information and subsequent request for proposal were posted to Sam.gov by the DHA in November and December respectively, specifying that the wearable must be a ring. There are a handful of alternative wearable ring companies, but the DHA has acknowledged to lawmakers that Oura is the only wearable ring company that is cleared by DoD for use in secure facilities, according to documents reviewed by Breaking Defense. In January, WHOOP issued a second protest. An Oura executive confirmed with Breaking Defense that the company received word from the DHA that the solicitation was cancelled. 'This contract was meant to be an efficiency initiative, and we believe that the DHA had a clear business case for how this would have reduced costs and operational inefficiencies from burnout,' the Oura executive told Breaking Defense. 'If the insights gained from a successful wearable-led initiative at DHA led to even just a 1% reduction in burnout and turnover, then the contract would have achieved a positive return on investment for an agency that spends billions of dollars on staffing.' Notably, the change comes during a period of upheaval at the Pentagon, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered a review of the Pentagon’s fiscal 2026 budget plans aimed at shifting funds from legacy programs toward President Donald Trump’s priorities. It also comes following last week's exit of DHA head Gen. Telita Crossland, whom Reuters reported was 'forced' into retirement after her 32-year military career. Related: Pentagon seeks to shift $50B in planned funding to new priorities in FY26 The goal of Hegseth's review is to find roughly $50 billion, or 8 percent of the FY26 plan, and reprioritize it. That effort seems to be a parallel but different one from the cuts expected to be pushed by the Elon Musk-led DOGE office, which arrived in the Pentagon a few weeks ago.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/this-acquisition-is-no-longer-required-defense-health-agency-cancels-96m-wearable-solicitation/	2025-03-05T10:45:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/6515897-e1741114926471.jpg
It’s a time to buy: M&A for the national interest	Large pile of one hundred dollar bills. (Jackal Pan/Getty Images) From business schools to boardrooms, Venture Capital has been on a tear over the last decade. Buoyed by near-zero interest rates, the asset class grew in the United States from $33.1 billion in 2013 to its peak of $329.9 billion by 2021, a roughly 896 percent growth rate that fueled the creation of around 1,000 unicorn companies, driven by promise and potential rather than profitability. Some of these truly generational companies, such as AirBnB, Palantir and Uber, touch the way many of us live, work and play. But for every successful VC-backed startup, there are legions of technically talented builders who paddle hard to catch the perfect wave, but rarely make it work: According to HBS’s Shikhar Ghosh, 75 percent of all venture-backed startups that raise more than $1 million ultimately fail. Patriotic defense and national security entrepreneurs are not immune. Defense-focused venture capital has grown substantially since 2019. In 2022, $35.8 billion was deployed across 800 deals, and despite a minor decline in 2023 ($34.9 billion across 627 deals), at the midway point of 2024, $9.1 billion had been invested across 228 deals in the face of a broader market slowdown. In sum, over the last 5 years, over 2,000 companies have raised almost $100B in venture capital across 14 Defense Department Critical Technology Areas. Yet since 2019, just 20 companies have received more than $25 million in government funding last fiscal year — highlighted in the Wall Street Journal in July. This is all occurring in the highest interest rate environment seen in a generation, which has already hit the venture sector hard, with venture funding contracting and companies shutting down at record rates. In addition, slower-sale-cycle public sector-focused tech companies now have to compete with capital-hungry AI companies that can show viability at much quicker rates. Thankfully, during the interest rate spikes of the 1970s, playbooks emerged on how we can turn high-interest rate challenges into impactful opportunities. Post-WWII, America was booming, driving new public policies that created massive influxes of capital into Wall Street. However, these large pools of capital remained risk-averse and mainly invested in highly stable investment-grade bonds. Then came the Iranian hostage crisis and the corresponding oil shock. Energy prices spiked, inflation skyrocketed, and interest rates followed. Otherwise, strong companies found themselves downgraded, by no fault of their own but simply due to the macroeconomic conditions. These once-strong companies became known as 'fallen angels.' Due to their downgrading, these companies found it more difficult to raise capital, and in some cases, they were shunned out of the capital markets. Where many saw distress, few saw an opportunity. Some players in the financial markets realized these companies were being penalized due to factors that had little to do with the quality of their products and the prudence of their management. Once these external factors subsided, the companies would be fine. Non-investment-grade debt was discovered to have very good risk-adjusted returns, and profit-driven bankers and investors jumped on board to facilitate and issue high-yield debt packages to these fallen angels. Non-investment-grade debt was used to help finance these fallen angels and also to support other financial activities such as leveraged buyouts. The parallels to today’s defense tech companies are startling. Many were born of the zero-interest-rate policy (ZIRP) era of deep tech resurgence, which provided investors with abundant capital, resulting in inflated valuations attempting to emulate Palantir and SpaceX. Inflation in the wake of COVID (another global black swan event) and the resultant interest rate increases isolated even very good product companies, creating an opportunity not too dissimilar from the fallen angels of the 1970s and 1980s. Saddled with ZIRP-era valuations, very good companies, perhaps even those nearing the elusive 'product-market fit,' are currently at the whims of market forces that have left them unable to get off the cheap-cash treadmill and adjust to a new cost of capital environment. These critical companies and their deep R&amp;D investments, paired with expensive operational requirements ranging from security clearance to compliance standards, cannot adapt as quickly as commercial sales and marketing-heavy enterprise software companies. The result is an enticing pool of 'venture fallen angels' — companies with some evidence of product-market fit and near-term commercialization potential, but not quite enough potential for venture capitalists to put more money in. Who are these venture fallen angels? Well, we put our theory to the test, and here is what we found. Our principles are to consider companies that 1) have raised venture capital, 2) have not finalized product-market fit, and 3) have seen financial headwinds that might make them viable targets. We used Pitchbook data to select a list of companies with an enterprise value of less than $50 million that had raised funding before 2022 (so not companies with fresh runway) in aerospace, defense, and/or deep tech. We manually confirmed that their product(s) fit the defense thesis and vetted them to ensure they are properly American entities. That yielded 385 companies. Next, we enriched this database with government revenue data from the most comprehensive publicly available set of resources, including USAspending.gov, FPDS.gov, SAM.gov, and SBIR.gov. We found that 119 of the 385 had received some form of federal obligation. Next, we looked at whether a company was healthy and growing. This includes looking at overall headcount (year-over-year, and six-month growth) — both in aggregate, and just the product team. We found that the average company in the cohort was 8.5 years old with 100 employees. On average 29 percent of their staff was engineering or technical, and their rate of headcount growth was slowing. In fact, over the past six months, headcount at these companies was flat: It averaged about 1 percent growth. Some saw declines of up to 85 percent and growth reaching a high of 80 percent. On a 12-month basis, the average growth rate stands at just 4 percent. Unsurprisingly, revenue is also disproportionately concentrated among a few high performing companies. The top five companies account for nearly 40 percent of the total obligations, while the top 10 represent over 50 percent of the total. What surprised us most is that some of these companies were high fliers. They are not limited to any single product or segment, instead cutting across cybersecurity, AI, additive manufacturing, UAS, and more. Additionally, while federal revenue is stagnant or shrinking, they may have pivoted to commercial use cases. As such, the acquirers may need to be creative in how they structure the deal, and be open to carveouts and atypical capital structures. Beyond this, any successful 'venture fallen angels' deal will have — at a minimum — three key hurdles to overcome: Strategic M&amp;A in the defense industry is notoriously difficult, with most participants holding a lower risk appetite than their purely commercial cousins. That said, the upside — for country, and profit — is immense. In the government-driven market, we must beware the 'false fail' — where the inability to gain traction in the time allotted (before the money runs out) is conflated with building 'bad tech' or a product no one wants. Historically, distribution in the national security sector has been the greatest moat; the mammoth legacy providers, borne out of World War II consolidation, have massive capture teams who spend every waking moment shaping future acquisitions and ensuring they are well-positioned to win. But like any industry, the convergence of the innovation-forward Trump administration, competition with China, and the most significant technology paradigm shift in the 21st century have created an unprecedented opportunity for disruption. So it is the time to buy and build, consolidate and create for the national interest. A different approach is sorely needed, lest these companies begin to fail, entrepreneurs chase other dreams, and investors pack away their checkbooks to chase AI, crypto, or whatever new wave emerges.

Anduril and Zone 5 Technologies advance for Air Force, DIU Enterprise Test Vehicle	Anduril's Barracuda 500. (Anduril) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit have selected Anduril Industries and Zone 5 Technologies to advance in a program to develop a modular, low-cost air vehicle that can help pave the way for a new generation of weapons. The two companies will now proceed under the Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program, which was originally envisioned to field an affordable testbed for subsystems and is now poised to serve as a foundation for a new weapon. The Defense Innovation Unit confirmed to Breaking Defense Tuesday that Anduril and Zone 5 Technologies have been selected to continue, meaning competitors from the program’s previous round, Leidos Dynetics and Integrated Solutions for Systems, have been axed. Anduril touted its recently unveiled Barracuda-500 cruise missile in a press release Tuesday announcing the company’s selection to continue, which states that '[o]ver the next several months, Anduril will produce a number of ETV Barracuda-500 units using manufacturing processes and equipment that are representative of future full rate production techniques, continuing development towards a production variant capable of rapidly scalable manufacture in 2026.' The company declined to comment on how much funding it has received under the ETV effort. Zone 5 Technologies confirmed to Breaking Defense that the company has been selected to advance. The vendors who were not picked to proceed did not respond to a request for comment. In a briefing with reporters Monday on the sidelines of the AFA Warfare Symposium, Anduril Senior Director of Advanced Effects Steve Milano explained that while the previous ETV phase demonstrated the ability to manufacture a platform with open systems architecture, integrate subsystems and fly it, the next phase aims to 'iterate' on the platform’s design. Additionally, the next ETV phase is anticipated to incorporate autonomous networking and last about six months. Barracuda is designed to launch from a range of platforms, and an early application of ETV is for a missile that can be dropped out the back of a cargo plane. After the next phase of the ETV program concludes, the effort can transition into the Franklin Affordable Mass Missile (FAMM) program for palletized munitions, Milano explained. Following an earlier phase that proved it was possible to integrate mission systems without extensive redesign activities and fly a vehicle, 'the next instantiation is a formalized requirement to go after a capability set, and that capability set is answered by a program of record called FAMM,' Milano said. A parallel effort called Extended Range Attack Munition has been formed to develop an ETV vehicle for foreign military sales, primarily to aid Ukraine — though military assistance for Kyiv has now been paused. In a separate briefing with reporters Monday morning, Lockheed Martin revealed its own cruise missile news. After previously teasing the concept, the company unveiled its Common Multi-Mission Truck (CMMT), pronounced 'comet,' that aims to answer the Pentagon’s call for cheaper and easily produced weapons. According to Mike Rothstein, Lockheed’s vice president of strategy and requirements for air weapons and sensors, the CMMT is designed to be an 'upper subsonic' air vehicle with a range of 'multiple hundreds of miles,' adding that larger variants can travel 'upwards to 1,000-ish miles.' Besides features like scalability, the platform was also designed to more easily incorporate different payloads like warheads or sensors. Rothstein said the CMMT 'fits very well inside [FAMM]' effort, and that the company was aiming to meet unit cost goals under the program of $150,000 per round. According to a Lockheed press release, the weapon comes in two air-launched variants: one configuration can deploy from airlifters, fighters and bombers, while a smaller version can act as a launched effect from rotary aircraft. 'Part of our concept is to make the manufacturing easily deployable, easily repeatable, whether it's different places in the United States, whether it's with international partners, whether it's in theaters closer to war,' Rothstein said. 'These are all things we get from listening to our customer.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/anduril-and-zone-5-technologies-advance-for-air-force-diu-enterprise-test-vehicle/	2025-03-05T09:08:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250305_Anduril_barracuda_500.jpg
US unfreezes $95M in military aid to Lebanese Armed Forces	A Lebanese army officer shows to Lebanon's Prime Minister Nawaf Salam an Israeli military positon on the horizon, in the southern village of Khiam near the border with Israel, on February 28, 2025, after the withdrawal last December of Israeli forces from the area under a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. (RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The US State Department has unfrozen $95 million in military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF), granting a waiver to a halt on military aid that occurred shortly after the Trump administration arrived in January. 'The Department approved an exception to expend the $95 million of FMF [Foreign Military Financing] recently reprogrammed to Lebanon. We are working with our DoD colleagues to move forward with the implementation of these funds,' a State Department Spokesperson told Breaking Defense Tuesday. This decision to greenlight the military aid to LAF comes at a time when the military has been charged with implementing a ceasefire between Hezbollah and Israel, which includes the first major deployment to the south of Lebanon in decades. The $95 million FMF sum was originally a part of military funding for Egypt, and was reprogrammed to Lebanon as the Biden administration exited the White House. Days later, FMF agreements were halted by the Trump administration, pending a review. News of the money being unfrozen was first reported by Axios. 'These funds will directly support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) as they work to implement the Lebanon-Israel Cessation of Hostilities. The LAF’s deployment into southern Lebanon – and Hizballah’s withdrawal – will represent the most significant steps towards implementation of UNSCR 1701 since the resolution was passed in 2006,' a State Department official told Breaking Defense on Jan. 7 when the initial announcement was made. The official added that 'supporting the LAF to exert sovereignty across all of Lebanon will constrain the malign activities of Hizballah and their Iranian backers both in Lebanon and their destabilizing activities across the globe.' 'Additional FMF will further enable the LAF to secure the South Litani area, implement UNSCR 1701, and signal strong U.S. commitment to advancing the U.S.-brokered agreement to partners who may be considering increasing assistance to the LAF,' the official added earlier. Israel completed its withdrawal in February 2025 but held on to five supervising positions in the South. And as the Lebanese armed forces are deploying in the South, there is also an increased burden on their shoulders to secure the Northern and Eastern borders with Syria, especially after the fall of the Assad regime. Hence, getting the US aid in could prove extremely well timed for the LAF. The Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, which saw a number of Hezbollah leaders killed and their power base inside Lebanon degraded, has led to a resurgence for the LAF. On Jan. 9, the Lebanese parliament elected the LAF chief Joseph Aoun as president of the country and during the same month the head of the International Court of Justice, Nawaf Salam, was appointed as prime minister, changing the internal dynamics of the country and bringing new non- Hezbollah allied figures to power. In his speech to the parliament, Aoun stressed the state’s exclusive right of carrying arms, a notable statement hinting at ending armed groups outside of the military — a move aimed at the Lebanese armed group, allied with Iran, Hezbollah. As a sign of how things have changed, the delayed funeral of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, took place on Feb. 23 with little incident.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/us-unfreezes-95m-in-military-aid-to-lebanese-armed-forces/	2025-03-05T08:15:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/lebanese-prime-minister-scaled-e1741189003840.jpg
As industry frets licensing bottlenecks, NOAA reinstates top commercial space officials	A graphic image of satellites and debris in space, produced by the Center for Strategic and International Security, the Secure World Foundation, and the University of Texas at Austin. (Satellite Dashboard) AUSTIN, Texas — The Trump administration has reinstated the top official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) charged with licensing commercial remote sensing satellite operations who was fired last week, following a reported revision in the Office of Personnel Management's (OPM) instructions to federal agencies requiring the firing of all 'probationary' employees. Sarah Brothers, the head of NOAA's Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA), is back on her job, a spokesperson for NOAA told Breaking Defense Tuesday. Nonetheless, representatives of US remote sensing companies have expressed to Breaking Defense that they remain extremely nervous about possible roadblocks to future plans that require either new licenses or license modifications due to the personnel downsizing resulting from the efforts of Elon Musk's DOGE team to chop the size of the federal bureaucracy. CRSRA is the division within NOAA’s Office of Space Commerce responsible for regulating space-based commercial remote sensing, including work involving companies such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky that provide imagery to the National Reconnaissance Office for use by the Defense Department for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. NOAA, in turn, is under the Department of Commerce. Several industry sources said that the Office of Space Commerce has lost between 25 to 30 percent of its total workforce of some 60 employees. Tahara Dawkins, director of policy at Astroscale U.S. and former chief of staff of the National Space Council, emphasized the critical nature of CRSRA’s role, based on her own firsthand experience leading the office. 'Commercial remote sensing, including non-Earth imaging, plays a critical role in maintaining American space leadership. We look forward to CRSRA’s continued facilitation of private sector innovation in space,' she said. Dawkins comments were echoed by several representatives of remote sensing companies, who noted that CRSRA has been instrumental in helping them navigate what is a bit of a murky regulatory arena as industry races to bring new capabilities to bear. They also pointed out that CRSRA's 'light touch' approach to regulation was crafted during the first Trump administration, and subsequently embraced by the Biden administration. Meanwhile, there were many small sighs of relief from experts here at the annual Space Traffic Management conference at the University of Texas at Austin in response to the news, also confirmed by the NOAA spokesperson, that Dmitry Poisik, the head of the Office of Space Commerce's program to create a civil space traffic management regime, too has been reinstated. That program, called the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS), was designed under the 2018 Space Policy Directive-3 to take the burden of warning non-military satellite operators of potential on-orbit crashes off DoD’s shoulders. Poisik was scheduled to speak at the conference, but withdrew after his termination due to the original Feb. 13 OPM memo ordering the mass firing of 'probationary' employees. In most federal agencies, personnel who have yet to complete one full year in their job are given 'probationary' status.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/as-industry-frets-licensing-bottlenecks-noaa-reinstates-top-commercial-space-officials-sources/	2025-03-05T07:27:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220126_csis_space_dashboard.png
No sailors in sight: DARPA launches warship designed ‘from the ground up’ to be truly unmanned	DARPA’s NOMARS is a 180-footlong warship designed from the ground up to not have humans aboard. (Photo courtesy of DARPA) WASHINGTON — A key Pentagon research and development agency said it has successfully launched and will soon begin sea trials for a vessel dubbed 'NOMARS,' a warship built from the ground up to sail without any humans aboard. 'The No Manning Required Ship (NOMARS) program has built a ship designed to operate autonomously for long durations at sea,' according to a statement from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency on Tuesday. 'Construction of the prototype, unmanned surface vessel (USV) was completed in February 2025.' Sea trials for the ship, dubbed Defiant (USX-1) and which does not have any mission or combat systems installed onboard, are scheduled for spring 2025, the statement added. DARPA in August 2022 selected tech and engineering firm SERCO to design and build NOMARS, a USV measuring 180 feet long and weighing 240 metric tons. While the Pentagon’s interest in unmanned surface vessels is well documented — and industry’s supply of options is vast — NOMARS aims to fulfill a somewhat surprising gap given the technology's name: An operational ship with no people aboard. The majority of USVs the Pentagon uses are either small drones that could not physically carry a human (i.e. Saildrone) or they have been modified to operate autonomously but still have all the relevant spaces to sustain life (i.e. Mariner). The US Navy has taken to calling the ladder 'optionally manned ships.' Proponents of the technology argue that allowing for 'optional manning' defeats the purpose of unmanned ships from the start. The spaces required for human life — bunks, food storage, bathrooms, life preservation equipment — are costly. Cue the NOMARS program. 'The NOMARS program aims to challenge the traditional naval architecture model, designing a seaframe (the ship without mission systems) from the ground up with no provision, allowance, or expectation for humans on board,' according to DARPA. 'By removing the human element from all ship design considerations, the program intends to demonstrate significant advantages, to include: size, cost, at-sea reliability, greater hydrodynamic efficiency, survivability to sea-state, and survivability to adversary actions through stealth considerations and tampering resistance.' Doing as much presents its own sets of challenges, but also a new world of potential solutions. For example, what happens if a fire breaks out aboard Defiant? The answer, Navy officials and others have previously told Breaking Defense, is that the ship can be equipped with a special gas that floods its internal spaces. That gas, which would have health repercussions if humans inhaled it, can deprive the compartment of oxygen, snuffing out a fire.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/no-sailors-in-sight-darpa-launches-warship-designed-from-the-ground-up-to-be-truly-unmanned/	2025-03-05T05:10:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250304_defiant_ship_DARPA_cropped.png

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jackson Adkins) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump today announced the creation of a shipbuilding office in the White House centered on revitalizing the nation’s commercial and naval shipbuilding industry. 'To boost our defense industrial base, we are also going to resurrect the American shipbuilding industry, including commercial shipbuilding and military shipbuilding,' Trump said during a presidential address to a joint session of Congress, to applause from Republican lawmakers. 'And for that purpose, I am announcing tonight that we will create a new office of shipbuilding in the White House and offer special tax incentives to bring this industry home to America where it belongs. 'We used to make so many ships,' the president added. 'We don't make them anymore very much, but we're going to make them very fast, very soon, it will have a huge impact.' Trump did not specify what kind of financial incentives the office could provide to industry, nor did he provide other details about the role the new office will play in bolstering naval shipbuilding. The Navy’s shipbuilding industrial base has faced supply chain constraints and workforce shortages after years of consolidation and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in the mass retirements of skilled laborers. Over the past couple of years, Congress has provided billions in additional funds to shore up the submarine industrial base, which has been especially impacted by supply chain challenges. The announcement of the new shipbuilding office is part of what Trump characterized as a focus on building 'the most powerful military of the future,' which also includes the construction of a comprehensive missile defense system for the United States homeland that is now being called Golden Dome.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/trump-announces-new-white-house-shipbuilding-office/	2025-03-04T20:27:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/7987135-e1696858610380.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: Lockheed out of Navy’s F/A-XX future fighter program	An F/A-18 Hornet assigned to the Gladiators of Strike Fighter Attack Squadron (VFA) 106 prepares to launch from the flight deck of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71). (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Alex Millar/Released) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Lockheed Martin is out of the running for the Navy’s sixth-generation fighter jet program, known as Next Generation Air Dominance or F/A-XX, Breaking Defense has learned. A source with knowledge of the program told Breaking Defense that Lockheed submitted a bid to the Navy, but the proposal did not satisfy the service’s criteria. The company is now no longer proceeding with the bid. The Navy previously told Breaking Defense in November that the service was evaluating proposals, but it is unclear when Lockheed was knocked out of the competition. The outcome leaves a horse race between Northrop Grumman and Boeing to replace the venerable F/A-18 and E/A-18 with a new air superiority fighter. At stake for Northrop is its first fighter contract since the F-14 Tomcat, famed for its appearance in the original Top Gun movie; at stake for Boeing is the future of its fighter arm, which has seen a massive investment in its St. Louis facility on a gamble that the company will win a sixth-gen contract from the US military. Lockheed referred a request for comment to the Navy. The Navy did not respond to requests for comment by deadline. Lockheed, which cornered the market on fifth-generation fighters through its ubiquitous F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the F-22 Raptor, still has a shot to build a sixth-generation jet through the Air Force’s separate fighter competition, also known as Next Generation Air Dominance, where the company is facing off against Boeing. The F/A-XX program is the highest-profile aircraft competition in the Navy in two decades, but the service has kept the effort highly secretive. Little is known about the capabilities or requirements of the aircraft, aside from the fact that it will be built to complement the F-35 aboard the service’s warships and will have a different airframe and engine than the Air Force’s sixth-gen fighter effort. John Phelan, the Trump administration’s pick to become the next Navy secretary, characterized F/A-XX as a 'next-generation aircraft, offering significant advancements in operational reach and capacity within contested environments' in written answers to questions from lawmakers published last week. The program 'is intended to enable Carrier Strike Groups to outpace adversaries while maintaining naval air dominance,' and will involve collaboration with the Air Force and Marine Corps on autonomy, mission systems, communication architectures, and autonomous combat drones, he wrote [PDF]. In its fiscal 2025 budget request, the Navy delayed about $1 billion of research and development funding that had been slated for F/A-XX in order to fund other readiness priorities while keeping the service’s budget within the constraints of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. 'We’re absolutely committed to the capacity and lethality of the carrier wing,' Rear Adm. Ben Reynolds, deputy assistant secretary of the Navy for budget, told reporters in March 2024. 'The capacity [and] the firepower of the air wing is orders of magnitude above anything else that [the Defense Department] has.' Navy officials have publicly remained committed to awarding an F/A-XX contract this year, a contrast with the Air Force, which put its NGAD program on hold last year as it assessed the program. The Air Force conducted an internal analysis last year, which supported the development and fielding of a manned sixth generation fighter, but officials punted a decision on whether to continue the program to the Trump administration. Stephen Feinberg, the nominee for deputy defense secretary, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that the decision on the Air Force program could be made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth or President Donald Trump. Justin Katz in Washington contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/exclusive-lockheed-out-of-navys-f-a-xx-future-fighter-program/	2025-03-04T14:03:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/220617_f18_aircraft_carrier_1638656-scaled-e1655486661613.jpg
Air Force fields FMS inquiries for MH-139 Grey Wolf helo as test campaign progresses	An MH-139 Grey Wolf flies in formation with UH-1N Hueys as part of an initial operational test and evaluation campaign. (US Air Force photo by Senior Airman Mary Bowers) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Ahead of potential orders, the Air Force has begun gathering interest in foreign military sales (FMS) for the service’s MH-139 Grey Wolf helicopter, another signal of confidence in the platform that has now entered a key evaluation phase. Supplied by Boeing as a replacement for the Air Force’s aging UH-1N Huey, the Grey Wolf as envisioned will be primarily tasked with supporting nuclear security, as well as ferrying VIPs in the Washington, DC-area. And, in an interview with Breaking Defense on Feb. 26, Boeing's Manager for Utility Helicopter Programs Azeem Khan said the helo has already sparked international interest. 'As we look at the program moving forward, we’re also excited [about] the interest and the demand signal that we’re seeing, both domestically and from potential customers around the world,' he said, noting that the attention spurred the Air Force to open an FMS office. 'We’re not far enough along to talk specifics at this moment, but the versatility of the platform [for] military customers is generating interest, and we’re continuing to take a look at those and see where we take this program on its next chapter.' Asked to comment on an FMS office for the program, an Air Force official told Breaking Defense that the service 'is fielding FMS inquiries for the MH-139. However, nothing has been formalized at this time.' Foreign sales would be a boon for Boeing as well as the Italian firm Leonardo, whose commercial AW139 serves as the Grey Wolf’s baseline. It may also help restore some helicopters the companies were originally expecting to manufacture following the Air Force’s apparent move to cut the Grey Wolf’s program of record. Former Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter previously explained the cuts would likely affect some of the helo's secondary roles, like VIP flights and search-and-rescue assistance. However, a Pentagon report last year revealed the service may be looking to add back in some aircraft for the Grey Wolf program, meaning that some roles may be on the table once again. Still, Khan said that though Boeing officials are aware of talks of trimming the MH-139 buy, a decision to change the program of record has not been finalized. 'As of today, we have not been formally notified that our program of record has been cut. We execute on what we have in front of us, and it's focusing on our requirements and our contractual deliverables,' he said, adding that a contract award for the program’s next production lot is expected sometime this year. As the evaluation campaign has proceeded, users have identified some needed changes to the platform, which the Pentagon’s top weapons tester said in a recent report [PDF] range from altering cabin seating to redesigning the aircraft’s gun mount and accompanying bag to catch spent shells. 'What we're delivering, from a configuration perspective, is what we are on contract for, and what the aircraft is being tested through is that configuration,' Khan said. Since the helicopter’s contract was awarded in 2018, 'needs and desires have also changed, but we're maintaining the contracted configuration, and we’re always open to opportunities to continue to enhance and improve that where it makes sense. And that's just part of the journey of this product life cycle, and we’re in close coordination with the Air Force.' Meanwhile, the platform itself continues to progress through its test campaign. According to an Air Force press release, on Jan. 28 an MH-139 embarked on its first initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E) flight at Malmstrom Air Force Base in Montana by escorting a missile convoy, kicking off assessments of the helicopter’s effectiveness in operational scenarios. The IOT&amp;E stage is expected to continue through June of this year, the Air Force press release says. Khan said the aircraft’s initial operational capability, or the milestone that indicates when a system has been fielded in sufficient quantities and can be maintained to support real-world operations, is expected 'toward the back end of the year.' Sometime after that, the program is expected to enter full rate production, he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/air-force-fields-fms-inquiries-for-mh-139-grey-wolf-helo-as-test-campaign-progresses/	2025-03-04T11:43:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/grey-wolf-mh-139.jpeg
Nominee for top DoD policy job sidesteps questions on Russian invasion of Ukraine	Elbridge Colby, then the Robert M. Gates senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security, asks U.S. Air Force Gen. Paul J. Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a question during a National Defense University Center conference in Washington, Jan. 19, 2016. (DoD photo by Army Staff Sgt. Sean K. Harp) WASHINGTON — Less than a day after President Donald Trump paused military aid to Ukraine, his pick for the top Pentagon policy job frustrated Democrats by refusing to state outright that Russia invaded Ukraine. Elbridge Colby, who Trump nominated for the Defense Department’s undersecretary for policy in December, has previously stated that the invasion of Ukraine was 'an evil act by the Russians.' However, during his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee today, Colby repeatedly sidestepped questions on the topic, citing the sensitivity of ongoing peace negotiations led by Trump. 'I stand by my record, but at this point, I think there's a very delicate diplomatic process going on where the president is rightfully trying to resuscitate the peace process,' he said in response to questions by SASC top Democrat Sen. Jack Reed. He later dodged similar questions from other senators, including Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, Angus King, Ind.-Maine, Tim Kaine, D-Va., and Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill. 'It's important to be discreet and say things at the appropriate time and place,' Colby told King. 'The problem is, you tell us you're going to tell truth to power,' King said. 'The most obvious truth is that Russia invaded Ukraine. Everybody in the world knows that, and you won't say it here today, because it appears that you don't want to offend the president.' Duckworth said Colby’s refusal to state 'a known fact' was tantamount to 'saying you don't know whether or not Hitler invaded Poland.' Colby’s testimony comes days after a disastrous meeting between Trump, Vice President JD Vance — who introduced Colby during the hearing — and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House last week. The meeting was set for the parties to agree to a mineral-rights deal, but devolved into a public argument in which Trump and Vance accused Zelenskyy of being insufficiently thankful to the United States for billions of dollars in military aid. Numerous news outlets reported on Monday, citing White House sources, that Trump has paused military aid to Ukraine as a result. Colby, whose longtime tenure in government includes positions such as the Pentagon’s deputy assistant secretary for strategy and force development, is best known as one of the authors of the Trump administration’s 2018 National Defense Strategy, which centered on great power competition with China and Russia over counterterrorism. Known within Washington circles as a foreign policy 'realist,' Colby has advocated that the United States pare back its involvement in the Middle East and Europe — including its aid for Ukraine — to focus its resources against the Chinese threat. In his opening comments, Reed said that Trump’s decision to cut military aid to Ukraine damages US relationship with its allies and could embolden China. 'The administration’s actions are doing great harm to America’s standing in the world, showing anyone who is paying attention that the United States can no longer be trusted,' he said. 'President Xi will take note.' However, Colby stood by his past statements that the US must prioritize a potential fight in the Asia-Pacific theater over its support of Ukraine. 'I don't contest the fact that the Chinese are looking at what we're doing in Ukraine at all,' Colby said. 'But fundamentally, Senator, my view — and I think it should be of particular interest to this committee, sir — is that we have to have the military capabilities in Asia, or relevant to Asia, to be able to conduct a local defense of Taiwan at a cost and level of risk that the American people are prepared to tolerate, and that has been my main focus.' 'A longer term top priority for me would be, if confirmed, would be to revivify our defense industrial base, so that we are no longer in a position where our defense industrial base cannot produce at levels, where we can resource in multiple theaters at the level that we need,' he added. Later in the hearing, Colby defended Trump’s actions on Ukraine, stating that the president is a 'deal maker' whose unpredictability gives him leverage during negotiations. 'With President Trump, you have a very different dynamic. You don't know what he's going to do, but you can get a deal with him,' he said. While Colby is likely to be confirmed, his nomination has come under scrutiny from some Republicans who have quietly questioned his noninterventionist stance on the Middle East, resulting in GOP heavy hitters like Vance and Elon Musk stepping in to defend his record, Politico reported last month. However, only Republican Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Dan Sullivan of Alaska asked pointed questions regarding Colby’s position in the Middle East, with both lawmakers interrogating the nominee on his position on Iran. Colby responded that a nuclear armed Iran — particularly one with access to intercontinental ballistic missiles — would be an existential threat to the United States, and that he would provide military options to the president to stop Iran from gaining access to nuclear weapons. Multiple times throughout the hearing, Colby stated he would help support defense acquisition reform efforts, with Vance characterizing Colby as a 'good guy' that would be willing to work with Democrats on such policy objectives. 'That means not just buying more weapons,' Vance said. 'That means being smart about how we buy weapons in a way that enhances our technological edge and ensures that upstarts, not just the big five incumbents, but upstarts, can participate in the process of procurement and of giving our troops the weapons systems that they need.' Colby’s reticence to assign blame for the Russia-Ukraine conflict echoed statements made by Stephen Feinberg, Trump’s nominee for deputy secretary of defense, during his nomination hearing last week. Elsewhere on Capitol Hill this morning, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held a confirmation hearing for two State Department nominees and the representative to NATO, where Democrats pressed nominees with similar questions about whether Russia invaded Ukraine. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., asked Christopher Landau, who has been nominated to be the State Department’s deputy secretary, 'Do you think that Putin and Russia were the aggressors in Ukraine?' 'Senator, at this point, there are peace negotiations taking place across the world —' Landau responded before Van Hollen cut him off, and posed the same question to Matthew Whitaker, who is nominated to be the US representative to NATO. 'I’m not here to assign labels, but I would say that JD Vance on Friday said that Russia invaded Ukraine,' he responded. 'Ok, so you don’t know if they’re the aggressor,' the senator shot back.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/nominee-for-top-dod-policy-job-sidesteps-questions-on-russian-invasion-of-ukraine/	2025-03-04T11:26:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/2363052-scaled-e1741112606915.jpg
‘Europe’s moment:’ EU unveils $843B ‘ReArm Europe’ spending plan, as US-Ukraine relations flail	Ursula von der Leyen delivers an announcement on a new $843 billion EU defense package (European Commission) BELFAST — As allies brace for the US to cut military funding for Ukraine, the European Union announced today a new €800 billion ($843 billion) package to 'rearm' the continent, dubbed &#8216;ReArm Europe.' Unveiling the plan, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, was blunt, saying, 'We are in an era of rearmament. And Europe is ready to massively boost its defense spending.' 'This is Europe's moment, and we must live up to it,' she added. Coincidentally or not, the announcement comes on a day when President Donald Trump will address the US congress, and as multiple reports say Washington has decided to cut off military aid and may stop the transfer of weapons to Ukraine following an explosive meeting in the Oval Office between Trump, Vice President JD Vance and Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. ReArm Europe funding will be dependent on securing €650 billion over four years by triggering a 'national escape clause' that suspends budget rules, allows national governments greater flexibility over public funding and could produce, on average, a 1.5 percent defense spending increase per member state. A 'new instrument' offering €150 billion of loans to member states would be responsible for delivering the remainder of the funding. Additionally, member states will be able to redirect funding from other EU projects to increase defense related efforts. Von der Leyen stressed that the rearmament project rests on 'spending better – and spending together,' while at the same time will focus on developing 'pan-European capability domains.' She referred specifically to ammunition, air and missile defense, artillery systems, drones and missiles as weapons that Europe needs to invest in. 'Of course, with this equipment, Member States can massively step up their support to Ukraine,' she added. We are living in dangerous times. Europe‘s security is threatened in a very real way. Today I present ReArm Europe. A plan for a safer and more resilient Europe ↓ https://t.co/CYTytB5ZMk &mdash; Ursula von der Leyen (@vonderleyen) March 4, 2025 The rearmament plan also signals a stronger joint procurement push by the EU, which von der Leyen said will 'reduce costs, reduce fragmentation increase interoperability and strengthen our defense industrial base.' European officials voiced strong support for von der Leyen’s rearmament plan. On X, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis labelled it a 'significant step toward strengthening our collective European security.' He added, 'We must now work out the details to ensure that all member states benefit—regardless of their current defense spending.' Similarly, Annalena Baerbock, Germany’s outgoing foreign minister, said the initiative was an 'important first step' in strengthening Europe defense. More broadly, the level of spending proposed under ReArm Europe is directly in line with calls from industry to urgently move the needle. Last month, Saab CEO Micael Johansson, told Breaking Defense that if the European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP) could not go beyond a proposed budget of €1.5 billion and reach 'hundreds of billions' then a 'coalition of the willing' should be formed to fund major equipment projects and scale up production. Von der Leyen's announcement comes two days before European leaders gather for a 'special' European Council meeting in Brussels to discuss additional support for Kyiv and 'exchange views on European contributions to the necessary security guarantees required to ensure a lasting peace in Ukraine,' according to an EU statement. Since Friday's explosive meeting in the Oval Office, Europe has been scrambling to come to grips with the reality that it may be alone in challenging Russia. That means any strategy needs to not only involve improving individual state defenses, but also helping to support Ukraine going forward. Whether Europe can step up and fill that void is very much a question, one on display Tuesday morning at a a UK defence committee hearing on European security. Julian David, CEO at TechUK, said that even outside of obvious heavy equipment like ATACMS, Patriot and HIMARS, the MoD would be unable to replace US communications and 'information, surveillance and reconnaissance' capabilities. He added, 'Everybody talks about Starlink, but it's a broader problem than that, and that really does need thinking about, even at the level of GPS.' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, said that production of ammunition across Europe would effectively need to double in order to make up for the absence of US stocks. 'That’s a big ask,' he explained.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/europes-moment-eu-unveils-843b-rearm-europe-spending-plan-as-us-ukraine-relations-flail/	2025-03-04T11:05:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/P065815-187142-scaled-e1741108794189.jpg
Mach announces deal with Army lab for vertical takeoff ‘Strategic Strike’ cruise missile	California-based defense firm Mach announced on March 4, 2025 it was working with a US Army lab to develop a new vertically launched cruise missile dubbed Strategic Strike. (Mach) WASHINGTON — Mach Industries has announced a recent deal with an Army research lab to work on a vertical takeoff (VTO) cruise missile called Strategic Strike. Based in Huntington Beach, Calif., the company said today that the Army Applications Laboratory awarded it with an undisclosed amount of funding last year to work on a new weapon for soldiers at the company- through brigade-level formations. The weapon, according to Mach, is being designed to hit targets up to 290 km (180 miles) away and host a 10-plus kg (22-lbs) warhead. 'The primary objective for Strategic Strike is to launch from beyond enemy radar range, reducing the probability of detection, and increasing launch team survivability,' Mach said in the press release. 'Tactical maneuver units will be able to engage and prosecute high-payoff targets, such as radar arrays and artillery pieces, well beyond the forward line of troops.' The company said it locked down the weapon’s design in September 2024 before 'successfully' testing out its vertical take-off during a full-performance, wing-borne flight in mid-January. It is now integrating 'artificial intelligence visual' and radio frequency sensing techniques into the cruise missile to enable it to hit a target when GPS and communication is severed — a growing requirement as strategists watch the electronic warfare-saturated combat environment in Ukraine. 'The combination of VTO, high speed and range/payload is radically novel for the current fighting force,' Mach said in the press release. 'At the culmination of the contract, Mach will provide the warfighter with a VTO asset that has HIMARS [High Mobility Artillery Rocket System] range, cruise missile speed, and Hellfire effects.' As novel as it is, Mach is not the only company working on a new class of such vertical takeoff weapons. While not a cruise missile, Anduril Industries has been working on a subsonic, vertical takeoff and landing drone dubbed Roadrunner-Munition (Roadrunner-M) that the company says can be reused on surveillance missions or in a kamikaze-like fashion to strike moving aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/mach-announces-deal-with-army-lab-for-vertical-takeoff-strategic-strike-cruise-missile/	2025-03-04T10:48:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250304_strategic_strike_MACH.png
New thinking needed to safeguard our spectrum	U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Geoffery Smith, 20th Communications Squadron installation spectrum manager, views the display on a radio spectrum analyzer at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C., Jan. 13, 2017. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Kathryn R.C. Reaves) If the Pentagon was asked to relocate its air bases, radar stations, missile silos, and other facilities to make room for wind farm developers, Congress would reject the idea out of hand. Such a massive disruption would threaten our national security and cost taxpayers untold billions of dollars — all to benefit a few. Yet effectively the same debate is taking place over another kind of real estate: the radio spectrum bands set aside to carry the military’s wireless transmissions, including the frequencies needed and used today and in the future for radar, targeting, and command-and-control systems, and potentially for envisioned systems like hypersonic and ballistic missile defense. Some in industry are again seeking to gain exclusive control over additional portions of the spectrum, including those used by the military, through spectrum auctions. Some in Congress are taking the proposal seriously. At the center of the debate is a slice of spectrum the military cannot plausibly replace: the mid-band frequencies between 3.1 and 3.5 GHz that offer the ideal mix of range and capacity for defense applications. For example, the Navy’s Aegis AN/SPY radar operates in this band. That is one reason defense champions in Congress have repeatedly raised concerns about the security threat posed by efforts to sell off these critically important segments of military spectrum. Former Pentagon CIO John Sherman explained that vacating the band would be 'absolutely untenable,' taking decades to complete. It would also cost more than taxpayers could ever hope to gain from auction revenues. Moving the Navy’s Aegis radar system alone comes with a price tag of $120 billion. What many fail to consider is that Congress doesn’t need to eject the military from these frequencies in order to free up spectrum for private use and gain the appropriate economic benefits for the American people. Reframing the discussion from one or the other, to one with the other is not only possible but necessary. Proven spectrum sharing models, such as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS), demonstrate that the military can retain priority access to key spectrum while safely and securely opening the band to factories, warehouses, rural internet providers, schools, airports, and other innovative users. As a result, consumers gain the benefits from new wireless technologies, improved connectivity, and more competitive prices — without forcing massive costs and dangerous disruptions on our armed services. We should continue to aggressively pursue proven sharing technologies, innovate new ones, and scale to multiple geographic areas and spectrum ranges. This approach affirms US global leadership in spectrum innovation. Bureaucratic inertia may tempt Congress and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to fall back on an exclusive, full-power licensing model rooted in the cell phone technologies of the 80s and 90s. That playbook assumes a false choice between national security and commercial innovation. In fact, spectrum sharing models support dual-use innovative technologies, maintain national security needs, and allow commercial use of the contested frequency bands. It’s time for new thinking. Military leaders have made it clear they are prepared to share key spectrum with a diverse array of users — so long as these commercial systems don’t interfere with operations or force the Pentagon to vacate vital frequencies. Now it’s up to Congress, the FCC, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to embrace spectrum sharing as the only reasonable solution to the country’s current spectrum stalemate. By setting aside dangerous and costly proposals for relocating military spectrum, we can clear the way for innovative sharing technologies that will reinforce US wireless leadership, boost competition, and create jobs. National leaders don’t need to accept the false choice between exclusive, full-power licensing and military readiness. It’s a recipe for failure. Instead, we should build on proven models for shared spectrum that can preserve our national security while still maximizing the use of a scarce national resource, increase taxpayer revenue, and advance American businesses and technologies around the world.

Space Systems Command chief backs ‘important’ work of Space Development Agency	Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant speaks during a Department of the Air Force worship service at Washington National Cathedral in Washington, D.C., Sept. 10, 2023. (U.S. Air Force/Eric Dietrich) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The head of the Space Force’s main acquisition arm expressed full confidence in the Space Development Agency (SDA) on Monday, offering support for both the entity’s work as well as its independent status within the service. 'I think it's fantastic work. It's continuing. It's important,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander of the Space Force's Space Systems Command (SSC), said in a Monday roundtable with reporters at the AFA Warfare conference in Aurora, Colo. 'And I think the Space Development Agency will continue to be an incredibly important part of the Space Force, independent and completely separate from SSC.' Originally established outside the Space Force by reporting directly to the Pentagon’s research and development office, SDA was required by Congress to transfer into the Space Force in 2022, but has maintained its quasi-independent status. However, as Breaking Defense first reported, the Trump administration is reviewing whether SDA should be more fully rolled into the Space Force acquisition system. SDA also finds itself at an awkward place, as its leader, Derek Tournear, is currently suspended while being investigated over whether he improperly steered a contract to a preferred company — something that led to Garrant briefly serving as SDA's acting head before being replaced. Despite all that, Garrant was clear he has been impressed with the work SDA has done. 'They have demonstrated, I'll call them inter- and intra-constellation crosslinks, which is pretty amazing when you think about how quickly they did that,' he said. SDA is currently developing a low Earth orbit (LEO) constellation that can transport data around the world, using a so-called 'mesh' network that relies on laser communications links between satellites. And the agency's approach has drawn concerns from the Government Accountability Office, which found in a February watchdog report that SDA has yet to prove the technology is viable. Asked about the report’s findings, Garrant said making sure the laser links — otherwise known as optical communications — work will be critical for the Space Force’s orbital architecture to function. 'Optical crosslinks are important to all of our constellations, not just in LEO but between orbital regimes as well. When you contemplate moving data at operationally relevant speeds, we're going to need to be able to do that. We're going to have to be able to do it between constellations as well,' he said. 'So it's a critical area that will get the attention that the GAO is pointing out.' The Elon Musk led DOGE effort to cut the federal workforce has been hitting agencies across the government, and Garrant said SSC has not been spared of large workforce cuts. 'A considerable number of SSC employees' took the deferred resignation plan offered to federal workers, according to the general, who added that there are a 'number' of probationary employees at the command whose easier-to-fire status has made them a favorite target of DOGE’s workforce cuts. Garrant said officials are working to quickly off-ramp employees, as well as ensure essential work remains covered. Garrant additionally said SSC will play its part to contribute to a budget drill ordered by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth that seeks to shift roughly eight percent of DoD funding to new priorities. In a separate roundtable with reporters Monday, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said the Space Force’s options for the budget drill essentially amounted to time and capacity, meaning that projects could be delayed or fewer systems could be fielded for the same mission in order to save money. 'I think that there is a recognition that we have a new mission, and the new mission comes with new resources. It's just about how much of those resources you get, how fast you get it,' Saltzman replied when asked what areas the Space Force may have to pull back in. 'I haven't really seen a push to give up anything. It's more about capacity and timeliness' for certain programs, he added. And as the Space Force jostles for funds under Hegseth’s new approach, Saltzman made his priority clear in a keynote address to the AFA conference on Monday. The Space Force, Saltzman said, must establish 'space superiority,' including by exercising 'space control' — protection of friendly space assets and denying adversaries the ability to use their own space capabilities — by degrading, disrupting or even destroying enemy satellite systems if necessary. 'Space control is a new function for our fledgling service and it's my No. 1 priority whenever I speak to executive and legislative leaders, because we currently don't have the resources to perform it as effectively as the Joint Force requires,' Saltzman said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/space-systems-command-chief-backs-important-work-of-space-development-agency/	2025-03-04T09:05:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/garrant-scaled-e1741094779597.jpg

Tech bros to the rescue? Reagan Institute 2025 scorecard dings Pentagon on ‘scaling’ innovation	SpaceX Transporter-5 launch, 25th May 2022, carrying 5 ICEYE radar imaging satellites. (Photo: SpaceX) WASHINGTON — As Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth pushes dramatic changes at the Pentagon, the thinktank named for the icon of old-school conservatism urged President Donald Trump to hit the gas on high-tech weapons built by non-traditional industry players. The Ronald Reagan Institute determined its recommendations before Sec. Hegseth's order to reallocate $50 billion in funding, said the institute's director, former Pentagon official Roger Zakheim, in a breakfast briefing with reporters, but they're 'highly complementary' to what the new administration is trying to do. The Pentagon has made real progress in reaching beyond its typical contractors to 'maturing defense startups' the institute's report said, with Zakheim specifically calling out Anduril, Palantir, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX as 'trailblazers.' But, it goes on, a sclerotic defense bureaucracy and a rusting US industrial base make it hard to scale up production to the levels required for major war. Meanwhile, China not only dominates heavy-metal manufacturing — with twice America’s manufacturing capability output and 230 times the capacity for building ships — but is investing heavily in cutting-edge R&amp;D to catch up to America in AI, quantum technology and hypersonics. Those are the principal takeaways from the Reagan Institute’s latest 'report card' on what it calls the 'national security innovation base' — a clunky but carefully chosen term for something much larger and more complex than the traditional 'defense industrial base.' First issued in 2023, the annual report looks not only at Pentagon procurement and R&amp;D, but across the US economy at metrics like most-cited scientific papers and amount of 5G spectrum. This broad view catches some strong positives that traditional military metrics miss. '[The] US leads with 61 notable machine learning models,' the report says, 'followed by China with 15 and France with eight.' And venture capital investment in defense-related fields, it says, has risen from $4.4 billion in the first quarter of 2024 to a whopping $14.7 billion in Q4, 'four consecutive quarters of growth' driven almost entirely by rising interest in AI. 'There's plenty of capital in the system,' said McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant Dale Swartz, an advisor on the report. 'You increasingly have very large rounds being being raised — on both sides of the Atlantic, by the way. At this point &#8230; some of the largest VC-backed companies, both in the US and Europe, are in the defense and space arena, which is actually a pretty novel development over the past couple of years.' It’s private-sector innovators like those funded by venture capitalists that the Reagan Institute sees as driving much-needed change and preserving America’s high-tech edge. That said, not all the good guys in the report are Silicon Valley upstarts: It notes the leading role played by 'corporate venture capital' investments by long-established defense contractors like Lockheed Martin and Raytheon/RTX. Even the Pentagon bureaucracy has made progress, according to this report, especially compared to the Reagan Institute’s first scorecard in 2023. There’s money moving through streamlined acquisition pipelines that were under-used in 2022, for example a 22 percent increase in Other Transaction Authority (OTA) awards. There are also new channels for faster funding of non-traditional contractors, like over $4 billion provided by the Small Business Investment Company Critical Technologies Initiative (SBICCT, a joint initiative of the Small Business Administration and the Department of Defense). But, the report laments, these streamlined processes and innovative technologies remain a relatively small part of the massive Pentagon budget. (Since the Reagan study looks back at 2024, it doesn’t comment on the recent announcement that Trump’s new Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, has ambitious plans to reallocate $50 billion from 'legacy' programs to new priorities). And while American tech has kept its cutting edge, mass production remains anemic. In fact, to emphasize this issue, the 2025 report adds a new category for 'Manufacturing Capacity and Industrial Base' — for which it gives the United States a 'D.' Meanwhile, the US defense industry — upstarts and established players alike — has been thrown into uncertainty by Trump's suspension of aid to Ukraine. Also Congress has yet to pass regular appropriations for the fiscal year which began Oct. 1st, forcing the Pentagon to operate on (slightly modified) funding lines from 2024. But Zakheim insisted there was light at the end of the budgetary tunnel, in the form of proposed 'reconciliation' bills that could add up to $200 billion to defense. 'Reconciliation is something that is not dependent on president's budget request,' he told reporters. 'It's Congress generating it, and doesn't require the 60-vote threshold [in the Senate]. And of course, why it's so critical.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/tech-bros-to-the-rescue-reagan-institute-2025-scorecard-dings-pentagon-on-scaling-innovation/	2025-03-04T07:36:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/SpaceX__Transporter-5.jpg
Navy contractor KEEL to open new $70M facilities for submarine fabrication	Metal Trades' Yonges Isand facility in South Carolina. (Photo courtesy of KEEL) WASHINGTON — South Carolina-based Navy contractor KEEL is planning to invest $70 million in three new facilities totaling 60,000 square feet focused on submarine and aircraft carrier component manufacturing in Charleston, the company’s chief executive told Breaking Defense. 'We’re purpose building KEEL to help solve the capacity challenges in nuclear Navy shipbuilding,' said Brian Carter. 'This is a critical step in us adding capacity to the industry that will directly impact the and improve the schedule for building both Virginia [and] Columbia [class submarines] and future' aircraft carriers. The company, which took its current shape in January 2024, was formed through a merger of two South Carolina companies — fabricator Pegasus Steel and shipyard Metal Trades — along with the Michigan-based Merrill Technologies Group. Its current work for the Navy is focused on building the Columbia-class submarine superstructures that are ultimately delivered — by truck or barge — to prime contractors General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII Newport News. KEEL also fabricates numerous components to be used on future Ford-class aircraft carriers. Carter said the expansion will include three facilities that will all start construction in 2025 or 2026 and be completed by or in 2027: a preparation and paint building; a facility for Columbia-class superstructure fabrication; and a building for employees. KEEL’s announcement comes on the heels of numerous other Navy contractors announcing expansions in the region. HII earlier this year closed on its acquisition of metal fabricator W International. Meanwhile, Leonardo DRS last week also announced a facilities expansion in South Carolina focused on manufacturing space for naval propulsion technologies. Carter said South Carolina's proximity from HII and General Dynamics Electric Boat is likely a key factor in why numerous other Navy contractors are opening up shop in the region. 'It's critical that it's an easy voyage, if you will, for both truckable and bargeable components to both Newport News and Electric Boat,' he said. 'But it's far enough away where it's a different labor market, and we can tap into some really great infrastructure here for training and developing our trades workforce. 'If you look at the growth of Charleston last 10-15, years, it is becoming more of a manufacturing hub, and there is quite a population growth that's occurred along with that,' Carter continued. 'And so it &#8230; should grow into more of its own shipbuilding ecosystem, if you will, to support these priority Navy programs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/navy-contractor-keel-to-open-new-70m-facilities-for-submarine-fabrication/	2025-03-04T05:45:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Keel-MetalTrades-157_Full-Aerial-with-Water_BB-scaled.jpg
Empty seats as Air Force limits AFA attendance, in line with ‘spirit’ of DOGE orders	Sparse attendance at AFA's Warfare Symposium following a Trump executive order. (Michael Marrow / Breaking Defense) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air &amp; Space Forces Association (AFA) Warfare Symposium held each spring is typically a packed affair, as thousands of airmen and Guardians crowd the halls of the three-day event standing shoulder-to-shoulder with industry and other attendees. But this year’s conference, held on the outskirts of Denver, Colo., at the Gaylord Hotel in Aurora, is a stark departure from past iterations. The halls are largely empty compared to years' past, as orders from above have barred many members of the Department of the Air Force (DAF), which includes the Air Force and Space Force, from showing up. Perhaps the clearest example of a drop in attendance came during keynote addresses from Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, where a number of audience members gathered near the stage but dozens of other chairs were noticeably empty. Most years when either top officer speak at this conference, it's a standing-room-only event. A full house for a panel at AFA's 2024 Warfare Symposium. (AFA Flickr) While a representative for AFA did not respond to Breaking Defense's request for attendance figures, the relatively empty conference rooms and hallways were accompanied by other, smaller indications of a drop in visitors. For example, it's often hard to establish cell signal due to the sheer number of other phones in the vicinity. This year, that's not a problem. The DAF recently made the decision to limit attendance 'to comply with the spirit of' President Donald Trump’s Feb. 26 executive order that implements the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative spearheaded by Elon Musk, according to a DAF spokesperson. 'Attendance has been limited to individuals with a direct role in the conference such as speakers, moderators, panel members, award winners and their supervisors, senior leaders with previously scheduled industry engagements, and local participants that attend at no cost,' the spokesperson said, adding that a virtual option is available for other registrees. AFA is the first large trade show held since the Feb. 26 order, and could raise questions about how future industry events may go. Vendors pay a hefty price to host booths in an exhibition hall that can serve as a meeting place for government customers and other officials — a primary driver of corporate attendance. If the severe drop in foot traffic here is a window into the future, it’s not clear how industry may be prompted to change its approach, particularly if fellow military services make similar moves to scale back their presence at major conferences. One industry source told Breaking Defense that they had seen roughly a 10 percent drop in meetings with senior service leadership following the Feb. 26 order. However, they said other senior leader engagements are largely continuing as planned, meaning there's still value for companies in showing up. 'We don't have this kind of interaction' except at shows like AFA, 'so it's very good from a company to really feel the pulse where the whole Air Force organization is headed and how we can support them,' the official said, who was granted anonymity to share internal planning details. 'So if that went away, yeah, that would be bad.' Another consideration, the source said, is that young airmen and Guardians who operate industry equipment may not have as many opportunities to interact and share feedback with suppliers. Whether the Pentagon's pullback from the AFA show should be taken as an omen may be too soon to tell, some industry sources said, particularly as Trump administration initiatives change by the day. 'I think the question is whether this is a temporary thing, or whether it becomes permanent,' a second industry official told Breaking Defense from the show floor.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/empty-seats-as-air-force-limits-afa-attendance-in-line-with-spirit-of-doge-orders/	2025-03-03T15:58:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250303_afa_colorado_empty_MARROW-scaled-e1741045601409.jpg
Air Force pauses deliveries of Boeing’s KC-46 tanker	A KC-46A Pegasus arrives at Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., Dec. 21, 2021. (US Air Force photo) AFA WARFARE 2025 — The Air Force has instructed Boeing to halt deliveries of the KC-46 tanker after cracks were found on two production aircraft awaiting their handoff to the Air Force. The decision to pause deliveries was made on Feb. 27 by the service’s KC-46A program office 'due to the identification of in the ‘outboard fixed-trailing-edge support structure’' of the two planes, an Air Force spokesperson said. 'The damage does not pose a safety-of-flight concern; however, identified cracks must be repaired before returning an aircraft to service,' The spokesperson said. 'Boeing, the Program Office, and Air Mobility Command are working to quickly identify the root cause and develop both a near and long-term way ahead.' A source with knowledge of the program told Breaking Defense that the issue revolves around cracks found on the aileron hinges of two aircraft yet to be delivered to the Air Force. The service and Boeing have been aware since 2018 that the KC-46 — like its parent aircraft, the commercial 767 — could develop cracks to the aileron hinges over time, but the discovery of cracking on brand new aircraft led the service to stop deliveries. 'We are working closely with the customer to assess a potential issue on KC-46 aircraft and to mitigate any potential impact to the fleet and in-production airplanes,' a Boeing spokesperson said in a statement. The War Zone was first to report news of the pause. The KC-46 has experienced numerous technical issues and schedule delays during its development and fielding, chiefly the redesign of the aircraft’s Remote Vision System — a collection of sensors that allow the boom operator to refuel a receiver airplane without visually looking out a window — which is expected to be fielded in 2026. Those issues and others have resulted in billions of dollars in cost overruns for Boeing, which is locked into a fixed-price contract that holds it responsible for paying costs above a certain threshold. Losses on the KC-46 amounted to $2 billion in 2024, Boeing stated in regulatory filings released in January. The Air Force last paused KC-46A deliveries for a two month period beginning in March 2024, which occurred so that the service could inspect production and fielded aircraft for a broken component on the aircraft’s boom. The service recorded a new 'category 1' technical deficiency for the program a couple months later after discovering that vibrations from a fuel pump that were damaging bleed air ducts, Air Force officials told reporters in July.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/air-force-pauses-deliveries-of-boeings-kc-46-tanker/	2025-03-03T12:05:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/6990563-scaled-e1741031493269.jpg
After JAG firings, a difficult truth about military legal independence	The Judge Advocate General of the United States Army, Lt. Gen. Stuart W. Risch, visited Puerto Rico on Feb. 8 as part of his ongoing efforts to spread awareness about the Judge Advocate General program. (Photo by Sgt. Marcuss Moyett) The recent decision by the secretary of defense to fire all three service Judge Advocates General (JAGs) sent shockwaves through the military legal community. Being a military lawyer myself, this decision went beyond a mere headline: It was deeply personal, as one of the JAGs who was dismissed was my boss. Like many in the JAG Corps, my initial reaction was frustration. The prevailing wisdom holds that JAGs are neutral arbiters of the law, advising commanders without political influence. Their role is ensuring legal soundness of policies, not shaping them based on partisan considerations. The idea that they were removed for being 'roadblocks' to policy seemed like an attack on that very principle. But as I sat with this, I realized that history tells a more complicated story. This event, as shocking as it is, may not be an aberration. Instead, it reveals a truth about military legal advice, a truth I was reluctant to acknowledge but now feel compelled to explore. For those of us who have spent our careers in the JAG Corps, there is a comforting belief that our role is fundamentally different from that of civilian political appointees. We do not serve at the pleasure of the president like the attorney general, and our function is often described as purely legal, not political. But if that were entirely true, why has history repeatedly placed military lawyers at the center of political battles? Take, for example, the John Yoo torture memos from the early 2000s. Yoo, a lawyer in the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), authored memos that provided legal justification for enhanced interrogation techniques, a policy deeply intertwined with the Bush administration’s political objectives. When Congress sought clarity on these policies, they did not call military commanders to testify. They called upon the expertise of lawyers from both the civilian and military sectors. Yoo and other administration-aligned lawyers provided testimony to Congress defending the policy decisions as legally justified. JAG officers, including the Judge Advocates General at the time, testified as well, voicing legal concerns about interrogation policies. The military testimony stood in stark contrast to the administration’s position, and it contributed to the eventual rollback of some policies. This historical example illustrates a difficult reality: Legal advice in government is never purely neutral. It is always part of the policy process. JAGs, whether we want to admit it or not, play a role in shaping and legitimizing military policies. Our legal opinions do not just exist in a vacuum; they influence what the Department of Defense is able to do, and as a result, they inherently intersect with politics. Unlike the attorney general, who is publicly nominated, confirmed by the Senate, and explicitly recognized as a political appointee, the selection of the Judge Advocates General is a closed process that takes place within the JAG Corps itself. This insularity has long been seen as a safeguard against political pressure, ensuring that military legal advice remains independent. But it also means that when legal interpretations do not align with an administration’s policy goals, there is no mechanism for resolving that conflict — except for the kind of sweeping firings we just witnessed. The secretary’s decision, whether intentional or not, highlights an uncomfortable pair of questions: If JAGs function in a manner similar to civilian legal advisors who help implement executive policy, should their selection process be more transparent? And if we acknowledge that military legal advice plays a role in legitimizing or obstructing policy, can we still assume that JAG selection should be insulated from the administration? None of this is to say that the secretary’s decision was the right approach. Blanket firings based on perceived policy misalignment, rather than demonstrated misconduct or incompetence, create serious risks. First, such a move weakens confidence in military legal integrity. If JAGs can be dismissed purely because they provide legal interpretations that do not align with policy objectives, future legal advisors may feel pressured to offer guidance that is politically expedient rather than legally sound. It could also politicize military legal advice even further. If the standard for removal becomes disagreement with an administration’s preferred policy direction, future JAG appointments may shift toward those who are perceived as more politically agreeable rather than legally rigorous. And finally, it sets a precedent for instability. The role of JAGs should not be about political loyalty. While legal interpretation is an inherently political process, there must be room for good faith legal disagreement without fear of dismissal. This moment calls for a serious discussion about the role of JAGs in military policy and whether the selection process should be reformed to better balance legal independence with accountability. In summation, the three key questions to consider are: These are not easy questions, and there are no simple answers. But ignoring them will not make the problem go away. The secretary’s decision may have been controversial, but it has forced us to confront a reality we can no longer dismiss: Military legal advice is not separate from politics, and our system does not fully account for that truth. One potential solution, which would require Congress to get involved, would be to adjust the timeline of the JAG selection process to align with a new presidential administration. A selection process that begins after election confirmation and ends sometime within the first 100 days of the new presidential term would provide two layers of protection: If the process were to remain untouched by political influence, the timing would make it appear it was underwritten by the administration protecting the JAG Corps, and on the other hand, if political influence is inserted into the process there is time to adjust and make it an acceptable selection within the normal administration confirmation time. As a military lawyer, I want to believe that our role remains one of principled legal guidance, unaffected by political shifts. But history suggests otherwise. If we do not grapple with this challenge now, we risk future administrations making similar moves, potentially with even more direct political motivations. The JAG Corps must decide whether to engage in this debate proactively or risk being reshaped by it. MAJ Trent Kubasiak is a judge advocate with Eighth Army in the Republic of Korea.

How to stop American AI from becoming the next Myspace	Image courtesy of RAFT. Recently, Vice President JD Vance delivered some hard truths to our European friends at the Paris Artificial Intelligence Summit. In short, he broke down the inevitable results of excessively regulating AI: it would hurt small, innovative startups the most; it would discourage American R&amp;D investments; and, last but certainly not least, it will drive nations around the world into the arms of the Chinese Communist Party. The Vice President’s message should be well received following last month’s DeepSeek panic. The Chinese company’s apparent breakthrough sent markets into a frenzy, and President Trump said it 'should be a wake-up call' for American tech companies. I can’t imagine many of America’s innovators slept through this alarm – we have ground to make up. DeepSeek sparked such a reaction largely because it’s performed so well in tests compared with rival American AI models like OpenAI, DeepMind or Llama. Remember when Facebook first came onto the scene and destroyed Myspace? Or when Apple wiped the floor with Motorola and Nokia? It’s our job to ensure that American AI models don’t become the next Myspace, and that requires more innovation and less regulation – our national security, as well as the national security of our friends and allies around the world, depends on it. First, just as the vice president did with our allies in Paris, we need to look ourselves in the mirror and accept some hard truths. There’s no denying that we’re at an institutional disadvantage to the CCP when it comes to developing these new technologies. I’m not referring to the fact that China has roughly nine times as many engineers as the U.S., or that they have as many as 15 times more science and technology graduates. I’m referring to the fact that American tech companies rightly abide by the principles of responsible AI – the consideration of societal impact, legal standards, and ethical values. The Chinese Communist Party simply does not share these concerns. That’s why the risk of losing this race is so high – it would mean nations around the world adopting and deploying Chinese AI models that can be used for malign purposes. We know that DeepSeek gathers data on its users – very similar to the way TikTok collects data – and censors responses to comply with the CCP’s speech controls. Vice President Vance was right to warn our allies that 'partnering with them means chaining your nation to an authoritarian master that seeks to infiltrate, dig in, and seize your information infrastructure.' America’s responsible, ethical AI technology standards are the very reason our partners and allies are right to follow U.S. leadership in this space. We need to be responsible, but we also need to recognize that unnecessary regulation will slow innovation and make it harder for U.S. companies to compete with China. If the U.S. and our allies can accept this reality – that innovation and responsibility are not mutually exclusive – and then translate it into policy that encourages competition, then we’ll have appropriately responded to China’s wake-up call. If you ask DeepSeek what happened in Tiananmen Square in June 1989, it’ll respond, 'I am sorry, I cannot answer that question.' We need to ask ourselves, 'How are we going to outpace China and ensure U.S. leadership in AI?' Fortunately, and unlike DeepSeek, we have an answer: American competition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/how-to-stop-american-ai-from-becoming-the-next-myspace/	2025-03-03T11:12:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-28-at-10.06.11 AM.png
Poland signs $300M lease for Apache attack helicopters	The AH-64D leasing ceremony occurred at Latkowo, home of the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade. (Lance Cpl. Wojciech Król/CO MON) WARSAW — Poland has formally signed a $300 million leasing agreement for eight AH-64D Apache attack helicopters, a bridge to when the Polish Land Forces will receive their full order of Apaches. The deal was signed Feb. 27 by Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s deputy prime minister and minister of national defense, at Latkowo, home of the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade. The agreement covers not only the leasing of the rotorcraft themselves, but support for training and operations. The leasing decision was made 'so that our soldiers can gain skills and be fully prepared for the arrival' of the future Apaches, Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'We are spending $300 million on it, so that our pilots, ground support personnel can get to know and learn all the skills, can take control of this equipment.' Poland in August signed its Letter of Acceptance on a $10 billion order of 96 Boeing-made AH-64Es, procured through a Foreign Military Sale case. Under that agreement, Poland will become the second largest Apache operator in the world, behind only the US Army. Deliveries are expected to run between 2028 and 2032, with 15 helicopters to be delivered in that first year. Once the Apaches are fully procured, they will be subordinated to the 1st Land Forces Aviation Brigade (1 BLWL), a tactical unit consisting of the 49th Air Base in Pruszcz Gdański, the 56th Air Base in Inowrocław and the Central Group of Tactical Air Area Control Teams. The AH-64s will be based at Inowrocław, Malbork and Świdnik. But the Polish government did not want to wait that long to be able to begin training and operations. Hence, the decision to go for the leasing agreement. 'Because of to this [leasing], we will be ready to accept these helicopters faster,' Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'We will have trained crews who will be able to operate this equipment. […] In addition, spare parts, a logistics package, simulators, armament, i.e. all the elements that are needed for this agreement to be fully valuable' will be met, he said. Last year the first Polish airmen completed the AH-64E Aviation Qualification Course and Instructor Pilot course as well as the AH-64E helicopter repairer and the American Language Course-General English at Fort Novosel in Alabama. Deputy Minister of National Defense Paweł Bejda, who was also at the signing, emphasized the domestic economic benefit of the deal, thanks to commercial offsets for Boeing that were required by the government. Thanks to those offsets, 'the Military Aviation Plant No. 1 in Łódź and Dęblin will be able to service both the composite structures of helicopters and their [T-700-701D, CT7-2E1 and CT7-8E] engines. Importantly, the same engines are also used in Leonardo [AW101 and AW149] and Black Hawk helicopters,' Bejda said. 'At the same time, the Military University of Technology will be able to train students, technicians and engineers for service and repair of composite components and engines. 'In this way, we are fulfilling the commitment that at least 50 percent of [any] expenditure on arms will remain in Polish defense companies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/poland-signs-300m-lease-for-apache-attack-helicopters/	2025-03-03T11:09:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Poland-AH-64D-leasing-1bd5cc49-b7a9-49de-a2bf-eab6813e891a.jpg
Amid US rift with Ukraine, UK proposes peace plan with ‘coalition of the willing’ boots on the ground	A UK Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon conducts a NATO air policing mission (UK MoD) BELFAST — In the event of a peace agreement for the conflict in Ukraine, the UK has vowed to establish a European 'coalition of the willing' to protect Kyiv from Moscow, by deploying 'boots on the ground, and planes in the air.' British Prime Minister Kier Starmer announced the move on Sunday during a meeting of 18 European leaders in London, set against a disastrous breakdown in relations between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during a recent heated argument at the White House. The proposed coalition is the key point at the heart of a four point plan launched by the UK, in collaboration with France, Ukraine and others. The other three points are to: 'Not every nation will feel able to contribute, but that can’t mean we sit back,' Starmer said of the coalition pledge — a sign that European nations are split over the idea as it could potentially draw them into armed conflict with Russia. 'Instead, those willing will intensify planning now — with real urgency,' explained Starmer. 'The UK is prepared to back this with boots on the ground, and planes in the air. Together with others. Europe must do the heavy lifting.' RELATED: Estonia &#8216;seriously' discussing sending troops to &#8216;rear' jobs in Ukraine, official says During questions with lawmakers today however, Starmer said that the government is 'nowhere near' the phase of holding a parliamentary vote on British troops deploying to Ukraine. Also, success of the coalition is dependent on 'strong US backing,' according to Starmer's remarks Sunday, despite a clear gulf between the Trump administration and similar UK calls for Washington to act as a security guarantor overseeing a peace settlement. Trump has excluded Europe and Ukraine from peace negotiations, initially demanded Kyiv sign over a $500 billion share of raw earth minerals in return for continued US military aid and balked at deploying US forces to support a peace deal. 'We have agreed that the UK, France and others will work with Ukraine on a plan to stop the fighting,' said Starmer. 'Then we’ll discuss that plan with the United States and take it forward together. The purpose of today’s meeting was to unite our partners around this effort to strengthen Ukraine and to support a just and enduring peace for the good of all of us.' He ruled out accepting any 'weak deal,' but it remains to be seen how outstanding differences between Europe and the US over Ukraine will be reconciled. Russia has previously pushed back on UK- and French-backed plans for a European peacekeeping force in Ukraine. Meanwhile, London also announced on Sunday that it had approved a £1.6 billion ($2 billion) deal for Ukraine to acquire over 5,000 Thales made lightweight-multirole missiles (LMM). The contract is funded by a British export finance loan, and the French manufacturer's UK arm will produce the air defense weapons from Belfast, Northern Ireland. As noted by London, it marks the largest contract signed by the UK MoD and Thales in Belfast to date and builds off a similar LMM contract signed last year for 650 missiles. To support the latest contract, a Ukrainian industry partner will manufacture launchers and command and control vehicles for the 29-pound weapon, which is designed to target armored patrol carriers, inshore attack craft and drones, according to Thales. 'This large deal and its timing underline the gap between the UK and Washington DC on support for Ukraine,' said Trevor Taylor, director of the Defence, Industries and Society Programme at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), in a statement to media. 'It also stresses the value of the UK’s industrial capabilities as a critical enabler of UK foreign and security policy. The production arrangements for the launchers and command and control vehicles for Ukraine mark a deepening of the cooperation of Western European firms with Ukrainian industry,' he said. The UK's LMM contract comes on the heels of Starmer committing to increase national defense spending to 2.5 percent GDP by 2027.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-us-rift-with-ukraine-uk-proposes-peace-plan-with-coalition-of-the-willing-boots-on-the-ground/	2025-03-03T09:54:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Eurofighter-Typhoon-e1732642769504.jpg
How Metrea hopes to grow the private air refueling market	Metrea refueled German Typhoons during the Pacific Skies exercise in 2024. (Metrea) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Far away from home and flying high above the seas for an event called 'Pacific Skies' last year, a small group of three German Eurofighters made several pitstops behind KC-135 Stratotankers, helping the jet fighter notch its longest-ever flight of roughly 10 and a half hours. It was a refueling mission like any other, except for one detail: Stratotankers supporting the flight were privately operated by the aerospace company Metrea, underscoring the growing role that commercial air refueling services can play to meet soaring demand among militaries for tanking. 'Pacific Skies was our largest and most complex deployment ever,' the German Air Force, or Luftwaffe, wrote in response to questions from Breaking Defense. Through the event, the service says it was able to 'demonstrate that our Luftwaffe is able to deploy around the world.' Founded in 2016, the American-based Metrea has quickly risen as an aerospace player, with three business groups that span air and space, electromagnetic and cyber, and digital and synthetics. Besides air refueling, Metrea’s air and space division offers other services such as supporting contractor-operated intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions in far-flung locations like West Africa. Air refueling is a growing focus for Metrea, particularly after the company agreed last year to buy a fleet of 14 KC-135s set to be retired by the French Air and Space Forces, growing the firm’s tanker inventory to a total of 18 on top of four previously acquired KC-135s from the Singaporean government. (Five planes in Metrea’s fleet of 18 are operational now and one is undergoing heavy maintenance, with additional tankers entering service 'based on customer demand,' the company said). According to Metrea, the French deal means the privately-held business now boasts the world’s fifth-largest refueling fleet, behind four countries. 'As many [KC-135s] as we can get in service in ‘25, we're going to put them to work,' Jon 'Ty' Thomas, the head of the company’s air and space group and a retired Air Force lieutenant general, said in an interview with Breaking Defense. Globally, air forces’ 'demand for air refueling is growing,' Thomas said, whether through buying more aircraft or running more sorties for an existing fleet. And having commercial tankers available could help supplement military planes thirsty for gas, Tim Walton, an air refueling expert at the Hudson Institute, said in an interview. 'Commercial aerial refueling tankers could support training, testing and evaluation and coordinate fighter movements in peacetime, which could help meet the high demand for aerial refueling services across the globe,' Walton said. While a range of factors from budget constraints to mission needs will ultimately shape future demand for private air refueling, Walton noted that 'ideally, it will increase if the government can take new approaches to aggregate different demands for training, deployment of aircraft and foreign military or direct commercial sales in support of foreign aircraft.' Metrea’s highest-profile international refueling to date with the Luftwaffe for the Pacific Skies event started out at the 2023 Royal International Air Tattoo in the United Kingdom. Metrea brought along its own KC-135 fresh out of heavy maintenance, catching the eye of several potential customers, including the Germans. Officials kept Metrea in mind, and ahead of Pacific Skies, they reached out to see 'if support for our deployment would be possible,' the Luftwaffe said. While the service operates refueling assets like the Airbus A330 MRTT and A400M, as well as the Lockheed Martin KC-130 — with the A330 providing a 'majority' of refueling missions for the deployment — like many nations, German armed forces are 'always slightly short when it comes to bigger deployments or exercises,' the service said. Pacific Skies is essentially a catch-all term to describe the overarching deployment of German forces to the region for a series of exercises. For the record-setting Eurofighter flight, the jets were ferried from one exercise in Japan called Nippon Skies to Hawaii for the biennial Rim of the Pacific, or RIMPAC, exercise. Ahead of the journey, Metrea staged one of its KC-135s at Yokota Air Base near Tokyo and another at Andersen Air Force Base in Guam, paving the way to support the trans-Pacific flight to Hawaii, according to Rory Cattelan, a former KC-135 instructor pilot who helped plan the event for the company. After rendezvousing with the Germans outside Tokyo, 'we dragged them [the Eurofighters] pretty much around the Pacific Rim, staying within 600 miles of a suitable alternate the whole time,' Cattelan said. A few hours later, the first aircraft passed the last of its gas and peeled off for Wake Island, dropping into a 'lovely thunderstorm,' while the aircraft from Guam carried the German jets the remaining way to Hawaii. Und wer wissen will, wie das mit dem Tanken in der Luft an einer KC135 der Firma @MetreaAero ist, der Boss zeigt es höchst persönlich in diesem Video.Dank an Metrea für die Unterstützung bei unserem #Weltrekordflug. Ohne Euch wäre das nicht möglich gewesen. #Pacificskies24 pic.twitter.com/xMIbZARRm4 &mdash; Team Luftwaffe (@Team_Luftwaffe) July 26, 2024 'We were just nervous this wasn't going to happen because it was really tight on gas as far as how much they needed and what we could support, and definitely didn't want them to fail their world record flight,' Cattelan said. 'In the end, it went off pretty good.' Metrea also helped the Luftwaffe get back to Europe, the service said, providing gas between Hawaii and Guam, Guam and Malaysia, then Malaysia to the UAE. In total, Metrea says it offloaded roughly 475,000 pounds of fuel over the course of 25 sorties spanning 160 flight hours. 'I think what we proved as a company is the complexity of the mission set that we're able to handle as a commercial entity,' said Joe Parker, a career boom operator and Metrea employee who helped execute the event. 'So I think what we proved as a company could be taken as a lesson learned, but really it was more, ‘We got this,’ and we kind of put our best foot forward in that regard.' From the Luftwaffe’s end, the experience of refueling with a commercial air refueling operator is 'pretty similar' to a traditional military run, particularly since air refueling is standardized in NATO. The service was even able to hire Metrea by tapping into the company’s active contract with the US Navy, easing some of the 'bureaucratic workload.' And what did the Luftwaffe learn from the endeavor? 'That commercial AAR [air-to-air refueling] is also a valid option for future deployments,' the service said. Describing Metrea’s business model of providing 'effects-as-a-service,' Thomas explained the company helps fill gaps that occur as part of militaries’ 'daily competition,' or day-to-day activities in lower-intensity scenarios. Much of the Air Force’s tanker force structure lies in the Guard and Reserve, whose assets and personnel are not always available for daily refueling taskings. Similar problems affect other militaries as well, Thomas said, noting that’s where Metrea comes in. 'It's not a choice of like, ‘Oh well, I could do that, or I could have a USAF tanker,' he said. 'It's, ‘I can have a commercial tanker, or I can have nothing. And so that's how we've grown the market.' Many of Metrea’s approximately 1,000 employees are either former military or a member of the Guard or Reserve. That depth of experience helps smooth operations for Metrea when serving military customers, but also provides a natural limit on what the company could provide under an all-out-war scenario. 'Probably a good fraction of our crews aren't wearing the Metrea blue flight suit' in that event, Thomas said. 'They're wearing the United States of America and US Air Force green flight suit, because they’re Guardsmen or Reservists and they've been mobilized,' he added. 'So our capacity is going to be constrained by the dynamics of that day.' 'We're not going to be able to have the luxury or be willing to take the risk of, on America's worst day, 20 of those tankers are coming out of a commercial company,' he added. 'That's not our place.' Walton, too, expressed skepticism that commercial refueling could shape what’s ultimately required by US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), which tasks air refueling missions and sets requirements for the fleet. 'Although it’s possible that private aerial refueling could exert downward pressure on the size of the government aerial refueling fleet, I think it’s unlikely, given that the US Transportation Command’s mobility requirements study has established a pretty high floor for the number of tankers required for the fleet in potential contingencies.' The minimum air refueling fleet number is mandated by Congress and is currently set at 466 tankers. At the direction of Congress, TRANSCOM has also studied the issue of incorporating more commercial tanking services. The command’s analysis previously found that the current air refueling fleet is sufficient to support global operations, but that 'the Air Force has and continues to explore the potential use of commercial tankers for training and other non-combat missions to help ease the pressure on the organic tanker fleet,' according to a statement from TRANSCOM. A day will come, however, when Metrea’s fleet of Eisenhower-era KC-135s will be tough to operate, particularly as the plane becomes increasingly difficult to maintain due to diminishing sources for parts as the Air Force retires the fleet. At that point, the firm may have to pivot, Thomas acknowledged. 'The [KC-]135 ecosystem does exist. And actually, let's be honest, the only way that it works for us is that there's a larger ecosystem in which we operate,' he said. 'If there's a day when the USAF isn't operating KC-135s in quantity, we'll have a hard choice to make as to what we're going to do,' he continued. 'But that day is like at least two decades away.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/how-metrea-hopes-to-grow-the-private-air-refueling-market/	2025-03-03T07:48:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250303_metrea_refueling_METREA_jpeg.jpg
The F-22 is having a modernization moment	A 1st Fighter Wing's F-22 Raptor from Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va. pulls into position to accept fuel from a KC-135 Stratotanker with the 756th Air Refueling Squadron, Joint Base Andrews Naval Air Facility, Md. off the east coast. It was 2 a.m. when the blast of the Klaxon rattled the halls of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, outside Anchorage, Alaska. Unidentified aircraft had approached U.S. airspace over the North Pole, and U.S. Air Force pilot John 'Schlem' Rogers – unsure whether it was real or a drill – had minutes to suit up, jump in his F-22 Raptor and investigate. Rogers can’t divulge exactly what happened that night years ago, but he did say the F-22’s low observability, high maneuverability and superior situational awareness gave him the advantage. 'Gear matters, engineering matters, quality matters,' said Rogers, director of business development in Avionics for Collins Aerospace, an RTX business. 'Knowing that the systems onboard that F-22 were going to work allowed me to take the aircraft over the most extreme parts of our planet to keep our airspace safe.' Rogers’ story shows the power of the F-22 Raptor. At times overlooked, this combat-proven, fifth-generation fighter jet is taking on new importance as the U.S. Air Force considers enhancements that could keep it ready and relevant for years to come. A Raptor renaissance Why the renewed interest? In short, the U.S. Air Force needs to supplement its F-35 fleet while plans for a new generation of fighter jet take shape. And the F-22’s capabilities – many of which come by way of RTX products and services – can meet that need. 'The Air Force and government see the F-22 as its primary stealth fighter,' said Jake Ullrich, senior program director for Advanced Products and Solutions at Raytheon, an RTX business. 'All systems on the F-22 are meant to complement each other – to maximize both the intel coming in and the actions being taken.' And better data coming in means pilots will need more sophisticated ways to see, process and act on that information. It’s why teams across RTX continue to advance cockpit technologies for the F-22 to help pilots stay ahead of the threat when a mission is changing rapidly and unfolding across several domains. Here’s a look at some of the RTX advancements that are helping the F-22 stay future-ready. The definition of air dominance Achieving air dominance means controlling the skies against enemy threats. In this role, the F-22 is often in a support position, carrying the right munitions to meet the needs of the particular mission. One of the most powerful weapons onboard is the Raytheon AIM-120 AMRAAM missile. John 'Clyde' Thayer is a 22-year U.S. Air Force veteran and former F-15C pilot who now serves as director of Air Dominance Requirements &amp; Capabilities for Raytheon. He explained why the weapons delivery capability of the F-22, along with its ability to fly fast and high, has helped earn the AMRAAM missile a reputation as the premier air dominance weapon around the world for nearly 30 years. 'When the pilot fires a missile, it is a very quick timeline for the doors to open, the missile to eject from the aircraft and the rocket motor to fire,' he said. 'At that point, the aircraft can immediately maneuver as needed to defend itself – without being detected.' The AMRAAM missile, equipped with its own guidance system, takes over from there. Thayer said recent upgrades, as part of the U.S. Air Force’s F3R (Form, Fit, Function Refresh), will bring even more processing power to the air-to-air AMRAAM guidance sections. This, in turn, will enable software improvements to take performance even higher. In particular, it will allow operators to extend the missile’s time of flight. 'We know the missile flies a lot farther than it was originally designed to,' Thayer added. 'The F3R improvements – perfectly fitted to the F-22 platform – will help us get the most out of the AMRAAM missile in the air dominance role.' The Raytheon team is ramping up production to 1,200 AMRAAM missiles a year, which will ensure the F-22 stays mission-ready. In air-to-air missions, the F-22 carries: Unlocking engine potential 'The F-22, when it starts up, has been described as a big muscle car,' said former F-22 pilot Rogers. 'It’s loud, it vibrates. As it gets into the air, it turns into a bit of a Ferrari. It’s smoother, it kind of growls. It has its own personality.' A lot of that personality comes from the two Pratt &amp; Whitney F119 engines that power the F-22, each packing 35,000 pounds of thrust. Caroline Cooper, who oversees the F119 program at Pratt &amp; Whitney, an RTX business, said the engine’s unique thrust-vectoring capability, and its capacity to fly at supersonic speeds without turning on the afterburners, have contributed to the F-22’s superior maneuverability. The F119 is the original fifth-generation fighter jet engine, and the direct predecessor of the P&amp;W F135, which powers the F-35 – another fifth-generation fighter. Cooper credits data gathered over Pratt’s long history supporting these fifth-gen platforms for driving the engine control software update that’s expected to unlock more performance potential for the F-22. The fleet software update is scheduled to begin in 2025. 'A more modern F-22 will need additional mission capacity,' said Cooper. 'That's going to require more thrust in certain parts of the design envelope, and this software update provides it.' Years of F-22 operation have also given Cooper’s team an advantage in predicting maintenance for engine parts: They can use actual, full-flight data to pinpoint when it's time for replacements. 'When we run this data through our advanced engineering algorithms, it gives us insight we can then use to extend the life of our parts,' she said. 'This means more time on wing and more cost savings for our customers.' Designed to win And more time on wing for customers translates to more mission time. This will be increasingly important, as the F-22 readies for tomorrow’s fight. Rogers, recalling his time in the cockpit, has every confidence the aircraft is up for the challenge. 'The F-22 was not designed to win 51-49,' he added. 'It was designed to win 100 to zero.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/the-f-22-is-having-a-modernization-moment/	2025-03-03T05:24:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AFA-AWS-Air-Warfare-lead-image_600x300.jpg
Firings sap NOAA office responsible for licensing remote sensing satellite firms	Planet satellite imagery shows widespread destruction in central Kahramanmaras, Turkey following the devastating 2023 earthquake. (Image courtesy of Planet Labs PBC.) WASHINGTON — Mass firings at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) have resulted in what is essentially a shut down of the unit responsible for licensing US remote sensing satellites, according to multiple sources, with license holders receiving emails notifying them all correspondence would now be handled by NOAA's Office of General Counsel. 'This is a temporary arrangement to address continuity of operations as no senior personnel remain in the office due to reductions in force,' reads a copy of the email from the Commercial Remote Sensing Regulatory Affairs (CRSRA) division seen by Breaking Defense. 'CRSRA is unable to state when this arrangement might end.' CRSRA is the division within NOAA's Office of Space Commerce responsible for regulating space-based commercial remote sensing, including work involving companies such as Planet, Maxar and BlackSky that provide imagery to the National Reconnaissance Office for use by the Defense Department for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance purposes. NOAA, in turn, is under the Department of Commerce. 'The email is correct, the Office of General Counsel will be supporting the continuity of license applications and processing for companies involved in the process,' a spokesperson for the Office of Space Commerce told Breaking Defense in an email. While it is too soon to judge the impact of the situation, if extenuated the likely outcome would be a slow down in the approval of new licenses for aspiring satellite imagery firms and of any pending license modification requests from current operators. The Trump administration began firings Thursday at NOAA, with some 800 personnel out of a total staff of some 13,000 terminated, the New York Times reported today. Among those was the head of CRSRA Sarah Brothers, sources who deal with CRSRA told Breaking Defense. 'Per our long-standing practice, we do not discuss internal personnel and management matters. NOAA remains dedicated to its mission, providing timely information, research, and resources that serve the American public and ensure our nation’s environmental and economic resilience,' the Office of Space Commerce spokesperson said. NOAA operates US weather satellites also used by the military, and has been central to research on climate change. In addition, the Office of Space Commerce sent out a notice today that it has cancelled a planned March 5 meeting of the NOAA Advisory Committee on Excellence in Space (ACES). The industry group has been active in helping the Office of Space Commerce on a number of key issues, including how to best provide oversight and management of on-orbit activities that fall between the cracks of current federal regulatory regimes. The notice, also reviewed by Breaking Defense, does not indicate whether the planned meeting would be rescheduled. However, the space-focused news outlet Payload today reported that ACES has been swept up in the cull of advisory committees mandated in a Feb. 19 Trump administration executive order seeking to slash the federal bureaucracy. Further, the head of the Office of Space Commerce's program to create a civil space traffic management regime designed to take the burden of warning non-military satellite operators of potential on-orbit crashes off DoD's shoulders, Dmitry Poisik, also has been fired, the same sources told Breaking Defense. Poisik was hired in July 2024 as the first director of the Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCCS) program, and thus fell under the Office of Personnel Management's order for termination of all federal agency 'probationary' employees. In most federal agencies, personnel who have yet to complete one full year in their job are given 'probationary' status. Nonetheless, work under the TraCCS program appears to be continuing, with the Office of Space Commerce today issuing a call for industry comment on its proposal for a new 'pathfinder' project. 'The pathfinder would investigate commercially available capabilities for the identification and cataloging of space objects immediately after their launch and deployment,' the notice explains.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/firings-sap-noaa-office-responsible-for-licensing-remote-sensing-satellite-firms/	2025-02-28T13:23:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Turkey-Earthquake-Damage-e1711045037612.jpg
The US Air Force lacks imagination, and that’s a dangerous thing	A US Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcon assigned to the 480th Fighter Squadron at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany (left), flies alongside a German air force Eurofighter Typhoon assigned to the 74th Tactical Air Wing over Germany, Feb. 16, 2023. (US Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Allison Payne) Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin has called his service to action, warning it faces a 'time of consequence' when 'the decisions we make, the actions we take' will determine if the Air Force is ready for the future fight. Deciding today what weapons, concepts and capabilities Airmen will need 10 or 20 years from now is no easy task, especially with war’s character changing rapidly. Despite what some would say, the fundamental problem is not the size of the service’s budget, but a culture that is reluctant to embrace the risks that come with innovation. This leaves the service vulnerable to technological and doctrinal surprise — something we’ve seen before, from the shock of Pearl Harbor to the aerial attacks on September 11. To meet the moment, the Air Force will need to hedge against a failure of imagination. And that means knowingly opening the service up to risk in several areas — especially around programs being allowed to fail and dollars sometimes being burned on new ideas. The Air Force, like any organization that has enjoyed enormous success, prefers to hold fast to what worked in the past, pursuing a procurement strategy that revolves around a small number of advanced, expensive platforms with long development cycles. But adding new technology to try to sustain this old way of fighting is unimaginative. The Air Force’s reluctance to embrace the near-term risks that come with innovation creates strategic risks. With Russia adapting to the battlefield in Ukraine, Iran pursuing a cost-imbalance strategy, and China pursuing the same or similar technologies as the United States, adversaries need only employ a little imagination to take the Air Force by surprise. The Air Force’s caution is understandable: If you are building something designed to last for many decades, you better get it right. Consider the venerable B-52 bomber, a platform still flying after more than 60 years, or the F-16, which remains a workhorse as it approaches its sixth decade in service. This hardware-centered mindset emphasizes perfecting a platform design before it ever reaches full production, much less the warfighter — a process that works well when change is slow and incremental — like moving from 4th to 5th generation fighters. In an age of rapid technological leaps, however, this process rewards the status quo and stifles real innovation. New capabilities or operational concepts are too easily rejected as unproven, and unprovable, ways of fighting. The Air Force — like the other services — is too often more concerned with near-term risks to budget and procurement programs than long-term strategic and operational upsides. If the United States and China ever got into a shooting war, Chinese military planners would expect the US Air Force to follow a familiar script, seeking to generate overwhelming precision effects from a smaller number of traditional fighters and bombers, supported by reconnaissance aircraft and aerial refueling tankers. After studying US military operations extensively for the last thirty years, China has honed its anti-access/area-denial playbook to counter it. Predictability is a vulnerability. And the solution lies in spreading risk. Instead of building a small number of super-expensive platforms made by a few large defense firms, the US Air Force should diversify its approach, developing a wider variety of systems in smaller numbers, with the flexibility to scale up when needed, add technology as available, and discontinue procurement of certain platforms when technology negates their benefits or capabilities. The service should also adjust and refine requirements for different mission needs and different adversary strategies. The Air Force currently upgrades platforms in blocks, periodically and incrementally adding new technology and capabilities while keeping the basic platform the same. While this approach is supposed to reduce training and sustainment costs, it prevents revolutionary change while driving up costs of sustaining an aging force. To implement this hedge strategy, the US Air Force needs to rethink its approach to procurement before it’s too late. First and foremost, adopt a shorter and less bureaucratic requirements process. The Federal Acquisition Regulation, which sets the policies and procedures governing acquisition with a focus on protecting taxpayer dollars, applies whether procurement is of a multi-million-dollar system built to last decades, or an expendable platform expected to become quickly obsolete. The upshot is that the marginal costs per unit of compliance is very high for low number, low-cost platforms, effectively discouraging innovation. The Air Force should therefore work with Congress to expand rapid and flexible acquisition authorities for lower-cost platforms, which would allow the Air Force to pursue a wider range of systems, and, after testing and evaluating them, decide whether to field them or change course. Second, the Air Force should work with Congress to allow more budget flexibility for emerging concepts and capabilities. The current process attempts to predict the future several years in advance, including what companies will be producing, what adversaries will do, and what capabilities will be available. Services have to program and plan their budgets for the Program Objective Memorandum more than two years before funds would become available, assuming the budget is approved and passed. This means a new company with an emerging capability has to wait over three years after developing it and convincing the Air Force of its value before potentially profiting. This is an eternity for new entrants, but something larger and more established companies can price into their contracts. Third, the Air Force should promote a development and procurement culture for most capabilities which encourages risk-taking over risk avoidance, signaling the value it places on innovation through promotions and budget priorities. Incentives today reward caution and punish creativity. The object is to preserve what has won fights in the past. But no one wins when high-priced legacy systems with dubious long-term advantages continue to win out over new capabilities that deliver the same or better effects at lower cost. Finally, the defense industry itself needs to change. Washington should cultivate an environment where many companies contribute to the development of airpower — not just a handful of defense giants who have an inside track because they know the rules of the game and lobby to keep those rules in place. A broader, more innovative defense market will better prepare the Air Force to create, rather than react to, the next wave of aerial surprises. A more agile, less predictable US Air Force, particularly one built around massive numbers of mobile, dispersed and lower-cost sensing, decoy, and weaponized drones (of varying capability), would simultaneously complicate both Russian and Chinese military planning. These platforms would seem similar but do different things, making it hard for the People’s Liberation Army to know which blips on the radar screen are the ones that can sink ships, which are the ones that are sensing the ships, and which are the ones — like decoys — just there for the confusion. Such surprise threatens to disrupt Chinese military plans and unbalance the PLA, giving the United States the initiative. Such diversity would also complicate Moscow’s calculus in rebuilding its military and give the United States and its NATO allies more options for deterring or defending against Russian aggression. The US Air Force has gotten comfortable with its predictability. That has to change if it is to succeed in future conflicts. Col. Maximilian K.

Warren, Duckworth probe Air Force secretary nominee on dealings with Elon Musk	Dr. Troy E. Meink, deputy Under Secretary of the Air Force for Space, answers questions during a space budget briefing March 5, 2014, at the Pentagon. (U.S. Air Force photo/Scott M. Ash) WASHINGTON—Two Democratic senators are raising alarms about Troy Meink, President Donald Trump’s nominee to lead the Air Force, following reports that Elon Musk recommended Meink for the job after he pushed a lucrative satellite contract towards Musk’s SpaceX. In a Feb. 27 letter to Meink, Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts asked Meink to disclose information about his relationship to Musk and whether Meink, in his role of principal deputy director of the National Reconnaissance Office, arranged a multibillion-dollar contract solicitation to favor SpaceX above other companies competing for the award, as reported by Reuters earlier this month. 'These reports raise concerns about your ability, if confirmed as Secretary, to treat contractors fairly and prioritize the Air Force’s mission over Elon Musk’s business interests,' wrote Duckworth and Warren, who as members of the Senate Armed Services Committee will have a role in evaluating Meink’s fitness for the Air Force secretary job. Citing seven people familiar with the contract, Reuters reported that the NRO inspector general began an investigation into Meink's role in a classified contract awarded to SpaceX in 2021 after noting changes to the program's requirements. It is unclear whether the probe is still ongoing. Duckworth and Warren said the Reuters report contained 'incredibly serious allegations of misconduct and favoritism,' noting that as Air Force secretary, Meink would be involved in key contracting decisions that involve Musk and SpaceX directly, as well as determining whether the service will move forward with a crewed sixth-generation fighter, which Musk has criticized. The senators requested answers by March 6 to a list of questions probing Meink’s dealings with Musk and SpaceX ahead of his nomination, whether Meink has ever been under investigation for his role in contracting decisions, and allegations from the Reuters report, including if he steered contracts toward SpaceX and threatened to withhold future contracts from L3Harris if it filed a protest. Warren and Duckworth's letter is the first sign of turbulence for Meink's nomination, which initially appeared set to cruise through the confirmation process before the publication of the Reuters report. Unlike Trump’s other service secretary picks, who have been relatively unknown in the national security realm, Meink is a familiar presence in the defense world, having served as deputy under secretary of the Air Force for space in the Obama administration before being tapped for the NRO job in 2020. Meink met with SASC Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., last week. Wicker's statement on the engagement makes no note of the allegations against Meink, with the senator saying that Meink 'understands that air and space power are essential to America’s military rebuild under President Trump.' SASC has not yet set a date for Meink’s confirmation hearing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/warren-duckworth-probe-air-force-secretary-nominee-on-dealings-with-elon-musk/	2025-02-28T08:19:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Meink-e1737049777778.jpg
Trump taps former Navy diver Hung Cao for service’s No. 2 civilian job	Then-US Senate candidate Hung Cao speaks during a campaign rally on November 2, 2024.

(Photo by ALLISON JOYCE/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump announced late Thursday night that he would nominate Hung Cao, a former Navy diver and immigrant from Vietnam, to be the next under secretary of the Navy. 'I am pleased to announce that Hung Cao will be our next United States Under Secretary of the Navy,' Trump wrote on Truth Social. 'Hung is the embodiment of the American Dream. As a refugee to our Great Nation, Hung worked tirelessly to make proud the Country that gave his family a home.' Cao previously deployed to Iraq, Afghanistan and Somalia as well as serving in positions at the Pentagon, Homeland Security and the FBI. In 2022, he unsuccessfully ran for a Virginia's 10th congressional seat — losing to Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton — and unsuccessfully challenged Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine in 2024. Trump's first under secretary of the Navy, Thomas Modly, served as the Navy's No. 2 civilian from December 2017 through November 2019 and then as acting SECNAV until April 2020. Cao's nomination came hours after John Phelan, Trump's nominee for Navy secretary, was on Capitol Hill for his own confirmation hearing. Phelan's hearing largely lacked any fireworks with most senators — Democrats included — focusing on the standard array of Navy topics, from improving the Navy's shipbuilding record to addressing the Pentagon's dwindling munitions stockpile. 'I think what is missing from what I can see is a sense of urgency,' Phelan said of the Navy’s shipbuilding record. 'We’re just going along and everybody — it’s Kumbaya. It’s almost as if you’re waiting for a crisis to happen to ignite things. And I think in the business of warfare, that’s a dangerous place to be. So I think why the president selected me is I will bring a sense of urgency to this. I will bring a sense of accountability to this.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-taps-former-navy-diver-hung-cao-for-services-no-2-civilian-job/	2025-02-28T05:58:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/cao-scaled-e1740749286984.jpg

(Photo by Ilia Yefimovich/Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Rafael, the Israeli company that makes Iron Dome, is creating a joint venture with US firm Kratos to produce solid rocket motors (SRMs). The new venture, called Prometheus Energetics, seeks to cash in on the growing demand for SRMs, which help power munitions of all sizes, including the Iron Dome interceptors. The companies said in a Feb. 26 statement that they have selected a 500-acre site 'near the United States Navy and Army facility in Crane, Indiana.' Kratos and Rafael said Prometheus will be controlled in an 'approximate 50/50 partnership.' The firms are investing $175 million in the new joint venture along with 'required property, plant, equipment and personnel needed for the new, state-of-the-art energetics manufacturing campus and facilities.' Production is expected to begin in 2027 after Rafael completes a technology transfer to Prometheus, with Eric DeMarco, Kratos president and CEO, saying in the statement that the company expects to provide 'tens of thousands of SRMs and casted warheads' for both the US and Israel. 'We believe Prometheus, once up and running at full rate production, will be a step function catalyst in value creation for Kratos’ stakeholders and the U.S. defense industrial base,' added DeMarco. Yoav Tourgeman, the president and CEO of Rafael, described the new investment as a 'strategic leap forward' for Rafael and its 'commitment to strengthening the U.S. defense industrial base while ensuring our allies and partners have access to the most advanced, combat-proven energetics solutions.'

He said the initiative taps business opportunities in the American market with 'with the increasing demand for energetic products, while significantly enhancing our ability to deliver resilient and reliable supply solutions to our customers.' It will strengthen supply chain independence and bolster 'critical capabilities needed to address evolving national security challenges,' he added. This is the second joint venture of this type in the US for Rafael, after it established R2S with Raytheon to produce Tamir missile interceptors in East Camden, Arkansas. It fits into a broader effort by Israel to secure its supply chains for various weapons systems that were heavily used in the recent war, both by investing domestically and looking for partners abroad. Both the Iron Dome interceptor and Rafael’s David’s Sling interceptor use solid rocket motors. David’s Sling has been sold to Finland and the US Marines have conducted live fire training integrating Tamir into the Medium Range Intercept Capability.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/rafael-kratos-team-to-produce-solid-rocket-motors-as-prometheus-energetics/	2025-02-28T05:25:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/221018_iron_dome_launch_2_GettyImages-451830874-scaled-e1666112637899.jpg
