Boeing wins Air Force contract for NGAD next-gen fighter, dubbed F-47	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) WASHINGTON — Boeing has won an Air Force contract to develop a new, sixth-generation fighter that officials emphasize will be critical to maintain America’s air supremacy over China, Breaking Defense has learned. The aerospace giant’s victory in the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program gives Boeing the opportunity to build a new fighter jet at a time when its F/A-18 line is nearing closure, a major lifeline for the company’s St. Louis facility. The win also helps boost the aerospace giant’s defense business, which has suffered billions of dollars in losses in recent years stemming from a series of ill-performing fixed-price contracts, and comes at a time when Boeing’s commercial arm is still in turmoil. Boeing bested Lockheed Martin in the NGAD competition, ending Lockheed’s status as the sole prime contractor producing stealth fighters in the West — namely the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. A third competitor, Northrop Grumman, dropped out of the competition in 2023 but is expected to compete for a new Navy fighter jet. In the decade since the existence of the program was revealed, little has come to light about the highly-secretive NGAD fighter, which is expected to enter service in the 2030s and replace the F-22. Unlike the Joint Strike Fighter competition, which played out publicly between Boeing and Lockheed in a series of flight demonstrations, the NGAD competition has taken place largely behind closed doors, aside from the Air Force's disclosure in 2020 that at least one NGAD demonstrator had flown. Dubbed a 'sixth-generation' system, officials say the jet will have cutting-edge stealth, communications and weapons capabilities. The fighter will additionally be expected to operate with the service’s forthcoming fleet of drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). General Atomics Aeronautical Systems and Anduril are competing for the separate CCA contract. Despite expectations previously laid out by the Air Force, the formal contract award for the NGAD platform failed to come to pass last year amid questions relating to its design and projected price tag. Following the results of the November election, former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall then decided to punt the decision on the platform to the Trump administration. An internal Air Force review in December subsequently validated the jet’s requirements, Breaking Defense previously reported, potentially strengthening the decision by the Trump administration to ultimately award the stealth fighter’s contract. In the time since, China has unveiled purported sixth-generation platforms, and Air Force officials have become more vocal about the need for NGAD if air superiority is going to be achieved. 'Bluntly, what this study told us is, we tried a whole bunch of different options, and there was no more viable option than NGAD to achieve air superiority in this highly contested environment,' Maj. Gen. Joseph Kunkel, the Air Force's director of force design, integration and wargaming said during a March 4 panel discussion at the AFA Warfare Symposium. Winning NGAD isn’t just a point of pride for Boeing — it will serve as a foundational part of the company's business going forward. Barring any major revisions by the Trump administration, the NGAD fighter’s per unit price is thought to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall previously described the fighter as costing 'multiples' of the F-35 and shared plans that the service was then aiming for an initial buy of 200 NGAD fighters, though that number could change. But that’s just part of the spending. Air Force budget documents say the service plans to invest billions of dollars between fiscal years 2025 and 2029 to develop the NGAD fighter, with more funds planned beyond to finish development and proceed with production. When the Air Force announced in May 2023 the goal of awarding the NGAD contract in 2024, the service said the winning vendor would enter at the engineering and manufacturing development phase.

The technology promises improved performance for features like thrust and fuel efficiency. Pratt &amp; Whitney and GE Aerospace are facing off under that separate engine development effort known as Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion, which recently saw its budget ceiling raised in a new round of contracts to both vendors. Meanwhile, the Navy is forging ahead with its own next-gen fighter that will replace the venerable F/A-18 and E/A-18 for the service's own air superiority missions. That contest is now down to Boeing and Northrop after Lockheed was knocked out of the running, Breaking Defense previously reported. Lockheed's loss in the Air Force's NGAD competition now leaves the world's largest defense contractor locked out of foreseeable sixth-generation aircraft efforts — and comes at a time when the F-35 is under new scrutiny by historic allies wary of the new Trump administration. It’s not clear whether the Air Force might pursue Kendall’s suggestions of aggressive cost savings for the stealth jet, especially as budgetary constraints may no longer be much of a factor. While Kendall indicated that some sacrifices, like reducing the complexity of the fighter’s engine, might be necessary to make the jet viable, a surge in defense spending championed by Republicans on Capitol Hill may obviate the need for such tradeoffs. It's also notable the award comes prior to the Senate confirmation of Troy Meink, who President Donald Trump has tapped to serve as Kendall's successor. According to Kendall, the F-35 program has been instructive for the Air Force, namely for what the NGAD program should not do. Specifically, Kendall — a longtime critic of the F-35, who accused the program of exhibiting 'acquisition malpractice' years ago in a previous DoD role — said in May 2023 that the government will acquire requisite intellectual property and data rights, as well as ensure the jet has a modular open systems architecture. Failing to take the same steps on the F-35, Kendall said, was a 'serious mistake' that officials have long complained allowed Lockheed too much control over the Joint Strike Fighter enterprise and fostered conditions for disappointing readiness rates. 'We’ll have a much tighter degree of government control over the future of [NGAD] than we’ve had,' Kendall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/boeing-wins-sixth-gen-fighter-ngad-air-force-lockheed-loss-trump-hegseth/	2025-03-21T08:25:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-R1-scaled-e1718985449640.jpg
Aussies buy $125 million-worth of Mk-48 torpedos to help counter ‘future threats’	Sailors assigned to the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Annapolis (SSN 760), guide a MK-48 torpedo during a weapons load, Dec. 5, 2023. (U.S. Navy Photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Nikita Custer) SYDNEY — Australia announced today it is buying $200 million AUD ($125 million USD) worth of MK-48 heavy torpedos, which the minister for defense procurement said 'will deliver a critical boost' to the country's Collins-class submarines. The minister, Pat Conroy, said the weapons — designed for anti-submarine warfare and anti-surface warfare missions — will uplift 'defensive and offensive capabilities' of the vessels and will also be fitted on Australia’s future nuclear-powered submarines. 'The continuous joint development of the MK-48 Heavy Weight Torpedo provides the Australian Navy with the latest technology to counter current and future threats,' Conroy said in a statement. 'This acquisition is a testament to Australia’s strong, long-standing alliance with the United States.' Mainly manufactured by Lockheed Martin and Science Applications International Corp (SAIC), the MK-48 is the product of a joint program between the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and United States Navy. The weapons can be used and maintained both by nations' maritime services. A defense procurement expert here, Marcus Hellyer, noted that the US Virginia-class boats — of which Australia plans to buy three — and the planned SSN-AUKUS fleet will all use these torpedoes. 'With appropriate maintenance and updates, torpedoes have a very long shelf life, so they [will] likely be for all three classes' when the aging Collins class is included, Hellyer, with the thinktank Strategic Analysis Australia, said in an email. 'Essentially you can take an RAN torpedo that has been maintained and stored at HMAS Stirling and load it into a US Navy submarine. More Mk-48 torpedoes in Australia's inventory means we can provide them to USN submarines that are part of Submarine Rotation Force-West [SRF-W].' SRF-W, part of the AUKUS plan to eventually create a fleet of Australia nuclear powered boats, is slated to begin in 2027. US Virginia-class boats and British Astute-class nuclear-powered attack subs will rotate in and out of HMAS Stirling, Australia's sub base near Perth, in Western Australia. Australia has decided to acquire the torpedoes to compensate for the glacial pace of deliveries related to other critical weapons, Hellyer suggested. 'As we've seen with the extremely slow deliveries of weapons like LRASM and JASSM-ER, it can take a long time for US guided weapons to show up as the US meets its own requirements or those of higher priority customers,' he noted. 'It's smart to get in early. Moreover, some weapons or components of weapons don't have continuous production lines, so you have to act when they are available.' The Labor Government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will soon announce the date for a federal election and that may have influenced the timing of the torpedo purchase, according to the former head of research for the Royal Australian Navy’s Sea Power Center. Elizabeth Buchanan said the announcement was made for 'pre-election spin.' Funding for the torpedoes comes from Australia's ambitious Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO), she said. Still, Hellyer said the munitions, and more like them, would have tactical benefits. 'As our strategic environment degrades, it's only smart to increase our warstocks,' he told Breaking Defense. 'The issue is not so much how many submarines we have available on any given day, but how many potential targets there are out there.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/aussies-buy-125-million-worth-of-mk-48-torpedos-to-help-counter-future-threats/	2025-03-21T07:05:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250321_DVIDS_mk48_torpedo_8380753-scaled-e1742565280280.jpg
Saltzman: Space Force in ‘pretty good spot’ regarding DoD funding shift	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman addressed the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 6, 2024. (Credit: Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said today he believes the Space Force's own priorities are well aligned with those of the Trump administration, as Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth considers an 8 percent funding realignment across the services for fiscal year 2026. 'I think in the end, what you'll see is that because our priorities were so focused on warfighting, so focused on the new emerging threats, that everybody is kind of coming to realization that we have to address, that we were pretty well aligned. We were pretty well aligned with the new administration's priorities. And so I think the Space Force is going to be in a good spot,' he told Defense One in an online interview today. Indeed, Hegseth told the Department of the Air Force Summit on Wednesday that he sees the space domain as critical to the future of warfare. 'I feel like there's no way to ignore the fact that the next and the most important domain of warfare will be the space domain,' Hegseth said. 'So, you're going to see far more investment from this administration into that domain, both offensively and defensively &#8230; because that's where we can continue to maintain an advantage.' Saltzman declined to go into any detail about what he put forward as areas for reductions in the service's budget in the 8 percent drill, but said the Space Force 'looked at what our lowest priorities were and we offered those up.' He maintained that his highest priorities for the service are space domain awareness, resilience and capabilities to 'hold at risk' adversary space assets to protect the Joint Force. He explained the fact that the US military is now 'really recognizing' that 'space is a contested warfighting domain' is what is driving the service's priorities, including a push to develop new capabilities for offensive and defensive operations. That realization, Saltzman said is 'what's new — not that a military is considering offensive and defensive operations. Militaries always conduct offensive and defensive operations to contest the domains, to meet military objectives. &#8230; We've just recently had to up our game.' He elaborated that there the service is looking at how best to invest in six categories of counterspace weapon systems, stressing that China's military already is pursuing similar capabilities. 'I talk about six categories of counter space weapons, three that are ground-based: jammers, directed energy and then kinetic capabilities, like we've seen the PRC [People's Republic of China] use with missiles attacking satellites. And then those same three categories can be done from space, from satellites on orbit: jamming and directed energy and kinetic capabilities,' Saltzman said. 'So those six categories all have to be invested in, because each one is optimized for different types of targets, whether it's low Earth orbit, whether it's in geosynchronous orbit, whether it goes out further than that,' he said. 'How much you need in each weapon is kind of what we're working through in terms of a strategy. But you really have to invest across all those. The PRC is showing us that because they're investing in all those.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/saltzman-space-force-in-pretty-good-spot-regarding-dod-funding-shift/	2025-03-20T13:38:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/RS_20241210_0067-151-scaled-e1734122255777.jpg
Trump eliminated a key space advisory committee at the worst time	Maxar Intelligence's second pair of WorldView Legion satellites launched Aug. 15, 2024 on a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Fla. (Photo credit: Maxar Intelligence) The Trump administration has made another misstep in its aggressive government spending cuts, this time targeting a crucial link between public and private sectors in the space industry. On Feb. 28, 2025, the Department of Commerce issued a stop-work order for the Advisory Committee on Excellence in Space (ACES), just days before its scheduled March 5 meeting. This decision is not just an administrative adjustment — it signals a troubling shift away from fostering public-private collaboration in a sector that is essential to both national security and America’s leadership in space. ACES was a non-authoritative advisory board comprised of 17 appointees from academia, government, and industry designed to bring together key actors across subsectors of the space industry to inform and support US space policy, regulations, and economy. While it did not have direct policy-making power, it played a critical role in ensuring that industry voices supplemented government action. It provided guidance to NOAA’s undersecretary and the director of the Office of Space Commerce on commercial space activities and offered recommendations on fostering innovation, complying with international obligations, and addressing issues like space debris and cybersecurity. Put simply, the elimination of ACES is a big mistake, as it cuts off a channel of collaboration that strengthens US space capabilities and security. A competitive commercial space industry fosters resilience and innovation. By cutting ACES, the Trump administration is taking a step backward, weakening the government’s ability to ensure that the US maintains technological superiority in space. The importance of commercial actors in national security is already well-documented. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has demonstrated how indispensable private-sector space technology can be. American commercial companies, including Maxar, Capella Space, HawkEye 360, Planet Labs, and SpaceX, have provided critical technologies, like remote sensing imagery and satellite communications, that have aided Ukraine’s defense. This reinforces the idea that cutting-edge commercial innovation and participation can make or break national security efforts. The US should learn from this and deepen its engagement with the commercial space sector, not alienate it. Building strong relationships between the US government and American companies is essential for effective technology acquisition. However, even before the elimination of ACES, it was already challenging for commercial actors to engage with the government due to strict regulations on meetings and collaboration. Removing an advisory board that facilitated dialogue only exacerbates this divide. Furthermore, this move contradicts stated space policy objectives from the first Trump administration, whose 2020 National Space Policy explicitly emphasized the importance of a 'robust, innovative, and competitive commercial space sector' as a cornerstone of US leadership in space. Cutting ACES also directly undermines this goal and Trump’s desire to build a Golden Dome, which could rely heavily on space-based capabilities. If this administration is serious about maintaining American leadership in space, why would it take an action that weakens the very partnerships necessary to achieve it? Moreover, does this decision signal a shift toward favoring a few dominant players in the industry, such as SpaceX? While SpaceX has undeniably contributed to American space dominance, an over-concentration of government contracts in a single company is risky for national security. This can be seen in the dominance of United Launch Alliance over National Security Space launches throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. With little competition in the sector, ULA was the sole provider of launch services for national security payloads, leading to high costs and a lack of innovation. It was only with the emergence of new players like SpaceX that launch prices dropped and innovation accelerated. However, we are now entering another era of domination with SpaceX conducting five out of six launches in the US. A diverse space industry ensures resilience against supply chain disruptions, technological failures, and geopolitical challenges and ACES was designed to support such diversity. The US needs a diverse and robust space industry to remain a leader in the global arena. Market concentration is already high in key space industry subsectors, including communications, remote sensing, and launch. Without mechanisms like ACES to encourage industry-wide engagement and competition, there is a risk of further consolidation. Some might argue that the Office of Space Commerce still exists, and therefore, the elimination of ACES is not a major blow. However, the Office of Space Commerce is primarily focused on leveraging the commercial space industry for economic purposes, not necessarily on fostering public-private partnerships for national security and technological advancement in space. Public-private advisory forums like ACES are rare and necessary across all industries, especially in space, where innovation and security are deeply intertwined. It is difficult to pinpoint the motivation behind the decision to eliminate ACES. Budget cuts, bureaucratic reshuffling, or shifting political priorities may all play a role. However, the reasoning behind this particular decision is less important than its consequences. What is clear is that this was a decision that will have second and third order effects for the nation’s security and the space economy. The administration should reconsider its decision and work to strengthen, rather than sever, ties between the government and commercial space actors. The stakes are too high to ignore — the future of American space leadership and national security depends on it.

An ocean away: In Paris, European defense officials confront confounding ‘new period’ in security	French soldiers from the Operation Sentinel patrol on the Trocadero Esplanade near the Eiffel Tower in Paris, on April 15, 2024. (Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA / AFP) (Photo by JULIEN DE ROSA/AFP via Getty Images) PARIS — 'The strategic environment has undergone a major change,' a senior French defense official remarked solemnly to close out the intensive three-day Paris Defence &amp; Strategy Forum, which saw senior European political and military figures gather to find their way through the new geopolitical forest last week. The official, Gen. Vincent Giraud, read remarks that had been prepared for his boss, France’s Chief of Defense Staff Gen. Thierry Burkhard, who could not make the speech himself as he was engaged in talks with French political leaders about the situation in Ukraine and the future of security in Europe — topics that nonetheless dominated the Forum agenda. Organized by the Defence Academy of the Military College (École Militaire), the Forum was opened by French Armed Forces Minister Sébatien Lecornu, who said this was 'a new period which is very complicated to explain and difficult to quantify.' 'We are not at war, but we are not at peace,' he said, referring to Russia’s aggressive behavior across Europe. He also told attendees in the packed 580-seat auditorium that 'rearmament is above all intellectual, ahead of weapons, percentages of gross domestic product, or billions of Euros.' French Defence Minister Florence Parly (R) hands over to her successor Sebastien Lecornu (L) during a ceremony at L'Hotel de Brienne in Paris, on May 20, 2022. (Photo by GEOFFROY VAN DER HASSELT/AFP via Getty Images) According to Lecornu the priority is 'to think about what the Ukrainian army should be in the future. Return to the principle that the Ukrainian army remains the first guarantor of security, and that we will refuse any form of demilitarization of Ukraine.' Beyond Ukraine and an ocean away from an American president who has threatened not to defend historical allies who do not 'pay' enough for their own defense, Lecornu urged attendees to think about the future of the Atlantic alliance. 'What will the defense of NATO’s eastern border be like next year, in five years, in 10 years, in 15 years?' he queried. 'If tomorrow the contributions of certain countries evolve downwards, how can we, Europeans, adequately execute NATO’s defense plans?' European nations must 'think in 360 degrees,' he said, to avoid being 'shortsighted.' 'We see what is close to us and deal with threats one after the other, methodically. But it’s not because we’re very preoccupied by Ukraine and Russia that we should not talk about Iran, North Korean strategies nor, more globally, of what is happening in the Indo-Pacific region,' he said. His Dutch counterpart, Ruben Brekelmans, gave the keynote speech, remarking, too, that 'Europe stands at a crossroads.' 'The threat posed by Russia is only growing. The United States has made it clear that its support for Ukraine is no longer a given,' he said. 'And Europe’s decades-long reliance on the US cannot be simply taken for granted anymore — instead it must be earned. Europe therefore needs to fortify its own security architecture.' Like Lecornu, Brekelmans said Europe was in a 'gray zone' conflict with Moscow already, with daily cyberattacks on hospitals, police and universities, espionage and preparations of sabotage, 'with Russian ships mapping our wind parks and undersea internet cables,' and 'Russian trolls flood the internet with lies and disinformation.' 'We may not be at war with Russia, but Russia is at war with us — a hybrid war,' he said, stressing that 'we should be capable of defending ourselves in both a hybrid war and a kinetic one.' With around 900 defense companies, Brekelmans said the Dutch defense industry is a substantial player in Europe and has doubled its turnover in the past three years, moving from €4.7 billion ($5.1 billion USD) in 2021 to €9.3 billion ($10.1 billion USD) in 2024, reaching the 2 percent of GDP required by NATO. Brekelmans applauded 'the fact that France is showing strong leadership together with the UK as we discuss what we could deliver in terms of safety guarantees for Ukraine,' adding that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'should not have to agree to a deal that would result in some sort of interbellum, with aggression constantly looming on the horizon. He needs to negotiate from a position of strength.' The Dutch defense minister went on to remark that 'Europe can be stronger than we sometimes think,' and 'should not downplay our relevance in the current geopolitical reshuffle of power.' 'Europe can be a force to be reckoned with — economically, militarily, morally, culturally. Let’s not be too modest about that,' he stated, adding that the European Union has over 27 member states, each with different cultures and histories, 'yet we all choose to go in the same direction: combined, we spent more on financial, military and humanitarian aid for Ukraine than the United States. And we have strong partners who join us in this direction, such as the UK and Norway.' In a press conference later, Breaking Defense asked him whether he was rethinking the kingdom’s commitment to the F-35 combat aircraft (the Netherlands has received 40 of the 52 it has ordered) in the light of rising European fears that the aircraft is far too dependent on US software updates, spare parts and maintenance support. 'I don’t think we should speculate on this,' he said, adding that the Royal Netherlands Air Force combat aircraft fleet was entirely constituted of F-35s given that its F-16s have all been gifted to Ukraine. He said the Netherlands 'wants to be part of the discussion' regarding the goal, the mandate and the security guarantees if European troops were to be sent on the ground in Ukraine. He said it should be a 'coalition of the willing, like-minded countries' including non-European Union members such as the UK and Norway. But any Dutch participation 'needs to be discussed in the (government) cabinet and then approved by parliament.' One issue for the kingdom is the shortage of personnel in its land forces. 'These must be bigger with heavier weapon systems and larger stocks,' he said. He also implied that a new NATO spending target above 2 percent of GDP might be set at the NATO summit in The Hague in June.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/an-ocean-away-in-paris-european-defense-officials-confront-confounding-new-period-in-security/	2025-03-20T07:17:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250320_paris_soldier_GettyImages-2147823934-scaled-e1742477979505.jpg
The next era of autonomous defense	Image: Courtesy of L3Harris Technologies. L3Harris has a proud legacy of autonomy spanning decades. Our deep expertise, combined with a culture of collaboration, positions us as the Trusted Disruptor in defense technology. Today, we stand on the cusp of a breakthrough moment. Autonomous systems have matured across air, sea and subsurface domains, but the challenge remains: how do we operate not just a handful, but thousands of autonomous assets simultaneously and effectively? To meet this challenge, we developed AMORPHOUS™, an open-architecture system designed to scale and manage thousands of autonomous assets at once. With AMORPHOUS, we are pushing the boundaries of autonomous control and tackling today’s most pressing challenges in large-scale autonomy. Solving the Problem of Scale Jon Rambeau, President of Integrated Mission Systems, L3Harris Technologies. The fundamental issue in modern defense operations isn’t just about technology; it’s about scale. Commanding and controlling thousands of autonomous assets in a contested environment requires more than human oversight. It demands a system that can serve as the orchestra conductor, seamlessly coordinating assets to achieve mission success. AMORPHOUS provides this capability by leveraging collaborative autonomy, enabling a leaderless swarm of systems. Instead of relying on a single asset or 'mothership' for control, AMORPHOUS allows autonomous assets to manage themselves – passing control seamlessly between platforms if one is compromised. This creates a more resilient, flexible and scalable system that can handle complex missions in dynamic environments. An Open, Collaborative Ecosystem Built on an open-architecture foundation, AMORPHOUS invites collaboration and provides adaptability, ensuring it remains flexible and responsive to future demands. At L3Harris, we recognize that the success of collaborative autonomy depends on industry-wide participation. That’s why we’ve adopted a partnership-driven approach, drawing on the expertise of both traditional and emerging tech companies. Collaborations with small, innovative tech firms, including those identified through our relationship with venture capital firm, Shield Capital, have allowed us to integrate cutting-edge solutions into AMORPHOUS. This fosters a dynamic and scalable ecosystem that avoids vendor lock and is compatible with future advancements. From Concept to Reality: Advancing Autonomous Systems Autonomous systems have long played a critical role in defense. Today, these systems are evolving from basic platform and mission autonomy to sophisticated collaborative systems, where thousands of assets independently decide how to best contribute to a mission. AMORPHOUS represents the culmination of this trend. By combining smart swarm technology – which is the ability to pass control from one asset to another seamlessly – with flexible, interoperable assets, AMORPHOUS allows warfighters to command large fleets of autonomous systems. It’s about more than just controlling drones or robots; it’s about enabling the commander’s intent through autonomy, even in complex and contested environments. Because AMORPHOUS understands controlling autonomous assets at scale, it is just as well equipped to detect, track and defeat large swarms of adversary systems. That’s why we’ve also applied AMORPHOUS to the challenge of Counter-Unmanned Air Systems, or C-UAS. Whether tasked with kinetic or non-kinetic C-UAS missions, AMORPHOUS optimizes asset positioning – such as electro-optical, infrared sensors, radar and high-powered microwave systems – allowing for the most effective outcomes. This system-of-systems methodology enables AMORPHOUS to take on some of the Department of Defense’s most dangerous tasks, ultimately reducing risks to operators and enhancing operational efficiency. A Future-Proof Solution for Modern Warfare AMORPHOUS represents the next chapter in autonomous systems, pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in defense technology. But this isn’t just a vision for the future – it’s happening today. Through active contracts with the U.S. Army and the Defense Innovation Unit, we are demonstrating AMORPHOUS’ real-world applicability in complex operational environments. Successful government-managed tests, involving multiple assets across different domains and vehicle types, showcase the platform’s ability to address the evolving needs of modern warfare. As the Trusted Disruptor, L3Harris remains committed to delivering innovative, scalable solutions that address the changing demands of our customers. AMORPHOUS is a tool for today’s defense needs, and it’s a future-proof solution designed to adapt to the challenges of tomorrow. Jon Rambeau is President of the Integrated Mission Systems segment at L3Harris Technologies. Jon leads an extensive portfolio of solutions including autonomy, reconnaissance, electro optics, aviation and power distribution. With customers’ mission-critical needs always in mind, L3Harris delivers end-to-end technology solutions connecting the space, air, land, sea and cyber domains in the interest of national security.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/the-next-era-of-autonomous-defense/	2025-03-20T05:24:48-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Amorphous_Scalability_OpEd_600x300_1.jpg
Space Force unveils multi-front push to fix its Unified Data Library	Path of the debris from Russia's Nov. 15, 2021 ASAT missile test over the first 24 hours after impact with the Soviet-era Cosmos 1408 satellite, according to COMSPOC. (COMSPOC/CSSI volumetric analysis, with rendering by AGI, an Ansys Company) WASHINGTON — The smallest military service has a big problem with its data, but a new strategy document released Wednesday lays out a multi-point approach to finally fixing the Unified Data Library. The UDL was created in 2019 with a contract to startup Bluestaq to pool commercial information on objects in space, from dangerous debris to foreign satellites. So far, however, the project has failed to integrate that data with the computer systems Space Force units actually use to monitor the increasingly crowded heavens, as Space Force officials have themselves acknowledged. Now, in the newly released Data &amp; Artificial Intelligence FY 2025 Strategic Action Plan [PDF], the Space Force has revealed its plan to convert the slow-moving project into a formal Program of Record — using the streamlined Software Pathway (SWP) favored by new Defense Secretary Peter Hegseth — and implement a long litany of improvements. That said, the UDL is not the only focus in the 12-page plan. The document also touches on topics from institutional culture and 'digital fluency' to generative AI and rigorous evaluation of Large Language Models. It lists both vague aspirational goals, like 'continue research into emerging topics,' and a litany of specific action items for fiscal 2025, from co-hosting the classified AI Space conference with the NRO (which happened in January) to establishing a multi-layered system of policy governance bodies. RELATED: 5 Chinese satellites practiced ‘dogfighting’ in space, Space Force says But the main recurring theme throughout the Strategic Action Plan is improving UDL, which comes out over and over again — and in some of the most specific to-do items with the hardest deadlines. The first of these (item 3.1.1) was to change UDL to a Software Pathway program. That’s a streamlined acquisition process, devised under the first Trump administration in 2019 and heavily promoted by Hegseth in the early days of the second Trump administration. It aims to imitate the rapid development and adaptation of commercial software, rather than bog down coding projects in procedures devised for industrial age arms programs. Transitioning to an SWP involves officially registering UDL as such with the Office of the Secretary of Defense, along with collecting and reporting the necessary metrics and cost estimates. As space acquisition chief Frank Calvelli previewed last year, the plan also says 'the UDL prototype [will transition] to an established program of record,' which would institutionalize it and establish it firmly in the service’s long-term acquisition plans. (The plan's deadline for these two action items has actually passed, but a spokesperson for the Space Force confirmed Thursday morning that both transitioned last fall, on Nov. 13.) But there's plenty more to come. Among other UDL tasks, various Space Force sub-commands are directed to: Other action items don’t specifically mention the Unified Data Library, but are inextricably intertwined with it. That includes increasing collaboration with the Commercial Space Office — the Space Force’s chief link to the private-sector providers feeding UDL — and 'identify[ing additional] commercial datasets,' for which the logical destination would be UDL. All told, the Strategic Action Plan lays out an ambitious and comprehensive strategy to get UDL on track this year — assuming funding battles and changing administration priorities don’t get in the way.

GOP defense appropriators spell out CR funding levels for weapons. Will the DoD listen?	Sailors, assigned to Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 147, spin up an F-35C Lightning II for maintenance operations on the flight deck of Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS George Washington (CVN 73) while underway in the Pacific Ocean, June 14, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class August Clawson) WASHINGTON — The leaders of the Senate and House Appropriations defense subcommittees have sent detailed funding tables to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, laying out how they believe the money in the fiscal 2025 continuing resolution should be spent, including on more F-35 fighter jets, C-130s and UH-60 helicopters, according to documents obtained by Breaking Defense. Included with a letter from Rep. Ken Calvert and Sen. Mitch McConnell, who chair the defense appropriations subcommittees, are 181 pages of funding tables that closely resemble the budget documents in line with the traditional appropriations process, spelling out the details of spending increases and cuts to each line item. 'The enclosures serve as the first step in consultation with the Department. We will make our staffs available to ensure Congressional intent is understood,' Calvert and McConnell wrote. Funding tables are typically laid out in a report accompanying an appropriations bill, but because these are not connected to the FY25 CR, they may not be legally binding, said Todd Harrison, a budget analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. 'In any prior administration, this letter would have been significant, and I think DoD would have, by default, tried to adhere to it. I think this administration has a very different view on executive power, and I don't think that they will pay much regard to this letter at all,' he said. Congress passed the yearlong CR last week. Here are the highlights of how Congressional appropriators would spend the funds included in the CR: The funding tables add $240 million for MQ-1C Gray Eagle drones and $60 million for an additional UH-60 Black Hawk for the Army National Guard. In the area of counter-unmanned aerial systems, lawmakers boosted overall funding from $117 million to $302 million, replacing a budget line specifically to buy Coyote launchers and interceptors with a general counter-UAS launchers and interceptors line that will allow the Army greater flexibility. Vehicle procurement was a mixed bag, with overall funding for the Paladin Integrated Management program increased from about $417 million to $568 million. However, the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle funding was cut from $515 million to $381 million. The funding tables also include some cuts to UAS efforts, decreasing funding for a 'future UAS family' by $5.8 million and for small drones by $26 million. Overall, Army munitions funding fell from $6.2 billion to slightly less than $6 billion. Funding for the service’s Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 decreased from almost $658 million to $552 million due to what lawmakers deemed as 'unjustified' spending on IDDS-A logistics support and 'excess pricing' on AIM-9X missiles, among other cuts. Its long-range hypersonic weapon program also suffered a $75 million funding decrease, and funds for the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor were cut by $129 million to a total of $387 million. Procurement and advanced procurement of the Precision Strike Missiles fell by a combined $35 million. Lawmakers also cut spending for the Javelin program by $102 million, citing 'unit cost increases' and a program adjustment. Changes to the shipbuilding accounts were previously spelled out in the language of the CR itself, which means that the Pentagon will be required to spend as Congress demanded. The biggest boost was the addition of $1.5 billion for a third Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer and a $1 billion cut to the Constellation-class frigate. It also adds $480 million for three ship-to-shore connectors and reduces funding for a medium landing ship to only about $30 million. Compared to the Department of the Navy’s FY25 request, GOP appropriators want to add $524 million for four additional F-35Cs while at the same time making about $210 million in other cuts to the F-35B and F-35C programs due to 'unjustified growth' in engineering costs and excess support costs. The tables increase the CH-53K account by $125 million to buy an additional helicopter for the Marine Corps and adds $261 million for two additional KC-130Js for the Navy Reserve. However, the MQ-25 tanker drone takes a major hit, with the program’s $501 million for procurement of three aircraft whittled down to $50 million. Justification documents state that the funding for low-rate initial production aircraft was 'ahead of need.' Funding for key munitions accounts also decreased in the funding tables. Standard Missile procurement funds fell from $627 million to about $525 million. The AMRAAM program took a cut of $88 million, while spending on the Joint Air to Ground Missile (JAGM) fell from almost $77 million to $55 million. Air Force aircraft procurement got a modest boost in the funding tables, with lawmakers adding funds for two additional F-35A jets even as they made about $182 million in cuts for 'unjustified growth.' The tables would increase funding for C-130Js by $411 million to provide additional aircraft for the Air National Guard, and adds $200 million for two HH-60W combat rescue helicopters. GOP appropriators spell out their intent to zero out a request for an additional C-40 aircraft citing a 'lack of acquisition strategy,' and also cuts about $75 million from the KC-46 program for an unspecified program delay and other unjustified costs. Lawmakers also buzzed the B-21 Raider program with an almost $78 million cut for a 'classified adjustment.' Like the other services, munitions procurement accounts were pared back, with almost $58 million less for AMRAAM missiles, about $21 million less for the Stand-In Attack Weapon, a cut of about $6 million for Small Diameter Bomb IIs, and cuts of about $5 million each for the Joint Air Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM) and AIM-9X. Several major research and development efforts took major cuts in the funding tables. Lawmakers hope to scale back funding for the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance fighter jet by $325 million, while its Collaborative Combat Aircraft drone program was cut by $70 million. Lawmakers would also cut about $143 million from the VC-25B program, which will build new presidential airlift known colloquially as Air Force One, as well as decrease funds for Survivable Airborne Operations Center (SAOC) planes by $70 million — though the program may receive the funds it needs to press forward after prime contractor SNC previously warned Breaking Defense of the potential for a delay. Procurement funding for the Space Force fell by more than $300 million, with the largest cut in the funding tables being a $246 million hit to classified 'special space activities.' Funding for national security space launch fell by $78 million, and lawmakers also cut funding for FAB-T terminals by $24 million. The service’s research and development account, while decreasing only slightly overall from $18.7 billion to $18.5 billion, included some cuts to key programs. Various budget lines associated with the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (OPIR) program, including ground stations and satellites, were cut by about $181 million. GOP appropriators slashed the Resilient Missile Warning and Missile Tracking – Medium Earth Orbit program by $170 million. They also decreased funding for the Evolved Strategic Satcom effort by $128 million and cut the Protected Tactical Service program by $92 million. However, they would add $40 million for commercial satellite services to provide tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking (TacSRT) — the subject of ongoing tug of war with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

Playing it SAFE? New EU spending plan leaves US out in the cold	Kaja Kallas, Vice President of the European Commission addresses media at the unveiling of the White Paper for European Defence (European Commission) BELFAST — The European Union has excluded the US from accessing a new €150 billion ($163 billion) Security Action for Europe (SAFE) funding package proposal as it charts a path toward greater strategic autonomy, rearmament at pace and less reliance on Washington for weapons. The SAFE initiative sits within the wider Readiness 2030 program announced by the European Commission today. It involves raising the new funding through 'capital markets' and then redistributing it to member states through loans based on demand and national equipment plans, according to a Commission statement. 'SAFE will allow Member States to immediately and massively scale up their defence investments through common procurement from the European defence industry, focusing on priority capabilities,' it adds. 'This will contribute to ensuring interoperability, predictability, and reducing costs for a strong European defence industrial base.' Joint SAFE procurements require involvement from at least two countries, one of whom must be a EU member. Eligibility is extended beyond EU members to Ukraine, European Free Trade Association (EFTA) countries — comprising of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland — and European Economic Area (EEA) nations. Alongside the US, the UK has been excluded from participation. 'What we see … with Ukraine, if they use weapons that are not produced in Ukraine and sometimes there are limitations on how you can use those weapons … in terms of crisis, your military needs to really have free hands,' said Vice President of the European Commission Kaja Kallas at a press conference in Brussels, hinting at unease over the utility of foreign weapon systems at a time when some European capitals are raising questions about the operational independence of high profile US aircraft like Lockheed Martin's F-35 fifth-generation fighter jet. SAFE funding makes up a sizeable portion of the wider €800 billion ReArm Europe package, the rest of which the EU plans on delivering over four years through a national defense escape clause that exempts deficit calculations for member states' individual defense budgets, up to a maximum of 1.5 percent GDP. Under the weight of Russian aggression and US pressure, the EU also delivered a new defense white paper today [PDF] focused on how to close capability gaps, make its industrial base stronger, build up support for Ukraine and 'urgently ramp up' readiness by the end of the decade. The pace of 'traditional allies and partners,' including the US, pivoting away from Europe is 'happening faster than many had anticipated,' warns the paper. The paper's release comes amid President Donald Trump's pro-Russia signaling, along with his calling on the continent to take greater ownership of its security, recently pausing US military aid and intelligence sharing for Ukraine, threatening to annex Greenland, and expressing his dislike of NATO. Air and missile defense systems, ammunition, counter unmanned aerial systems (C-UAS), drones, and electronic warfare equipment are among conventional capability gaps that the white paper targets, alongside emerging technologies like AI and quantum computing. The gaps also include 'strategic enablers' such as air-to-air refueling and airlift aircraft. 'Capability gaps can be closed through the acquisition of capabilities for high-intensity warfare in line with EU and NATO capability processes,' outlines the strategy document. 'The scale, cost and complexity of most projects in these areas go beyond' the capacity of individual member states. 'Thus, coordinated action benefiting from support of the whole EU toolbox would facilitate cost-effective procurement and prompt the ramp-up of European defence industrial capacity, strengthening our technological base including defence technology innovation.' Despite the clear-eyed focus on how to resolve capability shortages, the white paper does not spell out which joint flagship projects will go ahead. Industry has repeatedly called for the EU to roll out such programs and put sizeable funding toward them in order to dramatically strengthen military manufacturing across the continent. Instead, the document proposes a 'set of Defence Projects of Common European Interest,' the type of which will be decided by member states at a later date. Andrius Kubilius, European Commissioner for Defence and Space told reporters that the European Council has a 'goal' to present common defense project 'options' to member states around June, though he did not indicate which options are under consideration. The white paper also counts on collaborative programs to drive 'economies of scale' and accelerate equipment delivery times. 'In turn, this will boost the production capacity of [the] European defence industry,' it adds. Kubilius also said he 'didn't want to get stuck on numbers' over exact defense spending targets for EU members as a GDP percentage figure, though he suggested that above 2 percent GDP is in line with a 'new level of ambition.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/playing-it-safe-new-eu-spending-plan-leaves-us-out-in-the-cold/	2025-03-19T12:44:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/P066064-725765-scaled-e1742408615869.jpg
How to maximize the resiliency of PNT	The GPS constellation that provides positioning, navigation and timing signals to the US military and civilians around the world, is made up of 31 active satellites. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images) Military leaders have long recognized the need to improve the resilience of the Global Positioning System (GPS), due to its essential role providing positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) services for joint operations. But there is neither a comprehensive Department of Defense strategy nor one official assigned to ensure PNT resilience and finish GPS modernization, resulting in an uncoordinated cornucopia of service-level puzzle pieces that might not exactly fit together, putting at risk assured military PNT access during a conflict. To minimize this risk, DoD needs to consolidate responsibilities for the PNT architecture into one role and create a comprehensive strategy, with two focus points. First, pushing the department to complete current GPS modernization efforts as quickly as possible, and second, prioritize and harmonize the various service-level efforts to develop and integrate PNT alternatives, with emphasis on ones that do not rely on satellites, as backups. This approach would also present opportunities for cost-benefit analyses of service-level programs, identifying those where the juice is not worth the squeeze and which could be cut. Today, GPS access is critical to joint operations, but access to GPS is threatened by a variety of counterspace weapons, with signal jammers being a persistent and prevalent threat. Disrupting GPS would force a platoon of marines to navigate by a compass and map, the same method used by their great-grandfathers on Iwo Jima and by their great-great-grandfathers at Belleau Wood. Crewed fixed-wing aircraft, helicopters, tanks, Humvees, drones, destroyers and aircraft carriers all depend on GPS signals for navigation. Smart munitions and missiles cannot operate effectively in GPS-denied environments. The Pentagon is hardly unaware of this risk, which is why for years, the military has been modernizing GPS around a more jam-resistant GPS signal, called M-code, and improved cybersecurity. But while the Space Force is already launching new GPS satellites, though three have been sitting in storage on the ground since being built by their manufacture, it is late finishing the ground segment. Additionally, other service branches, who are responsible for making sure hundreds of weapon systems have new M-code receivers, have faced procurement and integration delays. These ground segment and receiver delays leave GPS modernization incomplete and the military unable to fully benefit from the new system. It might seem obvious to focus on finishing current upgrade efforts, but the Space Force is spending money on a new satellite constellation to provide GPS 'lite' services with unclear benefit over full-blown GPS. This initiative, called Resilient GPS (R-GPS), which would cost around $1 billion over five years, envisions about 20 satellites offering a subset of full GPS functions. Congressional appropriators questioned how the new satellites would mitigate jamming threats and observed that the effort does not address the delays in fielding jam-resistant M-code compatible equipment. The department needs to double down its focus on bringing M-code fully online, rather than getting distracted by efforts like R-GPS. That’s mission number one. And yet, there is a real reason to pursue true GPS alternatives, and those efforts need to be coordinated in their early infancy. But there is no cross-service strategy to manage these programs and no DoD-wide approach to measure success or determine priorities. The Air Force, Army, and Navy are developing systems that use onboard inertial sensors and clocks, equipment not reliant on external signals, to navigate and keep time. The services are also experimenting with systems that use celestial or magnetic navigation, terrestrial image navigation, or non-GPS signals, like TV broadcast towers sending PNT signals. Alternatives like these that do not rely on satellites are important given concerns that certain counterspace weapons could make parts of space unusable for an amount of time. Ideally, the DoD would have a plan for PNT resilience that recognizes the criticality of GPS and its modernization, while balancing that recognition with the need to develop non-GPS alternatives, especially ones that do not rely on space access. Without any doubt, at the center of that plan should be GPS, particularly efforts to complete GPS modernization and unlock the power of the M-code jam-resistant signal. Though the Space Force has a central role in completing GPS modernization, the other services have responsibilities too, specifically for new user equipment. The plan also needs to include non-GPS alternatives, specifically ones that do not rely on satellites. The next question is who should be responsible for developing such a plan. Pentagon officials already have cross-service PNT mandates. The DoD’s PNT Oversight Council is charged with performing a coordinating, architecting, and oversight role, while the DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) is responsible for PNT policy. But this approach is somewhat unwieldy because it means the PNT enterprise is managed and architected by committee, leaving no one official responsible (i.e., where the buck stops here) for optimizing PNT resilience. Giving such a role to the CIO makes little sense. Launching and flying satellites and building technologies that navigate using the Earth’s magnetic field are very different than running mainframe computers and cloud datacenters, operations of more day-to-day concern for the CIO. To fix this, DoD should consider consolidating the resource prioritization and architecting functions of the PNT Oversight Council and policy responsibilities of the DoD CIO into a new role. Given the importance of PNT to joint operations, such an official should report to the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, where Pentagon resource management, planning, and policy functions already reside. This approach would make the new role responsible for an overall PNT blueprint but leave acquisitions to each service, who also operate and use PNT capabilities. Rather than disband the PNT Oversight Council, it should be retained to provide direction and advisement for this new role. This structure would somewhat mirror how DoD handles the nuclear command, control, and communications (NC3) system. In that case, the NC3 Enterprise Center is responsible for maintaining a DoD-wide NC3 architecture, leaving the acquisition and operation of its elements to the services. A consolidated PNT architecting, resource prioritization, and policy function would also be well-placed to look across the services and assess which programs are worth the cost and which are mere distractions, taking away funding and resources that could be better used for other PNT resilience efforts. No one should doubt that today’s adversaries have GPS in their crosshairs, particularly with sophisticated jamming systems. But today, there is no one entity at DoD taking responsibility for making sure all the PNT puzzle pieces fit together. That needs to change. The Pentagon needs a cross-service 'one stop shop' (i.e., one official and not a committee) with responsibility for developing priorities and a blueprint that ensures military PNT resilience and access. Though a modernized GPS, which must be finished as soon as possible, is undeniably the star of the show, other non-space PNT alternatives have important supporting roles to play.

Space Force declares upcoming symposium ‘mission essential,’ amid Trump travel restrictions	US SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting addresses Space Symposium 2024. (Space Foundation via Flickr) WASHINGTON — The US Space Force has taken steps to ensure Guardians and civilian leaders are able to attend this year's April 7-10 Space Foundation Space Symposium in Colorado Springs, Colo., in the wake of the Trump administration's Feb. 26 executive order restricting 'non-essential' travel by federal officials that negatively impacted other recent aerospace trade shows. A March 17 memo from Space Force Staff Director Maj. Gen. Stephen Whitney, obtained by Breaking Defense, declares 'travel for the 40th Space Symposium to be mission essential for speakers, moderators, panelists, and other senior leaders with scheduled industry engagements.' In addition, the memo notes that because the nonprofit Space Foundation is providing free tickets to Guardians, local service personnel may attend as long as they pay for their own commuting costs to The Broadmoor resort where the Symposium is held each year. Whitney bases his decision on the importance of the meeting, arguably the world's largest space-related space expert gathering, for 'driving extensive collaboration' among officials from the United States and many other countries across the spectrum of space activities. 'The 40th Space Symposium is an annual event hosted by the Space Foundation and is a premier space gathering that uniquely attracts the entire breadth of the space community. This includes senior officials from the United States and other countries representing military, civil, intelligence and industry perspectives. The Space Symposium is where these space experts share groundbreaking ideas to inform critical space strategies. Additionally, Space Symposium provides a unique forum to build partnerships to secure the future of space warfighters with our allied partners,' Whitney wrote. He further stressed that past symposiums 'have proven successful because the participating Guardians were co-located with the other United States and international officials from government and industry.' The justifications for the 'mission essential' exemptions allowing travel and attendance were based on two Department of the Air Force memos designed to implement the Trump executive order and comply with cost-cutting measures being imposed by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, as well as subsequent March 5 travel guidance [PDF] from the Office of the Secretary of Defense: Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and US Space Command Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting are among the top brass slated to give keynote speeches at the symposium.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/space-force-declares-upcoming-symposium-mission-essential-amid-trump-travel-restrictions/	2025-03-19T09:42:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240410_whiting_keynote_space_symposium_space_foundation-e1712757057987.jpg
UAE defense giant EDGE Group joins forces with French firm CMN NAVAL	Emirate conglomerate EDGE Group had perhaps the largest exhibit of any company at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — UAE defense giant EDGE Group has launched an Abu Dhabi-based joint venture (JV) with French shipbuilding firm CMN NAVAL — dubbed AD NAVAL (ADN) — for the manufacturing of small- and 'mid-size naval vessels.' 'Leveraging an existing order pipeline worth approximately EUR 7 billion, the JV will bring together both companies under an exclusivity agreement on the segment of high value small to mid-size naval vessels including Corvettes, Offshore Patrol Vehicles (OPVs), High-speed Interceptors, Trimarans, and Landing Craft. The move will see EDGE significantly expand the scope of its capabilities in the naval domain,' EDGE said today in a statement. The Emirati firm holds a 51 percent stake of the JV, and will 'establish a design bureau which will assume intellectual property rights for all future designs,' according to the announcement. Existing non-NATO orders will be transferred to the JV as well. This JV follows an initial agreement signed during Emirati defense expo IDEX in February, where the two firms announced they will 'jointly pursue opportunities that will significantly expand their capabilities and market reach across the naval domain.' Recently, EDGE Group has focused on international investments, specifically in Latin America and Europe. This is also not the first time EDGE has signed a JV involving non-NATO contracts. Last May, EDGE and Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri signed a JV dubbed Maestral in which EDGE was awarded the prime rights to Fincantieri's non-NATO contracts. With ADN, EDGE said it will gain access to CMN NAVAL's global supply chain and integrated logistics support system and software. Additionally, EDGE will be able to begin integrating its weapons systems onto the ships produced as part of the JV. 'The scope of our collaboration with CMN, which is particularly strong in EDGE’s key focus markets in Africa, for example, will enable us to combine our expertise, and to share technology and know-how in the naval domain to build superior vessels in the UAE,' EDGE Group’s CEO and Managing Director Hamad Al Marar said in the statement. (In 2023, EDGE announced a $1.1 billion contract to provide ships to the Angolan navy.) Al Marar added that the JV will enable EDGE to develop cross-complementary integration programs for a number of weapons, radars and systems 'onto the vessels being manufactured for non-NATO navies around the world.' Chairman of CMN NAVAL Pierre Balmer said in the statement that 'this partnership not only strengthens our presence in key international markets but also paves the way for enhanced technology transfer, industrial cooperation, and job creation. Together, we look forward to setting new benchmarks in the industry and driving sustainable growth in the defence and maritime sectors.' Al Marar told Breaking Defense in February that the firm's plan 'is to continuously grow. Our plan is to grow internationally. Our plan is to see how we can establish alliances with countries outside the UAE.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/uae-defense-giant-edge-group-joins-forces-with-french-firm-cmn-naval/	2025-03-19T08:15:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/img_5477-scaled-e1739816889511.jpg
Australia, Canada announce $4B over horizon radar agreement	An aerial view of a Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) transmitter site at Laverton, Western Australia. JORN is a network of three over-the-horizon radars that can detect aircraft and ships between 1,000 and 3,000 km from the northern coastline of mainland Australia. (Australian MoD) SYDNEY — Australia is poised for its largest defense sale ever, exporting its Jindalee Operational Radar Network (JORN) to Canada, at a cost estimated at more than $6 billion CAN ($4 billion USD). In a surprise development, Canada's new prime minister, Mark Carney, spoke with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese overnight and decided to buy the radar, according to government statements. The United States and Australia had been in talks about the over the horizon network, but Canada now appears to have leapt over America's head, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), which first reported the story. 'Today, I'm announcing that our government will be working with our long-standing defence and security partner Australia to build a new, long-range, over-the-horizon military radar system,' said Carney. '[It] will enable Canada to detect and respond to both air and maritime threats over our Arctic both faster and from further away. It will most fundamentally keep all Canadians safe.' An official statement from Carney's office described JORN as 'a key component of Canada’s NORAD modernization plan' to detect and deter threats across the country's vast northern reaches. 'Collaboration with Australia on this critical technology,' the statement says, 'will further deepen our long-standing bilateral defense relationship, while supporting Canada’s commitment to strengthening North American defenses in partnership with the United States.' Albanese confirmed the discussions during a press conference today but did not provide any details. 'There's a lot of water to go under the bridge here,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters this morning in the northern Queensland city of Cairns, 'but in collaborating with Canada in relation to this technology and working closely with them, what is in prospect here is the single biggest defense industry export from Australia in our history. So this is a really, really big opportunity for the nation.' Marles also said Australia still hopes the United States will purchase JORN technology. BAE Systems Australia is managing a $1.2 billion AUD upgrade to the system, known as the Phase 6 upgrade, which involves hardware and software enhancements as well as sustainment support out to 2028, according to company literature. JORN monitors sea and air across 37,000 square kilometers, up to 3,000 km away. Unlike traditional radar, which sends a signal and then reads back the return, JORN bounces its signal off the ionosphere, making possible its much greater range. Jindalee, the system's original name, is an aboriginal word for a place the eye cannot see. Notably, Albanese pointed to the importance of Australia diversifying its trade relationships. While he didn't mention the tariffs President Donald Trump has ordered on Australia, there has been increasing discussion here about the solidity of the alliance and the relationship between the two treaty allies. 'It's important that we develop that diverse series of relationships and Canada is a very important one, we have so much in common,' he said.

Despite war, Israel’s IAI hits record backlog for orders, sees IPO as ‘essential’: CEO	Visitors stand on the booth of the Israeli defense technology company Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) at the Eurosatory international land and airland defence and security trade fair, in Villepinte, a northern suburb of Paris, on June 13, 2022. (Photo by EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Executives from Israel Aerospace Industries said recently their company saw a record gross income in 2024 and has a higher-than-ever backlog of orders — mostly from abroad. In a briefing at IAI’s offices with reporters in central Israel on March 13, the company’s President and CEO Boaz Levy and CFO Eran Anchikovsky discussed the company’s growth last year and its future plans. Levy pointed to an order backlog of $25 billion, a record for the company, while the value of new orders has jumped nearly $7 billion in the past six years. Levy said that about 80 percent of revenue comes from overseas exports. 'Every leader in the world these days knows that they must protect their population from future wars,' Levy said. 'What we see is that the wars are not being done on frontiers, they are in cities. We see a growth in defense requirements all over the world. Europe is having a change.' RELATED: MBDA CEO sees &#8216;moment of truth' for European defense, as firm sets order record The uptick in business comes despite — or galvanized by — Israel’s experience in the multi-front war sparked by Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack. IAI makes the Arrow air defense system, the highest tier of Israel’s multi-layered air defense system, which together has helped defend the homeland against rockets, drones and missiles fired on Israel by Hamas in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Hezbollah in Lebanon and, in two instances, directly from Iran. RELATED: What it was like on the ground during Iran's attack on Israel Levy said that despite the unprecedented conditions of the war, the company did not institute force majeure and break contracts with client abroad. Instead it sought to fulfill its obligations, such as an Arrow sale to Germany, which was finalized in November 2023. 'We have escalated our manufacturing lines, support and maintenance,' Levy said. The next step for IAI, as Levy sees it, is to take the company public with an initial public offering, something he’s previously pushed. 'It’s essential for Israel and the company,' he said. 'I believe it will happen.' Anchikovsky noted that an IPO could bring the company untapped potential, raising money and taking advantage of the opportunity the company's current strong balance sheet provides. Currently IAI is one of Israel’s three giant defense companies, along with Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems. Elbit is the only company that is publicly traded; the other two are government-owned companies. In December Levy said IAI was awaiting government approval for an IPO, and last week he acknowledged that Israeli leaders have other pressing issues as the military remains in engaged on multiple fronts. (On Monday, days after the executives’ comments, Israel launched a wave of deadly strikes on targets in Gaza, marking a violent crumbling of a fragile ceasefire.) Elsewhere during the visit to IAI on March 13, the company showcased several projects underway, including the D-9 bulldozer that the company has converted to autonomous operations. The D-9 is a principal platform used by the IDF’s engineering corps in Gaza to clear areas and has been used in the West Bank and Lebanon. However, D-9s are slow and cumbersome and have limited armor or defenses against drones, improvised explosive devices or missiles. As such, making them autonomous 'saved lives,' said one IAI official who was not named for security reasons. RELATED: For Israel, Gaza conflict is evolutionary ground for robotic vehicles The autonomous D-9 is made possible by adding cameras, sensors and LiDAR to the vehicle. The system enables it to plan missions and drive through waypoints. It also conducts route-finding itself to move to the most optimum path during its mission and can do its own collision avoidance. In one demonstration, the bulldozer drove in a circle through dirt and amongst trees and along a wall. The user interface was a kind of workstation that is man-packable and includes a joystick, similar to a game controller, to drive it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/despite-war-israels-iai-hits-record-backlog-for-orders-sees-ipo-as-essential-ceo/	2025-03-19T01:55:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240531_israel_eurosatory_GettyImages-1241281555-scaled-e1717169925705.jpg
5 Chinese satellites practiced ‘dogfighting’ in space, Space Force says	Vice Chief of Space Operations Gen. Michael Guetlein speaks at the McAleese Defense Programs Conference in Washington, D.C., March 7, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — US 'near peer' adversaries are 'practicing dogfighting' in space to simulate orbital combat in yet another step up their wide-ranging effort to develop capabilities to deny, disrupt, degrade and/or destroy US space capabilities, the Space Force's second in command warned today. Gen. Michael Guetlein, vice chief of space operations, told the McAleese annual Defense Programs Conference that commercial partners had provided space situational awareness data to the Space Force on a demonstration involving coordinated moves of five different satellites. 'There are five different objects in space maneuvering in and out around each other, in synchronicity and in control. That's what we call dogfighting in space. They are practicing tactics, techniques and procedures to do on-orbit space operations from one satellite to another,' he explained. And while Guetlein did not specify which countries five satellites were involved, a Space Force spokesperson later told reporters that the demonstration was Chinese. 'Gen. Guetlein referenced Chinese satellite maneuvers observed in space. China conducted a series of proximity operations in 2024 involving three Shiyan-24C experimental satellites and two Chinese experimental space objects, the Shijian-6 05A/B. These maneuvers were observed in low Earth orbit. These observations are based on commercially available information,' the spokesperson said in an email to Breaking Defense. RELATED: US, China, Russia test new space war tactics: Sats buzzing, spoofing, spying A representative of Colorado-based space tracking firm LeoLabs confirmed that the company had observed the Chinese demonstration of what are known in the space community as rendezvous and proximity operations (RPO) using its network of ground-based radar — as well as another, ongoing case involving Russian satellites. 'The Russians are right in the middle of a three-spacecraft RPO,' the LeoLabs rep added. Both countries in the past have demonstrated RPO ability with two spacecraft moving closely around each other in LEO, raising Defense Department concerns. US officials have said that China further has been using several satellites to stalk US government and commercial satellites stationed in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). But the demonstrations of the ability to synchronize movements of several satellites at once are relatively new, piling on to a long list of growing adversary space capabilities that Guetlein said require the Space Force to step up its game 'to deter and, if necessary, defeat aggression' in the heavens. 'The environment has completely changed. There used to be a capability gap between us and our near peers, mainly driven by the technological advancement of the United States. That capability gap used to be massive. That capability gap is significantly narrowing, and we've got change the way we're looking at space or that capability gap may reverse not be in our favor anymore,' Guetlein stressed. And while the term dogfighting brings to mind scenes from Star Wars with Rebel Alliance X-Wing and Y-Wing starfighters zipping in and out among the Empire's sporty TIE Fighters, in reality the laws of physics put heavy constraints on the speed of any future satellite-to-satellite warfare. Space war will be slow, with satellite maneuvers often taking hours, days or even weeks. That said, Guetlein's use of the evocative air warfare term highlights the Space Force's escalating rhetoric about the need for the service to improve its capabilities to establish 'space superiority' in any future conflict, including via 'space control' operations that include not just defensive measures such as to avoid hostile actions but also offensive operations to take out adversary satellites. 'Space superiority is the reason that we exist as a service, and the vagaries of warfighting must inform everything we do if we are going to succeed,' Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman told the annual Air and Space Forces Association Warfare Conference in Colorado on March 3. 'Space superiority is our prime imperative.' Further, he said, 'space control' is how the Space Force can achieve space superiority; thus is the service's newest 'core function.' 'Put simply, Space Control encapsulates the mission areas required to contest and control the space domain — employing kinetic and non-kinetic means to affect adversary capabilities through disruption, degradation, and even destruction, if necessary,' Saltzman elaborated. 'It includes things like orbital warfare and electromagnetic warfare, and its counterspace operations can be employed for both offensive and defensive purposes at the direction of combatant commands.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/5-chinese-satellites-practiced-dogfighting-in-space-space-force-says/	2025-03-18T14:33:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Gen.-Michael-Guetlein-scaled-e1725563197988.jpeg
Oracle teams up with Singapore defense agency to pilot air-gapped cloud platform	Executives from Oracle and the DSTA sign an agreement for the use of the Oracle Cloud Isolated Region platform. (Photo courtesy of Oracle and DSTA) WASHINGTON — Cloud service provider Oracle has partnered with Singapore’s Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) to provide the country’s ministry of defense and armed forces with a pilot of its Oracle Cloud Isolated Region platform, according to an announcement from Oracle and the DSTA. The Oracle Cloud Isolated Region is a secure, encrypted cloud environment which facilitates data management, cloud computing, artificial intelligence services, and more, while being completely disconnected from the internet — also known as being 'air-gapped' — making it more difficult for bad actors to hack into its platform, according to Oracle’s website. Because of this function, Oracle Cloud Isolated Region is able to operate in classified workloads, such as Impact Level 6 environments — a system reserved for storing and processing information classified up to the 'Secret' level. 'The use of Oracle Cloud Isolated Region will transform the Command, Control, Communications and Computers (C4) functions of the SAF [Singapore Armed Forces], and will modernise its digital capabilities with increased scalability and performance,' today’s announcement reads. 'The demand for secure and scalable cloud solutions is growing. It is more than just data storage and computing — it will be the foundation for a lot of innovation,' Chief Executive of DSTA Ng Chad-Son said in the press release. 'Through this pilot collaboration with Oracle, we will harness advanced cloud and AI technologies to digitalise and transform our operations.' Oracle has been providing its secure cloud services to the Pentagon long before it partnered with the Singapore defense community. Oracle is one of the four providers — along with Google, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft — involved in the Pentagon’s Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) program, which aims to offer cloud services 'from headquarters to the tactical edge' across various classification levels, per the DoD’s 2022 announcement commencing the program. 'Oracle has safeguarded the world’s most sensitive data for decades. We are pleased to bring this expertise to support the Singapore defence community’s missions,' Rand Waldron, vice president of sovereign relations at Oracle, said in today's release. 'Our air-gapped, isolated cloud regions bring the capabilities of our public cloud and defence ecosystem to the world's most secure networks. Oracle is built to deliver the highest levels of security and performance for governments around the world,' he added. Related: Don’t force Pacific Island nations to choose between us or China, says UK Royal Navy admiral This partnership comes at a time when tensions between China and Taiwan, along with other US allies in the region, are generating more and more attention.

No, there’s no ‘kill switch’: Pentagon tries to reassure international F-35 partners	Airmen assigned to the 34th Fighter Squadron and Fighter Generation Squadron perform pre-flight checks on F-35A Lightning IIs during an agile combat employment exercise at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, March 28, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman Keagan Lee) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon today attempted to reassure its international partners in the F-35 program that there is no 'kill switch' on the stealth fighter jet that the US could use to render it ineffective — the latest signal that there are real concerns abroad about American stewardship of the program amid tensions with historical allies. 'There is no kill switch,' the Joint Program Office (JPO) for the F-35 program said in a statement. 'The program operates under well-established agreements that ensure all F-35 operators have the necessary capabilities to sustain and operate their aircraft effectively. The strength of the F-35 program lies in its global partnership, and we remain committed to providing all users with the full functionality and support they require.' Discussion of a potential kill switch emerged earlier this month in European news reports, in the wake of President Donald Trump's decision to pause military aid to Ukraine. Foreign officials denied the idea at the time, but concern appeared to stem more generally from the fact that the technologically driven F-35 is dependent on rolling updates from the US, especially for the plane's complex software, as well as logistics support. The F-35 program, for which American aerospace giant Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor, includes 19 international partners or customers. '[It] isn't an electronic kill switch. The US also cannot remotely take control of the F-35,' Stacie Pettyjohn, the director of the defense program at the Center for a New American Security, told Breaking Defense. 'But by severing maintenance support, shipments of spare parts, and cutting foreign F-35s off from U.S. computer networks, the aircraft would quickly be hobbled. 'Without these software updates, F-35s could fly, but would be much more likely to be shot down by enemy air defenses. Also without U.S. maintainers and spare parts, it would be difficult to keep the aircraft flying for long, as it is an incredibly complex weapons system,' she said. Since those initial reports in the European press, officials from two American allies, Portugal and Canada, have publicly said their defense ministries are reexamining their future fighter jet options in light of the new geopolitical realities. While Lisbon has not made a commitment to a next-generation fighter, Ottawa had planned to purchase nearly 90 F-35As from the US. It is under contract to go ahead with the first 16, Canada's defense department told Breaking Defense on Monday, but it is doing its 'homework' on whether the remaining jets are still in Canada's best interest as a trade war with the US boils on. 'To be clear, we are not cancelling the F-35 contract, but we need to do our homework given the changing environment, and make sure that the contract in its current form is in the best interests of Canadians and the Canadian Armed Forces,' Laurent de Casanove, press secretary for Canadian Defence Minister Bill Blair, said in a statement. In its statement today, the JPO reiterated that the international nature of the program is among its greatest assets. 'The F-35 was conceived, developed, and continues to be operated and sustained as a joint/coalition platform, built on strong partnerships with U.S. allies and partner nations across the globe,' the statement said. 'From its inception, the F-35 has been a collaborative effort, integrating the expertise and contributions of multiple countries to ensure it meets the operational needs of all its users.' Lockheed in its own statement said that the company 'is committed to helping our customers strengthen their airpower and security with the F-35. The F-35 program recently surpassed 1 million flight hours across 16 military services flying the aircraft. We remain committed to providing the reliable and capable F-35 to enable our customers to complete their missions and come home safely.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/no-theres-no-kill-switch-pentagon-tries-to-reassure-international-f-35-partners/	2025-03-18T13:16:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240728_f35s_fog_USAF-scaled-e1722204407178.jpg

Army looking for ways to fund ‘transformation in contact’ 2.0 effort	The US Army held a TiC demo at its Project Convergence Capstone 5 event at Ft. Irwin, Calif., earlier this month. (Ashley Roque/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Now that lawmakers have signed off on a full-year continuing resolution (CR), US Army officials are weighing their options for how to pay for the second iteration of the service's 'transformation in contact' effort — one that they plan to be larger than last year, according to a three-star general. 'Is a full-year CR going to have an impact? Yes, it is,' Deputy Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Karl Gingrich told an audience today during the McAleese defense programs conference. 'Is it going to have a dramatic impact? In my opinion, no,' he added. 'And why is that? Because we have worked with [the Office of the Secretary of Defense] OSD, and we really appreciate Congress and the allocation of replenishment funding.' Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George launched the TiC effort last year, as a fundamental backbone of his service's attempt to get new technologies into the hands of soldiers faster. At its core, the concept is that, rather than waiting for technologies to be proven out in safe research and development spaces for years before going out to the field, George wants to see soldiers operating these systems in real world conditions to better understand and develop how they can be used. The first iteration provided three infantry units with newer equipment — Infantry Squad Vehicles, robotic mules, drones and more — and had them test it out in both hot and cold temperatures. RELATED: Frozen drones and robotic mules: What the US Army learned from a key exercise in Germany 'TiC is very, very valuable to us because we can do it in formation after formation after formation,' George told Breaking Defense during a March 13 interview. 'We can also do it in every different environment, like Europe, [the Indo-Pacific Command] INDOPACOM, stateside [or] in the Arctic… that's the real advantage of TiC.' George and other service leaders want to expand that experimentation this year under the TiC 2.0 banner, and hand soldiers a slew of new technology to test out in the sustainment, automation and ground autonomy arenas. That plan also includes a larger footprint by expanding to two armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and other units in the Guard and Reserves. To do that, the Army needs dollars to acquire more tech for more soldiers. However, lawmakers have punted on approving a FY25 spending bill for the Department of Defense and, instead, last week approved a full year CR that provides the department with a slight funding boost over FY24 levels and the flexibility to proceed with new start new programs. The Army, Gingrich explained, is now analyzing the FY25 CR alongside the capabilities it wants to buy and field soldiers under the TIC 2.0 umbrella. 'We're still doing the analysis there of what does it mean, and what, how much and where can we move monies,' Gingrich said. 'If we need to go through the reprogramming or transfer, … that may slow us down a little bit there, but I think the replenishment tranche funding that we're getting is going to allow us to kickstart [it].'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/army-looking-for-ways-to-fund-transformation-in-contact-2-0-effort/	2025-03-18T11:57:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/TiC-ar-scaled-e1742321060332.jpg
DoD should use likely $100B-plus reconciliation money on downrange needs: Wittman	Rep. Rob Wittman speaks at the Reagan National Defense Forum in 2023. (screengrab via RDNF Youtube) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is likely to end up with over $100 billion through budget reconciliation in the halls of Congress, a key lawmaker said today, money that he thinks should be prioritized for technologies urgently needed by troops operating around the globe, rather than only going to 'big programs.' Once Congress approves a single budget resolution, the House and Senate armed services committees will be tasked with figuring out how to spend additional defense funds. During comments at the McAleese and Associates conference today, Rep. Rob Wittman, R-Va., argued that in favor of handing some of that money over to combatant commanders overseeing current operations rather than routing it exclusively for major weapons programs. 'Where are the capability gaps today? Where are things that we need to close gaps quickly?' the head of the House Armed Services tactical air and land power subcommittee said. 'I would argue the folks closer to the operational side know better than we do, and I want to make sure, too, that it's not all about big programs. Obviously we need to be building submarines, ramping those things up, but it's also about getting those dollars out there for these attributable, expendable systems.' Congressional Republicans are aiming to pass a budget resolution with additional funding for key Trump administration priorities using a process called budget reconciliation, which allows a party with a slight majority in both chambers to push through legislation without the threat of filibuster. The House’s draft budget resolution includes an additional $100 billion for defense, while the Senate’s version includes $150 billion. Republicans will have to coalesce around a singular approach on reconciliation with agreed-upon spending increases and cuts. But despite urging from Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., to boost defense funds past $150 billion, Wittman said its more likely that the final number is somewhere between the $100 billion to $150 billion already established as 'guardrails' for negotiations. In addition to floating more money to the combatant commands, Wittman said that Pentagon organizations such as the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and the Office of Strategic Capital, which focus on harnessing innovative technology outside of the legacy defense industry, will also need more money to scale up operations. However, when asked about whether he would be supportive of consolidating DIU with similar offices focused on innovation, Wittman indicated he was agnostic as long as more funding was allocated over all. 'Do you allow these various entities … do you let them do things independently cause all of them have a little bit of area of expertise? Or do you try to combine them all together and have one common enterprise?' he asked. 'I'm not wed to a particular concept of the other, but what I am wed to is that we have to make much larger investments to get this innovative technology into the hands of the warfighter. And I think these entities have done a pretty good job about discovering what's going on out there and helping these companies cross that bridge into the defense industrial base.' Wittman, a proponent of Navy shipbuilding, also noted that he has been engaged with OMB director Russ Vought on the Navy’s Shipyard Accountability and Workforce Support (SAWS) proposal which would allow prime contractors HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding and General Dynamics Electric Boat to shift long-term funding for submarines earlier in order to invest in raising wages in the short term. OMB has raised concerns with the funding mechanisms associated with SAWS, but Wittman said he hoped to convey that OMB could help move money to the shipbuilding workforce more quickly than Congress can through the normal appropriations process. 'OMB can allow the money in these contracts to be moved to the left, to move that up front, to address workforce. I understand some of the issues that have been raised with that,' Wittman said. 'Our focus is, how do we, how do we get workforce issues addressed in the fastest way possible?' Vought has been 'very willing to listen, which is great,' Wittman said, noting that the OMB chief 'hadn’t made any commitment. I don't want to put any words in his mouth, but I think he understands the importance of this enterprise and the things that need to be done, and I want to make sure we continue that constructive conversation.' Following sightings of drones over domestic military installations in recent years, Wittman also stated his belief that the unmanned systems are operated by 'adversaries' attempting to glean information on US counter-drone operations. 'I think that those efforts, where you see incursions of UAS [unmanned aerial systems] across the United States at military bases, I think that's probing that's happening by our adversaries, and they're figuring out, What's the response going to be? How's the United States going to respond to that?' the congressman said in a speech with conference attendees. 'I would argue we haven't done a really good job of that to this point.' Given the complexity of some reported drone operations, such as days of mystery flights over Langley Air Force Base in Virginia in December 2023, some officials have reportedly suspected a foreign adversary like Russia or China is to blame, though many have been reluctant to point fingers absent evidence. Other officials, like Northern Command chief Gen. Gregory Guillot, have said they have not seen evidence that the drones are operated by a foreign power and that many flights are thought to be the work of hobbyists. The drone issue has kicked off a whole-of-government effort to fix policy gaps tying commanders’ hands from responding to potential threats over bases and to deploy technologies that could take out drones with minimal risk to civilian life. In a subsequent gaggle with reporters, Wittman declined to elaborate on direct evidence that the drones are operated by an adversary power, citing the classification of briefings he has received from military officials. Nevertheless, he said the public should infer that the drone flights are not innocent errors. 'If you look at the nature of these incursions and the information that's all public, I think you can reach a reasonable conclusion that these aren't hobbyists flying these platforms over these bases, that there is somebody, whether it's somebody here that wants to be mischievous… I think we have to assume that there is an effort here to try to discover what is the response of the US going to be? 'There's too much of this happening and too frequent of a basis to say that it's just random,' Wittman continued, pointing to the Langley sightings. 'So that wasn't just a hobbyist flying that platform in there just by mistake. I mean, this is a concerted effort.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/dod-should-use-likely-100b-plus-reconciliation-money-on-downrange-needs-wittman/	2025-03-18T11:05:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/231204_wittman_reagn_grab.png
Citing Russian threat, Baltic and Polish defense ministers want out of anti-landmine treaty	A Ukrainian de-mining sapper who gave the name Pavlo demonstrates how Russian forces place an anti-personnel mine on top of a fragmentation grenade on July 31, 2023. (Photo by Scott Peterson/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The defense ministers of the Baltic nations and Poland said today that the threat presented by Russia is so great that it's time their countries pull out of a treaty that bans the use or stockpiling of anti-personnel mines. 'We believe that in the current security environment it is of paramount importance to provide our defense forces with flexibility and freedom of choice of potential use of new weapon systems and solutions to bolster the defense of the [NATO] Alliance's Eastern Flank,' reads the joint communique. The top officials said that in 'light of these considerations, we — the Ministers of Defence of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland — unanimously recommend withdrawing from the Ottawa Convention. With this decision, we are sending a clear message: our countries are prepared and can use every necessary measure to defend our territory and freedom.' The Ottawa Convention, a thankfully shortened version of its formal name The Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines and on their Destruction, was proposed in the late 1990s and has been signed by 133 nations — part of a worldwide effort to protect civilians from encountering the weapons long after the conflicts for which they were meant had ended. RELATED: Clearing Ukrainian land of dangerous mines, ordinance will take decades, EOD firm says 'Despite our withdrawal, we will remain committed to international humanitarian law, including the protection of civilians during an armed conflict,' the joint statement says. 'Our nations will continue to uphold these principles while addressing our security needs.' The US is not a signatory to the convention, as Washington supports South Korea's use of landmines in the demilitarized zone between it and North Korea. During his first administration President Donald Trump loosened the rules for US use of 'nonpersistent' versions of the mines worldwide, according to the Congressional Research Service [PDF]. The Biden administration gave Ukraine anti-personnel mines to assist in their defense against Russian forces. The European defense ministers' call today comes amid a wave of worry in NATO capitals close to the Russian border about what Russian President Vladimir Putin will do with his large, battle-hardened army and war-oriented economy if a ceasefire in Ukraine comes to pass. 'A lot will depend on what the peace talks' deliver, but 500,000 experienced Russian troops will be unlikely to want to return to civilian life earning $100 a month, Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's minister of defense and a signatory to today's letter, told Breaking Defense at the Munich Security Conference in February. In a series of interviews in 2024, defense leaders in northern Europe all expressed concerned that a 'window' was closing during which they had time to deter or, if necessary, prepare to fight off a Russian invasion. RELATED: Ticking clock: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing &#8216;window' to prepare for Russia In addition to the potential land mine move, the Baltic nations previously agreed to develop a new, sprawling bunker system in order to better confront any Russian invading force, though that effort is years away from completion. In Finland, which shares a long border with Russia, a key lawmaker said today the Baltic and Polish defense ministers' call is a 'wise' one. 'It is important that all NATO countries can assess their defence capabilities in accordance with the prevailing threat situation,' Jukka Kopra, chairman of the defense committee in the Finnish parliament, said in a statement provided to Breaking Defense. 'The war in Ukraine has demonstrated that in a prolonged conflict, there is a risk that substitute capabilities may be exhausted, and simple weapons are needed. It is crucial that national defence forces have a broad range of tools available when necessary.' The statement indicated that a similar move will be the subject of debate in Helsinki in coming weeks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/citing-russian-threat-baltic-and-polish-defense-ministers-want-out-of-anti-landmine-treaty/	2025-03-18T09:36:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250318_anti-personnel_mine_ukraine_GettyImages-1583236400-e1742314657543.jpg

MBDA CEO sees ‘moment of truth’ in European defense, as firm sets order record	Missiles are displayed outside the MBDA exhibition hall during the Farnborough International Airshow 2022 on July 19, 2022 in Farnborough, England. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) BEIRUT — European missile giant MBDA announced that it hit a new record in orders for 2024, amounting to €13.8 billion ($15.1 billion USD), and predicted more aggressive growth to come as European militaries race to arm themselves amid a deepening rift with the US. 'This is a very specific moment where Europe is really considering, [and] actively discussing how it wants to take its destiny in its own hand,' MBDA CEO Eric Béranger told journalists Monday. 'This is a little bit a moment of truth for Europe.' The company said its total revenues for 2024 were €4.9 billion, with a backlog of €37 billion. The CEO pointed that his firm is working on new missiles, including the Aquila, which is a hypersonic missile interceptor. Generally speaking, he stressed 'the need to accelerate, the need to increase the volumes [of missiles]. In 2024 we produced and delivered 33 percent more missiles than in 2023. In 2025, in fact, the production of new missiles, and the delivery of new missiles at the end of the day, will have doubled when compared to 2023.' Béranger projected the firm’s investment in missile production to reach €2.4 billion from 2025 to 2029, and the company expects to hire 2,600 new employees in 2025. Earlier on Monday, Europe’s Organization for Joint Armament Cooperation – Executive Administration (OCCAR-EA) and Eurosam, a European Joint venture between MBDA and French firm Thales, signed the 15th amendment to accelerate production of Aster 30 B1 ground and naval missiles, and Aster 15 naval missiles. In his briefing with reporters Béranger stressed the significance of having the design authority in Europe as 'it means that you are the ones conceiving the equipment, the system, which means that you know them. If you are the one conceiving it, designing it, [this] means that you don't need to ask anybody on how it works, whether you can adapt it in one way or another. You don't need to ask anybody outside yourself [Europe] for the approval to use it in certain conditions or to adapt it.' While Béranger did not cite any specific examples of where such a dependence outside Europe could be an issue, his comments came shortly after the new Canadian prime minister ordered his defense ministry to re-evaluate Ottawa's planned purchase of American F-35 jets. The ministry told Breaking Defense Monday it was 'doing its homework' on the deal 'given the changing environment.' 'We are really today, living through historical moments where the alliances in the world are being challenged [and] tested,' Béranger said. 'We are living in a moment where the behavior of historical allies is becoming more uncertain, and so we are living it really, in a historical moment where we are shifting from one period to another.' He added that 'this does have some consequences, and through those consequences ... more than ever in those times for European countries, the model of MBDA is proving relevant. The model of MBDA, I mean the cooperation model, where several European countries, cooperate together in order to benefit from all the potential capabilities in terms of complex weapons in full sovereignty.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/mbda-ceo-sees-moment-of-truth-in-european-defense-as-firm-sets-order-record/	2025-03-18T07:34:03-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/231031_mbda_missiles_farnborough_GettyImages-1410168198-scaled-e1698768978256.jpg
SAIC partners with Defense Unicorns to speed up software delivery	Members of the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam operate cyber systems using a Enhanced communications flyaway kit during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3 and Architect Demonstration Evaluation 5 at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July, 12, 2021. (US Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Amy Picard) WASHINGTON — In an effort to speed up software delivery across the Department of Defense, well known defense contractor SAIC partnered with Defense Unicorns, a veteran-owned small business, to provide Defense Unicorns’s Unicorn Delivery Service (UDS) to both warfighters and leaders within the Pentagon. Before the partnership was officially announced March 12, the companies were able to establish a UDS connection in a Department of the Air Force classified workload in just two days, a task that usually takes 'several months,' Bob Ritchie, senior vice president and chief technology officer at SAIC, told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. The Department of the Air Force did not respond to a request for comment. UDS is a multi-layered software delivery platform 'built from the bottom up' that enables quick and secure software deployment across various environments including in the cloud, on premise or in semi- and fully disconnected environments including air-gapped systems — networks that are entirely isolated from external networks, Slaughter explained. He added that the UDS platform was built with the mindset of being 'defense first.' Ritchie said SAIC will benefit from UDS by gaining the ability to streamline how the company deploys and maintains applications for warfighters. Meanwhile, this partnership provides Defense Unicorns with the knowledge SAIC has on the intricacies and innerworkings within the defense industrial base such as varying security standards and timeline specifics, Slaughter said. 'All of the software primes in the defense community obviously have their own internal platforms and systems. They are leveraging their own solutions today, so that’s one of the things that makes it very challenging for us at times especially as a small business,' Slaughter said. 'So to have them [SAIC] and their backing, to say, ‘No, we just want the best solution for the warfighter’ is a huge statement.' The partnership announcement comes after Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth signed a memo calling for practices such as the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP) to be put in place to speed up software development and deployment. However, Slaughter and Ritchie said they had been working on this partnership for around six months. Though Ritchie and Slaughter said this partnership had nothing to do with Hegseth’s dedication to hurrying up software acquisition processes or Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) efforts in cutting down acquisition time and costs, especially in the tech realm, Slaughter emphasized how UDS and Defense Unicorns are closely aligned with DOGE’s mission. 'Everything with DOGE and this very, very important new emphasis on actually making sure the government is efficient — obviously DOGE didn't exist when we started UDS — but it is directly in line with our incentives,' Slaughter said. He added that with the decades of experience he’s had interacting with prime contractors, he’s seen that it can take up to 'a year and five to 10 million' dollars to build a platform. But with UDS his team thought 'Let's take this thing that typically takes people one to two years, and let's truncate that down' and do it at a price point that makes it 'very consumable by the government to make them not only just faster, but more efficient from a spend perspective.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/saic-partners-with-defense-unicorn-to-speed-up-software-delivery/	2025-03-17T13:20:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240716_gide_finger_computer_6733216-e1721160785247.jpg
Canada says it’s reconsidering multibillion dollar F-35 buy as Trump ratchets up trade war	Two F-35A Lightning II aircraft fly over the Alaska Range en route to their new home at the 354th Fighter Wing, Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, April 21, 2020. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Adam Keele) WASHINGTON — Amid escalating tensions with the United States, the Canadian military said while it is committed to the first 16 F-35As it's on contract to buy from American defense giant Lockheed Martin, it is actively re-evaluating the rest of the multi-billion-dollar order. 'At this time, the contract to purchase the F-35 remains in place and Canada has made a legal commitment of funds for the first 16 aircraft. The Prime Minister has also asked the Minister of National Defence to work with CAF/DND [Canadian Armed Forces/Department of National Defence] to determine if the F-35 contract, as it stands, is the best investment for Canada, and if there are other options that could better meet Canada’s needs,' Laurent de Casanove, press secretary for Canadian defense minister Bill Blair, said in a statement to Breaking Defense today. 'To be clear, we are not cancelling the F-35 contract, but we need to do our homework given the changing environment, and make sure that the contract in its current form is in the best interests of Canadians and the Canadian Armed Forces,' de Casanove added. The statement follows comments from Blair on March 14 to Canadian public broadcaster CBC that Ottawa planned to review the F-35 buy, marking one of the first acts by Canada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney, who was sworn in earlier that day. After years of back-and-forth that sparked national controversy, Canada eventually inked a $19 billion CAD (at the time worth $14.2 billion USD) deal for 88 of F-35As in 2023. The first stealth fighters under the order are expected to be handed over next year. Ottawa’s reconsideration of the deal could open a door for alternatives like Sweden’s Saab, whose Gripen fighter was beat out by the F-35 for the competition to replace Canada’s legacy F-18 fleet. In response to the Canadians' comments, Lockheed Martin said the company 'values our strong partnership and history with the Royal Canadian Air Force and looks forward to continuing that partnership into the future. The F-35 is the most advanced, survivable and connected fighter aircraft in the world, enabling 21st Century Security and allied deterrence. Questions about foreign military sales of the F-35 are best addressed by the U.S. government.' A spokesperson for the US F-35 Joint Program Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ottawa’s move to reevaluate the F-35 buy comes as Washington pursues more aggressive relations with its northern neighbor, as President Donald Trump threatens high tariffs and even annexation — renewing the electoral prospects of Carney’s Liberal Party, which he took over from former Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Trump’s sharper rhetoric against NATO allies is also driving a new wave of defense spending in Europe, as leaders grow concerned Washington may prove to be an unreliable partner. Canada is officially the first customer to openly reevaluate its F-35 order in the Trump era, and it is an open question whether other nations may follow suit — potentially risking major disruptions in the aircraft’s international supply chain. Although reports recently circulated that Portugal may rule out replacing its aging F-16 aircraft with the F-35, the country’s defense ministry confirmed to Breaking Defense that the F-35 is still in play in Lisbon's future fighter considerations, but that any procurement decisions must take into account the 'current geopolitical context' with an eye toward strengthening Europe’s defense industrial base. Tim Martin in Belfast contributed reporting.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/canada-says-its-reconsidering-multibillion-dollar-f-35-buy-as-trump-ratchets-up-trade-war/	2025-03-17T12:25:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/eielson-f-35-scaled-e1738163481700.jpg
Navy destroyer sails to support southern border mission	The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely (DDG-107) is moored at Naval Weapons Station Yorktown prior to getting underway for a scheduled employment to the U.S. Northern Command area of responsibility. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Ryan Williams) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon over the weekend deployed the US Navy destroyer Gravely (DDG-107) to join operations at the southern border, a move a top admiral acknowledged is 'unusual' given the ship’s capabilities and the missions with which it will be tasked. The Navy announced March 15 the ship deployed from Naval Weapons Station Yorktown heading towards the southern border where it will assist the Coast Guard in maritime drug interdictions and preventing illegal seaborne immigration, among other tasks. The destroyer will have a Coast Guard detachment aboard for certain law enforcement tasks. 'USS Gravely’s deployment will contribute to the U.S. Northern Command southern border mission as part of the DOD’s coordinated effort in response to the Presidential Executive Order. Gravely’s sea-going capacity improves our ability to protect the United States’ territorial integrity, sovereignty, and security,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, commander of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM), said in the Navy statement. Speaking to reporters today, Navy Adm. Daryl Caudle, who is dual hatted in his roles as the head of US Fleet Forces and the naval forces component commander for NORTHCOM, said it is 'unusual' to deploy an asset like Gravely, a Flight IIA Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, for the kinds of maritime interdiction missions its crew will soon take on. 'This is putting our toe in the water a bit to understand it, to make sure that we know how to employ this force,' he said. 'Is the return on investment for this level of capability going to return good, fruitful utilization of it? And so, this first round will educate us on that to see if further continued, I think, global utilization of these forces is required.' However, while Caudle said the mission was unusual, the request itself is not. NORTHCOM does request, as necessary, Navy ships to monitor Russian and Chinese vessels that are nearing US territorial waters. 'It is a bit unique to deploy a capability of this this level for this mission set, but I think it goes to the commitment that Navy has to the President and Secretary of Defense to support the southern border operations,' Caudle said. The Navy previously deployed two P-8 Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, which had been patrolling the border, but will soon transition to surveilling the ocean in support of the Coast Guard and Navy’s operations. Within days of the new administration coming into power, the Pentagon deployed 1,000 Army soldiers and 500 Marines to the southern border.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/navy-destroyer-sails-to-support-southern-border-mission/	2025-03-17T10:45:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/8917936-scaled-e1742225783536.jpg
Space supply chain gaps: Propulsion, hardened electronics and laser links	Hall Effect Thrusters are electric propulsion systems used to maneuver spacecraft on-orbit. (Image: NASA) WASHINGTON — Despite ongoing efforts by the Defense Department to bolster the space supply chain, government and commercial satellite programs continue to struggle with shortfalls in several critical areas, including on-orbit propulsion, optical communications terminals and hardened electronics, according to industry and Pentagon officials. The sluggish flow of key capabilities is a drag on Space Force efforts to rapidly transform its space architecture from handfuls of large satellites to so-called proliferated constellations made up of many small satellites, according to David Gauthier, the former head of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's commercial space office. 'We find ourselves in a new space race. Companies need to bring new space technology to market quickly, and supply chains are critical to both speed and scale for proliferated architectures,' said Gauthier, now chief strategy officer at consulting firm GXO Inc. 'Reliable supply is fundamental for a healthy and vibrant industrial base that enables government space missions.' Gauthier was speaking last week at the Satellite 2025/GovMilSpace conference on a conference panel with industry and Pentagon officials — including a representative of the Pentagon's Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) and the Defense Innovation Unit — focused on space supply chain chokepoints. All of the panelists agreed that developmental readiness and the ability to scale production in a handful of capabilities are hampering progress, but that the solutions will be tough to find and implement. Even just 'mapping the supply chain is hard stuff,' Reza Nikfarjam, deputy director of OSC's Credit Program, told the panel. 'It's a massive undertaking; it's difficult. It takes a lot of time.' In one example of just how dire supply problems have been with electric propulsion units, which are used to maneuver satellites in low Earth orbit, Frank Backes, CEO of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite startup Capella Space, said that his company had to undertake an 'unplanned' redesign of its spacecraft at one point. 'Not only did we need to redesign for the purposes of staying on orbit, keeping our satellite in the appropriate orbit, the correct altitude to do our mission, but we also had an issue in the sense that the propulsion companies that were available to us around the world became a little bit less reliable,' he said. 'So we needed to redesign and go to an environmental system that allowed us to have more than one propulsion supplier to our company, so that we could move toward — and we have now moved toward – continuous manufacturing of our satellites.' Similar bottlenecks have affected the plans of the Space Development Agency, according to Chris Quilty, co-CEO of consulting firm Quilty Space. He told Breaking Defense on Thursday that the near bankruptcy of Astra Space last year — which in 2021 acquired one of the major producers of so-called Hall Effect Thrusters Apollo Fusion — was a key factor in delaying the SDA's first operational data relay and missile tracking satellites. SDA originally planned to begin launching the 158 Tranche 1 satellites in September 2024. The agency then pushed that date to early this year, and just a week ago announced a further delay until sometime this summer. An SDA official confirmed that Astra's financial problems, and difficulties other electric propulsion companies have been facing in scaling production, have been a factor in the delays. Astra did not respond to a request for comment Friday. Likewise developmental set backs and troubles in scaling from laboratory to factory production that have plagued the optical communications industry also have contributed to SDA's difficulties getting Tranche 1 off the ground — an issue highlighted in a recent report from the Government Accountability Office. One key supplier of laser terminals for SDA prime contractors, German firm Mynaric, has been undergoing a debt restructuring, and on March 11 Rocket Lab announced its plan to buy the firm. Mynaric has been a supplier of optical communications terminals to Rocket Lab. Nonetheless, Mynaric in a press statement on March 10 said that it fully intends to continue to 'ramp up and increase deliveries' of its terminal. 'We are continuing to deliver on our promise to the industry to provide scalable products that meet evolving program requirements, and drive innovation in areas such as multi-orbit constellations. To maintain our industry position, we must continue delivering to existing customers while advancing future applications of optical communications technology,' said Joachim Horwath, Mynaric's chief technology officer. Meanwhile, Mark Jenkins, chief space systems officer at Maxar Intelligence, told the Satellite 2025/GovMilSpace panel that obtaining basic electrical and computer components that are able to withstand the rigors of operating in the harsh environment of space is also fraught. 'Some of the technologies that we really rely on are rooted in space-hardened electronics: focal array technology, AI-enabled processing, &#8230; attitude, determination, control systems. Those are big drivers in what we can produce and how long we can produce, or when we can produce it, which really drives to lead times. However, we're currently faced with a situation where there's a lot of competition out there for some of these components,' he said. While there is a widespread understanding among both suppliers and buyers about many of the problems, what remains unclear are pathways for fixing them. Jenkins said that although 'there are no silver bullets,' one thing industry could do better for itself is for each company to identify upfront what critical components it needs and where to find them, as well as to to figure out 'where are we sourcing our overall materials.' Another solution, he suggested, could be for the US government 'to establish strategic reserves of key critical materials like helium, xenon and other items for propulsion systems.' Nikfarjam explained that the OSC is working on providing capital to companies working across 31 critical supply chain baskets related to defense, including in the space domain, to help built up the domestic supply chain. 'Space launch, spacecraft and space-enabled services are three areas that are obviously directly related to space, but also advanced manufacturing, micro-electronics, solar panels, battery storage, [and] additive manufacturing,' he said. The OSC Credit Program earlier this year made available a total of 'about a billion dollars in direct lending,' Nakfarjam said. Fletcher Franklin, a senior program manager at market analysis firm BryceTech, told Breaking Defense on March 14 that the US 'at a really interesting point in time with the supply chain' related to space. 'I think the one thing that everyone agrees on is there are pain points and there are challenges,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/space-supply-chain-gaps-propulsion-hardened-electronics-and-laser-links/	2025-03-17T09:01:07-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-14-at-2.55.00 PM-e1741978925675.png
Washington must get out of Europe’s way on defense	Soldiers assigned to the 14th Field Artillery Regiment, 75th Field Artillery Brigade fire rockets out of an M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System during a media engagement on camp Tapa, Estonia (US Army) Europe is signaling that it is ready to rearm. If the effort falls short it would not be the first time, but stark changes in the US-Europe relationship have created new urgency in European capitals. To be successful, Europe must not only find more money to spend on military hardware but also invest that money at home buying European-made weapons. And the United States, historically protective of US defense firms, must break with past precedent and encourage them to do so. There are signals that the Trump administration may be more open to the development of an autonomous European defense industry than its predecessors. In his remarks to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in February 2024, for instance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth made a promise to his counterparts. The United States, he said, will 'prioritize empowering Europe to own responsibility for its own security.' If President Donald Trump and his advisors hope to reduce the US defense burden in Europe, limit US involvement in Ukraine, and focus more attention on Asia, they must stick to this commitment. The first reason for this is practical. US defense firms are simply not capable of meeting Europe’s extensive and comprehensive military requirements on the necessary, urgent timelines. US military contractors like Lockheed Martin and RTX are oversubscribed. It is not uncommon for countries to wait years for their orders of US-made tanks, missiles, aircraft, and other systems. With the growing US focus on Asia and concerns about US military readiness, European buyers often find themselves at the back of the queue. Poland offers a good example of the constraints created by the realities of US defense production. In the fall of 2024, Poland entered negotiations to buy 100 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), as part of a framework agreement that would allow Warsaw to acquire up to 486 systems. At current production rates, however, even if every US-made HIMARS went to Poland, it would take over two years to fill the first part of the order and more than five years to produce all 486 units. Since there are other buyers, the actual timelines would likely be even longer. Warsaw’s effort to buy over 1,000 new main battle tanks have also run into obstacles created by slow US production. And Poland is not alone in facing delays. Some of Germany’s most recent US defense orders including Patriot air defense missiles and F-35 aircraft similarly won’t arrive until almost 2030. Estonia, too, has raised questions about the delivery timelines of its orders. Europe cannot wait a decade to fill its many military gaps, and Washington seems equally impatient. If the Trump team wants Europe to take most responsibility for its own defense in this decade, Europe will need its own dedicated suppliers. A robust and self-sustaining European defense industry is also the key to the Trump administration’s plans for Ukraine. Like previous US presidents, Trump has assessed that the United States has limited interests in Ukraine’s future security. Trump’s team has no plans to continue aid to Ukraine indefinitely, and has rejected proposals that leave the United States with lasting liabilities in Ukraine. But Trump is also eager for a permanent end to the war, the associated drain on US military resources, and the ever-present risk of a US-Russia conflict. A strong and largely self-sustaining European defense industrial base able to credibly arm Ukraine to defend itself without external assistance offers Washington an exit ramp and a pathway to peace with no US strings attached. The second reason Trump and his advisors should want Europe to supply its own military equipment is strategic. The administration has made clear that it sees China, and not Russia, as the primary US adversary and wants to focus as much of its defense budget as possible on arming the US military and its Asian allies for Indo-Pacific contingencies. While preparations for these potential conflicts overlap in some places with Europe’s defense requirements—for example air defense, drones, and munitions—there are also vast differences. Europe must prepare for the possibility of a grinding land war of attrition, and the United States is focused on equipping itself for a long-distance fight that will occur primarily at sea. Given stark resource and workforce constraints, the choice to orient the US defense industrial base to rebuild European armies would mean less investment in capabilities essential for US military activities in Asia. A self-sustaining European defense that generates less materiel demand in the United States, on the other hand, would allow the Trump administration to shift defense industrial funds to areas deemed most vital to US national security — ships, submarines, and long-range munitions. If the Trump administration sticks with its pledge and pushes Europe to spend its defense euros on European-made equipment, it will face pushback from two domestic constituencies: defense contractors worried about their bottom lines and members of Congress protecting their districts. Trump and his advisors should not back down. Even if reduced European defense dependence comes with some costs, the strategic upside should make up for them. US defense firms currently face demand that exceeds their capacity, so even as European self-sufficiency will mean some lost business in the long term, American firms will feel no pinch overnight. Even if all countries in Europe quickly reach the 5 percent of GDP defense spending benchmark that Trump has proposed, it will take at least five years for European defense firms to build the workforce and production capacity to replace US weapons suppliers. European customers also might not wean themselves entirely, continuing to rely on US firms for small quantities of the most advanced systems. Moreover, as this transition occurs, there will be no shortage of eager new buyers; given ongoing wars and global insecurity, orders for US weapons will likely continue to increase, even if Europe goes its own way. For the same reasons, the concerns of Congress can be largely put aside. Jobs may shift within the defense sector but these changes will happen slowly, and overwhelming demand for weapons and shortages of trained personnel should limit long-term job losses, especially with investments in retraining. Trump and his advisors will need to push for European defense industrial independence in the early days, when Europe still relies on the United States, and later, when it can do more without US help. For its part, Europe should hold the Trump administration to their word. European leaders should invest massively in their national and collective defense industrial base, limiting purchases of US military equipment and giving preference to their own suppliers. At the same time, they should embrace a new narrative. Rather than being aggrieved at what they see as US abandonment, they should champion the new freedom that will come with self-reliance.

Amid Democratic turmoil, Senate passes yearlong funding stopgap with $892B for defense	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate approved a GOP-authored funding bill that will keep federal agencies funded until Sept. 30, with a $892.5 billion defense topline that slightly exceeds that of fiscal 2024. The full-year continuing resolution (CR) passed in a 54-46 vote largely along party lines, preventing a government shutdown before a midnight deadline. Ten Democrats voted with Republicans on an earlier procedural vote that allowed the bill to break filibuster. Unlike a typical CR, which keeps government funding at the previous year’s levels and does not allow the Pentagon to start new programs, the measure approved for FY25 includes a slight funding boost as well as provisions meant to give the Pentagon more flexibility. Namely, the bill: Democrats had sought a monthlong CR that would have granted congressional appropriators more time to hammer out FY25 spending bills, and they have criticized the Republican-penned bill for handing President Donald Trump additional authorities to redirect funding to his own priorities. However, faced with a March 14 deadline, House and Senate Democrats failed to get on the same page. Though higher than FY24 levels, the CR passed today still falls under caps set for FY25 by Congress in the Fiscal Responsibility Act, with nondefense spending $15 billion under the limit and defense under by almost $3 billion. The House passed the bill Tuesday evening in a 217-213 vote that largely adhered to party lines. With a 218-214 split in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson could only afford to lose one GOP vote if all Democrats voted against the bill. House Democrat leadership whipped its members to oppose the bill, but in the end Johnson was successful in rounding up the numbers needed to get the bill across the line, with Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie as the lone GOP defector. The House adjourned for a weeklong recess on the heels of the successful vote, leaving Senate Democrats with a dilemma. Unlike the House, where a bill can pass via a simple majority, a funding bill moving through the Senate must first proceed through a 'cloture vote' that requires 60 votes — meaning Senate Republicans were dependent on gaining the votes of at least eight Democrats to pass the bill. While House Democrats urged their colleagues in the Senate to follow their lead and vote against the CR, some Senate Democrats expressed concern that shutting down the government would have a more negative impact on the country, including potentially empowering Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency to make greater cuts to the federal government. On Thursday night, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, took to the Senate floor to announce that he would vote for the continuing resolution, reversing course from the position he espoused on Wednesday. 'For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option … but I believe allowing Donald Trump to take much more power via a government shutdown is a much worse option,' he said. 'Therefore, I will vote to keep the government open and not shut it down.' Schumer’s decision set off a firestorm of criticism from many Senate Democrats, as well as House Democrats who overwhelmingly voted against the bill. House Democratic leaders took the extraordinary step of leaving an ongoing retreat and returning to Capitol Hill to hold a news conference imploring Senate Democrats to hold the line against the bill. 'We do not want to shut down the government, but we are not afraid of a government funding showdown,' said House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-NY. 'And we will win that showdown because we stand on the side of the American people.' Asked whether Schumer acquiesced to Republicans, Jeffries demurred, stating that was a question best left to the Senate and that the position of House Democrats is 'very clear.' He declined to comment when asked whether the Senate needed new leadership and whether he retains confidence in Schumer. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., issued a statement calling the decision between the CR and a government shutdown a 'false choice,' urging Democrats to 'fight back for a better way.' Meanwhile, Trump, in a Friday morning post on Truth Social, lauded Schumer’s decision, stating that it 'took ‘guts’ and courage!' Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, led the charge against the CR in the upper chamber, telling lawmakers in a floor speech this afternoon that they should follow her in voting against cloture and against the bill itself.

Senate confirms billionaire financier Feinberg as Pentagon’s No. 2	Nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen A. Feinberg listens to the opening remarks of a Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C., Feb. 25, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — The Senate today confirmed billionaire financier Stephen Feinberg to be the Defense Department’s number two official, paving the way for the department to swear in the leader traditionally responsible for overseeing the Pentagons’ sprawling bureaucracy. Feinberg’s nomination was cleared in a 59-40 vote this afternoon. Feinberg is the third major Defense Department figure tapped by President Donald Trump to be confirmed by the Senate, following Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in January and Army Secretary Dan Driscoll last month. A cofounder of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, Feinberg told lawmakers during his Feb. 25 confirmation hearing that he had overseen the restructure of failing businesses and put them on the road to profitability — tactics he could apply to make the Pentagon leaner, more efficient and more financially accountable. He vowed to take a sharp look at acquisition reform, and indicated that he would be willing to cut legacy programs as the department looks to find 8 percent of its budget that it can redirect to top priorities. At the time, Democrats largely pressed Feinberg on how he would implement the Trump administration’s stated plan to eliminate 5 to 8 percent of the Pentagon’s civilian workforce, a query that Feinberg said he could not yet answer definitively, adding that 'without some turnover, you can’t become an efficient organization.' He also dodged questions about whether Russia invaded Ukraine, telling lawmakers, 'I don't think some person who's not informed on this, not involved in discussions, should make statements public that could undermine what the president and the secretary's intent is.' As a businessman whose holdings have reportedly included defense firms such as Navistar Defense, DynCorp and Stratolaunch, Feinberg has largely stayed out of the spotlight. During Trump’s first administration, he headed the President’s Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives private citizens access to classified information so they can provide advice to the president about the inner workings of the Intelligence Community. Despite some lawmakers’ frustrations with Feinberg’s answers to questions on Ukraine, civilian workforce cuts and overall spending, his nomination was generally uncontroversial. However, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., raised repeated concerns about potential conflict of interests such as his ties to Ligado Networks, which is currently suing the Departments of Defense and Commerce.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/senate-confirms-billionaire-financier-feinberg-as-pentagons-no-2/	2025-03-14T11:27:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250225_feinberg_testimony_8885249-scaled-e1740510119294.jpg
UK Royal Navy receives first autonomous mine countermeasures system	The Royal Navy has taken delivery of new autonomous mine countermeasures systems (Thales) BELFAST — The UK has announced the first delivery of an autonomous mine countermeasures system as part of a €430 million ($468 million) Organisation for Joint Armament Co-operation-led (OCCAR) Anglo-French naval cooperation program. In a statement today, the British MoD said that the Thales-made Maritime Mine Counter Measure (MMCM) systems are a 'new capability' for the Royal Navy and comprise a 12-meter long Unmanned Surface Vessel (USV) dubbed ARIADNE, alongside off-board payloads and a Remote Command Centre (RCC). 'With this advanced technology, mines can be rapidly detected in a more cost-effective and safer manner than previously, greatly increasing operational tempo and eliminating the need for sailors to enter mine danger areas,' noted London. It also outlined that the USV can be deployed from shore or a mothership to detect seabed mines in collaboration with the Thales-made Towed Synthetic Aperture Multiviews (TSAM) sonar system. 'Developments in sensor technology, data analytics, and machine learning have all significantly contributed to this innovation, allowing vessels to operate either fully autonomously or remote controlled by operators in a portable operations centre,' added the MoD. 'Fitted with AI automatic target recognition, these vessels will filter and refine vast amounts of data allowing professional operators to speed up the process of classifying and neutralising mines.' The UK alone has spent £184 million on the MMCM program, with the Royal Navy set to receive four systems overall by the end of the year. The MoD also revealed that French MMCM deliveries have also taken place. Deliveries are part of OCCAR's MMCM Production Contract (Stage II) which follows on from an earlier Prototyping Phase (Stage 1), according to the organization. Alongside lead contractors Thales UK and Thales France, key subcontractors include Sweden's Saab, France's Exail Prototyping and US firm L3Harris. Thales UK will train Royal Navy personnel on the ARIADNE boat for a 'period' before the service undertakes an operational evaluation of equipment and start to 'utilise MMCM to fulfil operational duties,' added the UK MoD. According to the UK's procurement arm, Defence Equipment and Support, the Royal Navy is committed to a further three autonomous mine hunting systems — Wilton, Sweep and Seacat — as it looks to transition away from 'conventional ship-based' methods. 'The Royal Navy plans to gradually phase out conventional crewed mine hunting vessels as additional autonomous systems are delivered over the next five years or so,' said the UK MoD. Other navies are making similar strides to the UK, with the US Navy recently rolling out a series of contract awards to advance the mine countermeasures mission package, set to deploy on its Littoral Combat Ships.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/uk-royal-navy-receives-first-autonomous-mine-countermeasures-system/	2025-03-14T11:03:06-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/190830_Roster_P0091_cropped-scaled-e1741972816293.jpg
DIU picks four companies, including two Ukrainian teammates, for one-way drone prototypes	A Ukrainian soldier launches a hand-held drone in 2015 (Petro Zadorzhnyy/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Heeding a congressional directive, the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has selected four companies to proceed with development of long-range, one-way drones capable of reaching their targets amid stiff electronic warfare interference, the office announced today. True to the name of the Greek goddess of the hunt, Artemis aims to deliver a ground-launched prototype that can takeoff 'quickly and expeditiously' and fly anywhere from 50 km (31.1 miles) to over 300 km at low altitudes. 'We are excited about the non-traditional companies who are providing low-cost, adaptable, long-range, UAS platforms with the potential to maximize operational flexibility for the Joint force,' Trent Emeneker, DIU’s program manager for the effort, said in the agency’s release. 'This was the intent of Congress’s direction to rethink how to get capabilities to the warfighter at speed and scale that can deliver much faster than traditional Programs of Record.' Emeneker told Defense News that two of the drones have a range of roughly 100 km while the other two can fly over 1,000 km. The smaller drones DIU is evaluating cost under $20,000 each, while the larger systems run closer to $70,000, the outlet reported. The 'next step,' according to the DIU notice, is to complete prototyping and 'demonstrate success' by May 2025, with the goal of having a 'successful prototype' in hand by the end of this fiscal year. After publication of this article, a DIU spokesperson said in response to questions from Breaking Defense that 'ideally' the Artemis program will conclude with four successful vendors, which will provide 'multiple options' for potential DoD partners to carry the designs forward — meaning that 'there will likely not be a single ‘winner’ who is picked.' Additionally, the drones should be able to carry 'multiple types of kinetic payloads (blast, shaped charge, etc.),' including the capability for electronic warfare and signals intelligence 'if desired.' Overall the Artemis effort aims to deliver a capability in dire need on the modern battlefield highlighted by the conflict in Ukraine, where drones have formed the tip of the spear of frontline fighting. As the war has dragged on, dense electronic warfare has disrupted the use of many systems, leading to interest in alternative navigational techniques, like terrain mapping, so that drones can avoid interference and dodge detection by emitting fewer signals that can be picked up by sensors. Operators additionally try to fly systems as low as possible, hugging the curvature of the earth, to avoid adversary radar. When the solicitation for Artemis was announced, DIU also asked for systems that can carry a payload of at least 10 kg, with a goal of over 25 kg. The solicitation further asked for platforms that can incorporate third-party software and hardware systems in a 'modular, warm-swappable manner,' and that 'proprietary interfaces, message formatting, or hardware that require vendor-specific licensing are not permitted.' 'Project Artemis goals are directly tied to observations of current real world combat conditions as well as feedback from end users across the DoD on what capabilities may be needed in this space to face near peer threat capabilities around the world,' the DIU release says. Through the Artemis program, DIU and the Pentagon’s acquisition and sustainment office 'are moving rapidly to provide an option for Services and Combatant Commands to choose from, delivered years in advance of current Program of Record timeframes.'

The Navy needs a 180-degree pivot: Embracing autonomy and AI for maritime dominance	The unmanned surface vessel Mariner transits the Pacific Ocean during Integrated Battle Problem (IBP) 23.2, Sep. 7, 2023. IBP 23.2 is a Pacific Fleet exercise to test, develop and evaluate the integration of unmanned platforms into fleet operations to create warfighting advantages. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jesse Monford) The United States Navy stands at a critical juncture, and as the global maritime landscape evolves, so too must our approach to maintaining naval supremacy. As it stands now, the navy is incapable of being active in three simultaneous theaters, lacks the depth in munitions, ships, and personnel for sustained combat operations, and struggles to produce the necessary warships, using outdated concepts from World War II and the Cold War. Which is to say, almost every part of the system is flawed. To address these challenges, the Navy must pivot away from large, costly platforms and embrace mass production and customizability. The service’s guiding philosophy should focus on autonomous systems, AI, cyber, electronic warfare, and distributed lethality, and include a cultural shift toward viewing software programmers as key partners for sailors. Unmanned surface and subsurface ships are at a similar development stage as unmanned aircraft were a decade ago. However, the maturity curve and adoption of drone ships will proceed much more rapidly than it has for comparable aircraft. This is due to two simple reasons: AI’s rapid development is providing a springboard that aerial drones a decade ago did not have, and sea drone production will benefit from the lessons learned from aerial drones. While manned vessels will never fully go away, the Navy should pivot away from its long held 355 ship target — which is proving unrealistic from a production standpoint anyway — and instead plan for tens of thousands of mostly smaller and relatively autonomous vessels, many of which will be tailored, specialized platforms for specific mission sets. With the White House announcing a wholesale overhaul of shipbuilding, this new direction will ensure that the United States become the global leaders for producing these new ships of the future, rather than investing in rebuilding the shipyards of the past. The Navy must also miniaturize its surface fleet. Swarms of smaller, modular vessels like patrol boats and gunboats should be deployed near coastlines, offering a deterrent and fast-response force without a major shipyard overhaul. These ships are cheaper to produce and deploy, particularly in contested or crowded areas. Thousands of drones, like the Orca, a large autonomous submarine designed for intelligence and mine hunting currently under development, could provide a persistent presence in contested waters. In addition, the era of manned Naval aircraft should end. Manned aircraft necessitate large aircraft carriers, which in turn require other ships for protection. Moving away from large ships to smaller, autonomous vessels is crucial. This shift will allow the Navy to leverage massive fleets of small and autonomous surface and subsurface drones, acting as force multipliers for surveillance, reconnaissance, and logistics support. Cancel F/A-XX, the Navy’s future sixth-generation air superiority fighter and invest that money into unmanned systems. Large numbers of aerial drones can enhance naval operations with intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, extending the Navy’s eyes and ears without endangering its manned sea vessels. Combat operations in the Middle East and Europe show that swarming drones, specialized drones, and cheap, attritable drones that function as munitions dramatically reshape the battlefield. While longer ranges will require larger unmanned systems due to weight and power, systems designed to operate without a pilot will still be smaller than manned fighters. The current Navy continues to be locked in a mindset of scarcity. If the manufacturing base is mobilized and money is provided, the US Navy should set its sights on millions of drones per year, which over time will become larger and more sophisticated: The current manned aircraft fleet will not disappear overnight, but instead over 10 to 15 years as they age out. Similar to the ships, the production of drones at scale is much simpler than hand building Joint Strike Fighters, and challenging industry to produce them by the millions is possible. If we could produce over 300,000 aircraft during World War II, we should be able to mass produce a million drones today. What is certain, is that if we do not try, then we will not succeed. The Navy's 180-degree pivot towards mass production, customization, and the integration of autonomous systems and AI is essential if the US is to maintain maritime dominance. By embracing these changes, the Navy can effectively counter emerging threats and ensure the free flow of goods and resources. Failing to fix our broken Navy is nonnegotiable. Fortunately, the change that is needed is affordable, and achievable. It is up to the Congress, which has the constitutional duty to 'provide and maintain a Navy,' to supply the funding, flexibility, and moral support needed to make this fix. Retired US Army Maj. Gen. John G. Ferrari is a senior nonresident fellow at AEI. Ferrari previously served as a director of program analysis and evaluation for the service.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/the-navy-needs-a-180-degree-pivot-embracing-autonomy-and-ai-for-maritime-dominance/	2025-03-14T07:17:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/unmanned-surface-vessell-scaled-e1741876860235.jpg
Hegseth orders ‘disestablishing’ of Office of Net Assessment	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered the 'disestablishing' of the Pentagon’s Office of Net Assessment, a key office responsible for high-level strategic analysis, according to a memo obtained by Breaking Defense. The memo, dated March 13 and signed by Hegseth, directs the Pentagon’s Performance Improvement Officer and Director of Administration and Management to reassign all civilian employees to other 'mission critical positions' inside the department, while military personnel will return to their service to receive new billets. Simultaneously, the Pentagon’s top acquisition official is directed to 'ensure that the necessary steps are taken' by department contracting authorities to terminate 'all ONA contracts awarded for ONA and ONA-related requirements.' A number of DC think tanks and research organizations will likely be impacted by these cancelled contracts. However, it appears ONA will live on in some manner: the memo directs the deputy secretary of defense to provide a plan in 30 days to rebuild the office in a manner 'consistent with [Hegseth’s] priorities.' The Pentagon did not directly return a request for comment. At roughly the time this story was published, Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell sent out a public statement that said 'This decision ensures that our resources are focused on the most pressing national security challenges while maintaining accountability and efficiency.' Founded in 1973, the Office of Net Assessment is sometimes referred to as the Pentagon’s internal think tank due to its role providing classified, long-term strategic-level studies on threats, trends, risks and opportunities that could shape the geopolitical environment 20 to 30 years in the future. Jim Baker, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, took over ONA in 2015 following the retirement of Andrew Marshall, its founding director who was often referred to as the 'Pentagon’s Yoda.' The Washington Post reported in 2015 that Baker’s appointment reflected then-Defense Secretary Ashton Carter’s interest in receiving assessments related to near-term threats as well as the long-term studies the office was known for. On Feb. 7, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, (R-Iowa), sent a letter to Hegseth questioning whether the office’s purpose was still necessary and asking for information related to ONA’s production net assessments since 2007 and the last decade of contracts. 'I remain concerned that ONA is not performing its mission for the taxpayer and has engaged in financial waste,' he wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/hegseth-orders-disestablishing-of-office-of-net-assesment/	2025-03-13T15:08:49-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
Who’s Who in Defense: Michael Waltz, National Security Advisor (NSA)	Responsibilities As the 29th U.S. National Security Advisor, Waltz is a key aide to President Donald Trump, advising him on national security issues and foreign policy. In his new role, Waltz leads the National Security Council, which is tasked with coordinating multiple federal agencies. Historically, the job of the NSA can be either high or low profile, but it demands quick pivots and cool-headed thinking under the threat of any volatilities. Perhaps the most well-known NSA remains Henry Kissinger, who left an indelible mark on U.S. foreign policy while serving under President Richard Nixon (1969 &#8211; 1976). Quote 'Iran will continue to stoke unrest because they want to destroy Israel. Making concession after concession to Iran is actually what is destabilizing the situation.' Stated Priorities Political Career Military Service The first Green Beret elected to Congress, Waltz served in the Army and National Guard for 27 years, retiring as colonel in the Army Special Forces. He was deployed to Afghanistan, the Middle East and Africa while on active duty (1996-2000), and served in the National Guard (2000-2025). Business/Private Sector Public Service Prior to joining the private sector, Waltz worked in the Bush administration, serving as defense policy director for Secretaries of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Robert Gates. He also served as a counterterrorism advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney and helped create a funding and strategy for counternarcotics in Afghanistan and South Asia while working in the office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics. Early Years Michael George Glen Waltz was born in Boynton Beach, FL, on January 31, 1974, and was raised in Jacksonville by his mother. Both his father and grandfather were chiefs in the Navy. Education Graduated from Virginia Military Institute with a B.A degree in International Studies. Named an honor graduate. Personal In 2021, Waltz married Julia Nesheiwat, an American academic and a former military intelligence officer. During the span of her career, she has held senior national security and economic policy positions under the administrations of George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Donald Trump, becoming his 10th Homeland Security Advisor in 2021. She and Waltz live in Boynton Beach.

NRO, MDA pulled out of annual DC Satellite conference due to travel restrictions	The DC Convention Center on Mt. Vernon Square, NW, hosted the Satellite 2025 conference this month. (Photo by Gerald Martineau/The The Washington Post via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — This week's Satellite 2025/GovMilSpace show appears to be the latest defense conference impacted by the Trump administration's Feb. 26 executive order restricting 'non-essential' travel by federal officials and the sweeping cost-cutting spree being spearheaded by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Officials from the National Reconnaissance Office and the Missile Defense Agency had planned to exhibit, but cancelled last minute following the executive order, spokespeople confirmed to Breaking Defense. However, officials from other Pentagon-based agencies — including the Space Development Agency and the Defense Innovation Union — made scheduled appearances on stage, a reflection of the confusion that has swirled around what is and isn't allowed under the executive order. The National Reconnaissance Office's Director's Innovation Initiative, a research and development program aimed at leveraging commercial capabilities, canceled a planned exhibit prior to the satellite show's launch on March 10, an agency spokesperson confirmed. The office is housed at NRO headquarters in Chantilly, Va. 'The presence of NRO’s Director's Innovation Initiative at Satellite 2025 was curtailed in accordance with the latest Executive Order and DoD guidance regarding conference attendance and non-essential travel,' the spokesperson said. Likewise, the Missile Defense Agency's Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer office, headquartered in Huntsville, Ala., also canceled its planned exhibit, with a spokesperson citing the DOGE-related ban on non-essential travel and freezes all use of federal credit cards, While not defense related, NASA's Space Communications and Navigation program office staffed an information booth for the first two days of the show, but abruptly shut it down on the third day. The program office is headquartered at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio but also has local support officials at NASA's Space Operations Directorate. A spokesperson from the NASA Space Communications and Navigation program did not respond by press time to a request for comment about the rationale for the booth's closure. It's unclear if the NRO and MDA attendance was impacted at all by a March 5 memo [PDF], signed by Darin Selnick who is performing the duties of the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, which limits any charges above one dollar on government-issued civilian travel charge cards. In general, government agencies usually are required to pay an upfront fee to register an exhibit space at a trade show — although neither NRO nor MDA was able to confirm if that was the case for Satellite 2025/GovMilSpace. An official at Access Intelligence responsible for booking exhibitors at the show did not return a request for comment about the issue by press time. The non-existence of the NRO and MDA exhibits did not go unnoticed by satellite communications industry officials in attendance at the show, exacerbating fears about how future military trade shows could be affected. That the NRO office is local enough to not require travel costs but still pulled out may raise eyebrows. Attendance by Air Force and Space Force officials and military personnel at the annual Air &amp; Space Forces Association (AFA) Warfare Symposium held March 3-5 in Colorado was sparse, due to travel restrictions imposed by the Department of the Air Force. Further, as first reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, the Air Force Materiel Command’s Life Cycle Management Center has canceled its annual industry seminar, called Life Cycle Industry Days, planned for July 28-29 in Dayton, Ohio. The service cited the Feb. 26 executive order as driving the decision.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/nro-mda-pulled-out-of-annual-dc-satellite-conference-due-to-travel-restrictions/	2025-03-13T12:36:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/dc-convention-center-scaled-e1741893124216.jpg
FCC launches new Council for National Security to counter threats from China	Telecommunication tower with mesh dots, glittering particles for wireless telecommunication technology (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr announced today the launch of the Council for National Security within the agency aimed at fending off foreign bad actors, particularly China. 'Today, the country faces a persistent and constant threat from foreign adversaries, particularly the CCP [Chinese Communist Party],' Carr said in a news release today. 'These bad actors are always exploring ways to breach our networks, devices, and technology ecosystem. It is more important than ever that the FCC remain vigilant and protect Americans and American companies from these threats.' The council will be headed by Adam Chan, a former associate at the Boyden Gray PLLC law firm, per the release. Today’s announcement outlines three focus areas for the council. The first is to reduce the US’s dependencies on foreign adversaries regarding tech and telecommunications supply chains. Second is to 'mitigate' the US’s vulnerabilities to surveillance, espionage and cyberattacks. Lastly, the council will 'ensure' that the US outpaces China in its race to develop and deploy 'critical technologies' such as 5G, 6G, artificial intelligence, satellites and space, quantum, robotics, autonomous systems, and the internet of things. The FCC and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) are the two organizations responsible for setting US spectrum policy, and governing which users get access when to what bandwidths for what functions. The FCC regulates commercial spectrum usage while the NTIA is responsible for advocating for spectrum usage for military departments. The announcement comes against the background of a tug-of-war between commercial providers and the Defense Department over usage of key parts of the spectrum, specifically between the 1 GhZ (gigahertz) to 6 GHz range, which makes up the 3.1-3.45 and 3.5 GHz S-band — widely considered to be the 'Goldilocks' zone of the spectrum. The DoD has contended that this part of the spectrum band is essential for its various satellite communications, radars and navigation systems. However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike. When it comes to the fight over the spectrum, John Sherman, former DoD chief information officer and now dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University, previously told Breaking Defense that 'it is a zero sum game' for the DoD. 'There is finite spectrum, and the physics of the spectrum, about the desirability of the lower [3 GHz band] both for our target acquisition radars and for 5G, this makes it very difficult,' he said. Carr is viewed as someone who supports the commercial sector over DoD on the spectrum fight. While there are likely a multitude of reasons as to why Carr is making this move, including the recent attacks on the US telecommunications sector facilitated by Chinese threat actor Salt Typhoon, supporters of the Pentagon may look at today's news with a wary eye.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/fcc-launches-new-council-for-national-security-to-counter-threats-from-china/	2025-03-13T11:30:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_antenna_network_GettyImages-1306156001-scaled-e1660843825841.jpg
New bill would create commission to investigate state of American shipbuilding	The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), front, passes the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush (CVN 77) as it departs Norfolk Naval Shipyard after completing a 10-month regularly scheduled extended carrier incremental availability. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Steven Edgar) WASHINGTON — Three House lawmakers today introduced legislation to establish a congressional commission to 'investigate the condition of the U.S. maritime industry and impediments to its growth.' The bill, dubbed the 'Save Our Shipyards Act,' is co-sponsored by Reps. Mark Green, R-Tenn., Jen Kiggans, R-Va., and Don Davis, D-N.C. If passed into law, the bill would establish a 'national commission on the maritime industrial base.' 'With a laser focus on the needs of the American military, the commission will develop actionable policy recommendations to revitalize our maritime industrial base,' according to a statement from the lawmakers. The state of American shipbuilding was pushed into the spotlight last week when President Donald Trump announced during an address to Congress the establishment of a new White House office focused on the subject. Green is the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security while Davis and Kiggans are both members on the House Armed Services Committee. Historically, legislation related to national security rarely receives standalone votes on the House floor. Rather, members submit their legislation as amendments to the annual defense policy bill. When asked about a path forward, a spokesman for Green told Breaking Defense, 'With bipartisan support, and a broad recognition of this crisis on both sides of the aisle, we are exploring all options. This includes a standalone vote as well as an amendment to the must-pass NDAA.' Even if the legislation is passed, congressional committees occasionally face stumbling blocks in their early days from a somewhat unlikely source — the lawmakers who established them. Such was the fate of an independent commission that lawmakers established in 2022 to offer policy recommendations for the US Navy’s force structure. That commission severely lagged in starting its work due to some lawmakers failing to appoint their respective commissioners. Separately, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and other lawmakers have been touting their own shipbuilding-focused legislation, dubbed the 'Ships For America Act.' That bill, among other things, would create a maritime czar inside the executive branch oversees shipbuilding issues that touch both the Pentagon and the Transportation Department. Notably, that legislation also had explicit support from former Rep. Mike Waltz, who is now Trump’s national security advisor.

Don’t let ‘efficiency’ result in looser standards for defense contractors	U.S. Army Reserve soldiers receive an overview of Washington D.C. as part of the 4th Annual Day with the Army Reserve May 25, 2016. The event was led by the Private Public Partnership office. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker) Christopher Kubasik — CEO of L3Harris Technologies, Inc. and Chairman of the Aerospace Industries Association — recently published an open letter to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), recommending the elimination of Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) in the name of efficiency. It’s a clever attempt to position a traditional defense contractor as an ally of new thinking, but it comes with a big caveat: Eradicating these standards would only promote more Pentagon waste. As Kubasik explains, Congress established Cost Accounting Standards to protect taxpayers from misallocated costs or unreasonable expenses in military contracts. This remains true today. CAS are a set of accounting principles used to price certain government contracts — specifically, what are known as 'cost-based' contracts. These are contracts that are priced based on the actual or expected cost of performing the work. Without CAS, contractors could essentially charge the government whatever they want — regardless of actual costs incurred. Kubasik argues that Cost Accounting Standards are duplicative because contractors are already required to comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), suggesting that they 'replace' CAS. But Cost Accounting Standards serve an entirely different purpose than GAAP. GAAP provides the basis for financial reporting at the highest level, the 30,000-foot view of a company’s financial performance, including its cash flows and profitability. GAAP are enforced by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to protect investors — so that they have a full understanding of a company’s financial position, including assets and liabilities. GAAP exists to provide financial information about companies so that investors and creditors can make informed decisions before investing or extending credit to companies. The SEC does not concern itself with the minutiae of contract costing — or the process through which companies determine how to charge the government on cost-based government contracts. In fact, the government established Cost Accounting Standards in 1970 because the General Accounting Office (now known as the Government Accountability Office, an arm of Congress) concluded that GAAP were inadequate for determining how companies allocate costs to relevant government contracts. This reality has not changed, and Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are inappropriate for companies to use in determining the costs that should be charged to government contracts. In contrast, Cost Accounting Standards provide contractors with criteria to measure and assign costs to specific contracts. It outlines how to allocate costs between government contracts and non-Federal work — guidance that is still absent from GAAP. Cost Accounting Standards are also the mechanism through which the government recoups funds when contractors do not consistently apply established cost accounting practices, charging the government for unreasonable costs. The ability to recover taxpayer dollars improperly charged by contractors is vital to effective oversight, without which inefficient spending abounds. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles do not enable the government to recoup such costs. One need only confer with recent history to understand the importance of Cost Accounting Standards. In 2020 the Defense Contract Management Agency reported over $3.1 billion in CAS compliance issues in active litigation with contractors. That amount did not include informal disputes that had not yet ripened into litigation. Far from pesky red tape, the Cost Accounting Standards enable the government to hold contractors accountable for wasteful spending. So while Pentagon contractors may claim that they find CAS to be burdensome, they provide the government critical insight into the costs of performing a government contract. Without these standards, the government, on behalf of American taxpayers, would not be able to meaningfully challenge contractors when they engage in overcharging. Efficient spending requires contractor accountability. The Pentagon cannot monitor performance on military contracts without visibility into contractors’ cost expenditures. The government not only uses this cost information for current contracts, but also to price future contracts. Absent the cost information provided by Cost Accounting Standards, the government is at the mercy of contractors to provide accurate and complete contract cost information without accounting gimmicks. There is no doubt that the absence of these standards would result in increased contract costs. Without Cost Accounting Standards, the Pentagon loses much of its ability to hold contractors accountable for unreasonable expenses borne by the government, increasing military spending in both the short and long-term. Eliminating these standards would be irresponsible, resulting in potentially billions of dollars in wasteful spending at the expense of taxpayers.

A nuclear Poland? Logistics, political challenges ahead of potential Warsaw deal	A general view taken on March 7, 2025 shows MPs listening to the speech of Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk on the situation in Ukraine at the plenary hall of Poland's parliament in Warsaw. (WOJTEK RADWANSKI/AFP via Getty Images) WARSAW and WASHINGTON — Last week, Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk stood in front of the parliament and gave a speech on the state of European security. And in it, he made eyebrows all across the world raise up with a declaration that his government was open to joining up with a nuclear security effort proposed by Paris. 'We must also look more boldly into the future when it comes to arms technology. We are seriously talking to the French about their idea of a nuclear umbrella over Europe,' Tusk said. 'It is high time for Poland, using not only the resources it has, but also its own experience, experience on the battlefield, Ukrainian experience, to look more boldly at our possibilities concerning the most modern weapons. 'At the moment — I say this with full responsibility — purchases of conventional weapons, the most traditional ones, are not enough.' It’s an extraordinary statement, but one that experts say should not be a full surprise, given Poland’s longstanding fears about Russia, its aggressiveness in rearming since the Ukraine invasion, and the clear signals from Washington that the NATO alliance may not be as iron clad as believed for decades. Artur Kacprzyk of the Polish Institute of International Affairs says the timing of Tusk’s comment reflects real world politics. 'It is possible that a national nuclear option is being floated by the Polish government to convince the U.S. not to weaken security guarantees for Poland at the time when the Trump administration seeks a reset with Russia and indicated it would cut military presence in Europe,' Kacprzyk told Breaking Defense. 'Poland’s history makes it very clear why they are concerned that the people they align with, and the people they rely on for protection from Russia, will abandon them,' Jon Wolfsthal, a former US government official now with the Federation of American Scientists, told Breaking Defense. Tusk’s comments are likely 'a signal of concern — maybe to motivate the United States, but clearly designed to play on the French and perhaps the British. But I think it’s also an open, transparent signal for concern in trying to figure out how they protect themselves.' Added Marek Świerczyński, head of the security and international affairs desk at the Polityka Insight center for policy analysis based in Warsaw, 'Tusk's declaration that ‘Poland must reach for the most modern possibilities also related to nuclear weapons and modern unconventional weapons’ … must be recognized that it is the most far-reaching [nuclear statement] because it comes from the prime minister, in parliament and at a time of rebuilding the European security order.' It doesn't appear the issue is going away anytime soon. On Thursday, Polish President Andrzej Duda, a political opponent of Tusk, called for the US to base nuclear weapons on Polish soil. But analysts tell Breaking Defense that the issue comes with major logistical, and geopolitical, hurdles. In the early 1960s, the Polish Army was equipped with two Soviet nuclear-capable weapons, the 8K11 and 3R10 missiles. Due to their low accuracy, they could only be effectively used as carriers of 3N14 nuclear warheads. Twelve of the MiG-21PFM aircraft delivered to Poland were also adapted to carry nuclear weapons. In the mid-1960s, Polish-Soviet talks resulted in an agreement to build three nuclear weapons depots inside Poland, based on Soviet plans, each equipped with two nuclear weapons stores. According to initial plans, they were to store 178 nuclear warheads, which were to be carried by 8K11 and 3R10 missiles. Construction of the depots began in 1967 and was completed in January 1970. Then the depots were transferred to the Northern Group of Soviet Forces, which was to take care of the charges until the outbreak of war with NATO, in which case control was to be transferred to the Polish Army. According to disclosed data, in the mid-1980s they stored 14 500-kT warheads, 83 10-kT warheads, two 200-kT bombs, 24 15-kT bombs and 10 0.5-kT bombs. In 1991, Poland announced that they would remove the nuclear capable delivery systems from their weapons inventory. Still, questions inside Poland about whether it benefits them to have nuclear weapons in country has persisted. They only gained energy after the Ukraine invasion, when Poland launched a dramatic reinvention of its armed forces. Tusk’s statement isn’t even the first time a recent prime minister raised the issue: In June 2023, then-Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki declared his interest in hosting nuclear weapons under the NATO umbrella. But the push has new energy given the events of the last few weeks: the dramatic White House meeting between US President Donald Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the statements from European leaders that they can no longer rely on America as a partner, and Trump’s further statements that he may not feel obligated to protect NATO nations in case of a conflict. According to a Feb. 21 poll, 52.9 percent of surveyed Poles supported the idea of Poland having its own nuclear weapons, with 27.9 percent against. Support for the nuclear option is likely to increase if Poland’s security environment deteriorates further, especially if Russia scores a victory in its war against Ukraine, and the US reduces its military presence in Europe and commitment to NATO.

This year's parliamentary elections will be held in Poland on October 15th. (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense emphasized that Tusk’s statement was fairly broad, and details are fairly scant. Świerczyński noted that 'we must first know what we are talking about, and unfortunately both President Emmanuel Macron's proposal and Prime Minister Donald Tusk's statement do not make this task any easier.' At a base level, though, Świerczyński feels Tusk made a mistake even talking publicly about the concept. 'It is not like partners, competitors or — most of all — enemies would look on idly at some hypothetical-theoretical ‘Polish nuclear program,’' he said. 'In this sense, I am angry with the Prime Minister for talking about it at all, because these matters are so sensitive that it is better to talk about them as little as possible and do as much as possible — quietly, without bragging or even showing the effects, although this is difficult for a politician.' What a French nuclear umbrella for Poland would look like is unclear. A former defense official, speaking on background, told Breaking Defense that 'In Europe, the United Kingdom and France, which possess relatively small nuclear arsenals, would be hard-pressed to replace the backstop provided by U.S. conventional and nuclear forces on behalf of the continent absent a different approach to requirements or costly changes in force diversity and size.' In theory, Wolfsthal said, 'France has nuclear subs, so potentially those could be at the disposal of Europe, and if you put French troops on the border with Russia that means France is committed to protect those troops, and that’s a tripwire.' But, he emphasized, such a shift would require a radical posture change for France. As first reported by Breaking Defense, the F-35 was certified to carry and deploy the B61-12 tactical nuclear weapon in October 2023; Poland is currently in the process of procuring 32 of the stealth fighters, which will all be delivered by 2029. However, the F-35 isn’t qualified to carry any French nuclear weapons, so teaming up with Paris would likely require alternatives — whether bringing old Mirage 2000s back into service or having some of France’s limited nuclear-capable Rafales stationed inside the country. While Tusk did not rule out a domestic nuclear effort, Poland developing its own nuclear program is almost surely unrealistic, according to Kacprzyk, both for logistical and geopolitical reasons. 'While Poland could perhaps produce first explosive nuclear devices within a few years of a determined effort, it would take much longer to obtain a credible nuclear arsenal,' he said. 'Risks would be related to the detection of such a nuclear program by Russia and allies alike.' 'While pursuing nuclear weapons, Poland would have to contend with the risk of Russia using force to prevent such a program from being successful,' Kacprzyk added. However, he noted that if Poland sees risk at being abandoned by the US, Warsaw would 'be at high risk of Russian aggression anyway.' Added Wolfsthal, 'If NATO’s in shambles and Poland says we need a nuke, wherever they build it, those become instant targets. It becomes very unstable and very volatile very quickly.' And how Poland’s allies might react is also unclear. In theory, Warsaw could face sanctions or isolation for violating the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), but realistically, Poland would be taking action in conjunction with other European nations. By acting jointly in the future, European countries could pool their knowledge, resources, and infrastructure and make it more difficult for Russia to try to forcibly prevent nuclear weapons programs' Kacprzyk observed. But the political fallout would be wide, said the former Pentagon official, because 'a decision by even one of our democratic allies or partners to actually cross the nuclear weapons threshold is not something the NPT is likely to be able to survive.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/a-nuclear-poland-logistics-political-challenges-ahead-of-potential-warsaw-deal/	2025-03-13T07:29:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/tusk-speech-poland-e1741872542639.jpg
Iron Drone Raider is at the cutting edge of autonomous drone defense	The array of counter unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) in the global defense marketplace share a common limitation. Almost all of them require a human in the loop to be effective. Iron Drone Raider does not. It represents a new generation of autonomous defense in which detecting, classifying, and defeating hostile drones is executed more efficiently, more cheaply and more persistently than ever. The Iron Drone system comes from Ondas Autonomous Systems (Nasdaq: ONDS), a newly organized defense tech competitor in the drone defense space. The system leverages the Israeli expertise of Ondas' subsidiary, Airobotics, in developing fully autonomous drone systems, and includes features that were integrated under the real-time pressure of combat. The Iron Drone system is provided in the USA by another Ondas' subsidiary, American Robotics, which specializes in complex drone operations in military and civilian environments. Development of the Iron Drone system began in 2016 and accelerated following the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict in 2023. For much of the year that followed, scores of hostile drones were intercepted in the greater Tel Aviv area where Airobotics is located. The consistent round-the-clock threat of drone attacks and the need to take them down without collateral damage reinforced the Iron Drone Raider team’s conviction that an autonomous approach to CUAS is essential. 'We saw that the traditional contractors in defense were having a hard time here in Israel to maintain the agility to keep up with combat. The enemy is very agile, industry is not,' says Meir Kliner, CEO of Airobotics and President of Ondas Autonomous Systems. As in Ukraine, the threat to populated areas in Israel from both long and short-range drones quickly mutated from remotely controlled, radio frequency (RF) linked UAVs to pre-programmed and autonomous air vehicles capable of navigating to and striking targets without command and control. Opportunities for drone detection and mitigation narrowed with correspondingly shorter interception timelines and increasing probability of collateral damage. The Iron Drone system is a response to these realities, a platform that offers persistently-aware, human-independent, reusable and low-collateral drone defense without relying on RF sensing for detection or defeat. Iron Drone Raider System Ready to Deploy 24/7. Agile, Autonomous &amp; Modular The Raider drone is the core of the Iron Drone system. It is a high-performance interceptor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) derived from high-speed racing drones. The eight-pound (4 kg), eight-rotor UAV can launch from the surface to intercept hostile rotary-wing or fixed-wing drones at ranges out to a few miles at drone racer speeds while carrying a 2.2-pound payload. The primary payload is a ballistic net which Raider uses to capture Class-1 UAS. The Raider interceptor is deployed from a ground-based box which can hold up to three Raiders to respond to multiple hostile drones. The system integrates adjacent ground-based radar engineered to detect and identify low-altitude drones at ranges out to several miles. Iron Drone can also leverage networked sensors to increase detection ranges. When an incoming drone is detected, the Raider launches from the box and rapidly flies to the target area using ground sensor guidance. It autonomously shifts to its own onboard micro-radar, thermal and optical sensor-based guidance once the threat is in close proximity. It then identifies the target using proprietary computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Raider locks on to the target and dynamically maneuvers into position to fire its net at close range with the adversary drone. The net incapacitates the drone which falls to the ground. An optional net-parachute slows its descent to reduce impact risk over populated areas and preserves the hostile UAV for examination for intelligence or other purposes. Raider provides live video as the entire sequence unfolds autonomously, obviating the need for human-actuated launch and intercept control, significantly shortening response time. Following the interception, Raider returns to the launch site, lands in a predetermined place, is retrieved and undergoes simple maintenance. It is fitted with a new net or other payload, and placed back in its launch pod where it is recharged and ready for reuse. 'We believe we have developed the most mature, robust and combat proven CUAS system currently in the defense market. The system presents next the level of drone autonomy, with no need for human intervention for detection, capable of maneuvering and intercepting small and medium drones no matter how they navigate,' Kliner says, adding that in addition to its instantaneous readiness, the Iron Drone system yields cost benefits from eliminating active remote pilots to lowering the training burden for system operators. 'Within the box you have a couple drones. You just need to plug it into [24 volt] power and it works,' vice president of marketing, Eitan Rotberg, explains. 'You don’t need to charge batteries, you don’t need to add the payload. The drones are ready to go and they’re well-trained.' A network of Iron Drone systems can be deployed to military bases, front-line operating areas/forward command posts, borders or to protect critical infrastructure. Small in size, they can travel with forces in the field on platforms from Humvees and helicopters to manned or autonomous maritime vessels. Already integrated with sensor and command-control systems from leading integrators, the Iron Drone Raider system is agnostic, ready to plug and play with new sensor and C2 system providers in as little two weeks. Its modularity extends to payloads with kinetic options for CUAS and other missions now in development. Raider components can also be sourced from multiple providers and can be Blue-UAS certified to meet U.S. requirements. 'It’s pretty impressive what you can do with this drone,' Kliner affirms. 'It opens a lot of options.' Proven in Israel, Poised To Produce and Deploy in America As it gains combat experience and sees expanded production in Israel, the Iron Drone system is poised to expand to new markets. In the US, Ondas’ American Robotics expects to engage technology partners to support demand for defense and homeland security markets. Iron Drone’s flexibility has been recognized in the Middle East where a major military and a renowned defense contractor placed orders for the system in 2024. It is already operational and proving itself daily, generating feedback that goes directly to the Israeli developer, Airobotics. Eric Brock, chairman and CEO of Ondas Holdings (Nasdaq: ONDS), the parent company of Ondas Autonomous Systems, has guided the growth of Ondas’ drone business since it acquired American Robotics in 2021 and Airobotics in 2023. Ondas’ vision has been to perfect Iron Drone in Israel before introducing it to the U.S. defense market. 'It was actually a blessing to develop this from the urgency of need, from combat pressure,' Brock reflects. 'Now, as we’ve gone operational, we’re devoting resources to bring this technology to other markets.' In addition to Iron Drone, Ondas Autonomous Systems is providing an intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance (ISR) drone system called Optimus to the public safety, first-responder, defense and commercial security markets. The dual-use Optimus System operates with the same level of autonomy as Iron Drone while undertaking aerial monitoring, inspection and other missions, providing overhead awareness for public safety and critical infrastructure or for homeland security and military installations. Optimus is in-use in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates’ largest and most populated city, with its police force. In the US, Optimus has already undergone a multi-month trial with the Massachusetts Department of Transportation Aeronautics Division and is being demonstrated in a large Northeast US city for major public safety operators. The system was also recently ordered by an important utility on the East Coast to help monitor and secure its infrastructure. A major Middle Eastern military has likewise begun deploying Optimus to secure military bases and sensitive border locations. Ondas Autonomous Systems’ early success with Optimus represents a feature which very few other CUAS providers can leverage – parallel commercial and defense revenue streams. Moreover, Iron Drone Raider and Optimus are complimentary systems, offering militaries, governments and municipalities the opportunity to combine autonomous drone based awareness with autonomous counter-drone defense. Iron Drone Raider System in Flight Tracking Hostile Drone. Iron Drone Raider will be progressively introduced to the United States defense market throughout 2025, As part of the effort, American Robotics will deploy its Iron Drone Demonstration Team to showcase Iron Drone to DoD in upcoming CUAS evaluation exercises and to potential defense industry partners with which the modular system can form comprehensive, layered counter drone solutions. 'We expect to have the Iron Drone Demo Team meeting with various U.S. customers in April,' Brock affirms. The team recently conducted a demonstration in Germany and more are planned. Ondas’ CEO affirms that as part of its outreach American Robotics looks forward to working with a variety of sensor and command-control providers in the US this year. In tandem with Optimus, American Robotics is in the process of establishing domestic Iron Drone production facilities and preparing to scale the system for the American market. As part of the process, it has adopted Palantir’s 'Foundry' enterprise resource platform to organize its operations and build out its supplier network. Utilizing Foundry further expands the integration potential of Iron Drone across traditional and emerging industry primes and presages U.S. market partnerships which American Robotics plans to announce in 2025. Ondas Autonomous Systems also envisions a broader production ecosystem with sufficient capacity to produce hardware for other providers to meet the scale that the growing global counter-drone market &#8211; valued at approximately $1.6 billion in 2023, projected to grow at a 27.8% CAGR to reach $14.9 billion by 2032 – will require. As the market expands, Ondas will continue to refine and diversify Iron Drone Raider, progressively improving its proprietary AI-based autonomy, organic navigation capability, and payload options. As Meir Kliner says, Iron Drone is the first of a new breed of smart CUAS solutions that effectively cut response times, cost, and command complexity. Iron Drone Raider is 'the intelligent counter-UAS drone that can operate in denied environments with precision and accuracy'.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/iron-drone-raider-is-at-the-cutting-edge-of-autonomous-drone-defense/	2025-03-13T06:24:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/Breaking-Defense_Main-Image.jpg
Amid ceasefire talks, Baltic defense leaders worry: What will Putin do with his battle-hardened army?	A Russian Il-76MD90A(E) large transport aircraft sits on display at Dubai Airshow 2023. (Tim Martin / Breaking Defense) BELFAST — In the days before a US- and Ukraine-endorsed ceasefire proposal was on the table, defense leaders from two other countries on the Russian border sounded the alarm that even if Russian President Vladimir Putin agrees to a deal, the reprieve may only allow Moscow to further consolidate its military and industrial might, and use it again in Ukraine or elsewhere. 'A lot will depend on what the peace talks' deliver, but 500,000 Russian troops will be battle-hardened and unlikely to want to return to civilian life earning $100 a month, Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's minister of defense told Breaking Defense. Likewise the Lithuanian minister of defense, Dovilė Šakalienė, recently warned that Russia's aggressive investment in its military-industrial complex was not just meant for Ukraine, but for 'expansion plans that Putin is voicing himself. Both Pevkur, who spoke to Breaking Defense at the Munich Security Conference last month, and Šakalienė, who spoke to several reporters at the Lithuanian embassy earlier this month, cited Putin's ambition to grow the military to 1.5 million troops, even as it loses thousands on the frontlines with Ukraine. That will include the standing up of new brigades and divisions close to Estonian and Finnish waters, Pevkur said. Russia's 'force posture will be around 50,000 to 60,000 troops,' said Pevkur. 'So we all understand that this is a totally different situation compared to today. Of course the risk assessment will go up, and we need to answer this with a very clear message &#8230; higher defense spending, more troops on the ground.' That investment will be necessary to match Russia's own, Šakalienė said and added, Russia's 'military capability is growing.' 'Even whilst waging full-scale war in Ukraine, they are able to replenish their losses on the battlefield,' she said. 'Their military industry capacity is growing, and the speed of production — both ammo and weapons — is growing. Chinese support is sufficient and consistent, and it's very helpful in their military capability building.' She said Russia is estimated to be spending some 40 percent of the federal budget, or around 9 percent of the country's entire GPD on its military forces, though she acknowledged financial figures coming out of Moscow may be unreliable. But if they're approximate, she said, that's more of an investment than Russia would need to maintain its war with Ukraine. Pevkur and Šakalienė's comments echo those made last year by the chiefs of defense of several Baltic and Nordic nations in interviews with Breaking Defense, some of whom predicted NATO had a three-to-five year 'window' to build up their militaries to deter Russia or, if necessary, defend against an attack. RELATED: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing &#8216;window' to prepare for Russia Alina Polyakova, president and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, agreed that in any post-war era, Europe will be 'dealing with, [a] battle-tested Russian army, a battle-tested navy and air force, and one that is also equipped, perhaps not with the most sophisticated, exquisite weapons, but with mass capabilities in the automated space in particular, and Europe doesn't have any of this.' 'Europe hasn't invested in drone capabilities, swarm capabilities in the air, in the sea and the ground,' she said. In Pevkur's view, Europe's readiness to prepare for a future Russian attack will be shaped by NATO's new capability targets, set to be announced in the summer, and the urgency with which member nations can rise to them. Supreme Allied Commander Europe Gen. Christopher Cavoli 'knows what is needed to defend the countries and to protect the people,' he said. 'For politicians, it is an obligation to explain to its population, to people, why we need to spend more on defense. Again, when this war will be over in Ukraine, Russia will have hundreds of thousands of troops ready to fight today — not tomorrow, today.' Polyakova said that there is an 'easy fix' for Europe to gain a competitive edge over Russia, regarding drone or aircraft mass capabilities: greater industrial investment. If 'we're talking about Europe's ability to defend itself and deter what happens in the post-war [era], Russia is going to be far more capable and it takes a long time to build tanks,' she explained. Instead, Europe can manufacture drones 'really quickly' and not a lot of training is required, added Polyakova. 'This is what Europe should be investing in now, their capabilities in the automated, future force readiness space. Ukraine is in an incredible position to provide all those capabilities. &#8230; They have the know-how and ability to build, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of drones that they could potentially, when there's peace and stability, export to every single NATO country.' Last year Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said the nation had produced over 1.5 million first-person-view drones in 2024 alone, according to the Kiev Independent.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-ceasefire-talks-baltic-defense-leaders-worry-what-will-putin-do-with-his-battle-hardened-army/	2025-03-13T04:27:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231114_dubai_russia_transport_MARTIN-e1699953553596.jpg
Saildrone, Palantir partner to use AI to streamline USV manufacturing, operations	Saildrone will deploy 20 of its Voyager USVs in support of 4th Fleet's Operation Southern Spear. (Photo courtesy of Saildrone.) WASHINGTON — National security tech giant Palantir and unmanned maritime tech firm Saildrone today announced a strategic partnership focused on utilizing artificial intelligence to bolster Saildrone's 'manufacturing, supply chain, and fleet operations.' 'Leveraging Palantir’s sophisticated manufacturing and AI tools will allow us to streamline manufacturing and radically enhance fleet capabilities,' said Richard Jenkins, Saildrone’s CEO. 'While others make promises about tomorrow's technology, we face complex global threats today. This partnership with Palantir ensures we deliver solutions today that outpace tomorrow’s threats.' Saildrone, a California-based company, has made a splash in recent years with the US Navy through its eponymously named, bright orange USVs which specialize in unclassified intelligence collection and data processing. Between the Navy and various civilian federal agencies, the company’s drones have been used for tracking narcotics trafficking, illegal fishing operations and compiling oceanographic data, among other things. The company in February announced it had begun a new iteration of operations in coordination with US 4th Fleet, dubbed 'Southern Spear.' That operation will focus on using unmanned and autonomous vehicles to 'support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking while learning lessons for other theaters,' according to a Navy officer overseeing the activities. The announcement also follows Palantir in December unveiling its 'Warp Speed' initiative, a 'manufacturing operating system' aimed at using AI to 'gain an advantage in dynamic production scheduling, engineering change management, automated visual inspection for quality, and more,' according to a company statement. Anduril Industries, L3Harris, Panasonic Energy of North America (PENA), and Shield AI were all included in Palantir's initial cohort for the initiative. 'We built Warp Speed to accelerate the organizations at the forefront of American reindustrialization — from the factory floor to the open ocean,' said Emily Nguyen, Palantir’s head of industrials. 'Saildrone is delivering the future of maritime AI, and we are extremely proud to provide software that supports the sustained competitive advantage of their USVs.' Palantir today is slated to host the sixth iteration of its artificial intelligence conference, dubbed AIPC. Investor’s Business Daily reported Palantir’s stock had climbed on Wednesday amid a 'sudden gloom' for other AI stocks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/saildrone-palantir-partner-to-use-ai-to-streamline-usv-manufacturing-operations/	2025-03-13T02:30:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250109-St-Thomas-200W-Radar-Voyagers-6741-scaled-e1738750883331.jpg
Shield AI names former Splunk CEO as new chief executive	The Shield AI logo is seen during defense industry exhibition in Kielce, Poland on September 3, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Shield AI has named former Splunk CEO Gary Steele as its new chief executive, with the autonomy firm’s co-founder Ryan Tseng stepping down and transitioning to the role of president. Steele, currently Cisco’s president for go-to-market, will take the reins at Shield AI on join its board of directors on May 13, the company announced today. With Tseng at the helm, Shield AI has grown from a small San Diego-based start up to one of the Pentagon’s so-called 'defense tech unicorns,' the name given to nontraditional defense firms that have received Silicon Valley backing and a stream of Defense Department contracts. Tseng founded Shield AI in 2015 with his brother Brandon, a former Navy SEAL who is currently the company’s president. 'Among my most important responsibilities has always been ensuring Shield AI is led by the absolute best person for the role,' Ryan Tseng said in a news release. 'Over the past year, with the demand for autonomy solutions at scale and the growth of our aircraft business, it became unmistakably clear that Shield AI required a leader with not only deep software expertise but proven experience scaling technology organizations. Gary Steele is the best leader for the next chapter of our growth.' Shield AI’s product list includes Hivemind, an artificial intelligence system that can pilot drones, and the V-Bat drone, which it produces in Dallas after acquiring original manufacturer Martin UAV in 2021. The company also contributed software that allowed the modified F-16 known as the X-62A VISTA to fly under AI control as part of DARPA’s Air Combat Evolution program. Last week, Shield AI announced the completion of a $240 million F-1 strategic funding round, which raised the company’s valuation to $5.3 billion. While a relative newcomer to the defense industry, Steele spent more than 30 years as a leader in the technology sector, leading Splunk before its acquisition by Cisco for $28 billion in 2024. He was previously CEO of cybersecurity firm Proofpoint, taking the company to its initial public offering. 'There is growing demand for advanced autonomy from defense industry leaders, and we also see an opportunity to expand beyond traditional defense applications to benefit larger commercial enterprises,' Steele said. 'I am proud to join this team and help bring this tremendous opportunity to bear, in partnership with Ryan and Brandon.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/shield-ai-names-former-splunk-ceo-as-new-chief-executive/	2025-03-12T13:10:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/shield-ai-scaled-e1741809329928.jpg

According to the solicitation posted today, the DAF is looking for vendors, technologies and system integrators to provide 'dual-use commercial products and/ or services' for cloud management and infrastructure for the platform’s development, security and operations (DevSecOps). DevSecOps is a framework that incorporates security practices into all phases of the software development cycle. 'Ideal solutions should be effective for workloads operating across multiple AWS [Amazon Web Services] GovCloud accounts; however, preference will be given to solutions which are agnostic of cloud service providers,' the request for information states. The RFI also states that industry solutions 'at a minimum' should be capable of managing, sustaining and deploying distributions of Kubernetes — the open-source container arrangement platform that automates the deployment and management of containerized software, otherwise known as packages of software that contain all the files needed to run an application independently of other software components in any environment, according to Amazon Web Services. Further, solutions should be compatible with Platform One’s Big Bang, the DoD’s 'trusted' open source DevSecOps platform which can cut the time it takes the department to approve software from years to 90 days utilizing authority to operate, or ATO, procedures, according to Platform One’s website. 'Product vendors should anticipate the need to include integration services within this effort either internally or in partnership with a systems integrator. System integrators without a vendor partnership will be considered if leveraging commercial and/or open-source tools in accordance with all applicable licenses,' the RFI reads. This effort to bolster Platform One comes after the Pentagon has affirmed its commitment to accelerating software development, as seen in a memo signed by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth last week. As Breaking Defense previously reported, the memo directed the Pentagon to adopt the Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), a streamlined method for procuring software programs bespoke to DoD requirements, as the preferred method for software development. Interested parties are to respond to the solicitation by March 31, per the RFI.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/daf-seeks-industry-feedback-to-strengthen-platform-one-devsecops-cloud-management/	2025-03-12T12:51:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230719_DVIDS_GIDE_computer_6733217-e1689799401542.jpg
DIU to start field testing quantum sensors in tough conditions	Air Force Research Laboratory scientists work on various technical platforms to accelerate quantum research and development of connected ultra-secure quantum communication to provide the best benefits to the Department of the Air Force and the warfighter. (US Air Force photo / Keith Lewis) WASHINGTON — While quantum computing hogs the hype — and the venture capital — military officers and officials increasingly see the biggest near-term possibilities in quantum sensors. Measuring the same kind of microscopic motion as atomic clocks, quantum magnetometers, gravitometers and more could help frontline forces navigate when GPS is jammed or hunt targets without conventional radar and sonar. But first, they have to work reliably outside the lab. To make that happen, the Pentagon’s outreach arm to Silicon Valley, the California-based Defense Innovation Unit, has just announced a slew of contracts to field test a dozen different quantum sensing systems. (This is similar to but separate from an ongoing DARPA effort to harden quantum sensors). The 18 vendors announced so far — another one or two might yet emerge from ongoing contract talks — include defense titans Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, established military-and-commercial players Honeywell and Leidos, upstart Anduril and a long list of smaller companies, many of them providing a single critical component to a larger team. 'It’s a good mixture of traditional primes, non-traditional defense, as well as emerging and startups and small business,' said Air Force Lt. Col. Nick Estep, DIU’s portfolio manager for emerging capabilities, in an exclusive interview with Breaking Defense. Using its preferred Commercial Solutions Opening process, DIU issued its initial solicitation just 10 months ago in May, sorted through more than 70 proposals, and got the most promising firms on contract, with many already at work. 'I would say roughly a dozen meaningful field tests are going to occur by the end of the fiscal year. &#8230; Some of these will be on small autonomous systems; some will be on manned aircraft; some will be ground tests.' DIU calls its project Transition of Quantum Sensors (TQS) because it’s working closely with DoD Quantum Tech Director John Burke, the Air Force, Navy and potential military users with the intention to identify mature technology, ruggedize it, test it, fix the inevitable glitches and hand it over to procurement programs for real-world operational deployment. 'I'm a scientist by trade,' said Estep, an electrical engineering PhD who’s worked in both academia and the National Reconnaissance Office. 'Our inclination is to optimize for as long as possible and build the best sensor you can possibly build in your lab. &#8230; It may have had some amazing performance for like five seconds in the lab when everyone stopped and held their breath, [but for the military] you can't deploy with five grad students and expect ideal thermal, moisture, and environmental conditions.' Traditional Pentagon procurement tends to perfect technology in ideal conditions, only to discover practical problems when it first goes to the field. Far better, the DIU team believes, to put an 80 percent solution in the field ASAP and find those flaws, and fix them, early on. For any given quantum sensor, Estep explained, 'we need to ruggedize it, integrate it with the controlling subsystems into a meaningful package, and answer: &#8216;How would we deploy it? How are we going to show functionality?' Because there's a lot of gremlins that pop out in that process. To do that, you have to learn a lot.' Trial and error is inevitable with new technology, he said, so he’s not expecting the first test articles to perform like the final product. 'These early field tests, we're not expecting them to hit the end operational objectives right away,' Estep said. 'Some of these I would expect to take several iterative cycles' over months or years. He emphasized, 'we expect to have some pretty notable outcomes even in 2025.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/diu-to-start-field-testing-quantum-sensors-in-tough-conditions/	2025-03-12T12:00:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/DVIDS-quantum-photo-scaled.jpg
Additional defense funds in reconciliation bill ‘may not be enough’: SASC chairman	Vice Chief of Naval Operations Jim Kilby and other services vice chiefs provide testimony at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services Committee-Subcommittee for Readiness of the Joint Force at the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C., May 16, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Chief Mass Communication Specialist William Spears) WASHINGTON — With the Pentagon increasingly likely to be locked into a yearlong continuing resolution for the first time ever, the head of the Senate Armed Services Committee said today that Congress may need to beef up the amount of funding it is pursuing for defense through a parallel process known as budget reconciliation. The House on Tuesday passed a stopgap spending bill expiring on Sept. 30 that would provide $892.5 billion for defense in fiscal 2025 — slightly higher than FY24 levels but below the $895 billion permitted by the Fiscal Responsibility Act. And while that gap may not seem huge by Pentagon standards, SASC Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss. is seizing on it to make the case that even more money needs to be added during the reconciliation process. 'The real flaw in in the CR that we'll be voting on later this week is that it doesn't provide enough money, regardless of the anomalies and the tiny plus ups here and there,' Wicker said during a SASC readiness subcommittee hearing today. 'Based on what is in this continuing resolution, $150 billion in the reconciliation bill may not be enough, and I'm hearing some comforting words from the administration, that they realize that too.' The House and Senate have each passed separate budget resolutions, kickstarting a path for Republicans to enact a laundry list of Trump administration funding priorities through a process called reconciliation, which allows the majority party with control of Congress to pass legislation without the threat of filibuster. The Senate budget resolution includes an additional $150 billion for defense, while the House version includes $100 billion. Wicker noted that the Trump administration has been aggressive in its goal of driving down government spending, adding that 'we all want fiscal responsibility.' However, he said, an additional boost to reconciliation funding for defense may been needed to address threats from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. Wicker, a defense hawk, has advocated for the United States to raise defense spending to 5 percent of its gross domestic production. Last year, as the committee’s top Republican, he pushed SASC to adopt an NDAA that would have supported a $923 billion defense topline (in conference, the House and Senate committees agreed on a lower funding level that would conform to FRA restrictions). In February, he told Breaking Defense that he hoped to secure a total $200 billion increase for defense in the budget reconciliation process, with funds to be used in FY25 and FY26. A continuing resolution is typically a stopgap that extends funding at prior-year levels for a short period of time. To try to mitigate negative impacts to the US military, the yearlong CR under consideration includes some additional funds — including $8 billion for US Central Command and US European Command, as well as plus-ups to certain shipbuilding programs. It also includes language meant to give the Pentagon additional flexibility, such as a provision that would allow the department to start certain new programs — a practice typically forbidden under a CR. While the House was able to pass the CR Tuesday evening in a mostly-party line vote, Senate Republicans will need support from a handful of Democrats in order to meet the 60 vote threshold that allows the Senate to proceed to a final vote on a bill. On the precipice of a March 14 deadline to pass a spending measure and avert a government shutdown, SASC members from both sides of the aisle groaned about the prospect of voting for a full-year CR. 'From a readiness standpoint, none of us think this is helpful,' said Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, who leads the readiness subcommittee. 'What would be worse, in my view, is a government shutdown.' Later in the hearing, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said he agreed with Sullivan's statement but thinks a short-term CR would have been preferable than a full year measure. 'Why do we have to accept, you know, half-assed over catastrophic?' he asked. A panel of the military services’ No. 2 officers told lawmakers that they were still working to understand the impact of the CR. Army Vice Chief of Staff James Mingus said the 'degree and severity is unknown,' with much dependent on the specific language of the bill and whether it contains 'anomalies,' or exceptions to CR-related funding restrictions. Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said the services’ readiness accounts 'are most vulnerable under a CR or sequestration,' and that 11 ships are at risk for missing maintenance availabilities under a full year CR. For the Air Force, a yearlong CR without anomalies would have $4 billion impact to readiness, said Lt. Gen. Adrian Spain, the services’ deputy chief of staff for operations. Mingus and Kilby said the services would benefit from greater budget flexibility, specifically for items such as drones or counterdrone systems, that would allow them to obligate funding more quickly or transfer that money to other systems if threats changed. Gen. Christopher Mahoney, the assistant commandant of the Marine Corps, cautioned that, while anomalies and budget flexibility are helpful, there is only so much the Marine Corps could do with a smaller budget. 'If there is only so much top line from which to flex … we're going to rob from one account to pay for another,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/additional-defense-funds-in-reconciliation-bill-may-not-be-enough-sasc-chairman/	2025-03-12T11:49:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/8910837-scaled-e1741804006931.jpg
Awaiting Space Force certification, ULA says future missions could aim to baffle Chinese watcher sats	ULA launches its Vulcan rocket on Oct. 4, 2024. (Screengrab via ULA livestream) WASHINGTON — United Launch Alliance (ULA) CEO Tory Bruno is positioning the Vulcan Centaur launch vehicle for future national security missions, including sneaking satellites past Chinese watching eyes, even as the company continues to wait for a Space Force decision on whether the rocket can be certified to carry today's payloads. Bruno told reporters today that Vulcan already is optimized for 'exotic orbits for the government' and could provide services like 'directly injecting [a spacecraft] into geosynchronous orbit.' At the same time, he added, ULA has 'a set of investments that are around extending the life of the upper stage, which would allow us to fly different kinds of trajectories&#8230; 'There are other things we can do for them [the US government] that are useful in national security, I might even say confounding for Chinese threats in space, that are enabled by a longer lived upper stage.' Such a fuel-heavy upper stage could be used in rapid, long-range maneuvering to outfox hostile satellites, Bruno explained. 'If I have longer duration, I can go to a different place. If I have longer duration, I can do unusual trajectories that would obfuscate where my destination is, which becomes a challenge for an adversary who wants to surveil or interfere with that spacecraft,' he said. 'Then they have to either find it and or position a hostile asset next to it. When they have a plan to do that, it's a big deal for an adversary because spacecraft can't carry very much propellant and still have useful payload.' But before any of that can happen, the Space Force needs to give Vulcan Centaur the thumbs up to carry currently manifested payloads under the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. To do that, a launch provider needs to demonstrate two successful flights of its launch vehicle before receiving certification by the service to fly critical NSSL missions. While Vulcan first flight last January passed the certification tests, its second certification flight in October did not. That flight suffered 'an anomaly in one of the two solid rocket motors where we lost the nozzle,' he explained, although the Vulcan nonetheless managed to achieve 'a perfect orbital insertion,' Bruno said. 'So, that was all good, but I do prefer that all the parts of my rocket leaders stay attached where they're supposed to be,' Bruno added. ULA's investigation discovered that the problem was due to a manufacturing error, he said. 'We have isolated the root cause appropriate corrective actions, and those were qualified and confirmed in a full-scale static firing in Utah last month. So, we are back in continuing to fabricate hardware and at least initially, screening for what that root cause was, which was a manufacturing defect of one of the internal parts of the nozzle insulator,' Bruno elaborated. A spokesperson for Northrop Grumman, which supplies the solid rocket motors for the Vulcan Center, declined to comment. Bruno said that ULA submitted the findings of the investigation to the Space Force about a month ago for review, noting that 'typically, it's not a very long process.' A spokesperson for Space Systems Command’s Assured Access to Space office told Breaking Defense today that a decision is still pending. 'We have been working with ULA very closely over the last several years to complete NSSL certification of their Vulcan system. The teams have made tremendous progress, and we are close to a decision,' the spokesperson said. In November, ULA and the Space Force said that the two NSSL program launches manifested on Vulcan for launch last year, USSF-106 and USSF-87, were expected to lift off early this year after having been postponed due to the investigation of the second flight. A senior Space Force official said in January that the Space Force was 'targeting mid-February' for being able to give the all clear to Vulcan, and noted that the service is planning 18 total launches under the current NSSL Phase 2 program: 11 on Vulcan and seven for SpaceX’s Falcon 9. While a recent report to Congress from the Air Force, first reported by Bloomberg, criticized ULA's overall performance as 'unsatisfactory' and suggested that the Space Force may shift some of its planned Vulcan launches to SpaceX, Bruno punched back that the report was out of date and not accurate even at the time of its writing in January. 'I saw it before it was leaked, and I don't normally talk about improperly leaked reports, but I'm going to make an exception this time. When that was written it was inaccurate. As we sit here today, it is certainly overtaken by events,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/awaiting-space-force-certification-ula-says-future-missions-could-aim-to-baffle-chinese-watcher-sats/	2025-03-12T10:51:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241004_ULA_vulcan_launch_GRAB-e1728045585388.png
Exploit America’s commercial strengths to mobilize weapons production	A row of Guided Bomb Unit 32s lie on a munitions assembly conveyer at Langley Air Force Base, Va., March 5, 2013. The productions section of the Munitions Flight is responsible for providing munitions to the flight line. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Kayla Newman/Released) During his recent confirmation hearings, Steve Feinberg, the nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense, observed that more companies must be integrated into the defense industrial base to produce the scale of weapon systems the United States needs to deter conflict. He’s right, and a good place to start would be missiles and munitions. As officials have repeatedly pointed out, even though the Pentagon spent close to $30 billion on missiles and munitions last year, its inventories of critical munitions are depleted. While some of this shortfall was driven by US support for Ukraine, the problem is a larger one, rooted in the way that we design and produce munitions in the first place. The term 'munition' covers conventional ammunition, such as the bullets and mortars used by ground troops, up to the Precision Guided Munitions (PGMs) used to shoot Russian tanks, and the missile interceptors that help to protect Israeli airspace. There are three specific steps that DoD leaders can take to ensure that the American military has access to the munitions needs to deter conflict and if necessary, prevail in war. Prioritize weapons that are scalable and adaptable over perfect, bespoke systems. Pentagon leaders need to ask themselves: Can this missile be produced in the numbers needed and can it be quickly modified when enemies develop countermeasures? Traditional weapons development emphasizes peak performance over flexibility, resulting in overly specialized, difficult-to-produce munitions that depend on often-obsolete custom components and narrow production pipelines. Defense suppliers cannot surge production of these weapons, and while we could afford this artisan approach when the United States was the dominant military power, that is no longer the case. The creativity of America’s adversaries also challenges the traditional DoD reliance on stockpiling, which risks obsolescence as threats evolve. Future conflicts will require adaptable, rapidly deployable weapons rather than rigid, slow-to-produce systems. Adopt new ways of designing and producing munitions. The DoD should design modular weapons that use widely available commercial or government off-the-shelf components and take advantage of advanced commercial manufacturing processes. The US military’s reliance on bespoke parts produced by dedicated defense contractors limits production capacity. Modular designs facilitate the integration of new technologies and reduce the chance of supply chain disruptions and obsolescence. To build modular weapons, the DoD should pursue contract manufacturing, where a weapon could be designed by defense experts but then assembled at multiple commercial facilities. This approach would leverage America’s considerable commercial sector advantages. The US contract manufacturing industry is thriving, generating combined annual revenues of over $85 billion. Contract manufacturers operate on scales that dwarf normal defense needs and produce a wide range of goods across various industries, from consumer electronics to medical devices. These products often overlap with the software and digital systems that comprise a majority of a modern weapon’s cost. Hence, these firms could assemble modular weapons except for classified software and warheads, leaving those final steps to be completed at a DoD depot before delivery. Contract manufacturers can achieve cost advantages by using widely available parts and investing in productivity improvements like automation. They can maximize the use of a factory (and amortize large capital expenditures) by enabling the same workers and machines to build millions of computers one month and pivoting to building another product, like dialysis machines, the next. During WWII, the United States relied on commercial manufacturers to meet wartime production needs. Germany, by contrast, suffered from excessive weapon specialization, which impeded mass production. Make the best use of America’s digital strengths. Small, loosely organized militaries can quickly field precision weapons without a sophisticated industrial base because their munitions draw most of their capability from commercial digital systems. Houthi terrorists use commercially derived drones to assist their home-built missiles evade ships in the Red Sea. Modern weapons are increasingly software-driven and digital capabilities often dictate a weapon’s effectiveness. Cruise missiles are essentially computers with warheads, their effectiveness tied to electronic warfare, flight control, navigation, and target updates. The good news is that the US leads in digital technologies. Future weapons can be 'born digital' by incorporating commercial off-the-shelf components and software. Unlike traditional hardware-centric designs, software-defined weapons allow for real-time updates, improving adaptability and resilience against enemy countermeasures. These digital attributes also allow for much faster and continuous weapons testing — a process that traditionally can take years. By using digital platforms, DoD can streamline the testing and deployment of adaptable, cheaper weapons. A magazine of inflexible high-performance weapons risks leaving the US military underprepared for future conflicts, particularly against China. Using widely available commercial components and building on US manufacturing and digital strengths, the DoD could field a complementary family of weapons that can be rapidly produced, deployed, and updated. By embracing a new paradigm that values scalability, adaptability, and digital innovation, the United States can produce more affordable weapons and ensure that America remains a formidable force in an increasingly complex and uncertain geopolitical security environment. Bryan Clark, Dan Patt, and Nadia Schadlow are all senior fellows at the Hudson Institute. This essay is based on their forthcoming monograph, 'Defense Department weapon design and production for 21st century mobilization.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/exploit-americas-commercial-strengths-to-mobilize-weapons-production/	2025-03-12T07:12:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/munitions_production-scaled-e1678396662443.jpg

Italy’s Leonardo forecasts $6.6 billion ‘upside’ from new wave of European defense spending	The M-346, produced by Leonardo, shows off some of its weapons options at the 2023 Paris Air Show. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) BELFAST — As Europe races toward 'strategic autonomy' in defense, Italian manufacturer Leonardo expects to generate new business in the region of €6 billion ($6.6 billion) should its home market and other European Union (EU) countries increase defense spending by a single GDP percentage point. Based on financial analysis carried out by the company, the percentage point shift is estimated to return between €2 to €3 billion from Italy alone, matched by a further €2 to €3 billion from the rest of the EU, according to Leonardo CEO Roberto Cingolani. He told investors during an industrial plan update today that in the case of Rome, a 1 percent GDP increase would amount to a defense budget jump of around €20 billion, roughly half of which would be reserved for procurement. 'Normally, one third of that procurement is captured by Leonardo,' he explained. An EU single percentage point increase would amount to additional procurement funding worth between €18 billion to €30 billion, drawing a return of up to €3 billion for Leonardo, set against the company’s current 4 percent capture rate for the bloc as a whole, shared Cingolani, adding that the forecasted figures exclude future export orders. He said that geopolitical threats and the urgent requirement that Europe rely less on the US are driving increases in defense spending and toward 'a new normal in which governments will reinforce critical infrastructure using innovative technologies.' 'We have to make our defense effective because we know that after the wars in Europe, that we have to protect ourselves much more than in the past, especially if the relationship with the NATO alliance will change and the Americans will give less effort in protecting Europe,' he said. A rearmament frenzy has gripped Europe in the wake of pressure from US President Donald Trump, who has publicly cast doubt on the NATO alliance and threatened not to come to the defense of any NATO nation who wasn't spending enough on defense. The EU has pledged a new $843 billion ReArm package over four years in a bid to beef up the continent’s ammunition, air and missile defense, artillery systems, drones and missile capabilities, while France and Denmark have recently announced accelerated rearmament plans. RELATED: Amid US-European strain, Lithuanian defense minister cements ties with US industry &#8216;giants' To deal with the changing geopolitical landscape, Cingolani called for 'stronger alliances' and 'industrial synergies,' while stressing that since the launch of Leonardo’s five-year industrial plan last year, a number of high profile partnerships have been launched. Those include an agreement with Turkey’s Baykar to form a drone technologies joint venture and collaboration with Germany’s Rheinmetall to develop a future main battle tank and infantry fighting vehicles based off the Lynx platform. In the long term those new initiatives, together with the launch of Leonardo’s space division last year, are forecast to deliver €5.4 billion in new business, according to Cingolani. Charting growth more broadly, he also said that Leonardo orders are expected to reach €26.2 billion in 2029 — the end of the five year plan — equivalent to an almost 6 percent uptick compared to €20.9 billion in orders recorded for 2024. Leonardo is a key industry player involved in the British, Japanese and Italian-led Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) sixth-generation fighter. Cingolani suggested that despite the deterioration security picture in Europe, it is 'not realistic' to expect entry to service of the aircraft to be brought forward from a projected timeline of 2035 on account of technology challenges. He noted, however, that 300 GCAP aircraft are expected to be sold, in addition to 10 prototypes set for development. The future fighter is slated to replace UK Royal Air Force and Italian Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons as well as Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-2 combat jets. Regarding mergers and acquisitions, Leonardo is progressing with five new leads, added Cingolani, though he did not provide additional detail.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/italys-leonardo-forecasts-6-6-billion-upside-from-new-wave-of-european-defense-spending/	2025-03-11T14:29:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/IMG_4965-scaled-e1713255621953.jpg
Space Systems Command reviewing expensive legacy programs for possible commercial shift	Space Force Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy (Image: Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's primary acquisition command is reviewing a number of its high-dollar legacy programs to consider whether there are now alternative commercial options for achieving the missions — starting with a new satellite constellation for keeping tabs on the heavens, according to a senior Space Systems Command (SSC) official. Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy, military deputy at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration, told the Washington Space Business Roundtable today that he signed off last week on an 'acquisition decision memorandum (ADM)' instructing a team to undertake an analysis of commercial options for obtaining new space situational awareness capabilities to monitor geosynchronous orbit (GEO). Further, he said that more ADMs are in the works, 'hopefully' as soon as next week, on programs ranging from satellite communications to ground systems. 'We basically had our team look for the last couple of weeks at many of our programs, looking for anything that looks like it could use some commercial competition. And so it's a whole host of them,' Purdy said. 'There are several programs that are slow, &#8230; traditional, expensive, and there's a potential that there might be commercial opportunities for each one of those,' he elaborated. 'And so we're going to have [the acquisition community] go out there, hopefully go out with some RFIs, and understand what's possible &#8230; in the requirements trade off space — something that we've not traditionally done very well.' The idea, Purdy stressed, is to find potential alternatives for 'getting us out of one-off, billion-dollar systems into a proliferated architecture.' For example, he later told reporters that SSC will be looking at commercial alternatives to the Deep Space Advanced Radar Capability (DARC), a trio of ground-based radar facilities designed to track satellites and dangerous space junk in far away orbits with more precision. The Space Force on Feb. 20 announced it is wrapping up construction at the first site in Western Australia. The other two sites will be located in the United Kingdom and the United States. 'We're proceeding with DARC, although I'm going to look at: &#8216;Hey, are there commercial solutions at DARC? Any one of them?' We're looking to ask the question. We may or may not find anything,' Purdy said. He cautioned, however, that with DARC and all other big ticket, legacy acquisition programs, a key to allowing commercial solutions will be a willingness on the part of the Space Force to down-scope requirements. 'We're going to have to roll back requirements,' he said. 'I mean, a lot of these most expensive systems, they have key requirements that are driving expense and time.' Purdy explained that while rigorous performance requirements may be 'what the operator wants' for any particular program, it is the job of the acquisition community to provide them with commercial options that may necessitate requirements 'trade offs' to obtain lower costs and more rapid availability for critical capabilities. Purdy explained to reporters that US Space Command 'has been eager for the unclassified capability' for keeping better tabs on adversary birds in the GEO belt. China, in particular, has been operating satellites in GEO that often closely shadow US and allied satellites apparently taking images and monitoring their operations. Further, he said, international governments/vendors also have been 'clamoring to provide' such capabilities to the US Space Surveillance Network, which incorporates ground-based radars and telescopes, as well as satellites with on-board sensors. The Space Force last March issued a request for information (RFI) about a new GEO constellation of highly maneuverable satellites carrying electro-optical cameras. The satellites, in essence, would be a successor to the Space Force's Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) constellation first declassified in 2014, and its follow-on called SILENTBARKER developed in tandem with the National Reconnaissance Office. 'So many companies responded back to SSC on that particular one,' Purdy said. 'So, I've asked the team to go in there and clean those [RFI responses] up and get me a commercial analysis on what kind of capabilities could we provide on what timeline and what cost compared to any existing programs of record.' The next step will be for SSC to 'provide options' to the Space Force, he said. 'We'll see if that's of interest to them — are these requirements trade offs of interest or not?' Meanwhile, Purdy is fretting the potential for workforce reductions among the Space Force acquisition corps as a result of Elon Musk's DOGE cost-cutting efforts. In response to questions from reporters, he explained that the majority of the Space Force acquisition workforce is civilian, including a host of civilian contractors. 'If we end up losing a lot of civilians, that will be a problem on the acquisition side. We're a heavily acquisition force, so a lot of our system program offices have civilians for continuity purposes, and it will impact us in a pretty great way,' Purdy said. Another issue is that because the Space Force is a small service, it will be hard to simply fill in for lost civilians with military personnel, he said, especially as the service already is struggling to meet operational needs. 'Now sometimes we can be efficient and not do some work, but a lot of this work is required at different levels in the hierarchy,' Purdy added. 'And until we get rid of that requirement, then we're &#8230; basically going to be delayed. And that's the key. Is that if we're getting rid of the people, we need to get rid of the requirements.' He further noted that rather than start with laying off civilians on 'probationary status,' his preference would be to look at voluntary separations and retirements — especially because there are a lot of civilians in the Pentagon workforce who are nearing retirement age. 'So, I wonder, hey, can we go down that route,' Purdy said. 'But, you know, I'll do whatever leadership wants.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/ssc-reviewing-expensive-legacy-programs-for-possible-commercial-shift/	2025-03-11T13:11:00-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-3.30.29 PM.png

Army releases Unified Network Plan 2.0, honing in on multi-domain fighting, zero trust	The ultimate goal of the Army's Unified Network is to give soldiers the same network capabilities while deployed as they have at posts, camps, and stations. (Photo courtesy of the US Army.) WASHINGTON — After months of anticipation, the Army has released the second version of its Unified Network Plan, building off of the 2021 iteration that aimed to collapse its 69 enterprise and tactical networks into a single, shared one by 2027. The service’s updated plan, also known as AUN 2.0 and released late last week, reiterates the 1.0 version of paving the way for a unified network but creates a clearer focus on preparing the Army for multi-domain operations. Since the first plan, AUN 2.0 says, 'a confluence of emerging technologies and events has transformed the world into a multidomain, persistently contested information environment that demands a far more data-centric approach to harness the power of the Army Network to fight and win.' It's an approach previewed by Gen. Jeth Ray, of the Army's G6 office, in December. 'It's gonna enable multi-domain operations. That's gonna be the key basis of what it's all about. [It will also] chart this road map of where we're going for the unified networking by 2027, but then it's also gonna talk about the critical enablers that's required for that multi-domain operation by Army 2030,' Rey said then at the Army’s technical exchange meeting in Savannah, Ga. (The 1.0 version had aimed for a multi-domain ready force by 2028, a timeline that has since been pushed back.) 'AUN 2.0 is going to be new guidance on how the warfighter actually approaches and accelerates and operationalizes the unified network across the board and the Army campaign plan,' he said. According to the new published plan, there will also be a sharper focus on creating data centricity through zero trust principles — the principle of 'never trust, always verify' philosophy that operates under the assumption that the network is always compromised. 'We look at it as where we're converging all of our networks from disparate networks into this condition of what we call underpinned by zero trust. We're bringing all those networks together so that when you leave from one installation to another installation, we don't have to do massive amounts of paperwork just to get you onto that network,' Rey explained in December. Within the AUN 2.0 plan there are five lines of effort: These are designed to be carried out within three phases, the plan explains, with all phases being completed by 2030. 'As with command posts, the network and data must be agile, adaptable, and able to rapidly move to the point of need even in a denied, disrupted, intermittent, and limited bandwidth (DDIL) environment. Whereas past network strategies homed in on perimeter defense and hardware, the AUNP 2.0 is focused on common principles and standards to centrally deliver and manage the network and data,' the new plan reads.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/army-releases-unified-network-plan-2-0-honing-in-on-multi-domain-fighting-zero-trust/	2025-03-11T08:03:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/The-ultimate-goal-of-the-Armys-Unified-Network-is-to-give-soldiers-the-same-network-capabilities-while-deployed-as-they-have-at-posts-camps-and-stations.-e1697476883722.jpg
GOP stopgap funding bill boosts defense funding over FY24 levels	WASHINGTON, DC &#8211; NOVEMBER 02: (L-R) U.S. House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) leave after a news briefing at the U.S. Capitol on November 2, 2023 in Washington, DC.(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — House Republicans’ yearlong continuing resolution for fiscal 2025 includes $892.5 billion for defense, boosting the defense topline about $6 billion above the FY24 spending limits but slightly below the $895 billion forecasted for this year. Backed by President Donald Trump, Republicans are supporting a CR that runs until Sept. 30 rather than banking on lawmakers’ ability to push through individual appropriations bills for FY25. Congress has until the end of March 14 to pass a spending bill before the government shuts down. The proposed CR, released Saturday and set to be taken up by Congress this week, includes an additional $8 billion for Central Command and European Command, specifying that the funds be used for 'only for U.S. military operations, force protection, and deterrence.' The language stipulates that this funding cannot be expended until 30 days after the defense secretary provides the congressional defense committees with an execution plan. It also makes some changes to bring shipbuilding funds roughly in line with the levels requested by the Navy in FY25, with some notable exceptions. Namely, Arleigh Burke-class destroyer procurement was boosted to $7.9 billion — potentially adding a third destroyer — while Constellation-class frigate procurement was reduced from about $1.1 billion to $233 million. It also cuts funds for the Medium Landing Ship program, while increasing funds for ship to shore connectors. Total procurement spending remained roughly flat at $167 billion from the Defense Department’s FY25 request, while research and development dropped slightly from $143 billion to $141 billion, according to calculations done by JP Morgan analyst Seth Seifman. The bill also 'appears to allow new start programs to proceed, which is not typically the case under a CR,' Seifman said. In a note to investors this morning, Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners noted that the bill 'is not a traditional continuing resolution' that simply funds the government at prior year levels, offering the administration 'far more flexibility' to spend certain funds. 'We expect this act, or something very close to it, will be passed by Congress,' Callan wrote. The House Rules Committee is expected to take up the bill this afternoon to decide the terms under which the measure will be brought to the House floor tomorrow. With a 218-214 split in the House, Speaker Mike Johnson may only be able to lose one Republican vote if all Democrats vote against the bill. Senate Republicans, who hold 53 seats, will need some Democrats to vote in favor for the bill for it to pass procedural hurdles that require a 60-vote threshold. Whether or not Democrats will do so is unclear, with House Minority Leader Rep. Hakeem Jeffries posting on X social media outlet, 'We are voting no' and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer yet to publicly lay out a strategy for the Senate Democrats. Democrats have called out defense related cuts, which included a $185 million cut to Defense Nuclear Nonproliferation programs and a $140 million cut to the NATO Security Investment Program, as well as cuts to military construction that will force the service 'to pick and choose projects to fund,' according to a fact sheet released by Washington Sen. Patty Murray, the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/gop-stopgap-funding-bill-boosts-defense-funding-over-fy24-levels/	2025-03-10T12:15:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_rep_mike_johnson_GettyImages-1770847690-scaled-e1709241354686.jpg

Turkey’s Aselsan tests laser counter-drone system, part of Steel Dome project	Aselsan’s counter drone high energy laser GÖKBERK (Aselsan) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Aselsan has tested successfully a mobile laser weapon system, dubbed GÖKBERK, against first-person-view (FPV) drones, the company said today in a statement. GÖKBERK detected, automatically tracked, and destroyed FPV threats in different scenarios. The firm said that the system will play a 'critical role in Türkiye’s national air defense system, Steel Dome.' Aselsan 'continues to take important steps in the field of directed energy weapons, one of the new generation technologies. Previously proven effective against rotary- and fixed-wing kamikaze drones, GÖKBERK now showcased its advanced capabilities by detecting, autonomously tracking, and eliminating FPV drones across multiple test scenarios, demonstrating exceptional speed and precision in engagement,' according to the statement. The system uses an electronic jammer to enable the 'soft kill' of drones, and an electronic laser for 'hard kills' of FPVs of multiple sizes, including mini UAVs, micro UAVs and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). Steel Dome is Turkey’s layered air defense system in development by Turkish firms to protect the air space against all types of threats, at a time demand on missile defense systems have surged in the Middle East due to latest conflicts in the region. 'The Steel Dome is very promising system. All nations want to have this kind of system,' Ahmet Akyol, president and CEO Aselsan, told Breaking Defense last month at the International Defense Expo in Abu Dhabi. He added that Aselsan 'can provide this solution for Turkey and for allied countries right now,' Akyol said. 'So in Turkey, this is in progress. Every year we are delivering new systems of the Steel Dome concept, and it will be beneficial for our region.' The firm distributed a video showing GÖKBERK composing of laser system, camera and thermal camera mounted on a vehicle and eliminating multiple types of drones. 'All major subcomponents of GÖKBERK have been designed and produced domestically, reinforcing Türkiye’s defense industry autonomy,' according to the company’s statement. The firm added that the new system will be deployed to military bases, airports, power plants and oil refineries protection.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/turkeys-aselsan-tests-laser-counter-drone-system-part-of-steel-dome-project/	2025-03-10T11:36:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/ASELSAN_GOKBERK-scaled-e1741627832120.jpg
Lockheed eyes two-year timeline to pick new F-35 cooling system	A US Air Force F-35A Lightning II assigned to the F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team performs a practice aerial demonstration prior to the Warriors Over the Wasatch Air Show at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, on June 28, 2024. (US Air Force photo by First Lieutenant Nathan Poblete) AFA WARFARE 2025 — Selecting a highly-anticipated upgrade for the F-35’s incumbent cooling system may take as long as two years to play out as manufacturer Lockheed Martin weighs options from Collins Aerospace and Honeywell, according to the company’s program manager. 'There's a few folks that have already presented some options to us now. That's going to take us, I think, about the next 24 months or so to really go through those options,' Chauncey McIntosh, Lockheed’s vice president for the F-35 program, told Breaking Defense Monday in an interview on the sidelines of the AFA Warfare Symposium. Lockheed is examining 'all offerings that are out on the market today to make that decision and go through [them]. So it’s not going to be a quick choice, it’s going to be one that’s driven by data' that ensures the company is 'getting the right thing' to support future needs, McIntosh added. 'So that's kind of the time frame that I think we're on, but as we go through, that could either accelerate or decelerate,' based on what the company learns. Collins and Honeywell are so far the only companies to have publicly thrown their hat in the ring for a new cooling system. Lockheed will run the competition, Breaking Defense previously reported, setting up a lucrative opportunity for an eventual winner that would provide parts to retrofit likely a bulk of the roughly 1,000 F-35s currently in service and manufacture the system for future aircraft. Officials say a new cooling system, formally known as the Power and Thermal Management Unit (PTMU), is needed to support forthcoming upgrades that are expected to make the jet run even hotter than it does now. In the near term, an enhancement to the stealth fighter’s Pratt &amp; Whitney F135 engine is expected to enable a suite of upgrades known as Block 4. Beyond Block 4, a new cooling system will be needed to work in tandem with the engine upgrade, the F-35 Joint Program Office has previously said. Regardless of how a competition for the new cooling system proceeds, time is of the essence. A previous request for information from the JPO said the government expects a new cooling system solution should be ready to field in roughly the 2032 timeframe. According to a May 2024 Government Accountability Office report [PDF], the F-35 program could start delivering post-Block 4 upgrades as soon as 2029. That timeline, the watchdog found, means that 'if the thermal management system upgrades come after 2029, post-Block 4 capabilities will also be delayed.' Remarking on the need to keep various requirements in sync, McIntosh said, 'We're gonna let the data drive us while knowing we're on a timeline to insert that engine along with the PTMU out in the future.' Honeywell supplies the incumbent cooling apparatus, known as the Power and Thermal Management System (PTMS), which is responsible for other critical tasks like providing emergency electrical power — and is offering an upgrade to the existing design. Collins, a subsidiary of RTX, is looking to unseat Honeywell by introducing a new offering dubbed the Enhanced Power and Cooling System (EPACS). Both Honeywell and Collins say their candidates meet an objective set out by the JPO: a capacity for 80 kilowatts of cooling. Honeywell touts its approach, which the company’s Defense and Space President Matt Milas shared with Breaking Defense following the results of digital modeling, as less risky, due to the fact that it retains much of the PTMS’s current 'footprint' with largely mature technologies. Collins, on the other hand, is pitching the EPACS as an alternative solution to meet the F-35’s needs, which the system’s chief engineer Matt Pess recently told Breaking Defense is being developed with the goal of 'leav[ing] as much margin in the system and as much flexibility in the system as possible.' Breaking Defense also toured the company’s facility and viewed the EPACS prototype in action last year. 'We looked at the total box of things that we were asked about' and worked to 'make sure that we were mission critical itself and make sure that our system would actually hold up to that,' Henry Brooks, Collins president of power and controls, said in a Feb. 27 interview alongside Pess. 'I think that our solution will be a novel one, if you will, for the F-35. It'll enable not only the F-35' but also sixth-generation fighter jets like the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance platform as well as future commercial aircraft designs. Additionally, according to Collins, the EPACS has achieved Technology Readiness Level 6, meaning the system is mature enough to enter into the engineering and manufacturing and development phase.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/lockheed-eyes-two-year-timeline-to-pick-new-f-35-cooling-system/	2025-03-10T10:54:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/8509355-1-scaled-e1721820217290.jpg
Emirati consortium to launch first satellite of Sirb constellation by late 2026, early 2027: Exec	A rendering of the view of the Middle East from Space. (NASA via Getty) BEIRUT — An industry team tasked with launching a small satellite constellation for the United Arab Emirates wants to get its first bird into low Earth orbit (LEO) as early as the end of next year or early 2027, according to a key industry executive. The industry consortium is in the 'last stages' of selecting a launch partner from the three finalists out of an original 10 international entities that had been under consideration, Waleid Al Mesmari, president of the space and cyber tech division of the sprawling Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group, told Breaking Defense last month. EDGE's new space-focused subsidiary FADA is the leader of the consortium, which also includes national entities Space 42, the National Space Science and Technology Center and the Mohammed Bin Rashid Space Centre. The goal of the project, called Sirb in a reference to the Arabic term for flock of birds, is to eventually put three UAE-made synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites into LEO to 'address the critical need for better environmental and land usage monitoring, data collection and analysis to meet today’s global challenges,' according to the UAE Space Agency. 'The planned satellites will be able to create highly detailed and complex radar ‘images’ of land use, ice cover, surface changes and characterization, with a wide range of scientific, civil and commercial applications,' the agency says in an online fact sheet. But Al Mesmari said the information acquired through the constellation will have have 'defense and national security applications' as well. FADA, which means space in Arabic, was only established in September 2024 as the first endeavor into space by EDGE, a conglomerate of nearly 30 subsidiaries with interests in everything from small arms to unmanned systems to armored vehicles. 'When it comes to establishment of FADA, [it is] to have a sovereign capability that can protect and preserve the prosperous future [of UAE] that has been built over the last 50 years,' Al Mesmari told Breaking Defense. He said that FADA aims to have 'a national capacity building program that can translate, and lead the space technological stack, enabling us to have a sovereign capability at the end.' He added that FADA is one of the companies that will contribute to UAE’s space strategy 2030, focused on localizing technology in UAE. During the International Defense Exhibition and Conference (IDEX) 2025, during which Breaking Defense spoke to Al Mesmari, FADA said it had launched a 'hyper-smart platform' dubbed TACTICA, which is an AI-based software that 'processes multi-source intelligence- including satellite imagery, signals intelligence, sensor data, and open-source information.' Al Mesmari expected that FADA 'will be a global player [in the space sector] and that's our focus.' He concluded that FADA is 'a vertically integrated company, which means that we will focus on building capabilities across the three streams: space platforms [including] space payloads [and] manufacturing capabilities, remote sensing, [which include] capabilities on the ground with the different applications, [and] space situational awareness or space domain awareness.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/emirati-consortium-to-launch-first-satellite-of-sirb-constellation-by-late-2026-early-2027-exec/	2025-03-10T08:32:47-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250228_earth_from_space_generic_GettyImages-2170815486-e1740757787949.jpg
Amid US-European strain, Lithuanian defense minister cements ties with US industry ‘giants’	Lithuanian Minister of Defense, Dovile Sakaliene, speaks to the press on Jan. 22, 2025 in Vilnius. (Photo by Kay Nietfeld/picture alliance via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As Europe rushes to reasses its reliance on American security guarantees and to dramatically boost military spending, Lithuania's defense minister personally worked to cement ties not only with US policymakers but with another key constituency: US defense contractors. Armed with a red folder containing a veritable shopping list of defense systems and billions of dollars to pay for them, Dovilė Šakalienė said she recently met with executives from major firms, including Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, RTX and AM General. The meetings, she said, were part of a broader effort to speedily boost Lithuania's defense capability in the face of an ever-increasing threat from Russia — and to draw the influential firms closer to Vilnius. Further Russian aggression beyond Ukraine, including potentially in Lithuania, 'worries us,' Šakalienė told reporters in a roundtable at the Lithuanian embassy Friday. 'That's why we are really pushing forward with our military capability plans, with our defense capacity-building, infrastructure and personnel and acquisitions, from weapons to ammo, building factories, defense industries &#8230; 'And actually all the good talks that I had with defense industry giants in the United States is something that, in my opinion, is a very positive element in our preparation,' she said. 'I'm very happy about it, these meetings. &#8230; We require a lot from them.' Šakalienė said Lithuania has done $2 billion-worth of business with American defense firms in the past three years and has 'need' for 'at least $8 billion' more in 'coming years' — a consequence of Vilnius's decision in January to boost defense spending to 5 to 6 percent of its GDP beginning in 2026. 'And we are happy to build factories together. We are happy to [be] part of [the] supply chain. And that's what we discussed,' she said, adding that the companies have been invited to come to Lithuania to explore on-the-ground opportunities there. 'Actually I feel like the United States defense industry feels that partnership with European countries and specifically with Lithuania is something that is mutually beneficial. We are a market and we are a partner in defense, so I hope it works.'

(U.S Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Kanoa Thomas) The push to forging deeper ties with US industry also builds off Lithuania's Memorandum of Understanding with Northrop Grumman last year, which involves the manufacturer supporting local suppliers in the production of medium-caliber ammunition for Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). Sakaliene noted that Lithuania already has Europe's largest fleet of Joint Light Tactical Vehicles, those made by Oshkosh Defense. Later in the discussion when asked by Breaking Defense exactly what Lithuania planned to spend the money on, Šakalienė held up a red manila folder. 'We want to develop a full-fledged capacity and capability to be able to work very well with the joint NATO forces, with our sister divisions, with capabilities that the United States will be providing, according to regional defense plans,' she said. 'So we are developing our land forces, our air defense, our engineering capabilities, and it's from rockets and air defense systems, artillery systems, helicopters, radars, drones &#8230; and additional enablers.' Sitting beside Šakalienė, Ministry of Defense spokesperson Ignas Grinevičius added, 'And we're paying in advance to get it quicker, as soon as possible.' Lithuania's strategic approach to strengthening business with the US comes amid a decisive shift by the European Union to rearm the continent at pace by investing more in the region's defense industry and while member states and other NATO allies rethink equipment planning decisions in light of Washington's pivot to Russia. In Lithuania, a country of 2.9 million that has been occupied by Russian forces twice in modern times, to even question the idea of US security protection is 'extremely sensitive,' Šakalienė said elsewhere in the talk. She said 'everyone' takes US security guarantees, or aid in the 'worst case scenario' as 'vital,' as a 'life-or-death issue.' Speaking days after the disastrous White House meeting between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, US President Donald Trump and his top officials and the subsequent freezing of US military aid and intelligence sharing to Kyiv, Šakalienė said there are 'different interpretations' of America's current stance towards European security. She acknowledged that it was all 'quite stressful' for her countrymen, but she at least has been heartened by two factors: the developments have shocked Europe into a keen understanding that they must do more for their own security — for which Šakalienė said Lithuania has been long ahead of the curve — and that at least in his term so far as president, Trump has not said he would not honor America's commitments to the Baltic states. Trump did say last week that if NATO members 'don't pay,' the US would not come to their defense. But the Baltic nations are among NATO members who spend the most on defense by GDP and would presumably be safe from such a threat. As for a potential ceasefire deal for the Ukraine conflict, Šakalienė floated the idea that the West should seize $200 billion in frozen Russian assets (elsewhere reported as €200 billion or $216.7 billion) to use as a 'safeguard' for any agreement. Added Larger European nations are divided over the issue. The UK has consistently said the assets should be unlocked by the West but France and Germany have raised objections, with Paris stressing that any such decision risks breaching sovereign asset immunity and curb EU investments from other foreign powers. Holding those assets in the balance 'could be a very viable and sensible thing to do,' said Šakalienė. 'Putin has not yet tried the method of keeping the agreement, of not violating treaties. So maybe that would be a good safeguard to keep his word for the first time.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/amid-us-european-strain-lithuanian-defense-minister-cements-ties-with-us-industry-giants/	2025-03-10T07:02:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/250309_lithuanian_defmin_bigger_GettyImages-2194656497-scaled-e1741537479453.jpg
Deputy defense secretary nominee has ‘clear conflict of interest’ with Ligado lawsuit: Sen. Warren	Nominee for Deputy Secretary of Defense Stephen A. Feinberg listens to the opening remarks of a Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington, D.C., Feb. 25, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Senior Airman Madelyn Keech) WASHINGTON — Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren is raising concerns with deputy defense secretary nominee Stephen Feinberg’s ties to Ligado Networks, arguing that Feinberg’s family or the private equity firm he founded could financially benefit from the ongoing lawsuit between the communications company and the US government. Feinberg’s Cerberus Capital Management owns about 14 percent of the communications company’s debt and 24 percent of its preferred stock, according to court documents cited by Warren in a March 9 letter to Feinberg, exclusively obtained by Breaking Defense. Ligado, now going through bankruptcy proceedings, is engaged in a $39 billion lawsuit against the US government over claims that officials at the Departments of Defense and Commerce took 'unlawful actions' to, in effect, improperly seize without compensation the firm’s L-band spectrum. That situation could create a 'huge conflict of interest' should Feinberg become the department’s No. 2 official, wrote Warren, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'As the second-in-command at the Pentagon, you would have the power to influence the DoD’s posture towards the Ligado lawsuit. If the government loses or settles the case, Cerberus could profit as it ‘would most likely receive some portion of the settlement proceeds,’ according to your responses to my questions for the record,' she stated. Feinberg’s family could also potentially make money from the outcome of the Ligado lawsuit, Warren said, as Feinberg has indicated he could divest his interest in Cerberus through a gift to one or more irrevocable trusts established for his adult children. 'This is a clear conflict of interest, as you could deal your former company — and your adult children — a multi-billion-dollar windfall at the expense of American taxpayers,' she wrote. Warren states that Feinberg can address this issue by amending his ethics agreement to recuse himself from matters related to Ligado and its lawsuit with the Defense Department. She also requests that Feinberg answer a series of questions by March 24 about his financial interests in Ligado, including whether he will divest any holdings in the company and how big a settlement is required for Cerberus to break even on its investment in Ligado. RELATED: Not on the same wavelength: Trump inherits spectrum fight between DoD, commercial industry Feinberg’s nomination could be confirmed by the Senate as early as this week, following a Feb. 25 confirmation hearing where SASC Democrats pressed him on the Trump administration’s planned cuts to the Pentagon’s civilian workforce. He was also asked about ongoing debate over whether the Defense Department be forced to vacate or share the lower 3 GigaHertz band and the 7-8 GHz band with commercial communications companies, responding that the Defense Department’s spectrum position must be protected. 'We need spectrum to defend our country. We also need commercial use of it to develop the technologies that will defend our country,' he said. 'The best solution is sharing, but we have to get it right and make sure sharing can be done without risk.' In an earlier Feb. 17 letter, Warren laid out concerns about Feinberg’s financial interests, stating that his holdings in Cerberus — which owns and invests in a number of defense-related companies, such as Stratolaunch and Navistar Defense — could pose a conflict of interest if not properly divested. In ethics documents submitted on Feb. 18, Feinberg said he would 'divest all of my interests in Cerberus including, but not limited to, my equity interest, carried interest, incentive fees/allocations, and capital commitments' prior to assuming the role of the deputy secretary of defense. He also said 'neither my wife nor I have any financial interest' in the trusts of his adult children and that he would not be the trustee for any of those trusts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/deputy-defense-secretary-nominee-has-clear-conflict-of-interest-with-ligado-lawsuit-sen-warren/	2025-03-10T03:00:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/8885252-1-scaled-e1741566340510.jpg
SDA again postpones launch of first ‘operational’ data relay, missile warning satellites	SDA's Tranche 1 launches are now anticipated to begin in summer 2025, starting with satellites for the Transport Layer. (Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Space Development Agency (SDA) today announced it is again postponing launch of its first-generation 'operational' satellites designed to provide data relay and missile warning/tracking, with a first lift-off now planned for 'late summer.' The launch setback — which represents yet another piece of bad news for the embattled agency — was recently decided by SDA's current leadership, 'in conjunction with' that of the Space Force, an SDA official told reporters today. William Blauser, former deputy head of the department’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), currently is the acting head of SDA, following the Jan. 16 suspension of Director Derek Tournear over alleged mismanagement of a contract award. SDA originally had hoped to begin launching the Tranche 1 Transport and Tracking Layer constellations for its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) stationed in low Earth orbit (LEO) in September 2024. That date was subsequently pushed back a few months to either very late 2024 or early 2025. Tranche 1 will include a total of 158 satellites, according to an SDA fact sheet [PDF]: 126 satellites in the data relay Transport Layer, 28 missile warning/tracking satellites in the Tracking Layer, and 4 'missile defense demonstration' satellites. The first launch will involve Transport Layer birds, an SDA official told reporters today, but the agency is not yet sure how many satellites will go up and whether satellites from all of the three current vendors will be included. Northrop Grumman, Lockheed Martin and start-up York Space Systems all won shares of a $1.8 billion contract award in February 2022. The plan, according to the SDA announcement, is to then undertake one launch per month until the all the Transport and Tracking Layer satellites are on-orbit. 'SDA continues to aggressively work toward the first Tranche 1 launch; however, as we progress through a normal assembly, integration, and testing campaign, with the added challenge of late supplier deliveries, it has become clear additional time is required for system readiness to meet the Tranche 1 minimum viable capability,' the agency said. The SDA official acknowledged that one of the problems pushing back the Tranche 1 launch has been the development of optical communications terminals (OCTs) — an issue highlighted in a recent report from the Government Accountability Office. Laser links are foundational to the workings of the PWSA, which is being designed as a 'mesh' network that uses laser links to rapidly transfer data among themselves — and eventually to ground stations. 'OCT terminals is definitely a challenge,' the official said. 'We're working to continue to help scale that and address any hang ups there.' Other problems have included supplies of propulsion units and vendor difficulties in getting 'approvals' for 'encryption devices,' the SDA official noted. (While the SDA official declined to elaborate on the latter issue, the National Security Agency is charged with approving encryption devices used by the Defense Department and other national security agencies.) Despite the launch delays, the SDA announcement stressed that the agency still intends to be able to provide region-by-region coverage for users in the field early in 2027. 'SDA is committed to completing on-orbit test and checkout of the initial satellites by mid-2026 and delivering the entire initial warfighting capability of the PWSA in early calendar year 2027, consistent with warfighter expectations,' the announcement said. 'SDA’s top priority is to quickly deliver capabilities promised to the warfighter. Launch is a major milestone but one in a much larger path to delivering viable capabilities. Our goal remains to rapidly deliver functional capabilities with a high degree of operational confidence,' it added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/03/sda-again-postpones-launch-of-first-operational-data-relay-missile-warning-satellites/	2025-03-07T13:18:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Northrop-Grummans-participation-in-SDAs-Tranche-1-Transport-Layer-program-went-from-award-to-passing-Critical-Design-Review-in-13-months.-1-e1741380771871.jpg
