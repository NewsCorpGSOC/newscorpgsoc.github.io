As Air Force reviews ejection seat deal, Collins, Martin-Baker gear up for a fight	During routine flying operations, 144th Fighter Wing pilots and maintainers prepare F-15 Eagles for take off from the Fresno Yosemite International Airport Aug. 14, 2019. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez) WASHINGTON — Seated near a model of Martin-Baker's latest ejection seat design, company executive Andrew Martin looked incredulous. An official at rival ejection seat-maker, Collins Aerospace, had suggested that some Martin-Baker seats weren't as safe as they should be — an unfair claim, Martin said, because it was based on outdated data. 'Why would somebody want to fearmonger?' Martin told Breaking Defense. 'Why would somebody want to put out data and tell pilots, you know, things that are incorrect and give pilots pause for thought, when what they absolutely should be doing is pulling their handle? That's the part that we find slightly irresponsible.' Safety is, of course, the top priority for both ejection seat-makers, as their product is one that's only intended to be used when a pilot's life is in grave danger already. But the comments also come as hundreds of millions of dollars are on the line amid a ticking clock: By the end of the year, the Air Force plans to complete a review of the Next Generation Ejection Seat (NGES) program, whose contract is currently held by Collins. Sometime after that, the service could decide to change its acquisition strategy, potentially shifting the rights to produce ejection seats for hundreds, if not thousands, of US aircraft. To be clear, once the review concludes, the Air Force could still stick with its incumbent acquisition strategy, where Collins is already underway with work on the F-15E. And if the service does change its mind, that might not mean a complete switch from US-based Collins, a subsidiary of defense giant RTX, to UK-based Martin-Baker. A full competition could still lead to Collins emerging victorious, or theoretically result in some split of work between the two companies. But any time there is even the chance to grab market share, the two members of the ejection seat duopoly know they have to go all-in, given the narrow nature of the business. 'There are certain markets that are just a natural for a small number of entrants,' JJ Gertler, an analyst at the Teal Group consultancy, said in an interview. Likening the ejection seat market to hockey resurfacing work, where Zamboni and Olympia products dominate, Gertler noted that specific aircraft tend to use the same ejection seat — a departure from other circumstances, like when different engines could power the same fighter. 'So each contract tends to be all-or-nothing for the ejection seat companies,' he said. It’s unclear how a competition might impact the already-delayed seat plan. For each platform under the NGES effort, 'the Air Force projects a 36-month integration and test program, followed by a 24-month manufacturing lead-time, followed by aircraft modifications,' the Air Force spokesperson said. Asked how a competition could impact that timeline, the spokesperson replied that '[i]nformation gathered from industry in the [August] sources sought notice will inform us on potential impacts to platform integration timelines.' 'It's cheap leverage,' Gertler said regarding the new market research. 'It's a time-honored tactic for putting some pressure on an incumbent vendor to perform better.' The story starts back in 2019, when the Air Force awarded Collins Aerospace a sole-source deal for NGES. But much has changed since then, according to the Air Force spokesperson. First, the Air Force now wants to completely divest the A-10 Warthog — mirroring a raft of other retirements across the service — prompting officials to nix plans to put a new seat in the aircraft. And second, 'significant delays' to integrate new seats in the remaining platforms under the NGES program have prompted the service to re-open the potential for a competition by launching a new round of market research in August. When the NGES deal was awarded, the Air Force reasoned that Collins was the only company effectively able to offer a seat for the program via the firm’s ACES 5, which is separately slated to replace seats in the B-2 stealth bomber and serve as the ejection seat for Boeing’s new T-7A training jet. At the time, Martin-Baker officials say, the Air Force told the company it was going to offer Collins a sole-source contract because Martin-Baker simply wasn't going to meet the requirements the service sought. 'We disagreed violently' with the Air Force’s reasoning, 'but we didn't [protest] that,' Steve Roberts, the company’s head of business development, said in an interview at the Air and Space Forces Association conference in September. Then in 2020, Martin-Baker’s US18E was picked by Lockheed Martin for foreign sales of the F-16, and the NGES effort hit delays. The latter event in particular prompted the Air Force’s recent move to once again survey industry. The Air Force spokesperson did not comment on the exact length of the delays for NGES, but budget documents point to four years of added time for the program. Specifically, fiscal 2019 documents [PDF] projected that a qualification campaign for NGES would run until the fourth quarter of 2023, but FY25 materials [PDF] indicate qualification efforts aren’t expected to complete until the final quarter of 2027. A Collins spokesperson disputed that timeline in an email to Breaking Defense, acknowledging that while there have been delays, 'current qualification efforts[…] are not forecasted to be delayed by four years. The first qualification effort for the F-15 is expected to be completed in late Q2/early Q3 2025,' they said. The company 'is standing by to support qualification for follow-on platforms, including parallel qualification efforts, to support the U.S. Air Force’s schedule,' they added. Meanwhile, there have been some recent hiccups with NGES. The government issued a 90-day stop-work order in July, halting work underway on the F-15E 'while we re-validate the acquisition strategy,' the Air Force spokesperson said. A representative for Collins subsequently told Breaking Defense that the order stopping work was lifted in October. Asked why the Air Force lifted the stop-work order despite the ongoing NGES review, the Air Force spokesperson confirmed the order ended '[a]fter achieving alignment on contractual requirements' for the existing acquisition plan. 'The program office still projects the market research update and acquisition strategy review will conclude by the end of the year,' the spokesperson added. The Air Force spokesperson attributed initial NGES delays to COVID-19 supply chain issues, but said more recent setbacks stem from 'realized aircraft integration risks and misalignment on contractual requirements.' The service 'is focused on developing a safe, reliable, and sustainable new ejection capability for the warfighter,' the spokesperson added. Tech. Sgt.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Emily Kenney) The delays have caught the attention of House lawmakers, who urged the Pentagon in a draft of the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act to evaluate whether the NGES acquisition strategy should be reconsidered. House authorizers additionally called out delays for a separate effort to integrate the ACES 5 in the B-2 stealth bomber. Asked about the NGES program’s setbacks in an interview at AFA, Rob Makros, a business development executive for ejection seats at Collins, told Breaking Defense that 'Safety is first and foremost' for the company. 'Anytime you have any type of concerns with the seat — not saying there were any concerns with the seat, but you have lots of issues that come up that are unforeseen — then you need to take the steps to make sure that you're addressing them,' he continued. He added that the company has a 'tailored approach' to get back on schedule. After the F-15, the Air Force will then move to qualify seats for the F-16, F-22 and then B-1, Makros said. (All four aircraft are equipped with Collins's legacy ACES II seat.) The Collins spokesperson added that the Air Force has removed requirements for the F-15C/D while keeping those in place for the F-15E, and that a contract modification was signed earlier this year 'to include the F-15EX as a qualified platform variant.' Looking ahead, the company is 'prepared to begin work on the NGES F-16 and have the infrastructure in place to support concurrent delivery orders to maintain our customer’s schedule,' the spokesperson said. Regarding the B-2, Makros said the seats for the stealth bomber have been manufactured, but that the planes need to enter their respective depot cycles to receive their new seats. The Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense the effort that includes placing a new ejection seat in the B-2, called the B-2 Safety and Sustainment Program, received airworthiness approval in July. Installing the new seats 'must be scheduled based on aircraft availability,' they added. On Oct. 21, the Air Force announced that one B-2 bomber dubbed the 'Spirit of Nebraska' had finished a planned depot stop more quickly than in previous years due to new techniques that sped up work. However, a spokesperson for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center told Breaking Defense the B-2 in question did not receive the new ACES 5 seats. The Collins spokesperson referred questions on airworthiness to the Air Force, but stated that the company is 'on standby to support installations' for the B-2 fleet. There are only so many Western planes in the world that need new ejection seats at any given time, so contract opportunities often end up as a dogfight between Collins and Martin-Baker. But the idea that Collins could suddenly have to defend its NGES work after having the deal sewn up for five years is leading the company to take a more aggressive public posture. In an email to Breaking Defense, a spokesperson for Collins shared several stats on the company’s ACES seat, including the claim that 'unlike other seats that can have ejection back injury rates as high as 40 percent' — a clear swipe at its rival — 'ACES has an ejection spinal injury rate of less than 1 percent.' Representatives for Martin-Baker, including Martin himself, disputed those characterizations, arguing that Collins was operating with outdated data for seats going back decades. Martin-Baker’s current seats for Air Force and Navy aircraft meet a standard one percent spinal injury rate, said Roberts. 'There are parameters the government will ensure called dynamic response,' Roberts said at the company’s AFA booth, where video of a series of crashes for aircraft like the F-35, which has a Martin-Baker seat, played on loop. 'They make sure that the modern seats meet modern requirements.' Reducing risk of injury to pilots is a key goal of the NGES program, which includes a focus on accommodating a wider range of body types. NGES is also intended to compensate for changes to flying missions like the proliferation of helmet mounted displays — heavy instruments sitting atop a pilot’s head that pose hazards when punching out. Both firms say their seats have made the necessary changes to keep pace with modern demands. The two also say they’ve incorporated other design tweaks, like introducing greater modularity to ease the maintenance process. And as a potential competition looms, the seat makers are making their closing arguments. 'I see it as the Air Force doing their due diligence,' Makros said. 'I am confident that ACES 5, being the gold standard and the safest on the market, is the seat for the Air Force. I believe the Air Force thinks this too,' he said. For its part, Martin-Baker isn’t necessarily trying to unseat Collins as the sole manufacturer for NGES, Martin said. Instead, the company believes the Air Force should take a piecemeal approach at platform integration, opening up the opportunity for both firms to play a role in NGES. 'There's no frustration. There's no animosity. We're all in the life-saving business,' Martin said. 'And I think our message to the Air Force has been, it doesn't have to be winner-takes-all.' But the stakes are higher for Martin-Baker than Collins, Gertler observed. For its part, Collins has a diversified portfolio that includes other products like avionics, and is a division of a much larger aerospace company. Martin-Baker, on the other hand, is a 'pure play ejection seat company,' meaning new ejection seat work is relatively more important. 'So in a way, a new contract for Collins is a very-nice-to-have. A new contract for Martin-Baker is a must-have,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/as-air-force-reviews-ejection-seat-deal-collins-martin-baker-gear-up-for-a-fight/	2024-11-15T07:45:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/F-15-scaled-e1731683936418.jpg
Chinese sanctions on US drone firm were ‘signal’ about supply chain weaknesses: DIU official	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019. (DVIDS) 'As a former American soldier, I don't want Chinese things in the hands of my fellow soldiers. Unacceptable,' David Michelson, director of the autonomy portfolio at the DIU, said Wednesday during a Defense One event. 'I think this is just a signal from the PRC [People's Republic of China] that we are very tightly coupled with certain parts of the supply chain still.' Michelson had been asked about recent Chinese sanctions on the US small drone-maker Skydio over its business with Taiwan, though the company says its only customer in Taiwan is the National Fire Agency. In a blog post, Skydio said it sources components for its drones outside China, but had gotten batteries from Chinese sources — at least until the sanctions cut off that supply. In the Oct. 30 note, the company said it's rationing the batteries it has in stock and is developing other sources. Though Skydio counts the US military among its customers, the US isn't the only nation likely to be reminded of China's influence in supply chains. Ukraine, currently fighting of a Russian invasion, reportedly has hundreds of Skydio drones. More broadly the ubiquity of Chinese components in battlefield tech has long-troubled the Pentagon and American allies. In 2020 the DIU launched its Blue UAS program, a 'holistic and continuous approach that rapidly vets and scales commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology for the Department of Defense (DoD)' in part to ensure parts don’t come from adversaries. Some companies like Lyten, a Silicon Valley battery startup, are already taking steps to avoid future run-ins with Section 154. Lyten announced on Wednesday that it acquired manufacturing assets from Northvolt, a Swedish battery manufacturer. This move will allow Lyten to manufacture up to 175 megawatt-per-hour (one million watts of power for one hour) of Lithium-Sulfur batteries 'to meet growing demand from defense, drone, and energy storage applications,' according to a company statement provided to Breaking Defense. 'The speed of Lyten’s manufacturing expansion represents a timely move to assist the U.S. Department of Defense and the military services in complying with the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which mandates the acquisition of domestic batteries,' Dan Cook, Lyten’s CEO and cofounder, wrote in the statement. The battery conundrum is a timely one, as Michelson said the US needs to seriously invest in drones. 'One of the things we've learned from Ukraine ... is you need a lot. You just have to have a lot, and the volume that we're seeing is just in a very difficult place right now,' Michelson said. 'So the more we can buy, the more that we can field, the more that we can have units have [drones] in their hands and learn, the better and better we're going to get.'

GREMLIN, but no aliens: Pentagon UAP office plans first deployment of new sensor suite	A trail of a group of SpaceX's Starlink satellites passing over Uruguay. The Pentagon is seeing an uptick in reports that mistake Starlink for UFOs. (Photo by Mariana SUAREZ / AFP) (Photo by MARIANA SUAREZ/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department today issued its fiscal 2024 report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), which once again, finds no evidence of aliens among the 757 UAP sightings documented — but does include a few new details about the Pentagon's mysterious GREMLIN sensor suite designed to detect, track and hopefully figure out what those weird lights in the sky (or under the sea) actually are. The report, issued by DoD's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), covers a total of 757 reported incidents: 485 that occurred between May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024; and another 272 incidents between 2021 and 2022 but were not relayed to AARO until this reporting cycle. Many of those incidents occurred near military bases or US nuclear facilities, the report adds. AARO says it resolved 118 of the cases as involving 'prosaic objects such as various types of balloons, birds, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS); and another 174 are near to closure for same reasons. 'I want to emphasize that although only a very small percentage of reports to AARO are potentially anomalous, these are the cases that require significant time, resources and a focused scientific inquiry by AARO and its partners,' Jon Kosloski, AARO director, told reporters today. 'It is also important to underscore that to date, AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology. None of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies,' he added. The AARO report, perhaps unsurprisingly, throws cold water on some of the more out-there allegations made during recent hearings in the House Oversight and Accountability Committee — such as claims that the Pentagon has discovered evidence of alien craft and biological material. For example, at a joint hearing of the Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation subcommittee and the National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Wednesday, several witnesses alleged that DoD and the White House are hiding evidence of alien activity, including crashes of extraterrestrial craft, from Congress and the public in top secret programs. (The Pentagon has denied such a concerted coverup.) Most of the cases documented in the AARO FY24 report, as in previous reports, involved objects in the atmosphere reported by civil and military pilots, the report explains. 'Of these reports, 708 occurred in the air domain, 49 occurred in the space domain, and none occurred in the maritime or transmedium domains,' it says. (Transmedium refers to objects that cross domains, such as flying from the atmosphere into outer space.) The report notes that there has been an uptick in cases that involve observers mistaking satellites in SpaceX's massive Starlink broadband constellation for UAPs. 'AARO increasingly receives cases that it is able to resolve to the Starlink satellite constellation,' it says. 'AARO is investigating if other unresolved cases may be attributed to the expansion of the Starlink and other mega-constellations in low earth orbit.' An overview of the GREMLIN network for detecting UAPs. (DoD All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, Nov. 14, 2024) Aliens or not, the report further provides details about AARO's efforts to improve its ability to detect, track and characterize UAP — including a bit more information about the GREMLIN sensor architecture first revealed by the office last year. GREMLIN is a network of 2D and 3D radar, and long-range electro-optical and infrared telescopes developed by the Georgia Tech Research Institute, the report explains. 2D radar measure range and azimuth (direction); 3D radar measure range, azimuth and elevation of target objects. The report says that GREMLIN 'successfully collected data' during a test in March, and will now be deployed at a 'national security site' for a 90-day 'pattern of life collection.' Kosloski refused to reveal the exact location, although he said GREMLIN already is in place there. 'We'd rather not say exactly where it is, because we want it to be an unbiased test and don't want to invite folks to come and do flyovers and test against the system. We chose that specific location because of the environment. We expect there to be a lot of variety in the types of things that we're going to see. And there had been UAP reports in that general area,' he said. The report further says that AARO is developing a new science and technology plan to outline and address 'the challenges facing UAP detection and identification such as a lack of high quality sensor data and a series of gaps in the scientific knowledge base.' For example, Kosloski said his office intends to increase its engagement with foreign partners to obtain a broader array of sensors, data, and information on UAP. Finally, he acknowledged that Congress has an 'understandable concern' about secrecy surrounding UAP, but explained that the process for lowering classification is complicated because it involves numerous agencies, including from the Intelligence Community (IC). Nevertheless, he added, AARO has 'taken significant steps' to try to speed declassification of what it can release without jeopardizing 'sensitive' information, for example that could reveal IC sources and methods. 'We've hired a number of declassification experts. We're going to be hosting a declassification workshop so we can make sure we're implementing best practices from across the DoD and the IC. All of that takes more time than I think the public would like for it to take. But ARRO is working on it,' Kosloski said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/gremlin-but-no-aliens-pentagon-uap-office-plans-first-deployment-of-new-sensor-suite/	2024-11-14T13:15:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/220830_starlink_sky_streak_GettyImages-1231167449-scaled-e1661980807658.jpg
FAA initiates review of commercial launch rules industry claims throttle innovation, new entrants	A couple views the Starship Flight 3 Rocket a day before its March 13, 2024 launch from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, facility. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today kicked off a review of its rules for granting commercial space launch and re-entry licenses — rules that when published in 2020 were meant to streamline its processes to accommodate a booming market, but which have been savaged by industry as instead creating unnecessary obstacles and delays. While the FAA rules do not apply to launches by the US Space Force or other federal agencies such as NASA and the National Reconnaissance Office, a healthy and diverse US commercial rocket market is important for keeping down government costs. Further, national security officials in recent months have been fretting about the fact that at the moment, Elon Musk's SpaceX, in effect, has a monopoly on US space launch. For example, SpaceX currently is the only company certified to launch critical payloads under the Space Force's National Security Space Launch Lane 2 program. 'The FAA is seeking to update the licensing rule to foster more clarity, flexibility, efficiency, and innovation,' said FAA Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation Kelvin Coleman in the agency's statement today. 'Making timely licensing determinations without compromising public safety is a top priority.' The FAA's announcement noted that it approved 'a record 148 licensed commercial space operations' in fiscal year 2024, an increase of 'more than 30 percent' over last year. 'The FAA forecasts that number may more than double by FY 2028 and is launching an Aerospace Rulemaking Committee to update the FAA’s Part 450 launch and reentry licensing rule,' it added. The Part 450 launch and reentry licensing rule is primarily focused on ensuring public safety, such as making sure that companies have proper containment measures in case of a launch pad explosion. But it also includes requirements for things like environmental protection. A number of commercial firms, and industry supporters in Congress, have complained bitterly about the rule, charging that it is confusing and is causing severe licensing delays that are harming innovation and US industry's market status. SpaceX in particular has been a vocal critic, especially following the FAA's Sept. 17 announcement that it was proposing to fine SpaceX $633,009 'for allegedly failing to follow its license requirements during two launches in 2023.' That action, which followed an earlier fine and delays in SpaceX obtaining a launch license for testing its giant Starship rocket — which the Space Force is eying as a possible through-space cargo carrier — has led to an ongoing feud between the agency and the company, with Musk threatening a lawsuit in a post on his social media site X (formerly Twitter). Musk now has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to co-chair a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' alongside former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to slash bureaucratic red tape. 'It was widely expected that the FAA would begin the process of updating its licensing regulations, and it is something the Trump administration is likely to accelerate. Given the apparent influence of Musk and whatever advisory or formal role he may play in the new administration, we should expect to see much more forward-leaning changes that make it faster and easier for companies to obtain launch licenses,' Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told Breaking Defense today. According to the FAA announcement, the review committee 'will consist of members of the commercial space industry and academia and will focus on nine topics, including flight safety analyses, system safety, and means of compliance.' A report enumerating recommended changes is expected 'by late summer 2025,' which in turn would underpin future rulemaking to legalize reforms, the agency's announcement explained. 'The FAA is reaching out to invite stakeholders to participate, with an initial meeting being scheduled during the first week of December,' it added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/faa-initiates-review-of-commercial-launch-rules-industry-claims-throttle-innovation-new-entrants/	2024-11-14T12:00:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240531_spacex_starship_GettyImages-2081922493-scaled-e1717175941296.jpg
‘Glimpse into the future’: US Central Command plans to fly MQ-25 unmanned refueler	MQ-25 Stingray prototype T1 refuels an F/A-18F Super Hornet in mid-air for the first time BEIRUT — Offering a 'glimpse into the future of naval aviation,' the Navy's MQ-25 Stingray unmanned refueling aircraft is expected to take to the skies over the Middle East, where it will join the MQ-4C Triton UAV that's already there, according to the Navy's leader in US Central Command. 'The [MQ-25] platform will set a new standard for future unmanned operations from the sea,' commander of the NAVCENT and Fifth Fleet Vice Adm. George Wikoff reportedly said this week at the Manama Air Power Symposium. The MQ-25, which is still in development, paired with the MQ-4C will 'provide fleet commanders the most modern detection and collection centers available with open architectures to allow future expansion,' he said. The two unmanned systems will be deployed on board of USS Abraham Lincoln carrier alongside P-8 Poseidon and F-35 lightning fighter jets, according to Wikoff's remarks as reported by National Defense magazine. A Central Command spokesperson confirmed Wikoff's comments. As of April, the Navy expected its first MQ-25s to go operational in 2026, though National Defense reported it could join the fleet in 2025. 'The MQ-25 gives us a glimpse into the future of naval aviation, demonstrating the potential force multiplier advanced uncrewed systems will play in the carrier air wing moving forward,' Wikoff said in Manama. In August the Navy said it had finished the first carrier-based control room designed to operate the MQ-25 aboard the George H. W. Bush, and the next month MQ-25 maker Boeing said it had demonstrated the ability for a crew of a P-8 surveillance aircraft to control the MQ-25 mid-flight.

(US Navy photo by LT Alex Delgado/released) The MQ-4C Triton, which reached initial operating capability last year, is a large, long-range unmanned platform based on the Air Force's Global Hawk. The Navy announced in October that it had established a third 'orbit' of Triton operations within Fifth Fleet's Area of Operations (AOR), after deployments to Guam and Italy. US Central Command's AOR covers Northeast Africa, Middle East, Central and South Asia, and the Fifth Fleet's encompasses the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman and part of Indian Ocean, a vast expanse that also includes critical chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb and Suez Canal. The MQ-25 will join a host of other unmanned platforms the US has deployed to the Middle East, many of them surface maritime vessels, in a separate effort led by the Navy's Task Group 59.1.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/glimpse-into-the-future-us-central-command-plans-to-fly-mq-25-unmanned-refueler/	2024-11-14T11:09:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241114_DVIDS_mq4_triton_8516590-e1731610395723.jpg
Nuclear power for military bases will increase our national security	Twin containment domes, that house the nuclear reactors, clear the morning fog at the Diablo Nuclear Power Plant in San Luis Obispo on August 9, 2024. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) President-Elect Donald Trump enacted pro-nuclear policies during his first term and has supported an 'all-of-the-above' energy policy during the campaign. At a campaign rally in Michigan on Aug. 29, he stated, 'Starting on day one, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new reactors and we will slash the red tape. We will get the job done.' This is exactly the posture needed to meet energy power demands — especially on the national security front, where the threats to energy infrastructure are all too real. We worked with our colleagues at the Pentagon, the Department of Energy and the White House Office of Management and Budget together during our time in President Trump’s first administration to launch several of these efforts, and his campaign comments are a good sign that they will continue going forward. The US Air Force, Army, and Navy, as well as other offices in the Department of Defense have been working on deployment of nuclear energy sources to enhance energy resilience for national security missions. And that progress needs to continue, despite pushback from critics of nuclear power who view any nuclear energy project with suspicion, fear or misinformation. A prime example of this kind of commentary can be found in an Oct. 7 op-ed by Alan J. Kuperman entitled, 'On Army bases, nuclear energy can’t add resilience, just costs and risks' published in Breaking Defense. While we are sure Mr. Kuperman and his Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Project (NPPP) intended to be honest brokers, they provided information that alternates between being incorrect and out of date. Given the likelihood that a new Trump administration continues to support nuclear power for military purposes, we would like to set the record straight. Any discussion on military nuclear power must begin by noting that the Department of Defense has a proud tradition of operating nuclear reactors safely on submarines and aircraft carriers with tremendous benefits for over sixty years. For certain critical missions, the resilience, reliability, and efficiency of a compact, high-power nuclear source is worth the engineering costs expended to reduce risk in contingency environments. With that backdrop, let us address a key part of Mr. Kuperman’s claims, that backup power requirements for the reactors being discussed for military bases would effectively neutralize any benefits gained by using nuclear power. A review of the programs within DoD show that current advanced reactor designs being considered by the Department of Defense may not require backup power. Natural air circulation and convection for heat removal eliminates the need for power driven cooling. For designs that do require backup power, it is a fraction of the primary power produced by the reactor. Further, and more importantly, many of the advanced reactor designs under consideration are inherently and passively safe, using the laws of physics to initiate protections in any conceivable situation. Kuperman also argues that nuclear reactors are an inherently risky target to have on a military base. Certainly, any power source on a base would be a likely target for an enemy striking at it — though we would argue that if an enemy is striking military bases in the homeland, the situation is already about as bad as it would get — which is why its important to note that over the last two decades, nuclear engineers have significantly increased safety in the reactor itself by using molten salts or liquid metals instead of water to cool the reactor. More importantly advancements in nuclear fuel, starting with tri-structural isotropic particle fuel (TRISO), which encloses the uranium in ceramic and carbon-based layers to keep the fuel contained and resistant to corrosion and melting, significantly reduces the concern for a radiological incident if attacked. Kuperman ignores these innovations to scare people about the risk of a wide-spread radioactive event. It’s like arguing about automobile safety today by citing the engineering concerns of a 1959 Corvair. We must acknowledge the role of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to protect human safety, and the innovations in nuclear fuel stability, methods of cooling, and modern reactor construction developed in our National Energy Labs and private industry over the last 5 years. Despite naysayers, it has been an amazing year for the resurgence of interest in nuclear power. Recent decisions by California, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to extend or restart existing nuclear power plants reverses decades of misguided closures that have made our nation more vulnerable to power outages. The private sector is investing billions of their own on reactors to meet the growing demand of digital technologies. Nuclear power provides an alternative to gigawatts of diesel generators and intermittent renewable sources whose varying outputs, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation are adding volatility to national electrical grids. Secretaries of Energy representing Republican and Democratic administrations have supported nuclear energy development and deployment, with current US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm recently stating, 'Nuclear power is America’s largest source of carbon-free of electricity, supporting hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the country and will play a critical role in tackling the climate crisis and protecting public health and the environment from its impacts,' The DOE then followed with an updated strategy, Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Advanced Nuclear report, to support the development of new generations of nuclear power technology. The military, rightly, is following suit. The US Navy just followed the Army’s lead by announcing its exploration of nuclear power for military bases in the mid-Atlantic region. The US Air Force continues its effort in Alaska and is looking for more opportunities to enhance energy resilience with dedicated nuclear reactors. NASA also wants to use nuclear fuel for propulsion and lunar energy. And the progress of Project Pele, a DoD transportable nuclear reactor being constructed at Idaho National Laboratory is real, despite Mr. Kuperman’s assertions otherwise. There should, of course, be a discussion about the challenges and efficacy of nuclear power to meet national security, energy reliability, and sustainability goals for the Department of Defense and our nation. But we can’t let bad information cloud that discussion. The Army is on the right path for interest and investments in the development of nuclear power for its critical bases and industrial activities. They have been carefully assessing developer responses from their June 2024 request, and will be down-selecting a preferred group of vendors in the next 30 days to continue exploration of nuclear power for installations. The service will do its due diligence, and we are confident in the end it will move forward with a smart, careful testing of nuclear power. And when they discover how well those tests work, a whole new frontier for nuclear energy will emerge — for the benefit of our national security.

Germany has given a ‘positive response’ to potential Turkish Eurofighter deal: Official	A German Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet armed with Taurus long range cruise missiles takes flight (Taurus) BEIRUT — In what would be a key reversal, Germany is apparently coming around to the potential sale of Eurofighter Typhoons to Turkey, according to a senior Turkish official. 'We will acquire 40 Eurofighter Typhoon jets,' Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler said during a televised interview Wednesday. 'Germany had been reluctant for a long time, but with the constructive contributions of our NATO allies Italy, the UK, and Spain, they finally gave a positive response.' Those comments came hours before Reuters reported that an unnamed Turkish official claimed the German government had directed its sales authority to work on the potential sale, though he said that didn't mean the process is complete. Germany does not appear to have put out a statement about any change in Berlin's stance, and the German Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a European fourth-generation fighter jet consortium comprised of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain, and is built by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo. If any of the four partnering countries vetoes an export order, the deal is halted, as seen when Germany put a block on the sale of Eurofighter Typhoons to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Gular announced in November last year that Turkey was in talks to buy 40 Eurofighter Typhoons. At the time, analysts told Breaking Defense that the pronouncement could've been something of a gambit, aimed in part at giving Ankara bargaining power in its years-long quest for new American F-16s. In January, the Biden administration gave the greenlight for a potential deal for Ankara to buy 40 new F-16s for $23 billion. 'Turkey’s approach to securing the Eurofighter deal involves leveraging diplomatic relations, with the UK and Spain playing pivotal roles in persuading Germany not to veto the agreement,' Ali Bakir, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told Breaking Defense when the potential deal was first announced. 'However, Germany’s history of imposing restrictions and sanctions on defense deals with Turkey, often under dubious or politically motivated pretexts, remains possible.' Can Kasapoglu, director of defense research at the Istanbul-based Edam think tank, emphasized in November 2023 that a successful Eurofighter deal wouldn’t necessarily preclude an additional F-16 deal. 'Turkish air power has a stopgap trouble up until the indigenous KAAN makes it,' Kasapoglu said. 'The [Eurofighter] can offer some relief, depending on the tranche.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/germany-has-given-a-positive-response-to-potential-turkish-eurofighter-deal-official/	2024-11-14T09:16:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/eurofighter-typhoon_flight-tests-with-taurus-kepd-350-missile-started_c_j-gietl_copyright-airbus-ds-e1731598143660.jpg
AUKUS partners to stand up electronic warfare intel-sharing framework	Australian Combat Systems Operators and Electronic Warfare sailors manning consoles in the operations room onboard HMAS Anzac during Exercise BERSAMA GOLD 21 in October 2021. (Australian Department of Defence) WASHINGTON — In alignment with its Pillar II priorities, the AUKUS trilateral security alliance is standing up a data-sharing framework dedicated to electronic warfare (EW), according to a Pentagon EW official. 'We are not out there alone, and we share that with our allies and partners, and they also have some pretty exceptional capabilities,' Travis Manning, the US lead for the AUKUS EW working group, said at a Defense One event Wednesday. Manning is also the deputy director of electronic warfare in the Office of the Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. The framework will take some time to come together, as the working group plans to iterate through cycles of feedback before going fully online. After these feedback cycles are completed, the nations and their respective military services can decide on how to implement the data-sharing platforms. Manning said that if all goes well, eventually maritime, ground and air units will be able to share EW intelligence with each other 'all in the same place.' Though AUKUS’ goal of sharing EW data on one network does not exist yet, the concept of data sharing between international allies in the Indo-Pacific isn’t new. At the end of last year, the Indo-Pacific Comand stood up the INDOPACOM Mission Network, which is designed to allow warfighters in the region to share data with partners and allies in a zero trust environment. Similarly, as Breaking Defense reported in December, Australia’s top intelligence official revealed then the development of a 'Top Secret' intelligence cloud that is planned to be interoperable with US and UK spy networks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aukus-partners-to-stand-up-electronic-warfare-intel-sharing-framework/	2024-11-14T07:06:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241114_aussie_EW_20211016ran8535379_0121-e1731596594417.jpg
Harnessing data to power the future of space domain awareness	Image: Courtesy of L3Harris. For the U.S. security community, space these days looks less like a vast, empty frontier, and more like the Los Angeles freeway system at rush hour. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), about 30,000 objects larger than a softball are currently orbiting Earth, presenting the U.S. military with a massive challenge: How to maintain an advantage in space and safeguard our assets in an increasingly complex, chaotic domain. In fact, the U.S. Space Command has called space domain awareness (SDA) — or the ability to detect, track and identify objects in orbit and predict potential threats — a top priority in upholding its mission to deter conflict and defend U.S. interests. L3Harris is serving as a vital partner in the effort, working to ensure the agency can effectively manage and analyze the vast amounts of data necessary for SDA. L3Harris is the sole vendor contracted on the development and long-term sustainment of the U.S. Space Force, Space Systems Command’s (SSC) Consolidated Operational Data Archive (CODA), a software system that can ingest and translate tens of thousands of data points from commercial and nontraditional sources and compare them against existing information in the Space Force’s Unified Data Library (UDL). L3Harris is responsible for the future development and long-term sustainment of Space Systems Command’s Consolidated Operational Data Archive, an automated system that provides U.S. Space Force operators with access to commercial and non-traditional data sources, expanding the amount of data that can be transformed into actionable information. CODA’s automation capabilities save hundreds of hours of manual labor and cut data processing times from hours to just 3-5 minutes, dramatically improving space operators’ ability to make informed decisions and respond to potential threats in near real-time. CODA was recently approved for an upcoming operational trial period, during which a Space Force operations unit will evaluate the system’s ability to integrate data streams from a commercial provider and the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Wide-Area Search telescope system into a standardized workflow. 'Traditional systems were not designed to handle the volume of data generated by satellites, debris, and other objects, introducing the potential for gaps in space domain awareness,' says Charles Clarkson, Vice President and General Manager, Space Superiority and Imaging, L3Harris. 'With CODA, we’re applying more than 30 years of space domain awareness expertise to give warfighters an advanced tool to detect, track and respond to potential threats faster and more effectively.' A critical contributor to CODA’s success, Clarkson notes, is its integration with commercial technologies to standardize and automate data processing and sharing across systems. For example, it can ingest JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data schemas from the UDL, translate them into one of several primary data formats, and deliver them to the Non-Traditional Data Pre-Processor (NDPP) for operational use – all in a fraction of the time it used to take. 'Enabling these systems to ‘talk’ to one another and work seamlessly together is a huge win for the warfighter,' Clarkson says. 'As operators get more familiar with the system, we’ll develop additional tools to support an even broader range of data, ultimately making space operations even more efficient and secure.' Futureproofing our space domain awareness architecture CODA is part of broader efforts to modernize, operate, and sustain the Space Force’s ground-based SDA sensors. In 2020, the service awarded L3Harris a contract for the Maintenance of Space Situational Awareness Integrated Capabilities (MOSSAIC) program, which built on previous 2020 efforts to maintain and upgrade radar and optical sensors, including the command and control systems that provide timely and accurate SDA data for military, civil, and commercial users. Subsequent option year awards have enabled L3Harris to perform maintenance and upgrades to space domain ground systems, supporting the execution of mission tasks associated with emerging threats. As for what’s next, L3Harris is already looking around the bend. 'As we expand CODA’s capabilities, we’re focused on how we can help warfighters not just respond to current challenges, but anticipate tomorrow’s,' Clarkson says. 'As the Trusted Disruptor, we’ll continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in ensuring our nation’s space operations remain resilient, secure, and future-ready in an ever-evolving domain.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/harnessing-data-to-power-the-future-of-space-domain-awareness/	2024-11-14T06:51:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/26783-Mossaic-Hero-Image-1280x854-FINAL-1.jpg
Could Trump establish a Space National Guard? Officials and experts say it’s likely	US Air Force Staff Sgt. Rhyan Acey performs maintenance on the AN-TSQ-180 Milstar Communications Vehicle July 28, 2021 at the 233rd Space Group, Greeley Air National Guard Station, Greeley, Colo. (US Air National Guard photo by Master Sgt. Amanda Geiger) WASHINGTON — Given President-elect Donald Trump's vocal support, chances for the creation of a Space National Guard are high, according to experts, supporters of the plan and several Guard officials. Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that there are 'pretty good odds for a Space National Guard,' although its congressional approval 'might have to wait for the legislative cycle.' However, he added, with Republicans soon to be in control of the House and Senate, it is 'hard to foresee any congressional barriers.' One Guard official agreed, noting that Trump in his victory speech vowed he would keep his campaign promises. 'This will be a very easy one to chalk up in his first 100 days, because it's been talked about for so many years,' said the official, who spoke to Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity. Trump, who established the Space Force during his first term, told the National Guard Association in August that the 'time has come' for a Space National Guard. 'As president, I will sign historic legislation creating a Space National Guard,' he said then. Several supporters of a Space National Guard told Breaking Defense it might even be possible for lawmakers to give the green light in the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which is still being negotiated, especially if finalization is pushed until after the inauguration. At the moment, the Senate version of the NDAA supports the Defense Department position to forgo a separate Space Guard in favor of transferring Air National Guard members with space expertise to the Space Force either full or part time, a path opposed strongly by the National Guard and 48 governors of US states and territories. The House version would require DoD to get consent from the governors of the states for the transfers. Neither calls for the establishment of a new Space Guard outright. Given that the two sides differ, experts and officials said, there is scope for pushing through an agreement based on past bills introduced into both chambers, but never voted upon, that would instead approve the creation of a Space National Guard — the House version sponsored by Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo.; the Senate version by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. But timing is up in the air and if Trump's first term is anything to go by, nothing is final until the man himself signs on the dotted line. A second Guard official told Breaking Defense that while space practitioners within the Guard believe that 'the Trump team will push' for a Space National Guard, they also are cognizant that 'the president-elect has many agenda items to pursue.' For that reason, the official said, there unlikely will be any formal pressure put on Trump by the National Guard Bureau. While Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has been a strong supporter of the Pentagon's position against a separate Space Guard both from a cost and personnel view, the service not always been on board. In a March 2021 report to Congress, signed by then-Acting Secretary John Roth and obtained by Breaking Defense, the Air Force endorsed a two-pronged organization to handle the issue of Space Force reservists and Guard service members: a Space Force component that effectively would absorb reservists into active duty status as part-time personnel alongside full-time Guardians as well as a Space National Guard. The report outlined a study of options conducted by the Department of the Air Force (DAF) for a 'Single Component Service (SCS)' conducted from February 2020 to May 2020. That study found that 'a SCS introduced higher complexity, and irreconcilable legislative and policy barriers due to conflicting Title 32 and Title 10 authorities, when absorbing the current Air National Guard (ANG) construct into the new component.' Further, according to the report, the study found 'because the existing ANG space units are solely Guard manned and equipped, it would result in an unacceptable level of risk to USSF mission execution as analysis estimated most members in the ANG space units would not volunteer to transfer to the new component, creating an immediate gap in capability, and a cost to rebuild mission capability. Moreover, the Space National Guard (SNG) provides crucial and immediate access to the State Partnership Program, enabling USSF's ability to rapidly build partner capacity.' However, following the decision by the White House Office of Management and Budget to reject a Space National Guard announced in September 2021, the Air Force in April 2024 released to Congress a new study that supported the White House position.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/could-trump-establish-a-space-national-guard-officials-and-experts-say-its-likely/	2024-11-14T04:54:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Air-Nat-Guard-space-exercise-scaled-e1714406537877.jpeg
Anduril, General Atomics drone wingmen clear critical design review, Air Force says	Anduril's Fury drone, which the company is pitching for the CCA program. (Anduril photo) WASHINGTON — Defense tech startup Anduril Industries and legacy dronemaker General Atomics have both completed a key assessment of their designs for the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, a service official said today, paving the way for both companies’ drone wingmen to take to the skies next year. 'We've just finished up, basically, critical design review for both Anduril and General Atomics. Both industry teammates are on the path to get to first flight in a timeline that allows us to get operational capability by the end of the decade,' Air Force Col. Timothy Helfrich, senior materiel leader for the advanced aircraft division of Air Force Materiel Command, said during an event hosted by the Mitchell Institute today. 'We are on on track, if not ahead, in some areas,' he added. The CCA program aims to initially field roughly 1,000 of the drone wingmen that are expected to fly and fight alongside Air Force aircraft, like fighter jets. The service expects the drones to be operational by the end of the decade. After beating out aerospace giants Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in April for the current CCA contract that will fund drone prototypes from the two companies, Anduril and General Atomics have started the manufacturing process for their respective drone wingmen designs. Anduril is offering a drone dubbed Fury, whereas General Atomics is pitching Gambit, which the company says is a modular system that draws from the firm’s work for the Air Force’s Off-Board Sensing Station program. After the prototyping phase, whose first flight is expected next year, the Air Force could choose to carry one or both of the vendors into production. Officials have also floated the possibility of selecting a different vendor for production that did not win the prototyping contract. There will be other opportunities to join the CCA program ahead as well, as the service plans to launch a second tranche in fiscal year 2025. Service officials have stressed the CCA program will act as a pathfinder for a new way of doing acquisitions, and an Anduril executive noted that the design review process reflects that approach. The CCA program doesn't necessarily follow 'traditional' steps like standard acquisition milestones, the executive said, meaning that the successful design reviews announced today are more of a rough equivalent to a CDR. (A CDR essentially verifies the maturity of a system's design.) 'I wouldn't necessarily say CDR. I would say that we have matured design to a critical point where we feel confident that it's moving forward,' Diem Salmon, Anduril vice president for air dominance and strike, told reporters on the sidelines of the Mitchell event. 'Fabrication is moving very quickly, and it's getting to the path where we're going to be able to integrate and support first flight that is more or less around the corner,' Salmon added. C. Mark Brinkley, a spokesman for General Atomics, said in a statement to Breaking Defense that the company is 'pleased to be on this path and proud of our work. Completing this design review for our CCA is one more step toward a new future in global defense aerospace and reflects more than a decade of investment, ingenuity and innovation.' The company’s CCA design is still 'on-track' for first flight in 'mid-2025,' Brinkley added. Several different efforts are feeding into the CCA program, including an experimental operations unit (EOU) that is exploring how to employ the drones in combat. In a separate event in Washington today hosted by Defense One, Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter stated that the service now plans to buy more prototypes from Anduril and General Atomics to properly equip the EOU, but he declined to comment on the quantity.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/anduril-general-atomics-drone-wingmen-clear-critical-design-review-air-force-says/	2024-11-13T14:50:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/2024_Fury-Painting-scaled.jpg
From firing generals to limiting women in combat, Hegseth hints at possible Pentagon shakeup	Pete Hegseth hosts FOX News Channel's 'Fox &amp; Friends' All-American Summer Concert Series outside Fox News Channel Studios on May 31, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — 'Going sideways' is how Fox News host and National Guard veteran Pete Hegseth, announced last night as President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for Secretary of Defense, recently dubbed the state of the Pentagon. The pick of Hegseth, who lacks extensive experience in the defense or foreign policy sector, caught many off guard, prompting a slew of questions about how he might approach the job overseeing the military and its over $800 billion budget. While a host of questions remain, Hegseth recently filmed an episode of the Shawn Ryan Show that dropped just five days ago. There, while promoting his new book, 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,' he offered a peek at possible priorities in the Pentagon’s top civilian post. Here are five key takeaways, in the prospective Pentagon chief's own words. One of Hegseth’s chief bones of contention, spread throughout the interview and seemingly the focus of his book, revolves around military 'woke shit' like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. One solution? A firing spree that starts with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, who still has three years remaining in his term. 'First of all, you got to fire the chairman [of the] Joint Chiefs, and…obviously you’re going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense. But, any general that was involved – general, admiral, whatever –&#8230; in any of the DEI woke shit has got to go,' he said. 'Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it, that's the only litmus test we care about.' 'You gotta get rid of DEI and CRT [critical race theory] out of military academies,' Hegseth added. 'You're not training young officers to be baptized in this type of thinking.' Notably, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the Trump administration is considering creating a board that would fire a number of three- and four-star general officers viewed as too invested in DEI issues, while both Politico and the Washington Post have raised the possibility that Brown would be removed from his position as America's top uniformed officer. When asked if he liked women in combat, Hegseth quickly said 'No.' However, his position appeared to become more nuanced as the interview went on. Women pilots? They have his support. But women in more 'labor intensive' jobs, they do not. 'I love women service members who contribute amazingly,' Hegseth said. 'Because everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat means casualties are worse. 'SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets, you know, MARSOC [Marine Forces Special Operations], infantry battalions, armor, artillery &#8230; I'm talking about something [where] strength is a differentiator,' he later added. 'Pilots? Give me a female pilot all day long. I got no issues with that.' Women have only been allowed to serve in all military capacities since the start of 2016. However, they are required to pass the same physical requirement as their counterparts. More broadly, Hegseth hit at the idea that the military has moved too far away from its traditional recruitment base. 'There aren't enough lesbians in San Francisco to man the 82nd airborne,' he said. 'And in trying to cater to that, they lost the boys from Tennessee and Kentucky and Oklahoma, the traditional dudes who did it because they wanted, they loved their country, or they wanted the adventure, or they, you know, wanted to try tough things, or they need an up and out of their community, whatever it is they're like, if I want to do the woke crap, I could go to the local community college or local college.' In 2023, the Pentagon renamed nine bases that had been honoring Confederate generals. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to switch all the names back, and Hegseth is seemingly onboard with that plan, calling it a mistake of former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley. 'Suddenly, after George Floyd…after defund the police, it became faddish to insinuate that the military ranks are infected with racists, that it's all these white nationalists under the radar, the tattoos just waiting to pop up, and ultimately, on the recruiting side, what you've done is you Bud Lighted yourself.' Switching the names back may not be that easy, however, as Congress may weigh in. For the past six years, Hegseth said, he has been a 'recovering' neoconservative who now looks down on the 'foolishness' of US military interventions around the globe. In almost every case, he asserted, they have 'created something worse.' In retrospect, he added, that laundry list includes two spots he served in — Iraq and Afghanistan. And while Hegseth didn’t use the podcast to broadcast just how he would reshape military operations around the globe, it won’t be advising on counterinsurgency operations. 'The hubris of the Pentagon is that they want to now tell other countries how to do counterinsurgency based on what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan,' he said. 'Are you kidding me? So you really have learned nothing.' And any notion of sending US troops to Ukraine, would be a hard pass for him. 'The trust there that our political leaders or our generals would have our best interest of mind, is totally broken. Totally broken,' Hegseth said. 'I acknowledge that completely, and the last thing I want is my son deploying to the Donbas to defend eastern Ukraine.' When discussing the war in Ukraine — which Hegseth described as 'Putin's give me my shit back war' — he expressed skepticism about the idea that supporting Kyiv is needed to keep Russia from moving into NATO territory. 'I've friends who would probably agree with us on most things. They're like, well, if you don't stop them in Ukraine, then he's going to go all the way to Poland,' Hegseth said. 'I don't think he's — I mean, maybe in a perfect world where he had unlimited capabilities and he could crown himself King of Europe, he would [invade elsewhere.] I think he probably knows enough to know that is probably not going much further in Ukraine. And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell bent on bringing an Armageddon through nuclear warfare.' 'So if Ukraine could&#8230; defend themselves from that great but I don't want American intervention driving deep into Europe and making [Putin] feel like he's so much on his heels that then he does have to, because early on, he was talking about nukes.' However, his views on Ukraine may be more nuanced than the interview shows. According to the Kyiv Post, Hegseth in the past has criticized the Biden administration for being slow to arm Ukraine, and in 2022 described Putin as a 'war criminal.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/from-firing-generals-to-limiting-women-in-combat-hegseth-hints-at-possible-pentagon-shakeup/	2024-11-13T12:25:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/hegseth-scaled-e1731528223195.jpg
Satellite communications: A roadmap for securing tactical and strategic missions	The path to Nirvana has many stages in certain religions, not unlike some programs in the defense world such as satellite communications where construction of a resilient space architecture across orbits will require a staged expansion over many years. 'In addition to applying resiliency to existing waveforms or leveraging geosynchronous, MEO, or LEO orbits, what we are truly driving toward is that Nirvana state where we are able to provide any and all different communications means to the commanders so that they're able to fight the fight and build out their PACE plan or their primary alternate contingency and emergency communications,' said John Anglin, Chief, Technical Management Div., PM Tactical Network, Army PEO C3T, speaking during a recent Breaking Defense webinar. 'Through experimentation as well as the relationships that we formed with division commanders to understand [how] each unit in their theaters are fighting in different ways and have different needs. We need to build that network in a way that provides flexibility and is modular, scalable, secure, and definitely simple. The ability for soldiers to rapidly make changes to the network, to support and operate over any and all of those paths at the same time is truly what we're driving towards.' Anglin and other SATCOM experts discussed how to address those challenges, both tactical SATCOM and strategic SATCOM for the nuclear command-and-control mission, in the Breaking Defense webinar entitled: Cybersecurity Across Domains for Multi-Domain Operations. Besides Anglin, two other panelists participated in the one-hour webinar, which is now available on-demand. They were: Katherine Coens, Futures Branch Chief, Military Communications &amp; Positioning, Navigation, Timing PEO, Space Systems Command; and Bonnie Triezenberg, Senior Engineer, Rand. Amongst other topics, Coens discussed how Space Systems Command is viewing the challenge. 'In terms of the military SATCOM architecture, everything is very much in flux and on the table right now. There's a lot of different trades that we have to look at and make. One of the things that we're certainly looking at very closely is what industry is doing. The government is good at some things, but in terms of innovation, industry is second to none. 'The more diversity we have in terms of spectrum and in different company systems that we can use independently and in conjunction with each other, the more resilient we'll be. We have to find that balance point between a system that we can make work, but also give us the max resiliency.' For her part, Triezenberg examined some of the lesser known but vitally important SATCOM challenges. 'If you look at INDOPACOM and the Pacific region, you quickly realize there's a lot of ocean out there to be covered. You’ve got a lot of people cutting across wide oceans and they'd like to have communications. We really don't have a lot of SATCOM [and] we cannot cover the entire ocean with communications right now. Instead what you end up is sort of corridors of communications, and that's a limitation that an adversary could exploit.'

(Photo by Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Officials from the United States, Canada and Finland today signed a joint memorandum of understanding, the next step in the trilateral high-north focused ICE Pact initiative, one of the Biden administration's last, big foreign policy efforts. The resources in the Arctic are 'vital to the economic, national and homeland security of the United States and our allies,' Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said today at a ceremony held at DHS's headquarters. Mayorkas was flanked by Jean-Yves Duclos, Canada's minister of public services and procurement; Willie Rydman, Finland's minister of economic affairs; and Amos Hochstein, a special advisor to President Joe Biden. 'Ceding these reserves and the batteries, semiconductors, magnets and energy resources that are derived from them to our adversaries in Russia or to our rivals in the People's Republic of China, could soon lead to higher prices at our gas pumps and on our heating bills,' he continued. 'It could jeopardize the readiness of our armed forces. It could compromise the security of our computers, cars and cell phones, and in a crisis, it could subject us to Russian or Chinese largesse in order to access essential goods like food and medical supplies, among many other risks.' The new memorandum has four elements, according to a DHS statement, calling for enhanced information exchange between the three countries, workforce development collaboration, engagement with allies and partners, and research and development. 'Today, we're taking the next step under that agreement, the joint memorandum of understanding we're signing today will develop world-class Arctic and polar icebreakers through the exchange of knowledge and resources in each other countries, equally importantly, that will create more good paying jobs in the United States, in Finland and in Canada,' said Duclos. The new memorandum follows an announcement made by the three countries' leaders during the NATO summit earlier year where they announced the plan to work together to develop and build advanced Arctic icebreakers using the economic might of the American defense industrial base combined with the niche shipbuilding skill sets of the Canadian and Finnish workforces. RELATED: ICE Pact: Why The US Had To Recruit Help In Race With Russia, China For Arctic Icebreakers The need for such a collaboration is critical, as Breaking Defense previously reported, Russia is the world's leading producer of icebreakers, and Mayorkas cited comments from President Vladimir Putin made just last week when he welcomed one of his fleet's newest ships. 'President Putin told assembled shipbuilders that, quote, strengthening the nation's icebreaker fleet is crucial to our plans for Arctic development and boosting cargo traffic,' the secretary said. Finland's Rydman, whose country is credited as one of the most skilled builders of icebreaking ships in the world, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also shifted how Helsinki and other capitals must view the Arctic. 'Previously, the Arctic and its fragile environments offered untapped business potential to be realized in a sustainable way. But as said, now, our concerns are different,' he said. 'Current geopolitical situation means that we must be able to operate in the polar regions to maintain peace and stability, without which there is no or limited room for new, faster shipping lanes, nor the sustainable exploration of raw materials.' In practical terms, Finland's expertise in building icebreakers will potentially translate into significant cost savings for both the United States and Canada. Jason Moyer and Rickard Lindholm, associates at the Washington, DC-based think-tank the Wilson Center, recently wrote that building an icebreaker in Finland would be approximately 'a fifth of the price' compared to the United States and could be 'completed in about 24 months after a contract is signed.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-canada-finland-ink-joint-mou-latest-step-in-high-north-focused-ice-pact/	2024-11-13T09:57:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/icebreaker-healey-scaled-e1723496380361.jpg
Pentagon announces 4 drones, loitering munitions now under Replicator	US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks (Photo by Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images) This story was updated on 11/13/2024 at 1:10pm with additional comments from Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks's office. WASHINGTON — The Pentagon confirmed new details about its Replicator initiative today, including that two existing Army small drones have been picked for it, along with loitering munitions and an Air Force drone prototype already under development. Since Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks launched Replicator in August 2023, details about what’s included have been sparse, and many included systems will 'remain classified' like low-cost, long-range strike capabilities and maritime systems, the Pentagon announced today. However, it confirmed that four aerial weapons, either already bound for troops or in design, now fall under the initiative. For example, in September the Army selected two drones for its Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft System program — Ghost X from Anduril Industries and the C-100 from Performance Drone Works. Both are now under the Replicator-1, Tranche 2 umbrella. 'Ukraine has demonstrated the value of small, attritable drones on the battlefield,' Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said in today’s announcement. 'The delivery of commercially available Company-Level Small UAS with support from the Replicator initiative will allow American soldiers to rapidly experiment, learn and innovate with these systems.' The Marine Corps’s Organic Precision Fires program, which revolves around Anduril’s Altius-600, is also now being deemed as a Replicator initiative, as it 'complements' AeroVironment’s Switchblade-600 loitering munition already under the initial Replicator tranche. The Air Force’s Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV), a drone prototyping competition, is also joining the Replicator pack. In June, the Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit selected four companies to compete for a program that aims to field a drone prototype capable of being produced cheaply and at scale that can also serve as a test bed for new subsystems and materials. 'The ETV's modular design and open system architecture make it an ideal platform for program offices to test out new capabilities at the sub-system level, reducing risk, and demonstrating various options for weapon employment,' said Vice Chief of Staff of the US Air Force Gen. Jim Slife. 'We are excited to be a part of Replicator 1.2 and to increase the speed of the ETV effort.' Hick’s team has been on the hunt for existing service programs that can be rapidly scaled, looked at more than 500 commercial firms’ hardware and software solutions, and awarded more than 30 deals. And now that those four new initiatives are under Replicator, Pentagon spokesperson Eric Pahon explained that the department will be using additional funds to accelerate their production and speed up deliveries. 'The key here is applying high-level, enterprise-wide attention, to eliminate bureaucratic barriers and use our funding and authorities to put these systems into the hands of our warfighters at greater scale and speed,' Pahon wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. Observations out of the war inside Ukraine, in part, provided the Pentagon with a blueprint for how cheap, commercially-made drones may be used to overwhelm an adversary. Then in August 2023, Hicks launched Replicator with the first initiative resulting in two tranches of small aerial and maritime drones. By September 2024, plans for a second Replicator initiative were announced, this time focusing on finding systems to counter small drones at US military installations across the globe. 'I am confident the Replicator initiative will complement and advance the significant C-sUAS [counter small unmanned aerial systems] work already underway in the DoD,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated in the memo. 'The expectation is that Replicator 2 will assist with overcoming challenges we face in the areas of production capacity, technology innovation, authorities, policies, open system architecture and system integration, and force structure.' Austin charged Hicks with seeking new project funding in the upcoming fiscal 2026 budget request and fielding 'meaningfully improved' counter-drone capabilities within 24 months of receiving money from Congress. However, with a new Trump administration coming into power in January, it is unclear whether Replicator will remain a priority.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-announces-4-drones-loitering-munitions-now-under-replicator/	2024-11-13T08:48:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/GettyImages-2160730520-scaled-e1723040734514.jpg
Australia narrows $10B AUD frigate competition to German, Japanese firms: Reports	HMAS Parramatta arrives at Henderson Shipyard in Western Australia to begin her Anzac Midlife Capability Assurance Program (AMCAP) upgrades. (RAN) SYDNEY — As it scrambles to double the size of its surface fleet, the Labor government here reportedly has made its first major decision in the $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) competition to build 11 frigates, picking a German and a Japanese company in the downselect process. Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Germany's ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) are through the first gate, leaving South Korea's Hanwha Ocean and Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) and Spain's Navantia in the cold, according to news reports here. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Defence declined to comment on the reported downselect, but told Breaking Defense the department 'continues to enhance the size and lethality of Navy’s surface combatant fleet, as directed by Government in February 2024, and is progressing the acquisition of Australia’s general purpose frigate by engaging with exemplar platform nations and tenderer.' The narrowing of the competition was first reported by the Australian Financial Review last week. The government has directed the companies not to discuss the program with the press. The General Purpose Frigate program (Sea3000) was created as a result of recommendations in the Defense Strategic Review. To some Australian observers, the German offering is the most favored because the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is familiar with German shipbuilders and its MEKO A-200 ships have a modular design, allowing integration of Australia's CEA radars and SAAB's 9LV combat management system, which is used on many Australian naval platforms including the ANZAC and Canberra classes. The existing ANZAC class fleet of nine is comprised of older MEKO designs. Meanwhile, the Mitsubishi Mogami 30FFM has an excellent reputation in many quarters, but Japan has never exported a major combat system of this complexity. In a rare disclosure relating to Sea3000, RAN chief Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said in August that 'base crews of 90 to 100' are set to staff the future ships, or 120 personnel when helicopters are deployed. However, at least one defense analyst is skeptical the new frigate fleet plan is the best choice for Australia, because of the limited number of Vertical Launching Systems (VLS). 'In my opinion, we need to maximize bang for buck. So maximum firepower combined with advanced sensors and combat systems really matters,' said Malcolm Davis of the independent Australian Strategic Policy Institute. 'Both the Hunter-class future frigates (which have now become larger in displacement than some cruisers) and these GP Frigates contenders have limited VLS cells, with these vessels only having 16 cells.' In other Australian defense news, Boeing Defense Australia was granted the authority Tuesday to produce the first locally manufactured parts for Australian F/A-18F Super Hornets. The Military Production Organization Approval (MPOA) authority makes Boeing the fourth company to receive such approval. It can now produce avionics, electrical and mechanical appliances, electrical, wiring and structural harness parts, as well as military display equipment, communication systems and components for the E-7A Wedgetails, P-8A Poseidons, C-17As, F/A-18F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, Chinooks, EC135-T2+ helicopters and the AH-64E Apache. Davis said this appears to be a parallel to the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise, designed to boost Australia's domestic capacity to build and matin long range precision strike weapons and the fuels that power them, he said. 'It contributes to Australia having the means to sustain and support the F/A-18Fs locally, and perhaps support US F/A-18Fs operating out of Australia,' he said. 'It would make sense to establish new servicing and support infrastructure along similar lines with GWEO.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/australia-narrows-10b-aud-frigate-competition-to-german-japanese-firms-reports/	2024-11-13T07:04:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/230816_aussie_anzac_RAN-e1692193702615.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: How the Pentagon (quietly) spent $1 billion of inflation relief money	A view of the Pentagon with financial charts in the background. (Graphic Breaking Defense, original images via Getty) WASHINGTON — When inflation soared in the wake of the pandemic, the defense industry emphatically warned the Pentagon of a problem: Climbing prices had begun pushing key projects across the military well past their planned budgets, raising the risk of those programs coming up short. So industry turned to Congress for a bailout, and lawmakers obliged. As part of the fiscal 2023 spending deal, Capitol Hill earmarked approximately $1.05 billion to offer relief to a range of projects across the Pentagon for 'revised economic assumptions.' And then, for much of the public, the money dropped off the radar, as selected projects were bundled in a trove of reprogramming documents [PDF] submitted to lawmakers with largely no explanations given for why, or how, those programs were selected. But a previously unreported document sent to Congress and obtained by Breaking Defense, along with new interviews with Pentagon officials, analysts and industry figures, reveals how the Defense Department determined which high-priority programs were worthy of the taxpayer aid — and what would happen if they didn’t get it. 'At the end of the day, we had a good bit more than a billion dollars’ [worth] of people who had their hand up,' DoD Comptroller Mike McCord told Breaking Defense in an interview at the Pentagon. 'So we had the Army, Navy [and] Air Force, who have most of the contracts, also identify priorities from their perspective of what they thought the worst problems were, which was helpful for us.' Of the 68 total projects selected for relief, 13 received over $10 million, 35 received between $1 million and $10 million, and the remaining projects were awarded less than $1 million. The top five programs by dollar amounts pulled in three quarters of the $1 billion pot, infusing cash into large-scale purchases of platforms like ships, fighter jets and helicopters. The leading recipient of relief was the Navy’s Constellation-class frigates, built by Fincantieri Marinette Marine, at a combined $310 million. That included two different pools of money: $222.8 million to cover expenses for ships FFG 62, 63 and 64, as well as a second $86.8 million payment for FFG 65. Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that one reason shipbuilding topped the list was likely because of the peculiarities of naval procurement. 'You can’t buy half a ship,' Harrison said. 'Once the cost goes up, if you don't have the full amount, you can't order it.' In second place was the Air Force’s new F-15EX built by Boeing, which received $154.4 million to help procure the fourth production lot of the fighter jet. In third was the Navy’s Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) program, whose prime contractor is General Dynamics NASSCO, which was allocated $107.4 million to finance shortfalls in ESB 7 and ESB 8. NASSCO’s John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler nabbed the fourth-place spot, garnering $102.4 million to spread across T-AO 206, T-AO 207, T-AO 208, T-AO 209, T-AO 210, T-AO 211 and T-AO 212. And rounding out the top five recipients was the Army’s AH-64E Apache attack helicopter, also made by Boeing, which received roughly $93.9 million to help purchase five additional aircraft. An analysis of program justifications shows the Pentagon viewed different forms of rising prices in the chaotic post-COVID environment as qualified examples of inflation, from the cost of materials to labor market competition driving wages up. 'This isn't just about value, it's about national security,' Harrison said regarding the inflation relief. 'Congress appropriated money to buy these weapons systems in these quantities for a reason, and we want to make sure that the quantities are actually bought that were deemed appropriate by Congress.' How the Pentagon spent more than $1 billion in inflation relief funding, by program, according to a 2023 DoD Comptroller report. (Graphic by Breaking Defense) Congress set aside the $1 billion-plus in inflation relief in Section 8121 of the fiscal 2023 defense appropriations bill, but not without some consequential caveats. The money had to be disbursed that fiscal year, for instance, a challenge since a continuing resolution had pushed the start of the spending period back three months. Also, the funds could only be spent on procurement and research initiatives. 'I would have loved to have been able to do it a little differently, maybe, but with the time constraints and the criteria, the people who showed up' — and met the Pentagon’s requirements — 'got a little more than other people did,' McCord said. According to an Air Force spokesperson, McCord’s office reached out and asked each of the military services to provide candidates for relief, with the understanding that funds had to be used by the end of FY23. McCord’s office then 'determined the final allocation between Services,' the spokesperson said, who in turn provided the relief funds to their specific programs. (Representatives for the departments of the Army and Navy did not respond to questions from Breaking Defense by press time.) One critical factor in the process was whether contracts were previously negotiated with provisions to raise prices in the case of inflation, according to McCord. Many programs in the Pentagon’s inflation report, as well as examples in reprogramming documents, cite increases under economic price adjustment (EPA) clauses — contractual arrangements that enable industry to raise prices when costs increase. EPA clauses also empower the government to negotiate lower prices in the event costs fall. 'The contract needed to be structured in a way that an inflation adjustment was payable,' McCord said of programs eligible for relief. 'They had a contract that had contemplated a problem like this.' With inflation mostly staying low since the 2008 recession, McCord posited that many defense companies had not sought out contracts with clauses that would protect against a sharp upswing in costs prior to the pandemic. Such clauses, like EPA provisions, are regularly written into shipbuilding contracts due to the oscillating price of raw materials like steel that can greatly affect the cost of the ship — a key reason why several of those programs carried the day in terms of raw dollars. '[T]heir contracts were written in a way that was very amenable to identifying price escalation,' McCord explained. 'And some contracts just are not written that way.' However, the EPA issue wasn’t a dead end: A provision in the FY23 defense policy bill enabled the Pentagon to simply modify existing contracts to provide them more money, even if they didn’t have clauses like EPAs, according to the Air Force spokesperson. That is how the B-21, Northrop Grumman’s new stealth bomber, was able to take advantage of $60 million in relief funds previously disclosed by the company, though it’s not clear what other programs may have benefited from the same process. Northrop referred questions to the Air Force. The change in the FY23 NDAA further directed that primes could apply for relief themselves or seek it on behalf of their subcontractors; subcontractors could apply directly too. But how much money filtered down to subs from the primes is difficult to identify. Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller Mike McCord speaks during a press conference presenting the 2021 Department of Defense's audit results, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Nov. 15, 2021. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Brittany A. Chase) The Pentagon’s inflation report identifies specific programs that received money, though it rarely tracked exactly how inflation relief was spent on the program, where it ended up in the supply chain and who, ultimately, benefitted the most — largely because the Pentagon doesn’t necessarily know, according to McCord. 'We don't have the visibility to say, if I gave Lockheed or Boeing $10 million, how much of that flowed to a small business,' he said. 'I would have liked to have had perfect information to know how much of this billion dollars went to small businesses. But in terms of straight from us to a small business, it wasn't a large amount, unfortunately, [or] as much as we would have liked.' (Boeing declined to provide a comment for this story.) Breaking Defense reached out to the prime contractors whose programs received a total of $10 million or more in inflation relief, as well as all companies otherwise mentioned in this story. By and large, those companies declined to provide specific data on how much relief funding was accepted by the contractor and how much filtered through the supply chain. In some cases, like a $9.4 million award for Freedom and Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), payments appeared to be straightforward EPAs to prime contractors to account for rising costs of factors like labor and materials. In such examples, the relief likely moved through a tangled web of primes and their suppliers that can include other major businesses as well as small mom-and-pop shops. In other cases, prime contractors may not have even played as prominent a role in the inflation relief process. For example, the Pentagon’s report cites soaring costs of government furnished equipment (GFE) for the Constellation-class frigates — something prime contractor Fincantieri has little, if any, control over. The document specifically calls out GFE like the Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin, suggesting that much of the spending for the Constellation program ultimately went to Lockheed, not Fincantieri. And like in the LCS example, it’s not clear how much of that money may have gone to Lockheed’s major partners and subcontractors on Aegis. Fincantieri spokesperson Eric Dent confirmed the company did not receive inflation relief for the GFE on the Constellation-class, though he referred further comment to the Navy. On the Freedom-class LCS, which Fincantieri builds, Dent referred questions to Lockheed, which is the prime contractor. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said that the company is 'regularly monitoring inflationary risks in active and future contracts so we can continue affordably delivering for our customers,' but referred specific questions to the Defense Department. Austal, which builds the Independence-class, did not respond to a request to comment. Only a tiny fraction of the total relief — $9 million — was awarded directly to small businesses, according to the Pentagon’s report. How the Pentagon spent more than $1 billion in inflation relief funding, by service, according to a 2023 DoD Comptroller report. (Graphic by Breaking Defense) In many cases, documents say the money functioned as a way to restore DoD’s buying power back to expected levels. For example, rising prices for RTX’s Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) meant that the Air Force needed an additional $13.6 million or would otherwise be forced to buy 14 fewer copies of the high-demand weapon, according to the Pentagon’s report. (The contract mechanism used to seek the relief isn’t clear, and RTX declined to comment.) Documents suggest ongoing contract negotiations got a boost from the inflation relief pot as well. In the case of the Apache, the Pentagon’s report cites the 'timing of negotiations' with Boeing for the attack helicopter’s multi-year contract. Boeing’s contract negotiations with the Pentagon for the F-15EX also benefited from the relief: Based on prior cost growth in the program, the Air Force anticipated Boeing’s forthcoming proposal for the fighter jet’s fourth production lot would result in the service only being able to afford 21 of 24 expected jets. For a few projects, the relief funding helped protect nascent research and development efforts, such as a $5.6 million award for the Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone for the Air Force. In justification documents, the Pentagon said officials would not be able to complete flight demonstration of the platform without more funding due to higher labor and material costs eating away margin on the program — explicitly listing several subcontractors who would be provided relief in the process — which is viewed as a key effort that will feed into the service’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft endeavor to build drone wingmen. OBSS prime contractor General Atomics declined to comment directly on the inflation relief and referred questions to the Pentagon. The levels of inflationary impact varied based on the root cause of the cost increases, with some programs stating that certain costs had ballooned by more than half. The Pentagon’s report cites a 49 percent increase in container costs for 155mm munitions, which ultimately spurred a $300,000 award. (155s are made by multiple contractors, and it’s not clear who the prime may have been in this case.) A total of $62.4 million was provided for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program, led by prime contractor BAE, due to a projected 50 percent increase in material costs, the report says. And justification documentation for the ESB, where General Dynamics NASSCO is the prime contractor, cites a 134 percent growth in the price of steel, 54 percent growth in long distance trucking and 47 perfect growth in copper. General Dynamics referred questions to the Navy. BAE Systems referred questions to the Army. In order to vet industry’s claims of rising prices, contracting officers would evaluate revised pricing proposals 'under standard cost and pricing procedures to ensure the cost was fair and reasonable,' the Air Force spokesperson said. One of BAE's two AMPV varients on the show floor at AUSA 2024, this one sports the company's Modular Turreted Mortar System. (Brendon Smith / Breaking Defense) Industry ultimately viewed the $1 billion relief fund as a critical damage reduction measure, but one that couldn’t completely mitigate the $110 billion loss in buying power caused by inflation from FY21 to FY23, said David Norquist, a former deputy defense secretary and comptroller who currently is president of the National Defense Industrial Association. (NDIA was one of the organizations that advocated for inflation relief to be injected into the FY23 budget.) 'From the point of view of industry, you didn't solve the problem, but it certainly helped key programs and particularly their supply chain,' Norquist said. 'It was a step in the right direction. And when you're dealing with Congress, you always appreciate when they take the step in the right direction,' he said. 'There's never enough time or money to solve everything. And the answer is, that's okay, we do what we can.' RELATED: Tired of being ‘shock absorber’ on inflation, defense industry wants new protections: AIA chief Richard Loeb, an adjunct professor of government contract law at the University of Baltimore School of Law and former official at the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, said that while much of the relief process reflected standard business practices, taxpayers should be vigilant about whether dollars were handed out carefully and with good judgment in cases where programs may have gotten inflation relief due to the special congressional carveout. 'I think that there's a heightened concern that we don't just turn fixed-price contracts into cost-type contracts,' he said. 'The parties chose a fixed-price contract, and now basically they're saying, because they're losing money, they want it to be cost-type,' he said. 'The big issue, I would say, is we're engaging in risk-shifting' in cases where the carveout could be applied. Harrison argued that the inflation relief did not adequately cover all Pentagon programs and that the fiscal environment forced some efforts to cover rising costs 'out of hide,' which in turn would require another round of targeted inflation relief issued in the form of a supplemental spending package. Still, he didn’t view such a package as likely to succeed. 'The appetite for trying to help the defense industrial base catch up from inflation, I think that may have passed,' he said. Loeb, Harrison and Norquist also agreed that the experience would likely shape contracting practices going forward. 'I definitely see [contracts] using more EPA clauses,' Loeb said. That trend, he added, should cause the Pentagon to scrutinize whether it would be more appropriate to use cost reimbursement-type contracts instead of fixed-price contracts in certain instances. The high inflation of the last few years, and industry’s attempts to ameliorate the issue, 'adds another variable to all of these contract negotiations, where the companies either have to seek this kind of a clause added to their fixed-price contracts or companies simply have to factor in the risk on their own,' Harrison said. 'So I think that's going to be at the forefront of people's minds now when they're negotiating contracts.' Norquist added that while top Pentagon acquisition officials such as Bill LaPlante, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, understand the pressures that industry is under, contracting officers sometimes simply do not have the budget to build in inflation protection clauses that reflect the risks that defense contractors are facing. McCord acknowledged the relief funding wasn’t a panacea for industry, but stressed that much of the defense budget — from the topline established by the White House to the final appropriations approved by Congress — remains out of the Pentagon’s direct control. 'As we work through the budget, we work internally to fix problems where we can move money around. And then, when the [congressional] committees give us an opportunity, we go to them with some problems,' McCord said. 'But the more well-defined our problems are, and the more scope, the better we do.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/exclusive-how-the-pentagon-quietly-spent-1-billion-of-inflation-relief-money/	2024-11-13T05:15:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241111_inflation_main_img_FINAL.png
Tiltrotors will change CONOPS for Army aviation, bring 'step-change' to industry	Bell's FLRAA provides the Army with expanded options for maneuver, including significantly increased mission efficiency and a reduced number of flight hours to accomplish missions. (Bell photo). The significance of introducing the tiltrotor – a brand-new aircraft type for the Army fleet, in this case the Bell V-280 Future Long Range Assault Aircraft – from the point of operations, support, and training, will be a true step-change for both the service and the industrial base. Breaking Defense discussed FLRAA status, how the industrial base is stepping up, and new strategies around MOSA, intellectual property and data rights for FLRAA’s long-term weapon system sustainment with Ryan Ehinger, senior vice president and program director, FLRAA Future Long Range Assault Aircraft/V-280 Valor at Bell. Breaking Defense: The Army recently announced that FLRAA achieved Milestone B and has entered into the next phase of development. What work is being done during this phase? What does the Army require in order to continue advancing the program? Ryan Ehinger: Milestone B is a major step in the acquisition process and is a precursor to engineering and manufacturing development (EMD). The government and industry collectively have done a tremendous amount of work over the last decade to reduce risk and inform the requirements, and the current EMD phase is all about further maturation of the digital models, finalizing engineering hardware and software designs, maturing the sustainment artifacts, and driving toward a successful weapon system critical design review as the next major program milestone. It is during this phase that we ensure across-the-board alignment and finalization of the design as we transition into manufacturing and test of the FLRAA prototypes. The FLRAA program was identified as a pathfinder program in terms of how we leverage and expand the application of the digital environment and digital engineering. This has provided new opportunities for collaboration and insight for the government as the design matures and helps ensure that industry gets the necessary feedback early in the design phase to yield good long-term outcomes for the weapon system. We have seen that Bell has selected several companies across the defense industry to support FLRAA development. How will Bell leverage its industrial partners as it enters the EMD phase and starts to work on program deliverables? We have and there are more selections in process. We look at it as a partnership with like-minded industry teammates committed to the Army acquisition and sustainment goals. Bell takes a lot of pride in the internal vertical integration of many key components and final assembly, but it is a team of industry leaders spanning many layers of the supply chain that complete the weapon system. All parts are important, and each supplier should feel the weight of program success on their shoulders and an accountability to the warfighters who need this affordable and sustainable capability. We are all working together in EMD, developing myriad systems and components in parallel for integration into our models and assembly and test against the requirements set. With Bell's FLRAA, industry is at a unique time where a truly new weapon system is being created that leverages the latest in manufacturing technology to yield improvements in affordability and quality. (Bell photo). What is the significance of introducing the tiltrotor – a brand-new aircraft type for the Army fleet – from the point of operations, support, and training? From an operations standpoint, the tiltrotor provides unsurpassed speed and range relative to the enduring fleet. This provides the Army with expanded options for maneuver, including significantly increased mission efficiency and a reduced number of flight hours to accomplish missions. The benefit of the tiltrotor’s unique combination of vertical lift, speed, and range has been a differentiator in both combat and humanitarian operations. From a support and training standpoint, the tiltrotor systems – drive systems, rotors, airframe structure, and hydraulic, for example – should be familiar to existing rotorcraft maintainers. They are integrated in a different way than traditional rotorcraft with significant on-board health monitoring to optimize maintenance action. Digital engineering has allowed us to drastically improve the link between the original engineering source of truth and the maintenance data. These new digital tools further improve system-specific training, maintenance, and record keeping. What does tiltrotor production at FLRAA scale mean to the U.S. industrial base, not just Bell’s supply chain but the broader, global base? New start aviation programs occur infrequently and the barriers to entry to incorporate new manufacturing technologies on existing platforms can be high. The ability to provide the upfront non-recurring effort to produce a clean-sheet tiltrotor at large scale using the latest in digital engineering, manufacturing, and scaled automation advances the U.S. industrial base. This advancement incorporates new and more efficient methods of engineering, manufacturing, and inspection that weren’t available almost fifty years ago when the enduring fleets started their production. This step-change in capability provides the global supply base with the opportunity to realize affordability, lead time, and quality improvements while establishing a new manufacturing foundation which the program can build upon during its production life-cycle. Our industrial base, when looking through the multiple tiers, extends from small businesses to large businesses and across many states in the U.S. as well as partner nations. This distribution reduces overall program supply chain risk, allows for healthy competition, and oftentimes dual-sourcing strategies. FLRAA is a clean sheet design, leveraging new manufacturing technology and digital engineering. Do you see this impacting the industrial base and supply chain? How? Absolutely. As an industry we are at a unique time where we can create a truly new weapon system leveraging the latest in manufacturing technology to yield improvements in affordability and quality. Part of this is due to the advancement in machinery, as well as how the digital thread and software has matured to allow fewer steps in the transition from engineering to manufacturing to assembly and inspection, all leveraging the same source data and reducing the opportunity for defective data. The industrial base is advancing to embrace this and, from a supply chain perspective, those that are able to thrive in this environment of model-based definition and maintain the integrity of the digital thread are at a clear advantage. How does the Army view manufacturing quality within the supply chain for FLRAA? Is it different from enduring platforms? From an industry perspective, I think there is an entirely rational expectation that we have learned from decades of past production on previous platforms and have adapted both designs and processes for improved quality. We have to capture the lessons from the past, learn from them, and address them. The clean sheet design and modern manufacturing allows us to incorporate these changes from day one through design using efficient manufacturing processes, more automation, and more repeatable processes. We validated a lot of this on our V-280 Valor technology demonstrator and continue to do so in our Fort Worth, TX, Manufacturing Technology Center ahead of FLRAA production. The Army has developed some new strategies around MOSA, intellectual property and data rights for FLRAA’s long-term weapon system sustainment. How do you see this impacting the industrial base? I think some see it as a significant shift and are working through how that may affect previous business models. It’s important to remember, though, that maximizing the operational availability of our weapon systems and ensuring they are affordable to procure and sustain is critical to national security. We can optimize to both support the warfighter and have a healthy industrial base. With some of these new initiatives, suppliers that are able to provide the best value in a competitive environment will do well and suppliers that fail to adapt will see fewer opportunities. A key element of this requires collaboration between industry and government to really understand associated intellectual property and data rights, what is needed for long-term organic sustainment, and how industry can help facilitate that. Customers are rightfully passionate about their ability to sustain their platforms over the long term. MOSA is going to be a big game changer in terms of enabling affordable upgrades to mission systems and I am pretty excited for FLRAA to be a leader in the adoption of those principles for both hardware and software. How involved is the Army with the sub-tier supply chain and industrial base? The depth of the industrial base to support aviation platforms is remarkable. At the same time, every tier provides critical contributions to both the quality of the final product as well as the security of data used in getting to that final product. Customer interest in the supply chain at all tiers is high, as the impact of all tiers on their weapon system can be high. What are your thoughts on supply chain risk management and what are you focused on in terms of top risks? Supply chain risk management is key to a healthy production line. Aviation component lead times are long and requalification/switching costs for making changes mid-production are high. If a supplier has a track record of poor quality, poor schedule performance, financial instability, lack of resilience when faced with a dynamic world environment, or lack of accountability, what should be expected going forward? We have had good success with teammates and suppliers on our program that understand we all contribute to long-term program success and collaborate and communicate early and often to ensure that we meet commitments.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/tiltrotors-will-change-conops-for-army-aviation-bring-step-change-to-industry/	2024-11-13T05:13:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/lead-scaled.jpg
Trump to nominate Pete Hegseth, Fox News host and Army Guard vet, for defense secretary	Hosts Katie Pavlich and Pete Hegseth on 'FOX &amp; Friends' at Fox News Channel Studios on May 27, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said today he intends to nominate Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his secretary of defense, one of the most powerful positions in the incoming administration. 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. Hegseth, currently a co-host of Fox News's 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend', was an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and served in Afghanistan, Iraq and at the US outpost in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according his Fox News biography. During his service he was awarded two Bronze Stars and a Combat Infantry Badge, the bio says. Hegseth is the author of several books, the most recent of which, 'The War on Warriors', extolled the 'kind of men prepared to face the dangers that the Left pretends don't exist,' according to a Fox News summary. In his statement, Trump said the Princeton graduate 'will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our &#8216;Peace through Strength' policy.' The Hegseth announcement is the latest in a string of Trump proclamations and news reports concerning senior officials he plans to bring into his administration. Earlier today Trump said he wanted John Ratcliffe, who served during Trump's first term as the Director of National Intelligence, to lead the CIA and Rep. Tim Waltz, a Republican from Florida, was tapped to be White House national security advisor.

Pentagon invests another $160 million from CHIPS Act to boost semiconductor manufacturing	A microchip developed jointly by the Air Force Research Laboratory and American Semiconductor. 'America's military systems are the most capable in the world, and that would not be possible without advanced semiconductor technology,' Arati Prabhakar, assistant to the President for Science and Technology and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a Nov. 8 Pentagon press release. The Microelectronic Commons is a network of technology hubs that has since grown to about 1,200 universities, private companies and other organizations from 35 different states, plus Washington, DC. It’s designed to spur the development of a domestic microelectronics manufacturing industry. Most of the new funding, $148 million, will go directly to the eight hubs spread across the country, which include: The $148 million will go toward 'building infrastructure, supporting operations, and accelerating workforce development across the eight established hubs,' the release read. Another $10 million will back a 'Cross-Hub Enablement Solution' that will enable the hubs to share access to critical Electronic Design Automation, software and hardware services that help develop electronic systems, and cloud computing tools, per the release. Another $2 million will go toward a prototype project list for the Silicon Crossroads Microelectronics Commons Hub. 'The Microelectronics Commons aims to enable lab-to-fab prototyping, evolving microelectronics laboratory prototyping to fabrication prototyping in domestic facilities,' Dev Shenoy, principal director of microelectronics for the Pentagon said in the release. 'More specifically, the goal is a national network of regional innovation hubs distributed across the U.S. that will foster a pipeline of domestic talent and innovative ideas, reduce barriers to innovation, and mature emerging microelectronics technologies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-invests-another-160-million-from-chips-act-to-boost-semiconductor-manufacturing/	2024-11-12T12:27:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/4046791-scaled.jpg
UK ‘needs’ GCAP future fighter to counter growth of Russian and Chinese stealth jets: Air Chief	The new GCAP next generation fighter concept is based on a delta wing design and increased wingspan for improved aerodynamics (BAE Systems) BELFAST — The UK Royal Air Force (RAF) must press forward with the multinational Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) to deliver a next generation fighter jet if it wants to take a stand against the 'proliferation' of Russian and Chinese stealth aircraft, according to the head of the service. The joint British, Italian and Japanese effort has been the subject of uncertainty in recent months after UK Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard refused to make a long term commitment to it on grounds that doing so could 'prejudge' the outcome of a new strategic defense review, set to report in mid-2025. Since Pollard's comments, the Financial Times reported that over the 'coming weeks' the Labour government will formally green light the multibillion-pound project. Government ministers have already agreed to such a decision, the publication said last week. In another boost for the project, Italy's parliament approved the country's continued participation today. 'The proliferation of stealth capability through the likes of the Chinese J-20 or the Russian Su-57 as well as increasingly long range air-to-air weapons like the PL-15 Thunderbolt, mean that we also need to be planning for the next generation capabilities now; that is why we need GCAP,' Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, RAF Chief of the Air Staff, said during a speech on Monday held by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) — a UK defense think tank. 'GCAP is very deliberately being designed to complement and enhance the capabilities of F-35, not replace it, but we also know that even a force of F-35 and GCAP will need to be augmented by what we call Autonomous Collaborative Platforms [ACPs] to defeat the threats that we see emerging.' The GCAP fighter jet is planned to replace British and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons as well as Japanese F-2s, with a service entry date of 2035. It is also expected to operate alongside ACPs or adjunct aircraft, similar to US Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). Additionally, GCAP industry partners are committed to flying a crewed, supersonic and low observable aircraft demonstrator within four years. Under the previous Conservative administration, London committed £2 billion ($2.55 billion) to GCAP out to May 2025. Knighton's support for GCAP comes on the heels of BAE Systems unveiling a new concept of the future crewed fighter jet, based around a conventional delta wing design and distinguished by an increased wingspan compared to previous iterations. &quot;Satisfaction with today&#39;s parliamentary approval of Italy&#39;s participation in the Global Combat Air Programme. The #GCAP is an ambitious project for the development of the 6th generation fighter aircraft in cooperation with the #UK and #Japan. It will be fundamental in ensuring… &mdash; Ministero Difesa (@MinisteroDifesa) November 12, 2024 All industry partners are 'steaming ahead' with design activities of the next generation fighter, Herman Claesen, managing director of Future Combat Air Systems at BAE Systems told reporters at the Farnborough Air Show in July. He added that the next engineering milestone for GCAP is a systems requirements review, directly supporting planning for launch of a development phase next year. Knighton did not share any comments relating to industry progress, other than to reconfirm that the RAF is on course to receive a first 'operationally useful' ACP 'before the end of the financial year.' The UK has not said which ACP it has selected specifically, but it will be a Tier 1 or disposable type, in line with comments made by Knighton to the Defence Committee [PDF] in February. At that time, he said that a focus on Tier 1 was based on assessment of costs against operational benefits. London also expects to operate a 'suite' of ACPs by 2030, according to its ACP strategy [PDF]. The RAF is targeting acquisition of ACPs to sit alongside GCAP and F-35 jets as a way of increasing combat mass and allow crewed platforms to be less vulnerable to attack. Such is the focus on the effort that London wants to see the air vehicles flying regularly alongside crewed fighters 'as part of a national or coalition force' by the end of the decade. 'This high-low mix of platforms will provide the cost effective way of delivering the combat mass we still need to win against the ever improving enemy,' said Knighton. 'With multiple nations such as the US, Australia, Japan, France, Germany, actively investing in their own versions of ACPs, now is the last safe moment to commit to an ACP if we're to retain a lead and seize the initiative as well as the market.' The UK has still to settle on an ACP budget. 'The exact level of resource to be allocated is yet to be defined,' states the strategy document, while the RAF's ability to 'rapidly' bring new drones into service took a knock when a lawmaker revealed in March that 216 Squadron, stood up in 2020 to specifically test and experiment with uncrewed aircraft, had yet to carry out a single drone test.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/uk-needs-gcap-future-fighter-to-counter-growth-of-russian-and-chinese-stealth-jets-air-chief/	2024-11-12T11:21:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/1721595970093-e1721613189775.jpg
Waltz reportedly in as Trump’s national security advisor, SecDef position remains a question mark	U.S. House of Representatives, The Hon. Mike Waltz attends the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit at Sheraton New York Times Square on September 23, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Riccardo Savi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit) WASHINGTON — In the week since the US presidential election, a second Trump administration appears to be taking shape — with one key national security slot seemingly wide open. Over the last couple days reports emerged that President-elect Donald Trump is eyeing Rep. Mike Waltz, a Florida Congressman, as his White House national security advisor. Trump also reportedly plans to nominate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his Secretary of State and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as Homeland Security secretary. Waltz served in the Army as a Green Beret and, according to his bio, saw tours in Afghanistan and elsewhere. He also worked in the Pentagon during the Bush administration, before founding a defense services firm called Metris Solutions, which won some contracts for training Afghan special forces. Metris was acquired by PAE in 2020. Waltz won his current seat in the House in 2018, and has held positions on the House Armed Services Committee, as well as the foreign affairs and intel committees. In public statements, he has styled himself China hawk, a trait he shares with Rubio — a sign that under a Trump administration, there will likely be no backing off of the idea that China is the 'pacing threat' for the US military. During a September event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Waltz issued support for the creation of a maritime czar — a single individual inside the executive branch whose authorities span across maritime issues related to both the Defense and Transportation Departments. As national security advisor, that idea may come to fruition. Additionally, Waltz was one of two cosponsors of a 2023 effort to authorize the use of military force against Mexican drug cartels. In a campaign policy platform, Trump pledged to 'use all resources needed to stop the Invasion — including moving thousands of Troops currently stationed overseas to our own Southern Border.' Trump also reportedly had discussed sending special forces operators into Mexico to target cartel leaders. In a note to investors, analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners said Waltz’s appointment may have 'mixed implications' for defense spending. 'His views on China could be positive, but those on cartels, Ukraine aid, and DoD ‘waste’ may entail nuances for defense contractors to wade through in 2025 and beyond,' Callan wrote, noting an April HASC hearing where Waltz pushed on waste, fraud and abuse issues. Meanwhile, the race for secretary of defense appears wide open. Three leading names in defense circles have all been struck from the list: Waltz, taking the NSC job; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was ruled out by Trump; and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who took himself out of the running and is now expected to be named chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. On the Senate side, it is expected that Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., will take over the Senate Armed Services Committee chair. Wicker is the architect of a plan to dramatically increase the defense budget to five percent GDP, with a $55 billion increase in FY25 alone. While that plan appeared dead on arrival under a Democratic administration, it may receive more support from a Trump White House. Wicker’s plan would raise all munitions production to maximum rates unless stocks are already above the required level, and call for the creation of alternate production lines to surge short-term capacity. It would also reform the Defense Production Act with updated authorities — which are not specified — and execute a $5.2 billion backlog of DPA projects on microelectronics, castings and forgings, and biomanufacturing. In the area of missile defense, the Defense Department should field the Guam defense system as soon as possible, reverse its decision to cancel the SM-3 Block 1B interceptor, and surge existing production lines for interceptors 'while exploring optionality in other systems like NASAMS, FrankenSAM, and others,' a summary of the plan states. The plan recommends a list of service-specific priorities, calling on the Navy to improve the health of the shipbuilding industrial base so it can deliver a 355-ship fleet — with Wicker’s proposal even laying out a path to get to to 357 ships by 2035. It includes reforms to get submarine builders to three Virginia-class attack subs per year and the creation of a 'large scale industrial base program' for surface combatants, which would cost $20 billion over five years. The Navy should also accelerate its buy of unmanned underwater vessels and surface drones, and use multi-year procurement to buy amphibious ships. Wicker’s plan states that the Air Force should buy at least 340 more fighter aircraft over the next five years and 'at least double' B-21 bomber procurement, currently set for 100 planes. It also directs the Air Force to begin a rapid acquisition program for the E-2D Hawkeye instead of buying the E-7 Wedgetail. The Army should 'adopt lessons war in Ukraine,' and field new air defense and counter-UAS units, the plan says. It should also accelerate the development of long-range munitions and command-and-control technologies for operations in the Western Pacific. Meanwhile, the Marine Corps needs to make 'major' investments in technologies to enable sophisticated contested logistics and accelerate its Force Design 2030 plans.

Trump’s defense secretary should focus on internal Pentagon challenges to meet external threats	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) As the Trump administration begins the process of forming its government and assuming the presidency, one of the most consequential decisions will be selecting the next secretary of defense. This person will be charged with the immense responsibility of leading two million uniformed military members and nearly 750,000 civilian employees across the globe. The secretary of defense is really three jobs rolled into one. The first is that the secretary is a global leader, travelling the world to advance US national security and guiding combat and non-combat operations 24/7 in all domains. The second is that the secretary is the largest employer in the United States, leading one of the most complex organizations ever assembled, with a budget of over $850 billion per year. Lastly, the secretary is the principal assistant to the president in all matters relating to the Department of Defense and serves on the National Security Council. The 'to-do' list on day one for the incoming secretary will be staggering, with two ongoing wars, an aggressive China, and the responsibilities of working with the president on crafting the National Security Strategy within the National Security Council process. These will undoubtedly be the most urgent tasks, drawing the secretary towards jobs number one and three above. If the incoming defense chief does this, they will be following a well-worn path of outsourcing the management of the Pentagon to the deputy secretary of defense. This, however, would be a substantial mistake. The most urgent and strategically important job that the secretary must personally be involved in is the management of the department, the second job mentioned above. Our military is in its most perilous shape since the end of the 1970s: Woefully behind in utilizing existing technologies, sized for one-short war which our adversaries are willing to take advantage of, and burdened with an acquisition process and programs that cost billions to deliver hand-crafted weapons that cannot be manufactured to scale and often do not even work. Finally, if that is not bad enough, the military is short of people, and a coming demographic cliff is going to exacerbate this problem right at the time we need to project strength to our adversaries. The secretary should therefore come in and personally lead the charge to fix three things inside the Pentagon: acquisition, resources, and recruiting. Much ink has been spent describing in detail the disaster that is the acquisition system within the Pentagon. While some former secretaries such as Bob Gates and Ash Carter have tried to fix the system, it has, to date, remained stuck in the 1970s, producing high-cost, low-volume, and technologically-antiquated systems. Fixing this cannot be outsourced to the Deputy Secretary or the acquisition chief. Only the Secretary of defense, over the course of four years, will be able to drive the change that is needed. On day one, the secretary should come in and signal his or her seriousness by cancelling a major weapon system built for a past fight — think the Joint Strike Fighter or the Army’s Future Vertical Lift —vowing to use all of the dollars to invest in unmanned systems, artificial intelligence, and the mass production of weapons. Why go after the dollars immediately rather than changing acquisition regulations? Because if the secretary did the latter, the bureaucracy would wait him or her out and four years would go by without change. Next, the secretary must address the fact that the budget of the Pentagon is currently sized to fight only one, short-term war. Some will make the argument that the nation should pivot away from the Middle East and Europe in order to fit our national strategy to the fiscal constraints of the current budget. This, however, belies the fact that today, the North Koreans are supplying troops to the Russians to fight a war in Europe with Iranian weapons bought with oil proceeds from China. Our adversaries are using the entire globe to challenge us and no amount of 'wish-casting' is going to change that. On day one, the secretary should come in and signal his or her seriousness by stating that the new force-sizing construct for the military will be to fight one long war, with two simultaneous small wars. This matches up with the incoming president’s strategy of peace through strength. This new force-sizing construct will then drive the budget process going forward. And while the defense secretary doesn’t control the budget, they should use their early juice in the new role to push Congress to step up spending. Sen. Roger Wicker, who might become the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has put together a plan that provides an additional $55 billion to the Pentagon per year. This should be a starting point. Finally, but probably most importantly, the military needs people to serve. The wars in both Europe and the Middle East are teaching us the same lesson: That in a test of wills, the side that runs out of people and money first will lose. With wages in the private sector heading higher and a smaller number of available 18-years olds due to a demographic cliff expected to start in 2026, the secretary has no time to waste. On day one, they should signal their seriousness by stating that the Department of Defense supports the Congressional plan to dramatically increase the pay of the junior enlisted force. Some have said that the world is dangerously close to tipping into an all-out war. One way to prevent war is to make sure that those who wish you harm believe that they cannot prevail. This can only be done through an American military force that is utilizing the most technologically sophisticated weapons, produced at a scale that cannot be matched by our rivals, and used by the best service members the world has ever seen. Through strength comes peace. While the incoming secretary of defense will want to look to travel the globe and tend to the White House, his or her most important task is to first fix the Pentagon.

Weapons and radars built with modular design are relevant and flexible as threats evolve	Through the lens of new weapons development, Raytheon Advanced Technology employs composability as a catalyst for speed for weapon systems like hypersonic missiles. (Raytheon photo). Delivering new sensing and weaponry capability at the 'speed of relevance' is the idea behind quickly countering adversarial threats in the battlespace. Too often, though, ideas stay just that, concepts that do not effectively lead to solutions. The lost possibilities are sensors and weapons that have little commonality between them so they take longer and cost more to produce and can’t share data across warfighting and security domains. There are, however, major new systems in production now for both the U.S. Navy and Army that have gone from conception to becoming the cornerstone of air and missile defense in just a handful of years due to engineering principals built around 'composable' weapons and software-defined apertures. One of those systems is the Navy’s AN/SPY-6 (V) active electronically scanned array radar now undergoing sea trials. The Navy is integrating SPY-6 into its surface fleet beginning with the USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125), first of the Arleigh Burke-class Flight III destroyers, and the USS Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29), an amphibious landing ship that introduced the (V)2 variant. Another is the Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, or LTAMDS. The program has advanced through multiple live-fire tests of the 360-degree radar, demonstrating the radar's performance. Both programs are the centerpieces of their respective services air and missile defense modernization strategies, and both were architected in the Advanced Technology (AT) business of Raytheon. Building atop foundational blocks Raytheon’s Advanced Technology team is bringing ideas to fruition through the use of foundational building-blocks that enable technical innovations like software-defined apertures for radars and composable weapon architectures for missiles and other weaponry. Through the lens of new weapons development, composability is a catalyst for speed. Over the last decade, AT has architected the use of common, scalable, modular hardware and software building blocks, allowing the company to deliver faster and streamline its factories. 'It's absolutely central to all of our new weapon developments and pursuits,' said John C. Otto, Raytheon AT’s technology director. 'It's a toolbox of subsystems that we can pull together and use again and again with common interfaces without having to recreate the wheel from the beginning on each of them.' In missile development, for example, one of the core but common subsystems is guidance electronics. What Raytheon AT has done is partition the functionality across the guidance unit so that if more processing is desired, cards can be easily added to support that. Or vice versa; processing can be dialed back for less complex missions where the additional capability and subsequent cost is not needed. With commonality of hardware, customers can bundle buys at lower cost and take advantage of common factories and test equipment. From the standpoint of the engineering workforce, different programs look much the same so that personnel can move between programs and only have to learn the particulars of that one program as opposed to an entirely new system. They experience the same look and feel of a program down to the fundamental software level. The result is higher efficiency, faster development, and quicker upgrades to combat adversarial challenges. In radar development, Raytheon Advanced Technology uses a building block approach to create a software-defined aperture architecture to control and update radars and other weapon systems. (Raytheon photo). Software-defined apertures for system updates Radar structures built with modular blocks can be scaled larger for massive sensing capability for advanced warships like Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, or – using the exact same blocks – scaled down for the needs of an LPD. The Navy’s SPY-6 radar is a perfect example of how Raytheon AT used this approach to develop and scale radar systems for different customers, missions, and vessels. Each building block for the SPY-6 family of radars is a 2’x2’x2’ box called the radar modular assembly, or RMA. Each RMA is a self-contained radar antenna and arrays of different sizes for different uses can be made by stacking RMAs together. 37 RMAs make up each of the four faces of the SPY-6(V)1 radar on the DDG 51. The SPY-6(V)2 rotating array on the Nimitz class has nine RMAs, and the three faces of the SPY-6(V)3 on Ford-class carriers and the FFG(X) frigates also have nine RMAs. The four faces of the SPY-6(V)4 radar on the DDG 51 Flight IIA destroyers have 24 RMAs. Modular radar technology is also used in the GhostEye family of radars, including the Army’s LTAMDS radar. 'Think of your hardware as a capability that is unlocked with software commands,' explained Matt Tyhach, mission area director for next generation sensors and microelectronics at Raytheon AT. 'You may have a radar that is capable of detecting slow low-flying drones and then with software commands you can reoptimize its configuration to detect fast high-flying ballistic missiles. Very different target sets, but we can leverage the power and flexibility of our radar hardware baseline to stay ahead of the threat by upgrading performance through safe, secure software only upgrades.' From a radar development perspective, AT uses such building blocks to create a software-defined aperture architecture, rather than a conventional radar approach, to create flexible hardware solutions that serve multiple missions. Software apps like those on cell phones make it simpler to control and update the radars and other weapon systems. This modular approach to radar development, coupled with robotic assembly of each system, allows Raytheon to rapidly field radars for different missions. As new capabilities via software upgrades are developed, they’re added to the company’s common radar software product line, which is shared and re-used across multiple radar programs. 'This is a common library of radar software that was first developed for SPY-6 and as we learn more from sea trials and first deployment, that learning is all fed back into the common baseline for future radar franchises, including LTAMDS.' said Tyhach. 'Likewise, LTMADS is fielding its first units now at WSMR (White Sands Missile Range) and that learning is fed into the common radar baseline to benefit SPY-6 and expand our trusted and tried software without the larger non-recurring engineering build of most heritage non-software defined systems.' Matching weapons system capabilities to the mission Raytheon Advanced Technology has found the pathway to addressing complexity through the simplicity wrought by modularity and reuse of components that match weapon system capabilities to the mission – no more, no less – while software-defined apertures let those same systems modernize remotely as threats evolve.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/weapons-and-radars-built-with-modular-design-are-relevant-and-flexible-as-threats-evolve/	2024-11-12T05:19:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Raytheon-Hypersonic.png
SPACECOM to Huntsville? Bets are on ‘yes,’ and possibly soon	The Army's Redstone Arsenal is home to Army Space &amp; Missile Defense Command, the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center among other organizations. (Photo: US Army) WASHINGTON — Space watchers say the odds are high that President-elect Donald Trump will redirect US Space Command headquarters to Huntsville, Ala., once he is in office — reversing the July 2023 decision by President Joe Biden to keep the command based in Colorado Springs, Co. 'I think it's a virtual certainty. He can announce it in the first 100 days, but the process will take many years and appropriations from Congress. But I think SPACECOM will end up moving to Huntsville,' said Todd Harrison, a long-time space analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. Those expressing confidence in such a move also include Alabama's senior Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville. 'Sen. Tuberville has spoken with President Trump several times about the importance of moving Space Command back to its rightful home in Huntsville,' a spokesperson for Tuberville's office told Breaking Defense. The spokesperson also pointed to a Nov. 7 interview with Tuberville on WREC radio station's 'Alabama Morning News with JT' show, where the senator stated that Huntsville was the 'best place' for SPACECOM HQ due to the level of security there. 'There is no doubt it's the best place, and it's secure. They're not secure out there [in Colorado]. But, again, I've told President Trump, listen, get a Secretary of Air Force. Let's go through this process again—[it's a] short period of time,' Tuberville said. 'It won't take long and I know where it's gonna go. Let's just do it the right way. Politics don't need to be involved. It needs to be done for the military and the people of this country,' he added. Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that plans for making such a move already exist — given that Trump had decided on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville as SPACECOM's home just before he left the Oval Office for the first time in January 2021. 'It's a safe bet that Space Command is going to Rocket City. Worth dusting off plans for the 60-acre site previously identified for a new Redstone headquarters,' he told Breaking Defense. Redstone Arsenal, a US Army post, currently is home to a number of service organizations, including Army Space and Missile Defense Command. It also houses the Missile Defense Agency and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The SPACECOM basing decision has been a political football between the Alabama and Colorado congressional delegations since 2018, and the subject of investigations in 2022 by both the Pentagon's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and Congress's watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act passed in December 2023, lawmakers blocked funding for additional facilities at the Colorado location and mandated yet another investigation by the OIG, this time into the fairness of Biden's decision to let the command stay where it was. GAO, likewise, opened another investigation in September 2023. Nonetheless, then-SPACECOM commander Army Gen. Jim Dickinson on Dec. 15, 2023 declared that the command had reached 'full operational capability' at Peterson SFB, including having the necessary infrastructure 'to support command and control across mission and business functions.' In a long thread on LinkedIn over the past week, commenters including current and former military officials raised questions about the costs of moving the headquarters now that it has had time to settle in, as well as the potential effects on mission readiness. One big concern cited was whether there will be a huge brain drain among the civilian workforce because many will not want to move from Colorado Springs. However, some other analysts keeping eyes on SPACECOM told Breaking Defense that perhaps that expected attrition in personnel would be a good thing — shaking up status quo thinking about the command's mission, and making room for new blood.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/spacecom-to-huntsville-bets-are-on-yes-and-possibly-soon/	2024-11-11T11:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Army-redstone-arsenal-e1731352925128.jpg
Army inks $435 million deal for new TNT production facility	Paladin artillery crews assigned to 3rd Battalion, 29th Field Artillery Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division conduct Table VI qualifications in February 2017, firing the first 155-mm rounds in Poland at the training site. (US Army/Staff Sgt. Elizabeth Tarr) WASHINGTON —As part of the Army’s quest to boost weapons production, it is reestablishing TNT production on US soil, inking a deal to build out a new facility in Graham, Ky. 'For the first time in decades, America will produce TNT on its own soil, manufacturing the explosive material our military uses for everything from hand grenades to 155mm artillery,' outgoing Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a press release. McConnell’s comments came after the service announced a new $435 million deal last Friday, tasking Repkon USA with designing and building out the new explosives production facility that should be completed by early November 2028. 'This is a major step forward in rebuilding our industrial base and ensuring we have the critical capabilities to support our warfighters,' Army acquisition head Douglas Bush said in the press release. 'Reshoring TNT production gives us the ability to control and secure our supply chain for this vital component, especially in an era of increasing global challenges.' TNT is used to produce an array of explosive weapons including ammunition, bombs and 155-millimeter artillery rounds, but the military has been reliant on overseas sources. The decision to build out a new production comes as service leaders work to scale weapon production in the wake of the Ukraine war, including 155mm artillery rounds. By fiscal 2026, the service is aiming to have the capacity to produce 100,000 rounds each month. To get there, Bush previously said the Army plans to spend $4.2 billion to build up the industrial base across various initiatives, to include commissioning three new domestic facilities to support 155mm production and a new metal parts production facility in Canada. 'This new state-of-the-art [TNT] facility is essential to the … mission to develop, procure and field safe, reliable and lethal munitions to our joint warfighters and international partners,' Maj. Gen. John T. Reim, the joint program executive officer for armaments and ammunition, said in the Army press release. 'This project will also further strengthen our defense industrial base, enabling munitions production at speed and scale.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-inks-435-million-deal-for-new-tnt-production-facility/	2024-11-11T11:23:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/TNT-story-scaled.jpg
German MoD picks up tab for ICEYE-Rheinmetall SAR-sat data sales to Ukraine	Image of the Davis-Monthan Air Force 'Boneyard' in Tucson, Ariz., US, March 1, 2024. (ICEYE) WASHINGTON — Finnish satellite operator ICEYE and German arms maker Rheinmetall today announced they have jointly signed a contract to provide Ukraine's armed forces with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery — with funding provided by Germany's Ministry of Defense. 'The agreement further increases the SAR data and other support Ukraine has been receiving from ICEYE' since Russia's assault on the country in February 2022, according to the Rheinmetall press release. 'This provision will supplement further reconnaissance data obtained by other sensors and provide the basis for decision-making and operational planning by the Ukrainian armed forces. The collaboration includes dedicated satellite capacity and constellation access, which allows the capacity of the entire ICEYE satellite fleet to be utilized. Since 2018, ICEYE has launched 38 satellites for ICEYE’s and its customers’ use,' it adds. Rheinmetall did not release the value of the German contract. The two firms first inked a cooperation accord in June, and in September Düsseldorf-based Rheinmetall procured the exclusive rights to market ICEYE's products to 'military and government end users' in Germany and Hungary, according to an Oct. 9 Rheinmetall press release. Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall AG, said at the time: 'The space domain is an integral part of a defence strategy and of great relevance to our military clients. We are convinced that our combined capabilities will enable us to develop innovative approaches to offer customized solutions for our military customers in the future.' SAR satellites, which can take high-resolution images day and night regardless of weather conditions, have been particularly useful for Ukraine's warfighting capability, given the preponderance of cloudy weather in the country. ICEYE was an early provider, in August 2022 offering Kiev access to its constellation via an agreement with the Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation in Ukraine for one of the company's satellites to be designated for Ukrainian government use. In July 2024, ICEYE and Ukraine's government signed a new 'Memorandum of Cooperation' to expand their collaboration.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/german-mod-picks-up-tab-for-iceye-rheinmetall-sar-sat-data-sales-to-ukraine/	2024-11-11T08:58:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/ICEYE-Press-Release_Aircarft_Boneyard_US-e1731343102183.png
Sweden selects Embraer C-390 transport aircraft, as Brazil eyes more Gripens	Embraer showed off its C-390 Millennium carrier during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow. Embraer signed a contract with the Netherlands and Austria for a combined order of the C-390 during the show. (Tim Martin/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Sweden has selected the Brazilian-made C-390 for its next military transport aircraft, creating another strong defense industrial tie between the two nations. Stockholm announced it was signing a letter of intent over the weekend to purchase the C-390, produced by Embraer, which will open the way for negotiations to begin. Sweden joins Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Netherlands and Portugal as European operators of the Millennium, which has also been purchased by South Korea and, of course, home country Brazil. Quantities and cost were not disclosed in the announcement. Sweden currently operates six Lockheed Martin-made C-130H aircraft, and a one-for-one replacement would make sense given Sweden’s military needs and its recent membership in NATO. Every win for the C-390 is important, but adding another NATO nation to its user base is a particularly large victory for Embraer as the company seeks to expand its global footprint — and, it hopes, break into the lucrative US market. As Breaking Defense first reported, Embraer and US-based L3Harris are no long working together to market the tanker variant of the 390 to the US Air Force. However, Bosco da Costa Jr., the company’s defense chief, said in an interview that Embraer is still pursuing sales to the Air Force, positioning the Millennium as a multi-mission aircraft able to fill multiple needs. 'You can use this airplane to do air-to-air refueling, but in some hours, you could do the plane to do transport, to do search and rescue, to do other types of missions, not necessarily only for air-to-air refueling,' he told Breaking Defense last month. 'That is an advantage.' The letter of intent was signed on Saturday by Sweden’s Minister for Defence Pål Jonson and Brazil’s Minister of Defense José Múcio. A Swedish announcement of the LOI was also accompanied by a statement that Brazil plans to increase its buy of Jas 30 Gripen fighters by 25 percent. Brazil currently has 36 Gripens on order, so a 25 percent increase would mean nine additional fighters. Embraer and Saab have a joint production agreement, with Gripens being produced in-country in Brazil as part of the 2014 decision to purchase the jets. 'Aerospace cooperation is important to both Sweden and Brazil. The new letter of intent provides a basis for us to further deepen this cooperation,' Jonson said in a statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/sweden-selects-brazils-embraer-c-390-transport-aircraft-brazil-eyes-more-gripens/	2024-11-11T05:24:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
US Olympic Defender allies seek ‘common’ space picture	Space Delta 5 and the Combined Space Operations Center, one of five centers under US Space Forces &#8211; Space, on Nov. 4-6. 2024 hosted a meeting of the Operation Olympic Defender Common Operating Picture working group at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., including Australian, Canadian and British representatives. (US Space Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Luke Kitterman) WASHINGTON — The US and some of its closest allies in Operation Olympic Defender (OOD) this week launched 'initial' efforts to create new standards for sharing space monitoring data — the necessary foundation for developing a common view of the space battlefield, according to US Space Command (SPACECOM). Earlier this week the Space Force's Space Delta 5 and the Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC) 'hosted a 3-day Operation Olympic Defender Common Operational Picture (COP) working group, consisting of space representatives from the Australian Space Operations Centre, Canadian Space Operations Centre and United Kingdom National Space Operations Centre,' SPACECOM said in a press release Thursday. Operation Olympic Defender is the US military's plan for space warfighting, alongside a select group of key allies. 'It’s essential that the [Olympic Defender] allies and partners have a shared understanding of the battlespace, to ensure mission impacting decision-making is based on common perceptions of what’s occurring and likely to occur in the Area of Responsibility,' said Royal Australian Air Force Group Captain Julien Greening, CSpOC deputy director. Space Delta 5's mission is to 'prepare, present, and fight' forces to SPACECOM for 'operational-level command and control,' according to SPACECOM's website. SPACECOM's CSpOC brings together the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to collaborate on space command and control. Both organizations are located at Vandenberg SFB, Calif. Since July, Col. Justin Sorice is double-hatted as commander of both. As of last month, the same group of countries also are members of Operation Olympic Defender. At a meeting last year, the Operation Olympic Defender allies agreed on the need for commanders to be able to collectively see what is happening in space at the same time. At the meeting this week, the working group reviewed 'risks and mitigations, refined the concept of operation, and update the plan to develop a shared Space COP,' the SPACECOM press release explained. Further, the group also 'reviewed and contributed initial requirements and identifying standards to cooperatively produce shared situation understand of the space environment,' the release said. 'The team will build on data provided by the US Space Surveillance Network and utilize the existing Global Command and Control System – Joint, as the initial means of generating and displaying space track information integrated with available intelligence and environmental information, to provide the user a fused battlespace picture,' it added. Both the UK and Australia are in the process of standing up two of three planned sites for the US Deep Space Advanced Radar (DARC) to track satellites and dangerous space junk in far away orbits with more precision. (The third site will be in the US.) The first radar, in Western Australia, will become operational in 2026; all three are expected to be online by 2030. Canada is at the start of an effort to develop a successor to its aging Sapphire satellite that keeps tabs on the heavens. The project, called 'Surveillance of Space 2,' is expected to cost as much as $250 million CAN to $499 million CAN ($180 million USD to $358 million USD), according to a Ministry of Defence fact sheet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-olympic-defender-allies-seek-common-space-picture/	2024-11-08T12:30:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Operation-Olympic-Defender-Space-COP-working-group-Nov.-2024-scaled-e1731096548525.jpeg
Eyeing future CCA missions, Navy teams with Lockheed, GA to test new drone control system	Navy unmanned aerial vehicle pilots check the readouts during a test of a new Lockheed control system working with a General Atomics CCA 'surrogate' on Nov. 5, 2024. (NAVAIR) WASHINGTON — US Navy pilots sitting comfortably in Maryland recently took a new carrier-based drone control center out for a spin for the first time, piloting a General Atomics MQ-20 Avenger thousands of miles away using autonomous tech made by Lockheed Martin's secretive Skunk Works division. The live-flight test of the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control Station (UMCS), conducted Nov. 5, was done 'as part of an effort to advance technology for future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA),' Naval Aviation Systems Command wrote in a release on Thursday. Both the Air Force and the Navy are pushing forward with CCA — essentially robotic drone wingmen to fly alongside or ahead of manned aircraft in combat operations — seen as the future of air dominance. 'This was a huge step for unmanned naval aviation,' Navy Air Vehicle Pilot (AVP) Lt. Steven Wilster said in the Navy release. 'This demo showcased UMCS’s first live control of an unmanned air vehicle, and it was great to be part of history in the making. The team is paving the way for integrating critical unmanned capability across the joint force to combat the high-end threat our warfighters face today and in the future.' For the test, Navy pilots in Patuxent River, Maryland, controlled the jet-powered MQ-20, which served as a 'surrogate' for a future CCA bird, as it sliced through the sky in California, according to the Navy and a Lockheed announcement today. 'UMCS is laying a foundation that will enable control of all unmanned carrier aircraft, starting with the MQ-25 aircraft,' Capt. Daniel Fucito, program manager for the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation Program Office, said in the Navy release. 'The UMCS opens the door for efficiently introducing future unmanned systems into the complex carrier command and control architecture.' The Navy's control station is built on what Lockheed Martin calls its 'MDCX autonomy platform,' which Skunk Works Vice President and General Manager John Clark said was used to 'rapidly integrate the MQ-20 &#8216;autonomy core' with the UMCS, demonstrating common control capability and third-party platform integration.' While both the Air Force and the Navy hope to see CCAs flying alongside their fighters and bombers within a few years, the services are pursuing the efforts separately. The Air Force has selected two platforms for its first tranche of aircraft, an aircraft from General Atomics's Gambit family and Anduril's Fury. RELATED: &#8216;I don't see it': Before their CCA drones even take to the air, Anduril and GA trade shots The Navy appears to be further behind in its quest for an actual aircraft, but has ideas about what it wants and does not want. 'I want something that’s going to fly for a couple hundred hours. The last hour it’s either a target or a weapon. I’m either going to hit something with it or I’m going to train [a sensor on it] and shoot it down,' Rear Adm. Stephen Tedford, the Navy’s program executive for unmanned systems and weapons, said during the Sea Air Space conference in April. 'But I’m not going to sustain them for 30 years.' At the time, he added that the Navy was looking for a platform that comes it an under $15 million each. Wherever the Navy lands, it's certain the USN and USMC AVPs want a reliable UMCS, perhaps aided by LM's MDCX, to fly their CCAs for ISR, EW or combat missions ASAP.

DCMA builds ‘information dictionary’ to decode DoD acronyms, key terms	Artificial intelligence and technology (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Employees at the Defense Contracting Management Agency created a much-needed solution to decipher between the ever-changing accumulation of Department of Defense key phrases and acronyms. Leading up to the DCMA’s IT Training Summit Innovation Contest this past summer, IT workers created a tool, dubbed the Information Dictionary, to help the agency quickly look up and see definitions for the DoD’s jargon-heavy terms and acronyms. The team behind the product won second place in the competition, according to a press release from DCMA. 'There are so many DOD and DCMA unique acronyms, and new ones are always being developed that we’re often asking, ‘what does XXXX stand for?’' Andy Bradshaw, DCMA’s Total Force Directorate Policy Branch supervisor, said in the release. 'Then we go on a rabbit hunt trying to figure it out, and at times there is more than one meaning. The DCMA Information Dictionary saves us a lot of time and frustration in determining acronyms and their definitions. It’s a great tool for us, and it will be a great asset for new agency employees as well.' He added that before the Information Dictionary was created, the agency used an Excel spreadsheet to track these key terms and acronyms. The second-place team was made up of team lead and data architect Joseph Lowe; business architect Sabrina Francis; technology architect Larry Hairston; and security architect Keith Young. The team used artificial intelligence from reports made by Power BI — a business intelligence platform that helps turn raw data into usable observations — that combined data from the DCMA, DoD, Federal Acquisition Regulation and National Institute of Standards and Technology to build the tool. So far, it’s been used over 400 times in the past month by DCMA employees, the release said. 'We manually extracted data over a period of six months from over 660 documents including more than 28 thousand rows of data that defines over two thousand unique terms and acronyms, and nearly two thousand unique references,' Lowe said in the press release. Though the Information Dictionary is jam-packed with data, it’s actually 'very user-friendly,' Francis added. 'For example, you can pick a filter on the left-hand navigation such as ‘DCMA Acronyms’ then search the words in alphabetic order. Let’s say you pick the term ‘ACQDemo’ from the list. The filter will show you all the different possible names for that acronym plus any related capabilities and policies related to the term,' he said. The team noted that the tool has been helpful, but there are improvements to be made. For example, automating the process of adding new terms, acronyms and definitions is next on the list. While currently only available to employees within DCMA, eventually the Information Dictionary will be available to others. 'I’m proud to say our approach to documenting organizational information for enterprise architectural purposes will be presented to DOD, other federal agencies and industry in the coming months,' Lowe said in the release.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/dcma-builds-information-dictionary-to-decode-dod-acronyms-key-terms/	2024-11-08T10:38:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_AI_brain_icon_GettyImages-1296904409-scaled-e1663074689851.jpg
The US needs to get real about maneuver warfare in space	An upgraded Ground Based Interceptor with a Capability Enhanced-II Block 1 Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) is launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, during Flight Test Ground-based Midcourse Defense Weapon System-12, or FTG-12, on December 11, 2023 Recently, senior Space Force commanders have been articulating support for the use of maneuver warfare in space deterrence and warfighting operations. While laudable, upon further review, it appears that these statements are not speaking about maneuver warfare as much as they are about rapid movement of spacecraft to avoid intercept by an enemy spacecraft or ground-based threats. These passive defensive actions are not true maneuver warfare. And if the Space Force wants to get serious about being able to defeat enemy nations in space, it needs to stop tip-toeing around the issue. It’s time for America to put real investments into space weapons capable of targeting earth-bound targets. As defined by Robert Leonhard in his book, The Art of Maneuver, 'maneuver warfare' as 'the means of defeat[ing] … the enemy.' The objective is to achieve victory, not the sustainment of competition. To achieve this victory requires an aggressiveness that under current DoD space policy and strategy, is considered irresponsible. As Leonhard proclaims, 'maneuver warfare is, to put it simply, a kick in the groin, a poke in the eye, a stab in the back. It is quick, violent for a moment and unfair. It is decisive, even pre-emptive, at the expense of protocol and posturing.' To use Chinese military terms in their strategy document, The Science of Strategy, this type of attack should be 'rapid and destructive.' Second, in implementation, Leonhard correctly states that maneuver warfare 'puts a premium on being sneaky rather than courageous, … because it typically flees from the enemy’s strength.' By maneuvering for the 'kick in the groin' or a 'rapid and destructive' strike, instead of attacking the enemy’s advantage — its concentration of forces arrayed against friendly forces — the space force can hit the decisive points to win against the enemy. It means that a space warfighting force needs to render an enemy force irrelevant at the decisive point, whether that be 'a theater (area of responsibility), an area of operations, or on a battlefield.' Here’s a real world scenario for how this could play out. It’s not hard to figure out where China has put its heaviest investments: numerous open-source intelligence reports show China now has a very robust, multi-layered system of air, land, and maritime based weapons to achieve counter-intervention or in Western parlance, anti-access/area-denial, in the first and second island chains of the Indo-Pacific. Beijing has large numbers of ships and missiles, interior lines between mainland China and Taiwan, industrial capacity that harkens back to the United States in World War II, and a centralized command structure sitting atop a authoritarian state. Its space deterrence and warfighting strategy and capability are proactive, pre-emptive and follow the principles of 'rapid and destructive' maneuver warfare to seek and sustain the advantage all the way to victory. In fact, according to the Army War College, wargames indicate that the United States, in a traditional, air, maritime, and land-based terrestrial fight, will lose significant combat power quickly. This is because terrestrial US military forces are too small, their supply lines are too vulnerable, and 'American’s defense industrial capacity is far too eroded to keep up with the material demands of a high-intensity conflict.' The way to beat this situation and to render the enemy force irrelevant terrestrially through attack operations within the space AOR, is to re-frame the Space Force from a mere support service into the primary door kicking, maneuver force for the United States. To do this requires the development of space-to-ground weapons (SGWs), whose focus would be to make Chinese concentrations of terrestrial and space counter-intervention forces in the Western Pacific irrelevant by holding them at risk. Once deployed, SGWs would provide enhanced space deterrence during peacetime and crisis, and if necessary, destroy threats to US terrestrial forces by rolling back barriers to entry for our smaller air, land, and maritime forces. The current technology at our disposal, coupled with less expensive lift, heavy lift, and soon to be super heavy lift rockets, means there are ways to get small constellations of SGWs deployed around Earth, capable of achieving five-minute target revisit rates with little defense to stop them. The Chinese have already demonstrated they are pursuing similar capability through their Fractional/Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) system. Therefore, we should position our space forces into the front of the line to ensure decisiveness in such a conflict. There is no need for US forces to attack using an old 20th Century method of terrestrial concentration of force and lose, when we can negate the A2/AD advantage/barriers to entry for terrestrial air, land, and maritime forces through orbital strike forces. Granted, this advantage would only last as long as the adversary lacks an effective counter-force, but those issues can be addressed as well by a proper organizational and budgetary perspective grounded in the strategic reality of the current threat environment. This is the role the Space Force should be accomplishing-providing for the decisive advantage over enemy terrestrial force advantage through maneuver warfare in and from space.

With help from Italy to Brazil, UAE’s EDGE Group beefs up maritime capabilities under new deals	The Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group shows of missiles and drones at its stand at Eurosatory 2024. (Lee Ferran / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — United Arab Emirates defense conglomerate EDGE Group has signed three international agreements focused on maritime capabilities and autonomous systems, and one to upgrade neighboring marine vessels this week during the 2024 Euronaval exposition in Paris. The first was sealed with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to codevelop underwater solutions in the UAE, the second was signed with the Brazilian navy to codevelop counter-drone systems, and the third was signed with French defense firm Lacroix to equip EDGE Group's RABDAN fast attack boats with decoy systems. The fourth agreement was with the Kuwaiti coast guard to repair some of its ships. 'The MoU [with Fincantieri] would see both groups collaborate on the design, development, and creation of advanced manned and unmanned underwater systems solution capability in the United Arab Emirates through their recently launched, Abu Dhabi-based shipbuilding joint venture, MAESTRAL,' a statement this week from EDGE Group said. 'This preliminary agreement will pave the way and boost for developing sophisticated solutions tailored to the unique underwater needs of navies worldwide.' EDGE Group and Fincantieri launched MAESTRAL in February this year to codevelop naval systems in the UAE. The joint venture has prime rights to non-NATO orders and a number of strategic orders placed by selected NATO member countries, EDGE said. The agreement will be the first step for the Emirati firm in underwater development. 'From the outset, we recognized that only through collaboration and partnership could we develop the technologies and expertise necessary for EDGE to lead in the air, land, sea, cyber, and space domains. Our ongoing partnership with Fincantieri exemplifies this strategy, opening limitless opportunities for both companies in the joint development and production of advanced surface and underwater naval solutions,' said EDGE Group CEO Hamad Al Marar in the statement. Gulf State Analytics analyst Leonardo Jacopo Maria Mazzucco told Breaking Defense that this agreement shows the evolution of the relationship between the two firms. 'Once a hungry buyer of Fincantieri’s products, the UAE has gradually sought to shift its role in the defense products marketplace, turning from a loyal customer into a reliable industrial partner for the Italian shipbuilder,' he said. Mazzucco stated that the benefits are not only to develop defense solutions 'capable of partially offsetting the shortage of manpower in the UAE Navy,' but also to support 'EDGE’s quest to generate revenue streams from the manufacturing of high added value military products for the export market.' EDGE’s agreement with the Brazilian navy aims to develop autonomous surface and aerial defense systems, specifically developing and deploying counter-drone systems 'This preliminary agreement to pursue the joint development and delivery of sophisticated counter-drone technologies and solutions will not only ensure that both parties benefit from the sharing of knowledge and innovation but will also enable us, as partners, to become leaders in the field, meeting sovereign needs and eventually those of other export markets in the face of modern naval and airborne threats,' said the Director General of Material for the Brazilian Navy Adm. Edgar Luiz Siqueira Barbosa. EDGE Group subsidiary Abu Dhabi Ship Building (ADSB) also inked a deal with LaCroix at Euronaval to equip its RABDAN FA-400 fast attack boats with decoy systems and countermeasures. The RABDAN fast attack vessel is a 45-meter long boat designed for patrolling territorial and coastal borders. 'This [agreement] greatly enhances its [RABDAN's] defence capabilities, ensuring it is fully prepared to support military operations, search and rescue, surveillance, and patrol activities in modern maritime environments,' said David Massey, CEO of ADSB, in a statement. Mazzucco told Breaking Defense that the pace and level of partnerships between EDGE and European original equipment manufacturers have significantly accelerated during the past four years. 'The UAE has cultivated solid industrial partnerships with leading weapon companies to advance its localization ambitions and bolster employment opportunities for nationals. Regarding strategic industrial cooperation, the UAE’s partner-seeking strategy has prioritized partnerships with top European defense companies in the air, naval, and automation sectors for two reasons: First, these three domains are critical to ensuring the UAE's national security; second, they manufacture high-value defense products for export,' he said. The Emirati firm didn’t leave the French naval expo without sealing a contract with Kuwait for the reconstruction, repair, development, and upgrade of Kuwaiti Coast Guard marine vessels. The work is expected to take place at the shipyard in Abu Dhabi, though the value and timeline of the deal were not announced.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/with-help-from-italy-to-brazil-uaes-edge-group-beefs-up-maritime-capabilities-under-new-deals/	2024-11-08T06:13:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/1000001673-scaled-e1718887127547.jpg
Israel signs $5.2 billion deal for 25 new F-15 fighter jets	Israeli Air Force F-15 Strike Eagles accompany a U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer over Israel as part of a presence patrol above the U.S. Central Command’s area of responsibility Oct. 30, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Jerreht Harris) JERUSALEM — The Israel Ministry of Defense has signed what it called a 'landmark transaction' to acquire 25 more F-15 fighter aircraft in a deal worth $5.2 billion, the ministry announced today. The warplanes will be delivered beginning in 2031, and it will take around five years for them all to arrive. The deal was widely expected and has been in the process of finalization throughout the year as Israel has been fighting a multi-front war against Iran-backed proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen. Israel used F-15s in its long-range strike on Yemen in July. The US has also deployed F-15s to the region amid Israel-Iran tensions, illustrating how the Boeing-made plane, which first flew in the 1970s, is increasingly relevant today. The deal was finalized Wednesday 'following negotiations between the Israel Ministry of Defense’s Mission to the U.S. and Boeing in collaboration with the Israeli Air Force,' the Israeli MoD said in its announcement, adding that Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir signed an earlier 'procurement authorization' during a visit to the US last month. 'Boeing takes pride in its longstanding partnership with Israel, a relationship that dates back to our nation's establishment,' President of Boeing Israel Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Ido Nehushtan said. 'The company will continue working with the U.S. and Israeli governments to deliver the advanced F-15IA aircraft through standard military procurement channels.' Zamir was accompanied to the signing by the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense’s mission to the US, Aviram Hasson. Israel has been considering a number of major aircraft and helicopter deals in recent years. The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas instilled additional urgency for some of this procurement, even though these deals take years to see aircraft delivered. In August, the US Secretary of State approved the potential Foreign Military Sale of the aircraft to Israel. At the time, the approval covered not only the 25 F-15s, but also an option to purchase 20 more of them and modification kits for F-15s Israel already operates. Should Israel pursue the full authorized deal, it would be worth $18 billion, the US said then. The F-15 was first flown in 1972, and one- and two-seater versions were delivered to the US military throughout the 1970s. Israel acquired its first F-15s late that same decade, and they have been a mainstay of the Israeli Air Force ever since. Since 2017 Israel has been considering buying new F-15s of the F-15EX variant. The deal only gained moment in the last year and a half. In June 2024 Israel also signed an agreement to buy a third squadron of F-35s. The agreement for the F-15s is 'part of a broader package of U.S. aid approved by the U.S. Administration and Congress earlier this year,' the Israeli Ministry of Defense noted. 'The new F-15IA aircraft will be equipped with cutting-edge weapon systems, including the integration of state of the art Israeli technologies. The upgraded aircraft will feature enhanced range capabilities, increased payload capacity, and improved performance across various operational scenarios,' the Ministry added. 'These advantages will enable the Israeli Air Force to maintain its strategic superiority in addressing current and future challenges in the Middle East.' Neither Boeing or the ministry elaborated on the statement or went into details about which Israeli systems might be incorporated into the aircraft. Israel has incorporated unique systems into its F-35 Adir. Zamir, the Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, praised the F-15 deal. 'We have secured procurement agreements worth nearly $40 billion (approximately NIS 150 billion) since the onset of the war. While focusing on immediate needs for advanced weaponry and ammunition at unprecedented levels, we're simultaneously investing in long-term strategic capabilities,' he said. He noted that the new squadron of F-15s and the new third squadron of F-35s Israel agreed to buy earlier this year 'represents a historic enhancement of our air power and strategic reach &#8211; capabilities that proved crucial during the current war.' Israel’s Calcalist reported that the new jets are meant to replace aging fighters, such as legacy F-15s and F-16s.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-signs-5-2-billion-deal-for-25-american-f-15s/	2024-11-07T14:05:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241107_DVIDS_israeli_f15s_6916781-scaled-e1731016811525.jpg
A second Trump administration won’t be ‘automatic disaster’ for Ukraine, NATO: Analysts	Then-NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (L) shakes hands with Donald Trump (C), next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R), during a family photo as part of the NATO summit at the Grove hotel in Watford, northeast of London on December 4, 2019. (Christian Hartmann/Pool/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A shakeup to US and European relations is assured under a second Donald Trump administration, but several analysts say that does not necessarily spell doom for American support for Ukraine or Washington's future in NATO. 'It's essential for us to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in Ukraine, and what Trump means for that is still unclear,' John Herbst, former ambassador to Ukraine and senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, said today in a briefing with other Atlantic Council experts. Herbst said Trump's public praising comments about Putin and calls to end the war quickly could be balanced out by some of the voices in the president's inner circle, like Trump's former CIA Director Mike Pompeo and former National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, both of whom would likely push back on any plan to cut support for Kyiv. Herbst said the potential for criticism from Trump's own party 'will have an impact, because one thing [Trump] does not want to be is taken for weak men and giving Ukraine to Putin or facilitating Putin's control of Ukraine, which will lead only to worse things for the United States.' Both Matthew Kroenig, vice president for the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council, and Atlantic Council senior fellow Rachel Rizzo concurred with Herbst’s take, while also noting that they expect Trump to make an attempt at striking some sort of negotiated settlement right out of the gate. 'He'll want to start out his presidency looking like a leader on the world stage rather than handing Ukraine to Russia, and in turn, looking like a capitulator,' Rizzo said. 'And what that means for Ukraine, I think, we'll have to wait and see but I'm not as convinced &#8230; that his presidency spells an automatic disaster for our Ukrainian partners.' Trump’s return to the White House will not just mean a potential push for a negotiated settlement between Moscow and Kyiv, or change for US weapons flowing to Ukraine. World leaders are also preparing for what his second term will mean for NATO after he has spent years questioning the alliance's value and publicly bashing countries not meeting the 2 percent GDP defense spending goal. In the intervening years since his first White House tour and with a war on European soil, more countries are now hitting that target, and there are discussions on bumping that spending figure up towards the 3-percent range. With nine out of 32 countries still shy of that threshold, Rizzo speculated that the incoming administration could view NATO though as more of a series of bilateral security agreements based on defense spending, or if the nation’s leader holds a similar word view to Trump. Will that mean a two-tiered NATO system where the US is officially unwilling to defend countries not spending 2 percent of their GDP, as Trump has suggested? Kroenig said he doubts that would become a White House policy, in part, because of those rumored to be in Trump’s cabinet including the likes of O'Brien, Pompeo and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. But what the analysts did agree on is the pressure placed on new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to continue acting as the 'Trump whisperer' by playing up NATO’s importance and the steady march towards getting all members up towards the 2 percent GDP benchmark. 'That number is now at 23 — obviously that number should be at 32 — but Rutte needs to tell the story, and if part of that is allowing Trump to take credit for those defense spending increases, then I think that's fine, and I do think there is probably actually some truth to that,' she added. Rutte has already done just that when he publicly congratulated Trump for his reelection. 'When he was president he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2 percent and now also thanks to him, in NATO, if you take out the numbers of the US for a moment, is above the 2 percent and I think very much that is his doing, his success, and we need to do more,' Rutte said ahead of a meeting of the European Political Community.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/a-second-trump-administration-wont-be-automatic-disaster-for-ukraine-nato-analysts/	2024-11-07T11:55:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241107_trump_nato_GettyImages-1186403739-scaled-e1731005326780.jpg
Canada inks $1.85 billion CAD deal with Lockheed for Halifax-class frigate support	Royal Canadian Navy Halifax-class frigate HMCS Regina (FFH 334) transits with the amphibious transport dock ship USS Green Bay (LPD 20) in a photo exercise (PHOTOEX) during Talisman Sabre 2019. (Photo by: HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) EURONAVAL 2024 — The Canadian government recently awarded Lockheed Martin Canada a contract valued at up to $1.85 billion Canadian dollars ($1.33 billion USD) for the continued combat system integration and in-service support of the Halifax-class frigates for their remaining operational lives. Glenn Copeland, general manager of rotary and mission systems for Lockheed’s Canada branch, told Breaking Defense here on Wednesday that Lockheed’s original long-term contract began in 2008 and ended recently. This new deal, he added, has options that persist through 2045, which is when the last frigate is expected to retire from the Royal Canadian Navy’s fleet. As the systems integrator, Lockheed's job and the contract's purpose centers around continually updating the software running the fleet's combat management system. 'The Royal Canadian Navy’s fleet of Halifax-class frigates are the backbone of maritime operations at home and abroad,' Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of national defence, said in the government's Oct. 31announcement. 'This in-service support contract will ensure our frigates remain operationally effective until the arrival of our future fleet of River-class destroyers.' RELATED: For US Navy's new frigate, design changes carry risks and rewards Lockheed's combat management system, dubbed CMS330, is proliferated throughout Canada’s fleet, but the new contract, also speaks to the state of the Royal Canadian Navy's fleet and the challenges its top admiral has bluntly acknowledged his force is faces. The Halifax class is considered an integral workhorse for the RCN’s operations. But with the first-in-class having entered the fleet in the 1990s and the last one needed to remain operational into the 2040s, Ottawa is endeavoring to keep that class online well past its original service life projecting its retirement in the 2030s. It’s a necessary measure until Canada brings online the Canadian Surface Combatant, its new warship that was recently named the River-class destroyer. That new class of ship is being built by Canada’s Irving Shipbuilding, which subcontracted Lockheed Martin for the design, a derivative of BAE Systems’ Type 26 Global Combat Ship. Copeland said the first three ships are under contract, and a second contract for another six is anticipated following a full-rate production decision later this year. The first ship is scheduled to be operational in the early 2030s. Lockheed's CMS330 combat management system will also be installed on the River class, which Copeland hopes will help to boost its reputation in an effort to sell it abroad in Europe. 'There’s a lot of countries out there right now that have either a MEKO-class or something similar that they want to modernize, plus a bunch of countries that are doing new hull construction warships that don’t' require the Aegis Combat System — a competing CMS also made by Lockheed that's favored by the US Navy but one that is a more expensive and niche capability compared to CMS330, he said. A 'MEKO' class of ships is a term that originates from German firm Blohm+Voss's family of warships that are multi-purpose in nature and focused on ease of maintenance and low cost. 'We’re on 42 platforms right now and I think in 10 years, we’ll be on well over 75,' Copeland added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/canada-inks-1-85-billion-cad-deal-with-lockheed-for-halifax-class-frigate-support/	2024-11-07T10:13:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/2411076_halifax_frigate_GettyImages-1354511708-scaled-e1730992861868.jpg
The right drone for special forces ISR: Mobile, long-range long-endurance, and a VTOL	Manufactured by Edge Autonomy, the VXE30 Stalker is the program-of-record platform for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PMA-263) long-range, long-endurance program. (Edge Autonomy photo). Whether the battlespace is on the European continent or islands in the Indo-Pacific, long-range, long-endurance reconnaissance has become a necessity for mobile and expeditionary operations. That means runway independent, Group 2 vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) platforms that operate from anywhere with a fixed wing for distance and time on station. These small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (sUAS) enable multi-domain operations and Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control (CJADC2), and are also reasons why the U.S. Army selected a VTOL aircraft for its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program. It’s also why the Army has said its Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) will be a VTOL, and why U.S. Marine Corps Littoral Regiments already employ such ISR systems to delay, degrade, and deny adversary aggression. 'In the past, operators would have an AC-130, F-16, or a Reaper nearby that they could call in for ISR and support,' said Allen Gardner, Chief Technology Officer for Edge Autonomy. 'Now, the modern battlefield requires operators to go in alone with all their own capability, oftentimes without air support. On covert and sometimes clandestine operations, they need to carry an entire airborne ISR capability. Being fully capable without support is the new, modern way of doing business, at least for the special operations community.' They demand a platform that can provide a full-scope solution that is light, mobile, flexible, and portable, an aircraft with a small logistics footprint that can launch vertically from a rooftop or alleyway, fly hundreds of kilometers to perform a mission, and fly back intact. That’s an accurate description of what Edge Autonomy provides to the Marines and special forces in the form of the VXE30 Stalker, a Group 2 UAS VTOL platform for long-endurance, long-range mission support. Silent Stalker Manufactured by Edge Autonomy, the VXE30 Stalker is the program-of-record platform for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PMA-263) long-range, long-endurance program. The VXE30 is also flying with U.S. Army Special Operations Command and special forces with Five Eyes (FVEY) countries. In addition, the VXE30 is part of the UK MoD’s plan to bring a new generation of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) UAS into the British Army through the TIQUILA program. 'What we’re seeing is an expansion in the role of small UAS beyond ISR,' said Joshua Stinson, Chief Growth Officer for Edge Autonomy. 'You're adding a kinetic delivery capability, a COMINT collection capability, and forward observer roles for precision fire correction – all at a high TRL (technology readiness level) and MRL (manufacturing readiness level).' Powered by either a solid oxide fuel cell or a rechargeable battery, the VXE30 Stalker provides the endurance needed to complete complex aerial operations. The whole system can be set up and flying in 20 minutes by a crew of two and is packed in ruggedized containers that are small enough to be transported in a single minivan, pickup truck, or helicopter. A payload-agnostic platform built with a modular open systems approach (MOSA), the VXE30 Stalker can be equipped for advanced ISR missions with EO/IR payloads for observation, inspection, and surveillance capabilities such as day and nighttime object tracking and small moving target indication. With a ruggedized and field-proven solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the Stalker can carry out long-range missions under even the most challenging circumstances. 'Our operators – and this is something that's been developed over 10 years and refined with the Marine Corps, especially MARSOC – can take dirty propane from any barbecue stand in a remote, austere location and fly the aircraft for eight hours,' said Stinson. The Havoc configuration of the VXE30 improves a variety of subsystems related to fuel efficiency, resulting in a doubling of the flight endurance and payload capacity of the base Stalker platform. (Edge Autonomy photo). Wreaking Havoc The demand signal from special forces and others is for more long-range reconnaissance capabilities in a small form factor and minimal logistics footprint. Edge Autonomy has met that challenge through the recent introduction of the Havoc configuration for the VXE30 Stalker, which has been deployed on six continents and proven in all theaters through more than 100,000 flight hours. Havoc improves a variety of subsystems related to fuel efficiency, and Edge Autonomy’s efforts have resulted in a doubling of the flight endurance and payload capacity of the base VXE30 platform. 'Blurring the distinction between the capabilities of small and large UAS, the Havoc configuration is a direct response to the mission requirement for long-range reconnaissance, which is slightly different from long-endurance reconnaissance,' said Gardner. 'You need endurance to achieve the range. But endurance combined with payload capacity combined with a beyond-line-of-sight communications capacity enables extraordinary range.' Without altering the VXE30’s configuration or changing its logistics footprint, Edge Autonomy has also tripled the payload capacity through the addition of wing tanks. With the Havoc configuration, Stalker can now fly hundreds of kilometers deep into terrain to perform missions, but still retain the all-electric silent profile and the small logistics footprint that makes the VXE30 platform the desired solution for these operators. The Havoc configuration has also demonstrated the ability to launch first-person-view drones from customized wing mounts. Said Stinson: 'That's another way to present a short-range capability while using a long-range aircraft as a delivery mechanism.' Where Group 2 UAS excel The impacts of small UAS on the battlefield in Ukraine – across air, ground, and maritime domains – have exposed a greater need for long-range, long-endurance ISR and targeting, not only there but in numerous other European and Scandinavian NATO countries that share borders with Russia. To secure, monitor, and react to such threats, platforms like Edge Autonomy’s VXE30 Stalker and Penguin C VTOL – with an endurance of up to 25 hours and line-of-sight range of 180 km – have shown themselves to be force multipliers. 'Previously, in order to get the kind of sensing capabilities that are needed, you had to have a large aircraft like a Reaper or Global Hawk that flies from a runway and can carry a heavy payload,' said Gardner. 'Sensors have been miniaturized now and it's amazing the sensing capabilities we can put on these platforms. 'When you can fly silent and can bring powerful sensors into the target, underneath the cloud deck, close proximity, low altitude, and be silent and covert, you can perform the missions in many ways more effectively than you can with a larger platform.' Large Group 4 and 5 platforms are non-factors in arenas like Ukraine because of contested environments and sophisticated air defenses on the modern battlefield. Those threats are even blocking Group 3 UAS from operating, creating a unique opportunity for a Group 2 platform that is light and mobile while still able to perform many of the same missions as the larger platforms. For example, the Group 2 VXE30 Stalker Havoc configuration can fly from the Philippines to the Spratly Islands to monitor the area with time on station. That’s a capability previously unheard of for a Group 2 aircraft. For a mission like that, the U.S. and Australian navies would typically use a much larger and costlier MQ-4C Triton. When it comes to long-range, long-endurance ISTAR, small UAS are following the familiar pattern of regular advancements in computing, communications, and sensors. That’s why special forces around the world are quickly realizing how much more they can accomplish with small platforms.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/the-right-drone-for-special-forces-isr-mobile-long-range-long-endurance-and-a-vtol/	2024-11-07T09:26:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/vlcsnap-2023-01-25-09h34m31s9591.png
US Air Force hit 2024 recruiting goal by meeting Americans where they are, not lowering standards	Pentagon Press Secretary US Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder conductions mediation for the fiscal year 2025 recruiting discussion panel at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Oct. 30, 2024. (DoD photo by US Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders) In today’s strong economy, recruiting successfully for the all-volunteer United States Air Force means overcoming strong and persistent headwinds. The challenges aren’t hard to find. Low unemployment, competitive private sector wages and benefits, and broader societal shifts such as the legalizing of marijuana and rising obesity rates, to name a few, make a complex job even harder. That reality is why we are proud that the US Air Force not only met our 27,200 active duty enlisted recruiting goal for this year, opening the aperture for more high-quality recruits to join in the future, but we also achieved it ahead of schedule. This stands in stark contrast to 2023 when the Air Force missed its goal of 26,877 new recruits. But as important as the raw number is — and it is important — this year’s success highlights a lesser known but equally important story about the way the Department of the Air Force looked at the world as it is and moved decisively to eliminate out-of-date and indefensible barriers that blocked capable recruits from joining the service. For example, while our standards for physical fitness and health remain rigorous, some policies persisted solely due to the 'way things have always been done' mentality. Recognizing we were denying enlistment into the Air Force for things like certain tattoos or body fat composition, we optimized these policies without diluting the qualities and capabilities we need in each recruit. In the real world it means we are no longer instantly rejecting smart and physically fit recruits simply because they have a small tattoo on the back of a hand — something that was happening just last year and conveyed to young Americans that our entry standards were out of sync with our nation’s current cultural norms. We also instituted a two-year pilot program allowing recruits who tested positive for THC at entry a chance to retest after 90 days. Unlike before when they would be forever banned after failing the first test, if they pass the second and meet all other requirements, they are provided an opportunity to complete basic training and ultimately join the Air Force. This common-sense change is a clear example of how we are adapting to a reality in which 24 states have now legalized the recreational use of marijuana, not to mention the ever-expanding variety of over-the-counter products that include various levels of THC. It’s important to recognize that amid these changes, there are aspects of recruiting that have not changed. Most importantly, we have not lowered the high standards required for Air Force and Space Force recruits. Nor does purposefully seeking to recruit any American interested, willing and capable to serve mean we’ve embraced shortcuts or polices not rooted in data and clear-eyed analysis. In fact, of the 5,800 recruits who were accepted under our updated body composition standard, only one failed to meet the physical fitness test required to graduate basic training. One other element that hasn’t changed is the dedication and prowess of our active duty and reserve recruiters stationed in communities across America. Over the course of the last year, we made training more focused and refined while also providing additional support not just to recruiters but to their families as well. Despite this year’s achievement, we are not taking our eye off the ball. We continue exploring new ideas for attracting qualified individuals to careers in our high-tech force. We are looking at ways, for example, to provide resources and time for those coming to us without a driver’s license to obtain one at their first duty station, rather than turn them away from certain career fields. We need everyone, whether they are destined to fly supersonic airplanes, to test and maintain them, or to take mission enabling roles as cyber warriors, trauma doctors and nurses, search and rescue specialists, law enforcement investigators, among many others. We understand too that with an ever-increasing military-civilian divide, we need to find ways to educate — and even excite — the public about the Air Force and what military service means. We must do even more to reconnect with young people where they are and find new ways to engage those with the greatest influence on their futures: their parents, coaches, teachers, guidance counselors, and even social media creators. We will continue to invest in growing propensity to serve — telling our story in new places and to people that haven’t heard it before — rather than just bemoaning it. Due to rapid technological change and our focus on great power competition, the Air Force in 10 or 20 years from now won’t look like the Air Force of today. But the one constant is this: Without the best people to operate and support our platforms, the edge we enjoy against our competitors and adversaries diminishes. Only when we can leverage the unique talents and skills of every community in America can we be ready for the threats our nation faces around the world. Winning future wars on a distant battlefield starts by winning the war for talent here at home. That means we need to enable the next generation to see uniformed service for the lifechanging opportunity it truly is, not from afar, or just in a museum, but in their lived experiences, no matter who they are.

Fincantieri openly eyeing Germany’s TKMS, even if deal not close	Italy's Fincantieri displays models from its military product line at Euronaval (Breaking Defense) EURONAVAL 2024 — The head of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri says the company is 'giving our availability' to the German government as Berlin looks to secure the sale of Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) in the wake of US investment firm Carlyle withdrawing interest. Fincantieri CEO Pierroberto Folgiero told reporters at Euronaval that 'We don't have numbers, we don't have business plans,' because a valorization process 'unlocking the value' of TKMS has to first run its course. 'It's a very strategic and intuitive exercise. Numbers will follow,' he added. 'We are at the disposal of the German system as a commercial partner, as an industrial partner, depending on their strategy &#8230; we are giving our availability because we believe that from an industrial perspective, it will make huge sense.' He also spoke in positive terms about Fincantieri's 25 years of collaboration with TKMS, adding, 'We know each other, we have a high respect of the management, respect of the product. Enhancing European collaboration, enhancing defragmentation &#8230; is what Europe needs.' The TKMS surface range includes Class 123, 124, 125 frigates, Class 130 corvettes and MEKO vessels. It also builds the Type 212CD submarine on order by Germany and Norway as part of a six ship deal agreed on in 2021 and valued at approximately €5.5 billion ($5.9 billion). TKMS's financial records also indicate that it holds backlog orders worth €11.8 billion. In October, TKMS CEO Oliver Burkhard said on LinkedIn that Thyssenkrupp had been notified of Carlyle’s decision to 'no longer pursue the valuation process for a possible partial sale' of the German naval business, before stressing that the move from the would-be buyer had 'nothing to do with the quality and financial performance of our company.' Fincantieri's newly released PPA Evo multipurpose combat ship features an array of armaments to support Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions (Breaking Defense) Based on confidentiality limitations, Burkhard did not outline why Carlyle walked away. The Financial Times reported that the decision was linked to German government 'indecision and scepticism,' around the prospect of a private equity firm taking on a major, local defense company. Burkhard also shared on social media that talks between TKMS and the German government have not finished. TKMS declined to comment. Parent company Thyssenkrupp has a long history of attempting to sell off its naval division, including rejecting past Fincantieri proposals and passing on interest from France's Naval Group, according to German business newspaper Handelsblatt. Elsewhere, Fincantieri launched a new version of its PPA multipurpose combat ship at Euronaval, dubbed PPA Evo, brought to market to deal with emerging threats and distinguished by a modular and reconfigurable design. The ship can accommodate 64 vertical launcher systems, eight anti-ship missiles, two 76mm guns, secondary 30/40mm Close in Weapon System (CIWS) guns, and can also host one Leonardo AW101 helicopter and one NH90 helicopter or a pair of NH90s, according to a company presentation. The integration of adaptable mission bays also enables the platform to deploy UAVs, UUVs and USVs. A virtual Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) suite mock up shared with media also showed off a range of subsystems for detecting and engaging threats, including a combat management system, dual band radar, Infrared Search and Track (IRST) applications, Omega360 radar, a fire control radar and a decoy launching system. Lead time for construction, between initial steel cutting through to delivery is expected to last between 48-50 months, said Roberto Olivari, senior vice president of naval vessel development and military innovation and research at Fincantieri. Italy has ordered seven PPAs but plans on acquiring an additional two, designed to the Evo standard, to make up for two vessels that are committed to Indonesia, following a €1.2 billion deal with Jakarta announced in March.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/fincantieri-openly-eyeing-germanys-tkms-even-if-deal-not-close/	2024-11-07T06:30:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/IMG_2233-1-scaled-e1730890343210.jpg
AUKUS faces little threat from Trump, Aussie officials say	Royal Australian Navy Collins-class submarines are set to be replaced in the 2040's by a UK designed SSN AUKUS fleet. (Australia DoD) CANBERRA — Senior Australian officials declared their relations with the United States sound in the wake of the victory of president-elect Donald Trump, dismissing concerns that the tripartite enterprise of AUKUS would be harmed. 'AUKUS is in the strategic benefit and interest of Australia, the United States and the UK. That's the fundamental point here,' Defense Minister Richard Marles told a small group of reporters at the Submarine Institute of Australia conference two days before the election. 'And that will continue to be the case at the end of this week as it is at the beginning. And we're really clear, in all the engagement we've had in the United States, that whoever wins the United States election this week understands that.' Marles pointed to the bipartisan support for AUKUS demonstrated by Congress. 'And it's not a guess. We've got a voting record. When you look at the way in which Democrats, Republicans — Trump Republicans — voted in the Congress at the end of last year in support of AUKUS, it was across the political spectrum,' he said. 'So we do have a sense of confidence that, going forward, this is a program that will be supported in the United States, as it will in the UK, as it will here.' Following the election, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Trump to offer his congratulations. 'We talked about the importance of the Alliance, and the strength of the Australia-US relationship in security, AUKUS, trade and investment,' he said in a tweet. 'I look forward to working together in the interests of both our countries.' Similarly, Foreign Minister Penny Wong extended the traditional congratulations to Trump on his election and said Canberra expects to work 'very closely' with the Trump administration. The morning after the election, she said, 'I think that this is an alliance that is bigger than any individual, that is bigger than any past comments, that is about the big issues that we face as a nation, as a region and as a globe. I have confidence that just as different [US] administrations and different Australian Governments have worked together, we will work very closely with the Trump Administration to deliver on things that are very important to Australia, including the AUKUS pact.' The Green Party here called again for Australia to exit AUKUS, a move Wong dismissed with prejudice. 'Well, the Greens continue to demonstrate their irresponsibility over and over again, but I would say this to Australians. First, remember what AUKUS is about, assuring the peace. It's about deterrence to assure the peace in a contested region,' she said, in a veiled reference to China's actions in the east and South China seas. 'Secondly, the capability we gain under the submarines to be delivered under AUKUS is a sovereign capability. And the alliance matters to Australia's interests. We are confident of our ability to continue to navigate these times, and I don't think that the Greens’ approach is a responsible one.' While AUKUS may be secure, there is likely to be a divide between the Albanese and Trump governments on another major issue with both economic and national security concerns: climate change. The strategically important Pacific Islands are at risk of, in some cases, total destruction as a result of climate change, meaning it is an existential issue for those governments. The American president-elect has pledged to pull out again from the Paris Agreement, the key international climate agreement. Much of the Australian public and its leaders take the issue of climate change seriously, domestically and in terms of foreign policy and national security, so how Australia copes with Trump's overall stance on climate change has become a hot topic this week. 'President Trump has campaigned on change. We shouldn't be surprised if there's change,' Wong told reporters today, according to a government transcript. 'One of the areas we know from the previous Trump Administration, as they did withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Australia didn't, because we don't believe it's in our national interest. You said, what is the point? Apart from the imperative of climate change, there is the imperative of the economic transition. We are going to have to be able to prosper in a world where many and much of the global economy is moving to net zero.' While she didn't mention the Pacific Islands, they will be watching.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aukus-faces-little-threat-from-trump-aussie-officials-say/	2024-11-07T05:15:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/20210212ran8108462_0099.t603ea3e9.m1200.x6jJkBKr4jkU3jQUm-e1679311612363.jpg
Aussies must be more open about AUKUS, work with communities, officials and experts say	Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles at biennial Submarine Institute of Australia conference. (Nic Douglas) CANBERRA — Australia's military and its ministers need to share more information with the public and press about the AUKUS plan for Australia to buy and build nuclear-powered attack submarines, key members of the coalition said Wednesday, in what would represent a shift in how the government here tends to interact with the public on defense issues. The defense minister, the UK high commissioner to Australia and a raft of industry experts spoke at the biennial Submarine Institute of Australia conference here and urged the government and military to reach out to the Australian public, especially communities that will be shaped by the vast effort, estimated to cost $368 billion AUD over the next 50 years. 'There needs to be a holding to account of government, of people sitting in this chair, constantly,' said Defense Minister Richard Marles. 'That needs to be done with intelligence, clearly, but please bring that intelligence to the table&#8230;..We need to know where balls have been dropped, where cracks are opening up. We need to know that so that we're doing everything we can to pick them up again, to fill in those cracks, to make sure that we are able to keep this thing on track. 'We are not going to get through this without intense scrutiny, so give it to us,' he said. Support for the AUKUS plan has slipped by 5 percent since it was announced three years ago and public criticism and questioning of the effort has ramped up over the last year. Australia 'has been a little bit slow off the mark,' in communicating with the public about AUKUS,' Tracey Hanley, deputy director of the Defense Research Institute at University of New South Wales and one of Australia's leading nuclear experts, told Breaking Defense at the conference. 'However, that is gaining traction now, and we need to get the media behind why AUKUS is so important to our nation, and that then brings people alongside, because they are starting to hear why it's so important.' Hanley added, 'Openness on things that they can be open about is absolutely crucial for gaining valid social license in the community.' While a more open approach to public information sounds good on paper, that will still require a cultural shift. A more typical approach to the media was seen at the beginning of the conference, when the head of the Royal Australian Navy chastised coverage of both the current fleet of Collins-class boats and of AUKUS. News broke last week about the fact that only one of the Collins subs was able to go to sea. (The Department of Defense later issued a statement that a second boat could sail if necessary.) 'They are meeting the operational requirements of the Australian navy,' Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said of the Collins. 'You don’t see the headlines in the media when we have two submarines at sea at the same time, as we did just a few months ago. Or, when two subs are operating thousands of miles from home port as I ordered just a few months ago.' He cited what he called a 'pattern of criticism' of the sub fleet and the prospects of AUKUS. 'To the critics I say, where we have succeeded in the past we will again.' One expert at the conference, who asked not to be identified, mocked Hammond's comments, noting that what he had described were basic requirements for the fleet. Also, the expert said, how could it be reported when the Navy had never told reporters about it. The British High Commissioner, Vicki Treadwell, told the audience of several hundred uniformed and civilian gathered that 'a big part' of what they could do 'outside this room' would be to pursue the 'social license' because 'this new endeavor for Australia requires the Australian people to believe in it, to understand its strategic importance.' Social license is a collection of techniques to inform, reassure and engage the public in complex and, in the eyes of some, potentially dangerous projects they might otherwise support. The UK envoy added, 'You all have friends, you all have families. You all have children. Talk about this endeavor in a positive and constructive sense, to explain why Australia is pursuing this. It's not the job of government alone. Referencing local media questioning whether the recent fire at one of Britain's nuclear submarine yards had derailed or delayed the AUKUS effort, Treadwell said, 'There is a role for the media to tell the right story — not to look for the sensational aspect of the fire, but to talk about the jobs and to talk about the new technology that will be transformational.' (BAE Systems issued a statement saying the fire had 'limited impact.') She also gave the example of how British communities near naval bases, once engaged, help improve security by reporting suspicious activity to the military. An intriguing idea was mentioned by the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy. After comparing AUKUS in complexity and daring to the moonshot proposed by her father, President John F. Kennedy, Kennedy briefly discussed the idea of an AUKUS visa after noting challenges to the US sub industrial base. 'We need to expand and strengthen collaboration between governments, industry, academia, to speed up and truly support a trilateral submarine industrial base and put more allied, conventionally armed, nuclear powered submarines to achieve one of AUKUS' greatest and most enduring benefits, the ability to leverage the manufacturing capabilities of all three nations for our common benefit,' Kennedy said. 'Right now, America's sub industrial defense industrial base is challenged. We can't produce all the components needed to construct submarines. We need Australian companies to get into the Virginia-class vendor base. Currently, only a handful are going through the defense industry vendor qualification process, and we need more of you to do that.' Asked about the idea of an 'AUKUS visa' during a brief chat with reporters at the conference, Marles said 'certainly we need to be looking at ways in which we can have an easier facilitated movement of people between our three countries who are working on this program. We are working with the governments of the US and the UK to look at how that can be done.' He pointed to the fact Australian submariners and industry personnel are now working in both the US and UK.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aussies-must-be-more-open-about-aukus-work-with-communities-officials-and-experts-say/	2024-11-06T23:01:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Credit-Nic-Douglass-@sailorgirlhq-1349-e1730904051669.jpeg
Space Force expands Commercial Integration Cell for industry cooperation	US Space Force Lt. Gen Douglas A. Schiess, US Space Forces &#8211; Space Commander; and US Space Command’s Combined Joint Force Space Component Commander, speaking at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (Photo credit: John Ayre, USSPACECOM) WASHINGTON — The US Space Force's key forum for interacting with commercial space operators is expanding both in number and in mission areas, according to a senior service official. Lt. Gen. Doug Schiess, double-hatted as commander of Space Forces-Space (S4S) and the Combined Joint Force Space Component, told the Mitchell Institute today that the Commercial Integration Cell (CIC) has added five members. Two additional companies are in the process of joining and should be on board by early next year, he said. '[O]n the commercial side, we are continually trying to up our game in the commercial world,' Schiess stressed. S4S is the Space Force's component command for providing forces to US Space Command (SPACECOM). Established as a service field command in 2023, S4S 'exercises operational control of USSF forces conducting protect, defend, and deliver missions, and when delegated, tactical control of other service forces conducting these missions,' according to a command fact sheet [PDF]. The Combined Joint Force Component Command, headquartered at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., was established last December to consolidate 'authority over all space forces presented by the services' to SPACECOM. 'As of October 2024, there are currently 15 CIC commercial mission partners. This includes 10 legacy partners (Hughes, SpaceX, XTAR, Inmarsat, Viasat, Eutelsat, SES, Maxar, Iridium, Intelsat) and five new partners (BlackSky, Kratos, Leolabs, ICEYE and Telesat),' a Space Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense today. 'Hawkeye 360 and Exoanalytic have agreed to join, and we look forward to welcoming them to the CIC in the future,' the spokesperson added. According to a Space Force announcement released today, the CIC 'enables operational and technology exchange' between SPACECOM and commercial partners. 'This real-time and near real-time information flow allows for rapid, informed response to space events and improves Space Domain Awareness,' the release added. Up to now, the CIC partners have primarily provided satellite communications and imagery, the Space Force announcement noted. But the additional firms now bring 'an expansion of mission areas these partners support to include Space Domain Awareness and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance,' the release said. BlackSky, ICEYE and Hawkeye 360 are all remote sensing companies that also have contracts with the National Reconnaissance Office to provide imagery. Kratos and Telesat are satellite communications companies. Both Leolabs and Exoanalytic are companies that monitor the heavens. Interestingly, SPACECOM also recently announced that its multinational Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell, originally created to improve space domain awareness via unclassified commercial data, also has expanded its mission to include tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking (Tac-SRT). The JCO is a new name as of last December for the Joint Task Force-Space Defense Commercial Operations created by SPACECOM in 2020. It now involves 14 countries plus NATO, and gets commercial data and analytical products via the Unified Data Library, head of JCO Barbara Golf explained using a slide presentation. Commercial firms are given contracts to provide data to populate the library, which then can be used by US and allied military operators based on the terms of those contracts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/space-force-expands-commercial-integration-cell-for-industry-cooperation/	2024-11-06T11:20:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Lt.-Gen.-Doug-Schiess-scaled-e1730917788621.jpeg
Army’s FLRAA fuselage production staying in Kansas, Bell announces	Bell's V-280 Valor tiltrotor won the US Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition. (Bell) WASHINGTON — In a win for the aerospace workforce of Wichita, Bell Textron unveiled plans to keep the US Army’s new Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) fuselage production in the city despite moving work in house, the company announced today. 'As Bell prepares for the next stage of FLRAA’s engineering and manufacturing development phase, we are committed to investing in advanced manufacturing to ensure we deliver exceptional performance at an affordable cost to our customer,' Bell President and CEO Lisa Atherton said in a short statement. 'Textron has a rich history with the state of Kansas as well as the city of Wichita, and we are proud to deepen that relationship as we establish this new facility.' Two Kansas lawmakers — Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Ron Estes — praised that decision, with Moran calling it a 'historic day.' Additional fuselage work, the company added, will take place in Texas before the aircraft is assembled in Amarillo. In late 2022, Bell beat out a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky to win the high-profile FLRAA competition. At the time, Army officials said the contract was worth $1.3 billion but could end up being in the range of $70 billion if contract options and export opportunities emerge. For its part, the Army has kept the program moving forward, announcing in August that it had greenlit the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase after receiving Milestone B approval. Bell Textron is now working on getting the first FLRAA prototype up in the air in 2026 before entering low-rate initial production in 2028 and ready for first fielding in 2030. And for now, Army officials tell Breaking Defense that despite the fuselage shakeup, that plan is on track. 'We’re ahead of that problem. It’s already been worked out,' Army acquisition head Doug Bush told Breaking Defense in early October. Days later, on the sidelines of the Association of the US Army annual conference, Program Executive Officer for Aviation Brig. Gen. David Phillips provided some additional details about the revamped plan. 'We believe that we’ve had very transparent discussions &#8230; with our OEM [original equipment manufacturer], and throughout the process, we're looking at every critical path item. The fuselage is not a critical path item. There's other items that are in the critical path to get the flight test,' the one-star general told Breaking Defense. 'They have a lot of experience with composite fuselages, and so they're going to use their experience to potentially design it… more modular,' he said of Bell Textron. 'That way, if there's parts of that fuselage that are ready earlier, you can go ahead and get it down to the production facility and not have to wait for the entire fuselage to be ready all at one.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/armys-flraa-fuselage-production-staying-in-kansas-bell-announces/	2024-11-06T10:57:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Valor-pic1.jpg
Saab makes play into autonomy software market aimed at unmanned ships	Saab's Enforcer-3 is a modified CB-90 combat boat equipped with various autonomy and sensing capabilities. (Photo provided by Saab.) EURONAVAL 2024 — Swedish defense contractor Saab is throwing its hat into the market of maritime autonomy software, debuting its new 'Autonomous Ocean Core' designed to offer navies the ability to command and control surface and subsurface platforms from afar — as far as the city of Paris sits from the islands off the coast of Sweden. 'Autonomous Ocean Core can boost key operational strengths for the dull, dirty, dangerous and dear. This control system gives our customers a tactical edge, increasing availability and efficiency and becoming less dependent on active manpower,' said Mats Wicksell, senior vice president and head of Saab’s business area Kockums. The Swedish company’s pitch, as Saab’s engineers describe it, is that AOC is capable of being integrated into any small or medium vessel — regardless of whether that boat was designed to be an unmanned platform — and turn it into it a remote-controlled craft that can be operated from ship or ashore. RELATED: How Saab is betting big on its C71 &#8216;Expeditionary' subs to win Canadian contest During the Euronaval exposition here in Paris, company officials showed potential customers, and an international group of reporters, a brief demonstration featuring a CB90 fast assault craft stationed in waters north of Sweden’s coastline, in the ballpark of 1,800 kilometers away. The craft, guided by the AOC software and being filmed by a small aerial drone, performed a handful of maneuvers including transiting around the complicated terrain and thousands of islands scattered off Sweden’s mainland. 'The autonomy and the core technologies for this is something that fits very well for us when it comes to what we also have been working with over a number of years with lean manning to make sure that the armed forces can do more using less people,' Lars Brännström, a Saab executive overseeing Kockums shipyard, said. 'We have this demonstrated in the highly advanced Visby stealth corvettes, our submarines and a number of different products.' While officials were tight-lipped about specific sales, the Stockholm-based company’s most natural customer, the Swedish Armed Forces, have already conducted trials with Saab’s Enforcer-3, a CB90 craft that was modified with autonomy software to experiment with how it could be used as an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance asset. Peter Karlström, the project manager for AOC at Saab, told Breaking Defense that while Enforcer-3's initial demonstrations with the Swedish military pre-dates AOC, that craft and others in Saab's inventory have since been updated with various baselines of the newer software. The trend of interest into unmanned and autonomous vessels has been a theme in recent years for both for the US Navy and its industrial base, as well as European militaries and their respective contractors. Just here in Paris this week, Naval Group, the state-owned French shipbuilder unveiled its first unmanned surface vessel designed, much like Saab’s Enforcer-3, to act as a detachable ISR asset alongside manned warships.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/saab-makes-play-into-autonomy-software-market-aimed-at-unmanned-ships/	2024-11-06T09:50:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Enforcer-3-scaled-e1666196418692.jpg
After USV export deal with Qatar, Turkish defense exec sees interest from ‘all the world’	A model of an ULAQ unmanned surface vessel sits on display at the Meteksan booth at DIMDEX 2024. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Fresh off signing a deal to export an armed, unmanned maritime surface vessel to Qatar, a senior executive at the Turkish defense firm Meteksan said demand is only growing. 'All the world is now much interested in attaining such unmanned surface vessels or unmanned maritime technology,' Meteksan’s Vice Chairman of the Board Selçuk Kerem Alparslan told Breaking Defense in an interview. Last week Meteksan inked a deal with the Qatari Coast Guard to export the ULAQ 11 USV — so named for being 11 meters long — which was developed alongside Turkey's ARES Shipyard, what Alparslan described as a first for Turkey. The contract will be executed in two phases, he said: a 12-month training phase and then a procurement phase. The training phase, with 'direct assistance to the customer,' has already started, after the first vessel was delivered during the Milipol conference last week. 'The second [phase] covers the actual ULAQ 11 PSV boats and command-control infrastructure,' Alparslan said. 'Therefore, Qatar's Coast Guard will have been immediately involved in attaining the unmanned technology capability.' The ULAQ 11 PSV (Port Security Vessel), will be dedicated to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions to aid in protecting critical infrastructure, according to Meteksan, though the company says it can also conduct other law enforcement activities, immediate response or search and rescue. The platform is equipped with a 12.7 mm automatic weapon system, radar and electrooptical system, encrypted communication systems, command and control station and autonomy software. It can sail up to 400 miles and is equipped with a number of link modalities on top of which is the line of sight data link and satellite links, the company said. The Meteksan official declined to disclose the value of the deal or the number of vessels contracted, but he said that the system was tested with Qatari officials in Turkey first, according to the Qatari requirements, and the platform structure has been verified by Qatar. 'With this export, we are acquiring products that are adapted to different seas and are further developed and recognized. We are moving forward with great motivation to continue bringing our customers technologies and capabilities that make a difference in this field,' Alparslan said. He specifically pointed to Gulf nations as further potential customers. To meet the demand, he said the company is 'coming up with new versions, new platform sizes, with new payloads for different missions. The most attractive mission nowadays is using these unmanned systems as one way-attack missile-like instruments on the sea or open seas and using swarming capabilities will be defense capability multiplier.' The export deal with Qatar comes as Turkish defense industry is witnessing increased export revenues of $820 million in October, a 61 percent increase compared to October 2023, according to a post by the secretary of Turkish defense industries Haluk Gorgun.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-usv-export-deal-with-qatar-turkish-defense-exec-sees-interest-from-all-the-world/	2024-11-06T08:50:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241106_meteksan_ulaq_model_HELOU-scaled-e1730907545792.jpg
HII’s Wilkinson to take over as Newport News Shipbuilding chief in 2025; Boykin to retire	A part of CVN-80's aft is held in place by Newport News Shipbuilding's towering crane, nicknamed 'Big Blue.' PARIS — American shipbuilding giant HII announced today that Kari Wilkinson will take the reigns at the company’s Newport News shipyard next year, with long-time executive Jennifer Boykin set to retire following a 37-year career. Wilkinson currently oversees HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, based in Mississippi and most widely known for producing the US Navy's destroyers and amphibs, and has been in that role since 2021. She will be succeeded by Brian Blanchette, who has served as vice president of quality and engineering at Ingalls since 2021. Boykin has been president of HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding since 2017. That yard is most widely known for being the sole prime contractor for the Navy’s aircraft carriers, as well as a key partner to General Dynamics in producing both the Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines. 'I have asked Jennifer to stay on in an advisory capacity through March to support a seamless transition to Kari,' HII CEO and President Chris Kastner said in a Nov. 6 statement. 'You will not find a more loyal advocate than Jennifer for her shipbuilders and the Hampton Roads community. Kari’s leadership has steered Ingalls Shipbuilding into its next phase of growth, having secured serial production contracts for both the destroyer and amphibious ship programs. She is a tremendous leader and now brings her great energy and expertise to Newport News.' The leadership change announcements come just days after the company was forced to report a bleak outlook to Wall Street, drastically reducing its projections for free cash flow in 2024 and mostly blaming those numbers on supply chain issues as well as the knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Asked about the announcement's timing, an HII spokesman told Breaking Defense today, 'The timing aligns with Jennifer’s retirement plans. HII has a long-term succession planning process working with our board of directors, and it was through that process that Kari Wilkinson and Brian Blanchette were elected. We are thankful for Jennifer’s 37 years of leadership and dedication — she will be greatly missed by shipbuilders and her colleagues across HII.' He added that Boykin provided the company notice of her intent to retire 'this year.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/hiis-wilkinson-to-take-over-as-newport-news-shipbuilding-chief-in-2025-boykin-to-retire/	2024-11-06T07:56:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/CVN80-Structure-scaled-e1661875696225.jpg
Trump admin will bring ‘uncertainty,’ opportunities for defense industry: Analysts	Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump takes the stage during a campaign rally at the Santander Arena on November 04, 2024 in Reading, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) EDITOR'S NOTE: A version of this story was published last week. With Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's election, we are republishing with updated commentary. WASHINGTON — A second Donald Trump administration will likely bring unpredictability in defense spending, but the final makeup of Congress will help drive the ultimate final number for the defense budget, analysts tell Breaking Defense. Trump's win over Vice President Kamala Harris is coming hand in hand with a takeover of the Senate. The House remains undecided, but even if Democrats take over the lower chamber, it seems likely to be with a razor thin edge. 'We have a [wide] range of uncertainty when it comes to Trump,' Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said ahead of the election. 'Under Trump, we could see a huge shift in strategy to become much more isolationist, which could end up bringing major changes in the defense budget and a drastic reduction in force structure.' At the same time, Harrison added, 'the makeup of Congress, and specifically the makeup of the House, I think will actually matter much more to the future of the defense budget than whoever the president is.' In a note to investors this morning, Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with TD Cowen, said the budget outlook for national security is still to be determined. However, he added that the 'first 100 days of the new Trump Administration could represent a major reset in foreign policy and defense spending,' with a Trump Pentagon likely positive for space, shipbuilding, missile defense and defense startups. Meanwhile, recent public comments by industry executives suggest they're confident the demand signal for their products will remain strong. The Republican platform includes a promise to 'prevent World War Three, restore peace in Europe and in the Middle East, and build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our entire country.' Throughout the campaign trail, Trump reiterated those statements, potentially setting the stage for greater missile defense investments. At the same time, he has questioned whether the US should remain in NATO, a longtime point of skepticism for the former president, who has hammered alliance members for failing to live up to the 2 percent GDP commitment for defense spending. Trump has also signaled that he would oppose further military aid for Ukraine unless it enters peace talks, and stated in September that Ukraine should have made 'concessions' to Russia to avoid war, according to the Associated Press. RELATED: How US election might impact stalled Saudi-Israeli normalization, arms sales to Gulf During an end of campaign rally at Madison Square Garden, Trump said he would strengthen and modernize the military, reiterating an old 2020 claim that he had 'rebuilt our military in total.' But Harrison said those comments are somewhat contradictory, leaving it unclear how much defense funding Trump believes is actually needed. 'If you've got all new equipment, why do you need to procure anything else?' Harrison said. 'Of course, it's laughably untrue what he said. But what if he actually believes it?' While Trump’s first term brought rising budgets and a renewed focus on China to the Pentagon, Trump himself was sometimes a turbulent influence on the department, with moments that included personally involving himself in contract negotiations for the F-35 and Air Force One, and unilaterally promising to cut the defense budget, only to reverse course and boost the budget after meeting with key defense leaders. That volatility makes it hard to know whether Trump is serious when he talks about leaving NATO or signaling that he could revoke support for Ukraine, analysts said. 'Maybe none of this happens. That is one view that, ‘Oh, this is just rhetoric,’' Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners said ahead of the election. 'But I think that there would be a pretty profound period of uncertainty until those answers are known.' Robert Stallard, an aerospace and defense analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said that a more isolationist United States under Trump would likely support a continued trend for increased defense spending in Europe. 'It could also see a more ‘Buy European’ approach to procurement. Other parts of the world lack this domestic option, and so we could see continue strong demand for US defense exports,' Stallard said in a note to investors this morning. He added that there is also 'a possibility' that Trump gets involved in 'defense contracting minutia,' as he did in his previous term. Speaking to Breaking Defense before the election, Schweizer was optimistic about defense investments under a Trump presidency, characterizing the Republican platform as 'very supportive of defense.' He added that prominent national security Republicans in Congress and within the administration would likely be supportive of increasing the base budget, though they may be less likely to approve supplemental spending like the foreign aid bill passed last spring, which approved additional funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and key US defense industrial base priorities. However, even if the Trump administration is broadly supportive of defense spending, other campaign priorities could have negative impacts on the defense industry, Callan said. For instance, plans to enact a 20 percent tariff on all imported goods could result in financial pressure on defense contracts. Another complication could be the potential creation of a new organization, the Department of Government Efficiency, centered on reducing federal spending, Callan said. Trump has said he would tap SpaceX founder Elon Musk to lead the new department, and Musk said last week he believed he could cut at least $2 trillion from the $7.3 trillion federal budget requested for FY25. 'When you start hearing those numbers get thrown around, it's like, if you think defense is going to be rising with a $2 trillion cut, it's not going to happen,' Callan said. 'Not that I think a $2 trillion cut is likely, but just this period of uncertainty about, well, what's going to happen?' Ahead of the election, Schweizer said the single best scenario for defense contractors is a Harris win, coupled with a Democratic House and Republican Senate. That permutation of what he called the 'congressional Rubik’s cube' couples Harris’s likely support for Ukraine and Israel with a pro-defense Senate and — most importantly — a House where the far-right Freedom Caucus would have little power to stymie military aid for supplemental spending, he said. The worst-case scenario, according to Harrison, is a narrow Republican majority in the House — something currently in play — 'because the Freedom Caucus will continue to hold defense hostage to try to give more spending cuts overall,' he said. Callan, in a Nov. 3 note to analysts, labeled a GOP sweep as the worst outcome for defense, noting that his view diverts sharply from other analysts who believe Republicans would serve up tax cuts and a larger defense budget. Callan disagreed, positing that tax cuts could drive up the federal deficit, potentially 'cast[ing]t a larger cloud over U.S. fiscal capacity for defense.' Although defense companies announced third quarter results in late October, just a couple weeks before Election Day, the subject of the next president largely flew under the radar during earnings calls with investors. 'Right now, the stocks are really trading on results,' Callan said. 'They don't appear to be looking beyond results and into election scenarios.' Even when pressed, executives haven’t drawn a distinction between how a Harris or Trump presidency could impact defense spending — at least not publicly. Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden said she didn’t expect a 'significant difference' in defense spending between a Trump or Harris administration during an earnings call last month. 'What we have seen over time is that the defense budget more reflects the threat environment than any particular administration change, and so we fully expect that again, this time,' she said. 'The national defense strategy has remained consistent over the past several years, in the last couple of administrations, and we believe that's because it is responsive to the emerging threats around the globe and focused on both deterring and defending. And in that regard, it's well aligned to the program portfolio that Northrop Grumman has.' Similar sentiments have been shared by Frank St. John, Lockheed Martin’s chief operating officer. During an August interview with Breaking Defense, St. John said that the Pentagon is experiencing 'a flat or a declining real purchasing power' relative to inflation, but added that it was too early to say how defense budget toplines could shape up over the next couple years. 'With regards to the election, we think that deterrence and deterrence capabilities are an enduring theme, regardless of which party is in the executive branch or who’s in control of Congress,' he said. 'And so we think our programs are well supported in the budget, and we’re looking forward to working with whatever the new administration looks like.' Other defense executives pointed to the uncertain political environment as a factor underlying more conservative projections about how business could fare in 2025 and beyond. Speaking to investors during an Oct. 19 earnings call, Leidos Chief Financial Officer Chris Cage said the company sees 'growth momentum' in its defense unit but wants to be 'cautious' about giving more exact financial guidance for 2025 until there is greater certainty on the outcome of the election and ongoing FY25 budget process. 'You look at the backdrop, we're clearly in an election year. There is a risk of … an extended CR and some disruption,' he said. 'If we get more clarity in the several months ahead, we'll be in a better position to refine that point of view going into the early part of next year.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/trump-admin-will-bring-uncertainty-opportunities-for-defense-industry-analysts/	2024-11-06T07:20:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/trump-flag-scaled-e1730902938445.jpg
Here’s how Congress’s biggest defense advocates fared in the 2024 election	U.S. Army Spc. Austin Fry, right, an infantryman with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, and Spc.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class R.J. Lannom Jr.) WASHINGTON — Donald Trump has decisively seized the presidency for a second time, a victory that could spell uncertainty for US relationships with Ukraine and NATO while also heralding a wider 'red wave' throughout government. Although results are still trickling in, the GOP has successfully taken control of the Senate. And while the House is still in play, Republicans are currently leading Democrats in terms of total seats flipped. Here are the big defense headlines from the 2024 election: In one of the tightest races of the night, Montana Democrat Sen. Jon Tester was defeated by Republican candidate Tim Sheehy, a Navy SEAL. Tester has fought for higher topline spending for defense during the FY 25 budget process, arguing that the lower funding levels mandated under the Fiscal Responsibility Act would create risk for military personnel and operations. Tester and Appropriations Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., worked across the aisle with Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican for the appropriations committee and defense subcommittee, to put forward a FY25 defense spending proposal that included $21 billion in emergency defense funds. Representing the state that is home to Malmstrom Air Force Base — one of the three bases that operate intercontinental ballistic missiles in the US northern tier — Tester is also known as a fierce advocate for the Sentinel ICBM program set to replace the aging Minuteman IIIs. Although Sheehy was leading the polls in the final days ahead of the election, the Navy SEAL faced questions about his military record, specifically on an injury he claimed he received in a firefight in Afghanistan, The Hill reported. On national security issues, Sheehy on his website that the United States must 'fund our military and stand strong against China, secure our southern border, and once again, make America energy dominant and independent.' The race between House Appropriations defense subcommittee chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif, and his Democratic challenger, Will Rollins, for California’s 41st district is still too close to call, with the Associated Press reporting a percentage point difference between the two candidates with 69 percent of votes reported in. Analysts view this race as a key battleground that could help determine which party will control the House moving forward. Calvert became chairman of the House appropriations defense subcommittee in 2023 following four years as its top Republican. Throughout the FY25 budget cycle, Calvert championed a defense spending proposal that hews to the budget caps set out by the Fiscal Responsibility Act and contains numerous conservative provisions on abortion, LGBTQ rights and climate change. He held a hard line against additional funding for Ukraine and a second Virginia-class submarine during committee deliberations of the bill, instead prioritizing increased funds for Israel, F-35s and counter-drug operations. During his two-year tenure as head of the House appropriations defense subcommittee, Calvert has promoted Silicon Valley defense startups and Pentagon organizations focused on technological innovation, such as the Defense Innovation Unit. In the FY24 defense budget, he proposed a $1 billion hedge portfolio managed by DIU, which would field low-cost munitions, satellites and drones — a mechanism Calvert wrote in a Breaking Defense op-ed could help change the Pentagon’s 'culture of risk-avoidance.' While defense issues were not a major focus of the race, Rollins — who Calvert previously defeated in 2022 — touted his work for the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, which led to the prosecutions of 'individuals illegally helping the Iranian and Chinese militaries,' according to his website. Sen. Deb Fischer, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee, successfully beat back Dan Osborn, an independent challenger whose shock victory would have threatened to turn the tide of the Senate. Fischer, who is also a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, is best known in the defense world for advocacy on modernizing all three legs of the nuclear triad, in particular her support for the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic system currently under development by the Air Force. As the likely pick to lead SASC’s strategic forces subcommittee under a Republican Senate, she would play a leading role in shaping the committee’s nuclear and space policy positions going forward. Fischer took office in 2013 and is the senior senator for Nebraska. As Osborn — a veteran of the Navy and the Nebraska Army National Guard — closed in on Fischer in the polls, he repeatedly refused to say whether he would caucus with Democrats or Republicans if elected, according to MSNBC. Osborn is critical of Pentagon waste and of lobbying efforts by defense contractors, and had instead pledged to raise pay for troops. 'From forty dollar hammers that cost ten bucks at the hardware store, to $10,000 switches that cost a couple hundred dollars to manufacture, price gouging is draining our military of the resources to defend this country. Meanwhile, military families struggle to put food on the table,' his website states. Rep. Don Bacon, who chairs the House Armed Services cyber, IT and innovation subcommittee, is currently leading in a tight race against Democratic challenger Tony Vargas for Nebraska’s 2nd district. The Cook Political Report had rated the race 'leans Democrat' in its latest Nov. 1 update, but the Associated Press currently has Bacon leading by almost 3 percent with 99 percent of votes counted. Bacon, who retired from the Air Force in 2014 as a brigadier general, was known in defense circles as one of Congress’s biggest advocates for the Air Force, with his background on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and electronic warfare often informing his questions during HASC hearings. He is also a strong voice on nuclear modernization, representing the district that is home to US Strategic Command and Offutt Air Force Base, and — unlike a large portion of House Republicans — has continued to support military aid for Ukraine. A moderate Republican, Bacon has been a HASC member since taking office in 2017. Vargas, a senator for Nebraska’s state legislature since 2017, said he would support military aid for Ukraine and Israel during an October debate, the Nebraska Examiner reported then.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/heres-how-congresss-biggest-defense-advocates-fared-in-the-2024-election/	2024-11-06T06:50:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/231213_DVIDS_soldier_capitol_6530390-scaled-e1702501640138.jpg
Israel’s Netanyahu fires Defense Minister Gallant	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III is greeted by Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, Oct. 13, 2023. (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shook up Israel’s political landscape by firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant late this evening, saying 'significant gaps' had developed between the two over Israel's military campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. Netanyahu said in a statement that 'in the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense.' He said that while he and Gallant had worked well together in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, over time the relationship declined. 'Significant gaps were discovered between myself and Gallant in the management of the campaign,' he said. Netanyahu claimed he tried to bridge the gaps but said 'they only grew wider. These divisions even reached public knowledge in an unusual manner and, worse, became known to our enemies, who took pleasure in them and derived substantial benefit from them.' Netanyahu said that Israel Katz, the current foreign minister, will step in to replace Gallant. 'He brings with him an impressive combination of rich experience and executive ability,' Netanyahu said. After news of his firing broke, Gallant issued his own statement saying that the 'security of the State of Israel always was, and will always remain my life's mission.' Gallant was born in 1958, the child of a Holocaust survivor. He served in Israel’s Shayetet naval commandos and was a commander of the Gaza Division and Israel’s Southern Command. He began his political career in 2015 as part of the Kulanu party. In 2019 he joined Netanyahu's Likud party, which has been in power since 2009. He was construction minister in 2017. At the time he warned, 'We need to be ready for a confrontation with Hamas from [the start of] the coming summer. It is a sensitive period, and we need to be alert and to take actions to prevent it.' The removal of Gallant comes after months of simmering disputes between Netanyahu and the defense minister over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Netanyahu and Gallant disagreed over the priorities in the conduct of the war, with Gallant pressing for a hostage deal and seeking to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews who usually have an exemption from service. Netanyahu's decision to fire Gallant was met with stinging rebuke from opposition figures and some analysts. 'Firing Gallant in the middle of a war is an act of madness. Netanyahu is selling Israel's security and the IDF fighters for a disgraceful political survival,' opposition leader Yair Lapid said. The leader of the Democrats' party, Yair Golan, a former deputy Chief of Staff of the IDF, called on Israeli to take to the streets and protest the firing of Gallant. Netanyahu’s coalition partners supported the decision. Ksenia Svetlova, a former member of Knesset and Executive Director of the NGO Ropes, said that a prime minister 'that fires a minister of defense when Israel is fighting in [seven] fronts in its bloodiest war since 1948, is dangerous to Israel’s security.' She told Breaking Defense Netanyahu seemed more concerned with his own political survival and appeasing far-right members of his coalition. Yaakov Katz, author of 'Israel vs. Iran: The Shadow War' and a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense said that Netanyahu chose to fire Gallant when the US is focused on elections. 'It shows he [Netanyahu] is more concerned with how they might react as opposed to how Israelis might respond,' Katz said. He noted that Gallant was the main point of contact for the US administration with Israel during the course of the war. This is not the first time Netanyahu’s disputes with a defense minister have been at the center of a political crisis. In 2018 then-Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman resigned after he disagreed with the government’s policy on Gaza. At the time Liberman had pressed for action against Hamas, while Netanyahu preferred de-escalating. This is also not the first time Netanyahu tried to fire Gallant. He previously intended to push Gallant out in the spring of 2023 during the controversy over judicial reform, but there were major protests, and Netanyahu climbed down from the decision. Gallant had criticized the government for trying to pass a judicial reform bill at the time, expressing concern it was dividing the country. Gallant leaves office as Israel is fighting a war on multiple fronts. Iran has threatened to carry out more direct attacks on Israel in the wake of Israel striking Iran in October, which itself was retaliation for Iran launching 180 at Israeli targets earlier that month.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israels-netanyahu-fires-defense-minister-gallant/	2024-11-05T13:55:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/8069894-scaled-e1716995064595.jpg
MBDA reveals Anglo-French future cruise/anti-ship missile stealth and wind tunnel testing	MBDA displays FCASW RJ &#8211; a future supersonic cruise and anti-ship missile model (Breaking Defense) EURONAVAL 2024 — European missile house MBDA has disclosed Radio Frequency (RF) signature and missile propulsion system testing of its Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapons (FC/ASW) for France and the United Kingdom. Over the last 12 months, weapon assessment phase activities have included a first TP15 'ultra' Low Observable [LO] subsonic prototype missile undergoing 'extreme' RF trials, and wind tunnel propulsion system testing of a RJ10 supersonic variant, according to MBDA executives speaking to media at the Euronaval trade show in Paris. It was also revealed that France’s Thales and MBDA UK have jointly started RJ10 seeker testing, while warhead, fusing systems, aerodynamic trials and new engine tests are all planned for the future. The Anglo-French program, which will expand next year with the onboarding of Italy, has been founded to deliver both a LO cruise missile and a highly maneuverable supersonic munition to replace Storm Shadow/SCALP air launched long-range missiles, as well as Exocet and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Due to sensitivities, limited details of the test activities were shared with reporters, but Pierre-Marie Belleau, deep strike product line owner at MBDA, provided a small glimpse into subsystem applications, saying that the TP15 prototype features a Rolls Royce and Safran designed turbojet engine. The TP15 and RJ10 tests took place over the 'last 12 months' he added. 'It’s a huge technical challenge, frankly speaking, one of the biggest technical challenges that the company has taken over the last [number of] years. Overall it has been an exceptional technical success,' outside of a software test that required repeating, Belleau added. He also shared that MBDA settled on the 15th version for the TP15 designation after looking at wide array of different configurations and test scenarios. Both the TP15 and RJ10 are being developed in parallel, 'in order to address the most difficult targets for the next decade,' according to Belleau. He explained that FC/ASW launch platforms include Italian Navy FREMM, UK Royal Navy Type 26 frigates, Italian and British Eurofighter Typhoons and French Rafale fighter jets. Customer decisions will dictate if the future weapons are fielded on sixth generation European platforms relating to the British, Italian, Japanese Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the French, German, Spanish Future Combat Air System/SCAF. In the near term, a convergence contract that enables Italy to join FC/ASW will be finalized at the start of next year. Additionally Belleau said, 'We [are] now working to prepare the development and the manufacturing of [these products] across the three nations and of course can welcome other nations at a later stage.' Although the UK has put a hold on long term acquisition and equipment program decisions until its Strategic Defense Review (SDR) reports in mid-2025, it is 'unlikely' that FC/ASW will be placed at risk, said Belleau. 'We have not stopped working in the UK, [across] all these tests,' he explained. 'There are some arbitrations made at political levels that will come but deep strike is such a priority mission we are confident on the future. It [a surprise] can always come but frankly that will be very &#8230; unlikely.' MBDA is the UK's preferred strategic weapons provider. In July, both parties renewed their long term partnership on 'complex weapons' under a new Portfolio Management Agreement 'worth at least' £6.5 billion ($8.4 billion). Separately, the manufacturer also unveiled the new submarine launched Exocet SM40 anti-ship missile at Euronaval. It has been designed with a new J-band RF seeker, new propulsion system with a turbojet engine, and can travel at twice the range of previous Exocet weapons, according to a statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/mbda-reveals-anglo-french-future-cruise-anti-ship-missile-stealth-and-wind-tunnel-testing/	2024-11-05T11:28:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/IMG_2197-scaled-e1730812445712.jpg
France’s Naval Group unveils Seaquest, its first unmanned surface vessel	Naval Group's new Seaquest USV. (Courtesy of Naval Group.) EURONAVAL 2024 — France’s national shipbuilder today unveiled its first ever unmanned surface vessel designed to operate in conjunction with manned warships following limited testing alongside the French Navy. The drone, dubbed Seaquest and measuring approximately 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, and can be equipped with payloads focusing on intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting. It was designed by Naval Group, the French shipbuilder majority-owned by the state; Sirehna, a subsidiary of Naval Group; and Couach Shipyard, another French shipbuilder known for its commercial yachts. 'We see that an increasing number of navies are equipping themselves or thinking to equip themselves [with unmanned drones],' Aurore Neuschwander, executive vice president of drones and unmanned systems and underwater weapons at Naval Group, told a crowd here at the Euronaval exposition in Paris. 'It becomes a glimpse of what future naval combat is set to become. This new context calls for navies to adapt.' Neuschwander said the Seaquest can be operated from a ship or from ashore and was designed to be 'fully integrated' with a frigate, landing helicopter docks or supply ships. When Neuschwander said the USV is 'fully integrated' with the ship, she was referring to a short video that showed the vessel being deployed and recovered by French sailors using a davit attached to a warship. 'We wanted to have it available as soon as possible because operations don’t wait,' said Patrick Pennamen, CEO of Sirehna. 'So based on our own experience in hydrodynamics and dynamic positioning, we have developed in less than one year a brand new system following an agile and incremental process, and today it’s operational at sea.' Seaquest’s debut comes at a time when numerous international navies and their associated contractors have taken heightened interest in unmanned and autonomous maritime vessels. The Pentagon’s Replicator program has driven that home particularly hard with the US Navy which has been experimenting with numerous commercial-off-the-shelf USVs and UUVs with mixed success and at least preliminary investments into systems deemed worthwhile. But for a company like Naval Group, a product’s debut has more implications than simply marketing. The shipbuilding giant is majority-owned by the state — and partly by another French aerospace and defense giant, Thales — meaning its research and development efforts are in part a reflection of the interests of the Ministry of Armed Forces and the country’s navy, Marine Nationale.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/frances-naval-group-unveils-seaquest-its-first-unmanned-surface-vessel/	2024-11-05T10:20:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Visuel-FP-Seaquest®.png
US approves potential $4.9 billion E-7 Wedgetail deal with South Korea	Saab GlobalEye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) aircraft lost out to Boeing made E-7 Wedgetails in a recent NATO procurement (Saab) WASHINGTON — The US government has approved a potential deal for South Korea to buy four E-7 Wedgetail surveillance and early warning aircraft and related equipment for nearly $5 billion, should Seoul choose the Boeing bird in its race to expand its Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Aircraft (AEW&amp;C) fleet. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced late Monday that the State Department okayed the would-be $4.9 billion arrangement, saying the 'proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea’s ability to meet current and future threats by providing increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and airborne early warning and control capabilities.' 'It will also increase the ROK Air Force’s command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability with the United States,' the release said. 'Korea will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and support into its armed forces.' Seoul already operates a handful of Wedgetails — along with Australia, the United Kingdom and Turkey, according to planemaker Boeing — but late last year Seoul announced a competition to expand its capabilities. International offers have lined up, including from Sweden's Saab with its GlobalEye surveillance aircraft and from a team-up of America's L3Harris with Korean Air and Israel's ELTA. Beyond its current operating customers, the Wedgetail has been chosen as the latest AEW&amp;C for the US Air Force as well as NATO — though the US acquisition was bumpy as negotiations with Boeing dragged and NATO's came with its own criticisms. RELATED: &#8216;Political decisions': Saab CEO says NATO rush E-3 replacement decision in favor of E-7 Foreign Military Sale approvals are not final deals, but signify the US government's acquiescence if the Wedgetail is the direction in which Seoul would like to go.

Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-approves-potential-4-9-billion-e-7-wedgetail-deal-with-south-korea/	2024-11-05T08:29:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/20230221-en-4471121-2-scaled-e1709577371527.jpg
Boeing machinists vote to end strike, putting KC-46, P-8 programs back on track	A P-8 maritime patrol aircraft undergoes assembly at Boeing's Renton production line. Future E-7s, based on the 737 NG, will be slotted into this line for assembly. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s Seattle-area machinists union voted on Monday evening to end a seven week strike and accept a new contract with the planemaker, a move that will allow the company to restart production of commercial derivative military planes like the KC-46 tanker and P-8 Poseidon. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents about 33,000 Boeing workers mostly in Washington state and Oregon, voted in a 59 percent majority to end the strike and will return to work on Nov. 6. Union workers first rejected a previous contract and voted to strike on Sept. 13. 'While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,' said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. 'We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.' IAM 751 President Jon Holden said the strike allowed Boeing workers to 'rebalanc[e] the scales' with a contract that provides improved wages and a better quality of life. 'This contract also creates a new foundation to build on for the future and that future begins today,' he said in a statement. 'We are ready to help Boeing change direction and return to building the highest quality and safest airplanes in the world. Our members are critical to that mission, and now have a stronger voice in the decision making process to ensure those needed improvements are made.' The strike had immediate financial consequences for Boeing, halting production of its 737, 767 and 777 jetliners and impacting military derivatives of those aircraft, which include the 737-based P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and the the 767-based KC-46 tanker. Boeing also acknowledged it could see impacts to the Air Force's program to build E-7 Wedgetail prototypes due to the strike. The company recognized $6 billion in losses in the third quarter, including $2 billion on defense programs, which it partially attributed to the work stoppage. At the onset of the strike, Boeing said it was 'working with our suppliers and customers to ensure continuity to the extent we can' on the P-8 and E-7 Wedgetail programs, and that it had fulfilled its commitment to the US Air Force to deliver at least 15 KC-46 tankers during fiscal 2024, which ended on Sept. 30. During an earnings call with investors in October, Ortberg said that coming to a contract agreement with the union and ending the strike was the first step necessary for moving the company forward. 'I met with the union leadership the first week on the job and let them know that I was committed to resetting the relationship. And I remain committed to getting the team back and improving our relationship, so we don’t become so disconnected in the future,' he said on Oct. 23, hours before the union would vote to reject an earlier contract proposal. However, as the strike continued on, Boeing leaders showed signs of frustration with the impasse. During a Nov. 1 interview with The Seattle Times, Holden said Ortberg told union leadership that, should the union reject the company’s latest offer, the next proposal would contain less generous terms. Under the agreed-upon contract, machinists would earn a 38 percent general wage increase over the next four years, $12,000 in bonuses, the reinstatement of the company’s incentive plan, and additional contributions to 401(k) plans. As part of the deal, Boeing also agreed to build its next commercial aircraft in the Puget Sound region, should the company launch a new program during the contract’s duration. The deal is an improvement from the original Sept. 8 contract proposal, which offered a 25 percent wage increase, as well as the latest Oct. 19 proposal, which offered a 35 percent increase. However, it still falls slightly short of the 40 percent wage increase originally demanded by the union, and although the offer includes higher bonuses and improvements to benefits, Boeing has refused the union’s continued demands to reinstate the company’s legacy pension program, which was phased out 2014. IAM 751 recommended that members accept the contract proposal, calling for the union 'to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory' in an Oct. 31 post on its website. 'In every negotiation and strike, there is a point where we have extracted everything that we can in bargaining and by withholding our labor. We are at that point now and risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future,' the union stated. In a Nov. 1 message to employees, Ortberg said, 'It’s time we all come back together and focus on rebuilding the business and delivering the world’s best airplanes. There are a lot of people depending on us.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/boeing-machinists-vote-to-end-strike-putting-kc-46-p-8-programs-back-on-track/	2024-11-05T06:09:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/P-8-photo-scaled-e1704386404109.jpg
Netherlands orders 12 H225M helicopters for special operations	Dutch Special Operations Forces (SOF) will receive 12 newly configured H225M Caracal helicopters (Airbus Helicopters) EURONAVAL 2024 — The Dutch Ministry of Defence signed a contract with Airbus today for the acquisition of 12 H225M Caracal heavy-lift helicopters to equip special operations forces (SOF) and replace aging AS532 Cougars. The agreement was signed at the Euronaval trade show by Vice-Admiral Jan Willem Hartman, Head of the Netherlands Command Materiel and IT (COMMIT) agency, and Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. The deal was widely expected after Gijs Tuinman, Netherlands State Secretary of Defence, wrote a letter to lawmakers in October to explain that a proposed procurement of 14 aircraft had been reduced to 12 because funding was 'not sufficient' enough to absorb costs for aircraft modifications. The Netherlands has requested a tailored H225M configuration to support SOF requirements. 'Airbus Helicopters and the RNLAF [Royal Netherlands Air Force] will work closely together on the development of the H225M adapted to the requirements of the users, enhancing capabilities and efficiency for special operations missions success, through tactical communication and a unique design of interaction of the aircraft and its systems,' said the manufacturer in a statement. In October, the Dutch Ministry of Defence also announced that a new unit, 300 Special Operations Squadron, based at Gilze-Rijen Air Base, southern Netherlands, had been formally stood up to support the future rotary fleet. The Netherlands plans on issuing a number of other H225M-related contracts, including an agreement with Israel's Elbit Systems for self-protection systems — equipment already installed on Dutch Gulfstream G650ER aircraft and due for integration on future C-390 tactical airlifters. Additionally, in line with the Dutch Armed Forces Foxtrot communications program and combat net radio requirement, Airbus will integrate L3 Harris radios on the rotary wing platforms. At a design level, the H225M aircraft itself features 'new avionics, an enhanced main gear box, airborne communication systems and can be equipped with the HForce weapon system,' according to Airbus company literature. The Hague had previously put forward 2030 to 2032 as the period for deliveries of the new rotorcraft but that has shifted 'partly due to the technical complexity' of integrating specialised mission equipment and 'great pressure on the production lines of the Caracal helicopter due to international orders,' according to an online translation of Tuinman's letter. In response to the suggestion that the H225 production line is having problems keeping up with demand, an Airbus Helicopters spokesperson told Breaking Defense, 'I would not say that we are struggling, but the fact is there will be a lot of helicopters to deliver in the coming years.' He added: 'The other factor to take into account is the fact that the NL [Netherlands] are asking for a new advanced configuration of the H225M matching their specific needs. We can't go into specifics, but new development work will be needed. It's always the case when a customer asks for new types of equipment.' The spokesperson declined to share an updated delivery schedule. The Dutch Ministry of Defence declined to comment. Outside of the Dutch deal, this year alone Airbus has secured new H225M orders from the German Federal Police (38 aircraft), Iraq Ministry of Defence (12 aircraft) and Japan Coast Guard (3 aircraft). Other defense customers include Brazil, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and Thailand. Breaking Defense reported exclusively last year that the United Arab Emirates had decided to cancel a $800 million H225M acquisition, citing high lifecycle costs and modular design limitations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/netherlands-orders-12-h225m-helicopters-for-special-operations/	2024-11-05T04:46:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/unnamed-4-scaled.jpg
France begins delivery of 100 loitering munitions to Ukraine	French drone manufacturer Delair displays a model of the Ukraine supplied OSKAR short range loitering munition at Euronaval (Breaking Defense) PARIS — France has started transporting loitering munitions to Ukraine for the first time — just a little over six months since the suicide drones were rapidly developed from demonstration standard to war ready, according to an industry executive. Made by French drone manufacturer Delair and KNDS France, the OSKAR (Opportunity Strike Kinetics Aircraft Ruggedised) platforms are currently 'being sent' to Ukraine, Bastien Mancini, CEO of Delair, told Breaking Defense. Under the French Colibri (Hummingbird) project, 100 of the short-range loitering munitions are due for transfer to Ukraine, as part of broader plans by Paris to acquire 2,000 units of different types overall. Mancini declined to share additional details about the new deliveries but they fit with a timeframe shared on X, in October, by Sébastien Lecornu, France’s Armed Forces Minister. At the time, Lecornu noted that 'successful testing' of the loitering munitions had taken place and deliveries to Ukraine would begin in 'the coming weeks.' Evolved from Delair's UX11 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and modified to integrate a 2.3 kilogram (5 pound) warhead from KNDS France, OSKAR can fly for up to 45 minutes and has been designed to strike fixed targets, light vehicles and personnel. The back-packable loitering munition was selected as one of two solutions for acquisition under Colibri in March. In all, 'we had six months to transform [our] demonstrator into an operational product &#8230; operational with constraints of the ammunition,' Mancini told Breaking Defense. 'Now this phase is finished and the [OSKAR] drones are being delivered to Ukraine. They are being sent, I don’t have' further details. Loitering munitions have flown steadily into Ukraine since the war started and are widely considered cost effective solutions compared to antitank or cruise missiles. As an example, US manufacturer AeroVironment estimated in April that it had provided Ukraine with 'thousands' of drones, including Switchblade types. RELATED: France makes new &#8216;pact' with industry to speed small drone production, acquisition Similarly, Delair has already gained product feedback from Ukraine, having provided Kyiv with UX11 and DT26 surveillance drones. Mancini noted that Russian Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities continue to present 'a real danger' to Ukrainian supplied equipment and stressed that because a platform 'works today' does not mean that 'it will work in three months.' The 'quality that we need is to remain very adaptive and alert &#8230; because so far, we have solutions that work, but &#8230; things evolve very quickly on the battlefield,' he said. To resist EW attacks, OSKAR also uses satellite navigation denied capabilities and can operate fully encrypted, out to a 25 kilometer (15.5 mile) communication range, according to KNDS company literature. Mancini also said that following Delair’s acquisition, late last month, of French swarming and inspection drone manufacturer Squadrone System, the company could decide to test multiple OSKAR’s in a swarm. He declined to share the value of the Squadrone deal. The Grenoble-based manufacturer is currently part of the DGA- and Defence Innovation Agency-led Tactical Multi-Objectives Swarming UAVs) TAMOS line of effort — a two-year research and development program exploring development of an interface capable of letting a human operator control the flight of several small-sized UAV’s for civil and defense markets.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/france-begins-delivery-of-100-loitering-munitions-to-ukraine/	2024-11-05T04:14:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/IMG_2223-1-scaled-e1730808912287.jpg
Navy will extend service lives of 3 cruisers following destroyer announcement	A Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block 1B interceptor missile is launched from the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie (CG 70) during a Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy test in the mid-Pacific. (U.S. Navy photo/Released) PARIS — The US Navy announced today it is extending the service lives of three Ticonderoga-class cruisers, a decision that adds 10 years of cumulative ship service to the fleet and follows a similar decision last week to extend 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. 'All three cruisers received extensive hull, mechanical and engineering, as well as combat system upgrades as part of an extended modernization program,' according to a service statement published today. 'USS Gettysburg (CG-64) and USS Chosin (CG-65) completed modernization in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024, respectively. USS Cape St. George (CG-71) is on schedule to complete modernization this fiscal year.' For years, the Navy has lobbied Congress to allow for certain Ticonderoga-class cruisers — as well as Littoral Combat Ships — to be decommission ahead of schedule, but lawmakers have repeatedly blocked those efforts, largely citing the need for the service to achieve a larger fleet. Those efforts have followed a large, and problematic, effort to modernize those ships, which is nine years old and counting. 'As a former cruiser sailor, I know the incredible value these highly-capable warships bring to the fleet and I am proud of their many decades of service,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in the statement. 'After learning hard lessons from the cruiser modernization program, we are only extending ships that have completed modernization and have the material readiness needed to continue advancing our Navy’s mission.' The Chosin (CG-65) was also recently part of a Navy demonstration that has been personally lauded by Del Toro for transferring and reloading missile cannisters at sea, a capability the Navy claims will be 'transformational' because it removes the need for a ship to pull into port.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-will-extend-service-lives-of-3-cruisers-following-destroyer-announcement/	2024-11-04T10:02:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/934664-scaled-e1713286156806.jpg
The next president must recognize Americans’ unwavering support for int’l leadership, engagement	NATO delegates come together at the 2024 summit in Washington, DC on July 11, 2024. (NATO) As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris make their closing arguments to voters around the country, both candidates must contend with an undeniable truth: Americans across the political spectrum favor strong U.S. leadership in the world. Regardless of who wins the presidential election and takes office in January, he or she would be wise to recognize this clear mandate from the American people. The American public’s commitment to an internationalist foreign policy is unwavering in recent years amidst chaos and conflict around the world, as shown in six years of consistent data from the Reagan National Defense Survey. Since 2018, the Ronald Reagan Institute has conducted an annual nationwide public opinion poll assessing Americans’ views on a wide array of defense, foreign policy, and national security topics. One message we have heard loud and clear: a rock-solid preference among the American people for U.S. leadership and engagement on the global stage. Even as public opinion has shifted on the particulars of some foreign policy issues, many core principles receive consistent support year on year. When asked whether the United States should be more engaged and take the lead or be less engaged and react to world events, a majority favors American engagement. Across six years of polling, there has always been a preference for global leadership—and in recent surveys, more and more Americans want the United States to take the lead, now up to 54 percent, from 40 percent in 2022. On a bipartisan basis, the American people have a clear preference for internationalism over isolationism. Americans also consistently support our forward-deployed global military presence. A remarkably constant supermajority of about two-thirds of Americans has favored the United States maintaining military bases around the world to deter attacks and provide a quick response. Almost eight in ten Americans, including majorities across party lines, favor increased defense spending, a figure that has remained consistent since 2018. Despite the four decades since President Ronald Reagan was in office, his philosophy of peace through strength still resonates with the American people. The American public maintains a steadfast commitment to standing by our allies and partners. Since 2018, about six in ten Americans have consistently reported having a favorable view of NATO. And they support NATO’s core principle of collective defense, with almost three-quarters saying United States should respond militarily if a NATO ally was attacked. On Ukraine aid, our polls have shown rock-solid support for sending U.S. weapons. Since 2022, around 60 percent of Americans across party lines want the United States to provide military aid to Ukraine—debunking speculation of 'Ukraine fatigue' among the public. This is what international leadership and engagement looks like. While foreign policy may seem distant, it is not abstract. And the broad, bipartisan mandate is clear. Over 80 percent of Americans believe that a strong U.S. military is crucial for peace and prosperity, both at home and abroad; 78 percent agree that American leaders is essential to promote trade and boost the economy; and 77 percent say the United States has an obligation to champion human rights and democracy whenever possible. While support for these core principles has remained steadfast, we have seen a remarkable shift when it comes to threat perception—particularly vis-à-vis China. A steadily rising percentage of Americans view China as the country posing the greatest threat to the United States. In the most recent Reagan National Defense Survey, released last December, 51 percent of Americans identified China as the top threat, up from just 21 percent in 2018. This shift reflects growing public concern about China across every domain: its military build-up, technological advancements, economic engagement, human rights abuses, and global ambitions. And yet, over half of Americans say that the United States does not have a clear strategy for managing its relationship with China. Beyond the bipartisan consensus that we are engaged in a great power competition, the next president should articulate how our country and the free world can win that contest. On the eve of the 1980 election, then-candidate Ronald Reagan made foreign policy part of his closing argument, saying, 'Many of us are unhappy about…our diminishing prestige around the globe, about the weakness in our economy and national security that jeopardizes world peace, about our lack of strong, straightforward leadership…I believe we can embark on a new age of reform in this country and an era of national renewal.' Now, facing similar circumstances, Americans desire a renewed commitment to strong U.S. leadership and international engagement, the approach that has long safeguarded peace in a dangerous, turbulent world. Whoever steps into the Oval Office in January should heed this call.

Austal eyeing European markets for US Navy’s new medical ship design	A graphic of Austal USA's expeditionary medical ship. (Courtesy of Austal USA) EURONAVAL 2024 — Austal USA is eyeing European markets for its relatively new medical ship that is being designed and produced for the US Navy, as the company looks to beef up future production to avoid fallow periods at its facilities. 'We’re interested in expanding our market — three to four years out — we want to be looking at a new set of programs,' Larry Ryder, a company executive, told Breaking Defense here at the Euronaval exposition. 'It’s a piece of the market we haven’t touched yet. We’ve come close on a couple of international [foreign military sales] deals, but we want to kind of gage the market over here.' Austal is slated to build three Bethesda-class Expeditionary Medical Ships for the US Navy, a specialized platform derived from the expeditionary fast transports and designed to provide a more mobile and agile version of the iconic hospital ships Comfort and Mercy. The interest to put the platform forward in markets abroad stems from the American shipyard’s recent history. As Breaking Defense reported, Austal’s Mobile, Ala.,-based yard was facing numerous programmatic closures and severe layoffs at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic as several US Navy programs were slated to close and no new work was on the horizon. Through a combination of facility expansion and contract wins, the shipyard, a staple builder for the US Navy, has come out of that period with a more diverse portfolio of programs than it held a few years ago. But, Ryder acknowledged, it also acted as a warning sign for the need to seek out new customers. 'We've got to be looking three, four years out, and if we sit and wait till we need work, it's too late,' he added. Europe is relatively fresh ground for Austal as a whole. While the Expeditionary Medical Ship is built by Austal USA, its parent company, Austal, based in Australia, is largely focused on its domestic market and Asia, especially as it pertains to defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/austal-eyeing-european-markets-for-us-navys-new-medical-ship-design/	2024-11-04T07:19:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/53440417469_c4b21d066d_o-scaled-e1704306136265.jpg
Australia kills $5.3B military space program with Lockheed	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (L), US President Joe Biden (C) and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (R) during the AUKUS summit on March 13, 2023 in San Diego. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) CANBERRA — The Labor government of Anthony Albanese today cancelled Australia's largest space program ever, almost 18 months after killing the main civil space program, drawing sharp criticism from analysts and industry experts. The satellite communications program, known in typical Australian military fashion as JP 9102, was projected to be worth at least $7 billion AUD ($5.3 billion USD). The government began the project in 2021 and eventually chose Lockheed Martin's Australian arm to see it through, but the Department of Defence said in an announcement today that due to the 'acceleration in space technologies and evolving threats in space, Defense has assessed that a single orbit GEO-based satellite communications system would not meet strategic priorities.' 'Instead of a single orbit solution, defense must instead prioritize a multi-orbit capability increasing resilience for the Australian Defense Force,' the department said. 'Defence’s current satellite communications capabilities support the immediate needs of the organisation. This decision allows Defence to prioritise emerging needs, mitigate capability gaps and continue to support our transition to an integrated, focused force.' News of the cancellation was broken by The Australian newspaper, which said the decision was based on budget issues. After The Australian broke the story, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spoke with Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio and offered justification for the government's defense planning and spending. 'We’re busy prioritizing all of our purchases when it comes to defense assets. We’ve got a considerable increase in our defense budget and we’ll make sure all of the decisions that we make are in our national interest,' the prime minister said. 'We are not only seeing advances with the AUKUS arrangements being on track and on time and on budget, we’re seeing our capabilities increased with increased asset purchases. We are also very much interested in this being part of our ‘Future Made in Australia’ agenda.' But the cancellation was cast as a broad example of the Albanese government's unwillingness to increase defense spending beyond inflation and currency changes and its lack of commitment to space programs. The Space Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) noted the government's decision with 'profound disappointment.' Its chairman, Jeremy Hallett, said in a statement, 'While other OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] nations see sovereign space capability as critical to creating high-tech, high-value jobs and a military advantage, in our own backyard we seem to be doing the exact opposite.' Lockheed Martin Australia said it would try to keep the jobs created so far: 'We are committed to preserving our sovereign workforce with impacted staff being redeployed across other existing and emerging programs where possible.' Malcolm Davis, a defense expert with The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense in an email that If the government offers no alternative to JP 9102, it will mark 'a retreat back to dependency on foreign actors to provide our crucial upstream space segment.' Australia has already experienced this. It discovered the limits of access to the Boeing-built WGS defense constellation, even after paying to build one of the satellites. During the massive bushfires here in 2019 and 2020, the Aussies asked the US military for WGS coverage to help with command and control; US Army Pacific reportedly turned things around within 24 hours, but that was time lost and highlighted the limits of Australia’s access even during a time of peace. 'In the meantime, government doesn't send any signal of confidence to the Australian commercial space sector and that will only see that sector seeing greater risk,' Davis said. 'At a certain point, companies begin to close doors and relocate over to the US, or elsewhere. Jobs are lost, financial returns decline, and it snowballs.' Davis said the government is trying to cover the high cost of AUKUS and the Navy's surface fleet expansion, without making a 'real increase in defense spending.' He notes that 'other key projects' have been redefined, reprioritized, delayed or cancelled by Labor. 'And now, as the cost of AUKUS continues to increase (as it always was going to) they are having to continue to make cuts to avoid spending more on defense,' he said. Hallett of the SIAA ticked off space programs either cut or in limbo. 'We’ve seen a change in direction for Space Domain Awareness under JP 9360 after industry being led along for many years. We have the media-reported cancellation of the Resilient Multi-Mission STaR Shot program by DSTG, we have heard nothing public on Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing under JP 9380 even though that tender closed over a year ago, and now this news on JP9102 — not to mention cuts to civil space programs,' Hallett said in the SIAA statement. 'I am sure some companies will seriously consider the business case for dealing with defense as a customer in the future, which I worry will mean our warfighters will miss out on homegrown innovations that can make a difference on the battlefield,' he said. Hallett said Australia needs strategic autonomy and resilience for its 'future economic and national security' and it is central to AUKUS Pillar II, the cluster of capabilities such as hypersonics, autonomy, AI and other advanced weapons America, Britain and Australia are pursuing to rapidly improve their militaries in the face of China's rapid military modernization. 'Owning and operating significant military space infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific as part of a multi-orbit architecture would have achieved this, and provided meaningful contribution into AUKUS Pillar [II],' Hallett said, 'the advanced capabilities of which cannot function without space capability.' The DoD's statement suggested Australia would pursue an altered space program, one with a 'multi-orbit capability,' but did not provide further details.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/australia-kills-5-3b-military-space-program-with-lockheed/	2024-11-04T05:19:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/aukus_2023-scaled-e1678742636131.jpg
