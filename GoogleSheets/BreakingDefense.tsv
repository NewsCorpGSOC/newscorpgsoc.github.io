UK ‘needs’ GCAP future fighter to counter growth of Russian and Chinese stealth jets: Air Chief	The new GCAP next generation fighter concept is based on a delta wing design and increased wingspan for improved aerodynamics (BAE Systems) BELFAST — The UK Royal Air Force (RAF) must press forward with the multinational Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) to deliver a next generation fighter jet if it wants to take a stand against the 'proliferation' of Russian and Chinese stealth aircraft, according to the head of the service. The joint British, Italian and Japanese effort has been the subject of uncertainty in recent months after UK Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard refused to make a long term commitment to it on grounds that doing so could 'prejudge' the outcome of a new strategic defense review, set to report in mid-2025. Since Pollard's comments, the Financial Times reported that over the 'coming weeks' the Labour government will formally green light the multibillion-pound project. Government ministers have already agreed to such a decision, the publication said last week. In another boost for the project, Italy's parliament approved the country's continued participation today. 'The proliferation of stealth capability through the likes of the Chinese J-20 or the Russian Su-57 as well as increasingly long range air-to-air weapons like the PL-15 Thunderbolt, mean that we also need to be planning for the next generation capabilities now; that is why we need GCAP,' Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, RAF Chief of the Air Staff, said during a speech on Monday held by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) — a UK defense think tank. 'GCAP is very deliberately being designed to complement and enhance the capabilities of F-35, not replace it, but we also know that even a force of F-35 and GCAP will need to be augmented by what we call Autonomous Collaborative Platforms [ACPs] to defeat the threats that we see emerging.' The GCAP fighter jet is planned to replace British and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons as well as Japanese F-2s, with a service entry date of 2035. It is also expected to operate alongside ACPs or adjunct aircraft, similar to US Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). Additionally, GCAP industry partners are committed to flying a crewed, supersonic and low observable aircraft demonstrator within four years. Under the previous Conservative administration, London committed £2 billion ($2.55 billion) to GCAP out to May 2025. Knighton's support for GCAP comes on the heels of BAE Systems unveiling a new concept of the future crewed fighter jet, based around a conventional delta wing design and distinguished by an increased wingspan compared to previous iterations. &quot;Satisfaction with today&#39;s parliamentary approval of Italy&#39;s participation in the Global Combat Air Programme. The #GCAP is an ambitious project for the development of the 6th generation fighter aircraft in cooperation with the #UK and #Japan. It will be fundamental in ensuring… &mdash; Ministero Difesa (@MinisteroDifesa) November 12, 2024 All industry partners are 'steaming ahead' with design activities of the next generation fighter, Herman Claesen, managing director of Future Combat Air Systems at BAE Systems told reporters at the Farnborough Air Show in July. He added that the next engineering milestone for GCAP is a systems requirements review, directly supporting planning for launch of a development phase next year. Knighton did not share any comments relating to industry progress, other than to reconfirm that the RAF is on course to receive a first 'operationally useful' ACP 'before the end of the financial year.' The UK has not said which ACP it has selected specifically, but it will be a Tier 1 or disposable type, in line with comments made by Knighton to the Defence Committee [PDF] in February. At that time, he said that a focus on Tier 1 was based on assessment of costs against operational benefits. London also expects to operate a 'suite' of ACPs by 2030, according to its ACP strategy [PDF]. The RAF is targeting acquisition of ACPs to sit alongside GCAP and F-35 jets as a way of increasing combat mass and allow crewed platforms to be less vulnerable to attack. Such is the focus on the effort that London wants to see the air vehicles flying regularly alongside crewed fighters 'as part of a national or coalition force' by the end of the decade. 'This high-low mix of platforms will provide the cost effective way of delivering the combat mass we still need to win against the ever improving enemy,' said Knighton. 'With multiple nations such as the US, Australia, Japan, France, Germany, actively investing in their own versions of ACPs, now is the last safe moment to commit to an ACP if we're to retain a lead and seize the initiative as well as the market.' The UK has still to settle on an ACP budget. 'The exact level of resource to be allocated is yet to be defined,' states the strategy document, while the RAF's ability to 'rapidly' bring new drones into service took a knock when a lawmaker revealed in March that 216 Squadron, stood up in 2020 to specifically test and experiment with uncrewed aircraft, had yet to carry out a single drone test.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/uk-needs-gcap-future-fighter-to-counter-growth-of-russian-and-chinese-stealth-jets-air-chief/	2024-11-12T11:21:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/1721595970093-e1721613189775.jpg
Waltz reportedly in as Trump’s national security advisor, SecDef position remains a question mark	U.S. House of Representatives, The Hon. Mike Waltz attends the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit at Sheraton New York Times Square on September 23, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Riccardo Savi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit) WASHINGTON — In the week since the US presidential election, a second Trump administration appears to be taking shape — with one key national security slot seemingly wide open. Over the last couple days reports emerged that President-elect Donald Trump is eyeing Rep. Mike Waltz, a Florida Congressman, as his White House national security advisor. Trump also reportedly plans to nominate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his Secretary of State and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as Homeland Security secretary. Waltz served in the Army as a Green Beret and, according to his bio, saw tours in Afghanistan and elsewhere. He also worked in the Pentagon during the Bush administration, before founding a defense services firm called Metris Solutions, which won some contracts for training Afghan special forces. Metris was acquired by PAE in 2020. Waltz won his current seat in the House in 2018, and has held positions on the House Armed Services Committee, as well as the foreign affairs and intel committees. In public statements, he has styled himself China hawk, a trait he shares with Rubio — a sign that under a Trump administration, there will likely be no backing off of the idea that China is the 'pacing threat' for the US military. During a September event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Waltz issued support for the creation of a maritime czar — a single individual inside the executive branch whose authorities span across maritime issues related to both the Defense and Transportation Departments. As national security advisor, that idea may come to fruition. Additionally, Waltz was one of two cosponsors of a 2023 effort to authorize the use of military force against Mexican drug cartels. In a campaign policy platform, Trump pledged to 'use all resources needed to stop the Invasion — including moving thousands of Troops currently stationed overseas to our own Southern Border.' Trump also reportedly had discussed sending special forces operators into Mexico to target cartel leaders. In a note to investors, analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners said Waltz’s appointment may have 'mixed implications' for defense spending. 'His views on China could be positive, but those on cartels, Ukraine aid, and DoD ‘waste’ may entail nuances for defense contractors to wade through in 2025 and beyond,' Callan wrote, noting an April HASC hearing where Waltz pushed on waste, fraud and abuse issues. Meanwhile, the race for secretary of defense appears wide open. Three leading names in defense circles have all been struck from the list: Waltz, taking the NSC job; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was ruled out by Trump; and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who took himself out of the running and is now expected to be named chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. On the Senate side, it is expected that Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., will take over the Senate Armed Services Committee chair. Wicker is the architect of a plan to dramatically increase the defense budget to five percent GDP, with a $55 billion increase in FY25 alone. While that plan appeared dead on arrival under a Democratic administration, it may receive more support from a Trump White House. Wicker’s plan would raise all munitions production to maximum rates unless stocks are already above the required level, and call for the creation of alternate production lines to surge short-term capacity. It would also reform the Defense Production Act with updated authorities — which are not specified — and execute a $5.2 billion backlog of DPA projects on microelectronics, castings and forgings, and biomanufacturing. In the area of missile defense, the Defense Department should field the Guam defense system as soon as possible, reverse its decision to cancel the SM-3 Block 1B interceptor, and surge existing production lines for interceptors 'while exploring optionality in other systems like NASAMS, FrankenSAM, and others,' a summary of the plan states. The plan recommends a list of service-specific priorities, calling on the Navy to improve the health of the shipbuilding industrial base so it can deliver a 355-ship fleet — with Wicker’s proposal even laying out a path to get to to 357 ships by 2035. It includes reforms to get submarine builders to three Virginia-class attack subs per year and the creation of a 'large scale industrial base program' for surface combatants, which would cost $20 billion over five years. The Navy should also accelerate its buy of unmanned underwater vessels and surface drones, and use multi-year procurement to buy amphibious ships. Wicker’s plan states that the Air Force should buy at least 340 more fighter aircraft over the next five years and 'at least double' B-21 bomber procurement, currently set for 100 planes. It also directs the Air Force to begin a rapid acquisition program for the E-2D Hawkeye instead of buying the E-7 Wedgetail. The Army should 'adopt lessons war in Ukraine,' and field new air defense and counter-UAS units, the plan says. It should also accelerate the development of long-range munitions and command-and-control technologies for operations in the Western Pacific. Meanwhile, the Marine Corps needs to make 'major' investments in technologies to enable sophisticated contested logistics and accelerate its Force Design 2030 plans.

Trump’s defense secretary should focus on internal Pentagon challenges to meet external threats	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) As the Trump administration begins the process of forming its government and assuming the presidency, one of the most consequential decisions will be selecting the next secretary of defense. This person will be charged with the immense responsibility of leading two million uniformed military members and nearly 750,000 civilian employees across the globe. The secretary of defense is really three jobs rolled into one. The first is that the secretary is a global leader, travelling the world to advance US national security and guiding combat and non-combat operations 24/7 in all domains. The second is that the secretary is the largest employer in the United States, leading one of the most complex organizations ever assembled, with a budget of over $850 billion per year. Lastly, the secretary is the principal assistant to the president in all matters relating to the Department of Defense and serves on the National Security Council. The 'to-do' list on day one for the incoming secretary will be staggering, with two ongoing wars, an aggressive China, and the responsibilities of working with the president on crafting the National Security Strategy within the National Security Council process. These will undoubtedly be the most urgent tasks, drawing the secretary towards jobs number one and three above. If the incoming defense chief does this, they will be following a well-worn path of outsourcing the management of the Pentagon to the deputy secretary of defense. This, however, would be a substantial mistake. The most urgent and strategically important job that the secretary must personally be involved in is the management of the department, the second job mentioned above. Our military is in its most perilous shape since the end of the 1970s: Woefully behind in utilizing existing technologies, sized for one-short war which our adversaries are willing to take advantage of, and burdened with an acquisition process and programs that cost billions to deliver hand-crafted weapons that cannot be manufactured to scale and often do not even work. Finally, if that is not bad enough, the military is short of people, and a coming demographic cliff is going to exacerbate this problem right at the time we need to project strength to our adversaries. The secretary should therefore come in and personally lead the charge to fix three things inside the Pentagon: acquisition, resources, and recruiting. Much ink has been spent describing in detail the disaster that is the acquisition system within the Pentagon. While some former secretaries such as Bob Gates and Ash Carter have tried to fix the system, it has, to date, remained stuck in the 1970s, producing high-cost, low-volume, and technologically-antiquated systems. Fixing this cannot be outsourced to the Deputy Secretary or the acquisition chief. Only the Secretary of defense, over the course of four years, will be able to drive the change that is needed. On day one, the secretary should come in and signal his or her seriousness by cancelling a major weapon system built for a past fight — think the Joint Strike Fighter or the Army’s Future Vertical Lift —vowing to use all of the dollars to invest in unmanned systems, artificial intelligence, and the mass production of weapons. Why go after the dollars immediately rather than changing acquisition regulations? Because if the secretary did the latter, the bureaucracy would wait him or her out and four years would go by without change. Next, the secretary must address the fact that the budget of the Pentagon is currently sized to fight only one, short-term war. Some will make the argument that the nation should pivot away from the Middle East and Europe in order to fit our national strategy to the fiscal constraints of the current budget. This, however, belies the fact that today, the North Koreans are supplying troops to the Russians to fight a war in Europe with Iranian weapons bought with oil proceeds from China. Our adversaries are using the entire globe to challenge us and no amount of 'wish-casting' is going to change that. On day one, the secretary should come in and signal his or her seriousness by stating that the new force-sizing construct for the military will be to fight one long war, with two simultaneous small wars. This matches up with the incoming president’s strategy of peace through strength. This new force-sizing construct will then drive the budget process going forward. And while the defense secretary doesn’t control the budget, they should use their early juice in the new role to push Congress to step up spending. Sen. Roger Wicker, who might become the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has put together a plan that provides an additional $55 billion to the Pentagon per year. This should be a starting point. Finally, but probably most importantly, the military needs people to serve. The wars in both Europe and the Middle East are teaching us the same lesson: That in a test of wills, the side that runs out of people and money first will lose. With wages in the private sector heading higher and a smaller number of available 18-years olds due to a demographic cliff expected to start in 2026, the secretary has no time to waste. On day one, they should signal their seriousness by stating that the Department of Defense supports the Congressional plan to dramatically increase the pay of the junior enlisted force. Some have said that the world is dangerously close to tipping into an all-out war. One way to prevent war is to make sure that those who wish you harm believe that they cannot prevail. This can only be done through an American military force that is utilizing the most technologically sophisticated weapons, produced at a scale that cannot be matched by our rivals, and used by the best service members the world has ever seen. Through strength comes peace. While the incoming secretary of defense will want to look to travel the globe and tend to the White House, his or her most important task is to first fix the Pentagon.

Weapons and radars built with modular design are relevant and flexible as threats evolve	Through the lens of new weapons development, Raytheon Advanced Technology employs composability as a catalyst for speed for weapon systems like hypersonic missiles. (Raytheon photo). Delivering new sensing and weaponry capability at the 'speed of relevance' is the idea behind quickly countering adversarial threats in the battlespace. Too often, though, ideas stay just that, concepts that do not effectively lead to solutions. The lost possibilities are sensors and weapons that have little commonality between them so they take longer and cost more to produce and can’t share data across warfighting and security domains. There are, however, major new systems in production now for both the U.S. Navy and Army that have gone from conception to becoming the cornerstone of air and missile defense in just a handful of years due to engineering principals built around 'composable' weapons and software-defined apertures. One of those systems is the Navy’s AN/SPY-6 (V) active electronically scanned array radar now undergoing sea trials. The Navy is integrating SPY-6 into its surface fleet beginning with the USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125), first of the Arleigh Burke-class Flight III destroyers, and the USS Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29), an amphibious landing ship that introduced the (V)2 variant. Another is the Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, or LTAMDS. The program has advanced through multiple live-fire tests of the 360-degree radar, demonstrating the radar's performance. Both programs are the centerpieces of their respective services air and missile defense modernization strategies, and both were architected in the Advanced Technology (AT) business of Raytheon. Building atop foundational blocks Raytheon’s Advanced Technology team is bringing ideas to fruition through the use of foundational building-blocks that enable technical innovations like software-defined apertures for radars and composable weapon architectures for missiles and other weaponry. Through the lens of new weapons development, composability is a catalyst for speed. Over the last decade, AT has architected the use of common, scalable, modular hardware and software building blocks, allowing the company to deliver faster and streamline its factories. 'It's absolutely central to all of our new weapon developments and pursuits,' said John C. Otto, Raytheon AT’s technology director. 'It's a toolbox of subsystems that we can pull together and use again and again with common interfaces without having to recreate the wheel from the beginning on each of them.' In missile development, for example, one of the core but common subsystems is guidance electronics. What Raytheon AT has done is partition the functionality across the guidance unit so that if more processing is desired, cards can be easily added to support that. Or vice versa; processing can be dialed back for less complex missions where the additional capability and subsequent cost is not needed. With commonality of hardware, customers can bundle buys at lower cost and take advantage of common factories and test equipment. From the standpoint of the engineering workforce, different programs look much the same so that personnel can move between programs and only have to learn the particulars of that one program as opposed to an entirely new system. They experience the same look and feel of a program down to the fundamental software level. The result is higher efficiency, faster development, and quicker upgrades to combat adversarial challenges. In radar development, Raytheon Advanced Technology uses a building block approach to create a software-defined aperture architecture to control and update radars and other weapon systems. (Raytheon photo). Software-defined apertures for system updates Radar structures built with modular blocks can be scaled larger for massive sensing capability for advanced warships like Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, or – using the exact same blocks – scaled down for the needs of an LPD. The Navy’s SPY-6 radar is a perfect example of how Raytheon AT used this approach to develop and scale radar systems for different customers, missions, and vessels. Each building block for the SPY-6 family of radars is a 2’x2’x2’ box called the radar modular assembly, or RMA. Each RMA is a self-contained radar antenna and arrays of different sizes for different uses can be made by stacking RMAs together. 37 RMAs make up each of the four faces of the SPY-6(V)1 radar on the DDG 51. The SPY-6(V)2 rotating array on the Nimitz class has nine RMAs, and the three faces of the SPY-6(V)3 on Ford-class carriers and the FFG(X) frigates also have nine RMAs. The four faces of the SPY-6(V)4 radar on the DDG 51 Flight IIA destroyers have 24 RMAs. Modular radar technology is also used in the GhostEye family of radars, including the Army’s LTAMDS radar. 'Think of your hardware as a capability that is unlocked with software commands,' explained Matt Tyhach, mission area director for next generation sensors and microelectronics at Raytheon AT. 'You may have a radar that is capable of detecting slow low-flying drones and then with software commands you can reoptimize its configuration to detect fast high-flying ballistic missiles. Very different target sets, but we can leverage the power and flexibility of our radar hardware baseline to stay ahead of the threat by upgrading performance through safe, secure software only upgrades.' From a radar development perspective, AT uses such building blocks to create a software-defined aperture architecture, rather than a conventional radar approach, to create flexible hardware solutions that serve multiple missions. Software apps like those on cell phones make it simpler to control and update the radars and other weapon systems. This modular approach to radar development, coupled with robotic assembly of each system, allows Raytheon to rapidly field radars for different missions. As new capabilities via software upgrades are developed, they’re added to the company’s common radar software product line, which is shared and re-used across multiple radar programs. 'This is a common library of radar software that was first developed for SPY-6 and as we learn more from sea trials and first deployment, that learning is all fed back into the common baseline for future radar franchises, including LTAMDS.' said Tyhach. 'Likewise, LTMADS is fielding its first units now at WSMR (White Sands Missile Range) and that learning is fed into the common radar baseline to benefit SPY-6 and expand our trusted and tried software without the larger non-recurring engineering build of most heritage non-software defined systems.' Matching weapons system capabilities to the mission Raytheon Advanced Technology has found the pathway to addressing complexity through the simplicity wrought by modularity and reuse of components that match weapon system capabilities to the mission – no more, no less – while software-defined apertures let those same systems modernize remotely as threats evolve.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/weapons-and-radars-built-with-modular-design-are-relevant-and-flexible-as-threats-evolve/	2024-11-12T05:19:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Raytheon-Hypersonic.png
SPACECOM to Huntsville? Bets are on ‘yes,’ and possibly soon	The Army's Redstone Arsenal is home to Army Space &amp; Missile Defense Command, the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center among other organizations. (Photo: US Army) WASHINGTON — Space watchers say the odds are high that President-elect Donald Trump will redirect US Space Command headquarters to Huntsville, Ala., once he is in office — reversing the July 2023 decision by President Joe Biden to keep the command based in Colorado Springs, Co. 'I think it's a virtual certainty. He can announce it in the first 100 days, but the process will take many years and appropriations from Congress. But I think SPACECOM will end up moving to Huntsville,' said Todd Harrison, a long-time space analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. Those expressing confidence in such a move also include Alabama's senior Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville. 'Sen. Tuberville has spoken with President Trump several times about the importance of moving Space Command back to its rightful home in Huntsville,' a spokesperson for Tuberville's office told Breaking Defense. The spokesperson also pointed to a Nov. 7 interview with Tuberville on WREC radio station's 'Alabama Morning News with JT' show, where the senator stated that Huntsville was the 'best place' for SPACECOM HQ due to the level of security there. 'There is no doubt it's the best place, and it's secure. They're not secure out there [in Colorado]. But, again, I've told President Trump, listen, get a Secretary of Air Force. Let's go through this process again—[it's a] short period of time,' Tuberville said. 'It won't take long and I know where it's gonna go. Let's just do it the right way. Politics don't need to be involved. It needs to be done for the military and the people of this country,' he added. Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that plans for making such a move already exist — given that Trump had decided on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville as SPACECOM's home just before he left the Oval Office for the first time in January 2021. 'It's a safe bet that Space Command is going to Rocket City. Worth dusting off plans for the 60-acre site previously identified for a new Redstone headquarters,' he told Breaking Defense. Redstone Arsenal, a US Army post, currently is home to a number of service organizations, including Army Space and Missile Defense Command. It also houses the Missile Defense Agency and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The SPACECOM basing decision has been a political football between the Alabama and Colorado congressional delegations since 2018, and the subject of investigations in 2022 by both the Pentagon's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and Congress's watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act passed in December 2023, lawmakers blocked funding for additional facilities at the Colorado location and mandated yet another investigation by the OIG, this time into the fairness of Biden's decision to let the command stay where it was. GAO, likewise, opened another investigation in September 2023. Nonetheless, then-SPACECOM commander Army Gen. Jim Dickinson on Dec. 15, 2023 declared that the command had reached 'full operational capability' at Peterson SFB, including having the necessary infrastructure 'to support command and control across mission and business functions.' In a long thread on LinkedIn over the past week, commenters including current and former military officials raised questions about the costs of moving the headquarters now that it has had time to settle in, as well as the potential effects on mission readiness. One big concern cited was whether there will be a huge brain drain among the civilian workforce because many will not want to move from Colorado Springs. However, some other analysts keeping eyes on SPACECOM told Breaking Defense that perhaps that expected attrition in personnel would be a good thing — shaking up status quo thinking about the command's mission, and making room for new blood.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/spacecom-to-huntsville-bets-are-on-yes-and-possibly-soon/	2024-11-11T11:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Army-redstone-arsenal-e1731352925128.jpg
Army inks $435 million deal for new TNT production facility	Paladin artillery crews assigned to 3rd Battalion, 29th Field Artillery Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division conduct Table VI qualifications in February 2017, firing the first 155-mm rounds in Poland at the training site. (US Army/Staff Sgt. Elizabeth Tarr) WASHINGTON —As part of the Army’s quest to boost weapons production, it is reestablishing TNT production on US soil, inking a deal to build out a new facility in Graham, Ky. 'For the first time in decades, America will produce TNT on its own soil, manufacturing the explosive material our military uses for everything from hand grenades to 155mm artillery,' outgoing Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a press release. McConnell’s comments came after the service announced a new $435 million deal last Friday, tasking Repkon USA with designing and building out the new explosives production facility that should be completed by early November 2028. 'This is a major step forward in rebuilding our industrial base and ensuring we have the critical capabilities to support our warfighters,' Army acquisition head Douglas Bush said in the press release. 'Reshoring TNT production gives us the ability to control and secure our supply chain for this vital component, especially in an era of increasing global challenges.' TNT is used to produce an array of explosive weapons including ammunition, bombs and 155-millimeter artillery rounds, but the military has been reliant on overseas sources. The decision to build out a new production comes as service leaders work to scale weapon production in the wake of the Ukraine war, including 155mm artillery rounds. By fiscal 2026, the service is aiming to have the capacity to produce 100,000 rounds each month. To get there, Bush previously said the Army plans to spend $4.2 billion to build up the industrial base across various initiatives, to include commissioning three new domestic facilities to support 155mm production and a new metal parts production facility in Canada. 'This new state-of-the-art [TNT] facility is essential to the … mission to develop, procure and field safe, reliable and lethal munitions to our joint warfighters and international partners,' Maj. Gen. John T. Reim, the joint program executive officer for armaments and ammunition, said in the Army press release. 'This project will also further strengthen our defense industrial base, enabling munitions production at speed and scale.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-inks-435-million-deal-for-new-tnt-production-facility/	2024-11-11T11:23:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/TNT-story-scaled.jpg
German MoD picks up tab for ICEYE-Rheinmetall SAR-sat data sales to Ukraine	Image of the Davis-Monthan Air Force 'Boneyard' in Tucson, Ariz., US, March 1, 2024. (ICEYE) WASHINGTON — Finnish satellite operator ICEYE and German arms maker Rheinmetall today announced they have jointly signed a contract to provide Ukraine's armed forces with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery — with funding provided by Germany's Ministry of Defense. 'The agreement further increases the SAR data and other support Ukraine has been receiving from ICEYE' since Russia's assault on the country in February 2022, according to the Rheinmetall press release. 'This provision will supplement further reconnaissance data obtained by other sensors and provide the basis for decision-making and operational planning by the Ukrainian armed forces. The collaboration includes dedicated satellite capacity and constellation access, which allows the capacity of the entire ICEYE satellite fleet to be utilized. Since 2018, ICEYE has launched 38 satellites for ICEYE’s and its customers’ use,' it adds. Rheinmetall did not release the value of the German contract. The two firms first inked a cooperation accord in June, and in September Düsseldorf-based Rheinmetall procured the exclusive rights to market ICEYE's products to 'military and government end users' in Germany and Hungary, according to an Oct. 9 Rheinmetall press release. Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall AG, said at the time: 'The space domain is an integral part of a defence strategy and of great relevance to our military clients. We are convinced that our combined capabilities will enable us to develop innovative approaches to offer customized solutions for our military customers in the future.' SAR satellites, which can take high-resolution images day and night regardless of weather conditions, have been particularly useful for Ukraine's warfighting capability, given the preponderance of cloudy weather in the country. ICEYE was an early provider, in August 2022 offering Kiev access to its constellation via an agreement with the Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation in Ukraine for one of the company's satellites to be designated for Ukrainian government use. In July 2024, ICEYE and Ukraine's government signed a new 'Memorandum of Cooperation' to expand their collaboration.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/german-mod-picks-up-tab-for-iceye-rheinmetall-sar-sat-data-sales-to-ukraine/	2024-11-11T08:58:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/ICEYE-Press-Release_Aircarft_Boneyard_US-e1731343102183.png

Embraer signed a contract with the Netherlands and Austria for a combined order of the C-390 during the show. (Tim Martin/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Sweden has selected the Brazilian-made C-390 for its next military transport aircraft, creating another strong defense industrial tie between the two nations. Stockholm announced it was signing a letter of intent over the weekend to purchase the C-390, produced by Embraer, which will open the way for negotiations to begin. Sweden joins Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Netherlands and Portugal as European operators of the Millennium, which has also been purchased by South Korea and, of course, home country Brazil. Quantities and cost were not disclosed in the announcement. Sweden currently operates six Lockheed Martin-made C-130H aircraft, and a one-for-one replacement would make sense given Sweden’s military needs and its recent membership in NATO. Every win for the C-390 is important, but adding another NATO nation to its user base is a particularly large victory for Embraer as the company seeks to expand its global footprint — and, it hopes, break into the lucrative US market. As Breaking Defense first reported, Embraer and US-based L3Harris are no long working together to market the tanker variant of the 390 to the US Air Force. However, Bosco da Costa Jr., the company’s defense chief, said in an interview that Embraer is still pursuing sales to the Air Force, positioning the Millennium as a multi-mission aircraft able to fill multiple needs. 'You can use this airplane to do air-to-air refueling, but in some hours, you could do the plane to do transport, to do search and rescue, to do other types of missions, not necessarily only for air-to-air refueling,' he told Breaking Defense last month. 'That is an advantage.' The letter of intent was signed on Saturday by Sweden’s Minister for Defence Pål Jonson and Brazil’s Minister of Defense José Múcio. A Swedish announcement of the LOI was also accompanied by a statement that Brazil plans to increase its buy of Jas 30 Gripen fighters by 25 percent. Brazil currently has 36 Gripens on order, so a 25 percent increase would mean nine additional fighters. Embraer and Saab have a joint production agreement, with Gripens being produced in-country in Brazil as part of the 2014 decision to purchase the jets. 'Aerospace cooperation is important to both Sweden and Brazil. The new letter of intent provides a basis for us to further deepen this cooperation,' Jonson said in a statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/sweden-selects-brazils-embraer-c-390-transport-aircraft-brazil-eyes-more-gripens/	2024-11-11T05:24:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
US Olympic Defender allies seek ‘common’ space picture	Space Delta 5 and the Combined Space Operations Center, one of five centers under US Space Forces &#8211; Space, on Nov. 4-6. 2024 hosted a meeting of the Operation Olympic Defender Common Operating Picture working group at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., including Australian, Canadian and British representatives. (US Space Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Luke Kitterman) WASHINGTON — The US and some of its closest allies in Operation Olympic Defender (OOD) this week launched 'initial' efforts to create new standards for sharing space monitoring data — the necessary foundation for developing a common view of the space battlefield, according to US Space Command (SPACECOM). Earlier this week the Space Force's Space Delta 5 and the Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC) 'hosted a 3-day Operation Olympic Defender Common Operational Picture (COP) working group, consisting of space representatives from the Australian Space Operations Centre, Canadian Space Operations Centre and United Kingdom National Space Operations Centre,' SPACECOM said in a press release Thursday. Operation Olympic Defender is the US military's plan for space warfighting, alongside a select group of key allies. 'It’s essential that the [Olympic Defender] allies and partners have a shared understanding of the battlespace, to ensure mission impacting decision-making is based on common perceptions of what’s occurring and likely to occur in the Area of Responsibility,' said Royal Australian Air Force Group Captain Julien Greening, CSpOC deputy director. Space Delta 5's mission is to 'prepare, present, and fight' forces to SPACECOM for 'operational-level command and control,' according to SPACECOM's website. SPACECOM's CSpOC brings together the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to collaborate on space command and control. Both organizations are located at Vandenberg SFB, Calif. Since July, Col. Justin Sorice is double-hatted as commander of both. As of last month, the same group of countries also are members of Operation Olympic Defender. At a meeting last year, the Operation Olympic Defender allies agreed on the need for commanders to be able to collectively see what is happening in space at the same time. At the meeting this week, the working group reviewed 'risks and mitigations, refined the concept of operation, and update the plan to develop a shared Space COP,' the SPACECOM press release explained. Further, the group also 'reviewed and contributed initial requirements and identifying standards to cooperatively produce shared situation understand of the space environment,' the release said. 'The team will build on data provided by the US Space Surveillance Network and utilize the existing Global Command and Control System – Joint, as the initial means of generating and displaying space track information integrated with available intelligence and environmental information, to provide the user a fused battlespace picture,' it added. Both the UK and Australia are in the process of standing up two of three planned sites for the US Deep Space Advanced Radar (DARC) to track satellites and dangerous space junk in far away orbits with more precision. (The third site will be in the US.) The first radar, in Western Australia, will become operational in 2026; all three are expected to be online by 2030. Canada is at the start of an effort to develop a successor to its aging Sapphire satellite that keeps tabs on the heavens. The project, called 'Surveillance of Space 2,' is expected to cost as much as $250 million CAN to $499 million CAN ($180 million USD to $358 million USD), according to a Ministry of Defence fact sheet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-olympic-defender-allies-seek-common-space-picture/	2024-11-08T12:30:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Operation-Olympic-Defender-Space-COP-working-group-Nov.-2024-scaled-e1731096548525.jpeg
Eyeing future CCA missions, Navy teams with Lockheed, GA to test new drone control system	Navy unmanned aerial vehicle pilots check the readouts during a test of a new Lockheed control system working with a General Atomics CCA 'surrogate' on Nov. 5, 2024. (NAVAIR) WASHINGTON — US Navy pilots sitting comfortably in Maryland recently took a new carrier-based drone control center out for a spin for the first time, piloting a General Atomics MQ-20 Avenger thousands of miles away using autonomous tech made by Lockheed Martin's secretive Skunk Works division. The live-flight test of the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control Station (UMCS), conducted Nov. 5, was done 'as part of an effort to advance technology for future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA),' Naval Aviation Systems Command wrote in a release on Thursday. Both the Air Force and the Navy are pushing forward with CCA — essentially robotic drone wingmen to fly alongside or ahead of manned aircraft in combat operations — seen as the future of air dominance. 'This was a huge step for unmanned naval aviation,' Navy Air Vehicle Pilot (AVP) Lt. Steven Wilster said in the Navy release. 'This demo showcased UMCS’s first live control of an unmanned air vehicle, and it was great to be part of history in the making. The team is paving the way for integrating critical unmanned capability across the joint force to combat the high-end threat our warfighters face today and in the future.' For the test, Navy pilots in Patuxent River, Maryland, controlled the jet-powered MQ-20, which served as a 'surrogate' for a future CCA bird, as it sliced through the sky in California, according to the Navy and a Lockheed announcement today. 'UMCS is laying a foundation that will enable control of all unmanned carrier aircraft, starting with the MQ-25 aircraft,' Capt. Daniel Fucito, program manager for the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation Program Office, said in the Navy release. 'The UMCS opens the door for efficiently introducing future unmanned systems into the complex carrier command and control architecture.' The Navy's control station is built on what Lockheed Martin calls its 'MDCX autonomy platform,' which Skunk Works Vice President and General Manager John Clark said was used to 'rapidly integrate the MQ-20 &#8216;autonomy core' with the UMCS, demonstrating common control capability and third-party platform integration.' While both the Air Force and the Navy hope to see CCAs flying alongside their fighters and bombers within a few years, the services are pursuing the efforts separately. The Air Force has selected two platforms for its first tranche of aircraft, an aircraft from General Atomics's Gambit family and Anduril's Fury. RELATED: &#8216;I don't see it': Before their CCA drones even take to the air, Anduril and GA trade shots The Navy appears to be further behind in its quest for an actual aircraft, but has ideas about what it wants and does not want. 'I want something that’s going to fly for a couple hundred hours. The last hour it’s either a target or a weapon. I’m either going to hit something with it or I’m going to train [a sensor on it] and shoot it down,' Rear Adm. Stephen Tedford, the Navy’s program executive for unmanned systems and weapons, said during the Sea Air Space conference in April. 'But I’m not going to sustain them for 30 years.' At the time, he added that the Navy was looking for a platform that comes it an under $15 million each. Wherever the Navy lands, it's certain the USN and USMC AVPs want a reliable UMCS, perhaps aided by LM's MDCX, to fly their CCAs for ISR, EW or combat missions ASAP.

DCMA builds ‘information dictionary’ to decode DoD acronyms, key terms	Artificial intelligence and technology (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Employees at the Defense Contracting Management Agency created a much-needed solution to decipher between the ever-changing accumulation of Department of Defense key phrases and acronyms. Leading up to the DCMA’s IT Training Summit Innovation Contest this past summer, IT workers created a tool, dubbed the Information Dictionary, to help the agency quickly look up and see definitions for the DoD’s jargon-heavy terms and acronyms. The team behind the product won second place in the competition, according to a press release from DCMA. 'There are so many DOD and DCMA unique acronyms, and new ones are always being developed that we’re often asking, ‘what does XXXX stand for?’' Andy Bradshaw, DCMA’s Total Force Directorate Policy Branch supervisor, said in the release. 'Then we go on a rabbit hunt trying to figure it out, and at times there is more than one meaning. The DCMA Information Dictionary saves us a lot of time and frustration in determining acronyms and their definitions. It’s a great tool for us, and it will be a great asset for new agency employees as well.' He added that before the Information Dictionary was created, the agency used an Excel spreadsheet to track these key terms and acronyms. The second-place team was made up of team lead and data architect Joseph Lowe; business architect Sabrina Francis; technology architect Larry Hairston; and security architect Keith Young. The team used artificial intelligence from reports made by Power BI — a business intelligence platform that helps turn raw data into usable observations — that combined data from the DCMA, DoD, Federal Acquisition Regulation and National Institute of Standards and Technology to build the tool. So far, it’s been used over 400 times in the past month by DCMA employees, the release said. 'We manually extracted data over a period of six months from over 660 documents including more than 28 thousand rows of data that defines over two thousand unique terms and acronyms, and nearly two thousand unique references,' Lowe said in the press release. Though the Information Dictionary is jam-packed with data, it’s actually 'very user-friendly,' Francis added. 'For example, you can pick a filter on the left-hand navigation such as ‘DCMA Acronyms’ then search the words in alphabetic order. Let’s say you pick the term ‘ACQDemo’ from the list. The filter will show you all the different possible names for that acronym plus any related capabilities and policies related to the term,' he said. The team noted that the tool has been helpful, but there are improvements to be made. For example, automating the process of adding new terms, acronyms and definitions is next on the list. While currently only available to employees within DCMA, eventually the Information Dictionary will be available to others. 'I’m proud to say our approach to documenting organizational information for enterprise architectural purposes will be presented to DOD, other federal agencies and industry in the coming months,' Lowe said in the release.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/dcma-builds-information-dictionary-to-decode-dod-acronyms-key-terms/	2024-11-08T10:38:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_AI_brain_icon_GettyImages-1296904409-scaled-e1663074689851.jpg
The US needs to get real about maneuver warfare in space	An upgraded Ground Based Interceptor with a Capability Enhanced-II Block 1 Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) is launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, during Flight Test Ground-based Midcourse Defense Weapon System-12, or FTG-12, on December 11, 2023 Recently, senior Space Force commanders have been articulating support for the use of maneuver warfare in space deterrence and warfighting operations. While laudable, upon further review, it appears that these statements are not speaking about maneuver warfare as much as they are about rapid movement of spacecraft to avoid intercept by an enemy spacecraft or ground-based threats. These passive defensive actions are not true maneuver warfare. And if the Space Force wants to get serious about being able to defeat enemy nations in space, it needs to stop tip-toeing around the issue. It’s time for America to put real investments into space weapons capable of targeting earth-bound targets. As defined by Robert Leonhard in his book, The Art of Maneuver, 'maneuver warfare' as 'the means of defeat[ing] … the enemy.' The objective is to achieve victory, not the sustainment of competition. To achieve this victory requires an aggressiveness that under current DoD space policy and strategy, is considered irresponsible. As Leonhard proclaims, 'maneuver warfare is, to put it simply, a kick in the groin, a poke in the eye, a stab in the back. It is quick, violent for a moment and unfair. It is decisive, even pre-emptive, at the expense of protocol and posturing.' To use Chinese military terms in their strategy document, The Science of Strategy, this type of attack should be 'rapid and destructive.' Second, in implementation, Leonhard correctly states that maneuver warfare 'puts a premium on being sneaky rather than courageous, … because it typically flees from the enemy’s strength.' By maneuvering for the 'kick in the groin' or a 'rapid and destructive' strike, instead of attacking the enemy’s advantage — its concentration of forces arrayed against friendly forces — the space force can hit the decisive points to win against the enemy. It means that a space warfighting force needs to render an enemy force irrelevant at the decisive point, whether that be 'a theater (area of responsibility), an area of operations, or on a battlefield.' Here’s a real world scenario for how this could play out. It’s not hard to figure out where China has put its heaviest investments: numerous open-source intelligence reports show China now has a very robust, multi-layered system of air, land, and maritime based weapons to achieve counter-intervention or in Western parlance, anti-access/area-denial, in the first and second island chains of the Indo-Pacific. Beijing has large numbers of ships and missiles, interior lines between mainland China and Taiwan, industrial capacity that harkens back to the United States in World War II, and a centralized command structure sitting atop a authoritarian state. Its space deterrence and warfighting strategy and capability are proactive, pre-emptive and follow the principles of 'rapid and destructive' maneuver warfare to seek and sustain the advantage all the way to victory. In fact, according to the Army War College, wargames indicate that the United States, in a traditional, air, maritime, and land-based terrestrial fight, will lose significant combat power quickly. This is because terrestrial US military forces are too small, their supply lines are too vulnerable, and 'American’s defense industrial capacity is far too eroded to keep up with the material demands of a high-intensity conflict.' The way to beat this situation and to render the enemy force irrelevant terrestrially through attack operations within the space AOR, is to re-frame the Space Force from a mere support service into the primary door kicking, maneuver force for the United States. To do this requires the development of space-to-ground weapons (SGWs), whose focus would be to make Chinese concentrations of terrestrial and space counter-intervention forces in the Western Pacific irrelevant by holding them at risk. Once deployed, SGWs would provide enhanced space deterrence during peacetime and crisis, and if necessary, destroy threats to US terrestrial forces by rolling back barriers to entry for our smaller air, land, and maritime forces. The current technology at our disposal, coupled with less expensive lift, heavy lift, and soon to be super heavy lift rockets, means there are ways to get small constellations of SGWs deployed around Earth, capable of achieving five-minute target revisit rates with little defense to stop them. The Chinese have already demonstrated they are pursuing similar capability through their Fractional/Orbital Bombardment System (FOBS) system. Therefore, we should position our space forces into the front of the line to ensure decisiveness in such a conflict. There is no need for US forces to attack using an old 20th Century method of terrestrial concentration of force and lose, when we can negate the A2/AD advantage/barriers to entry for terrestrial air, land, and maritime forces through orbital strike forces. Granted, this advantage would only last as long as the adversary lacks an effective counter-force, but those issues can be addressed as well by a proper organizational and budgetary perspective grounded in the strategic reality of the current threat environment. This is the role the Space Force should be accomplishing-providing for the decisive advantage over enemy terrestrial force advantage through maneuver warfare in and from space.

With help from Italy to Brazil, UAE’s EDGE Group beefs up maritime capabilities under new deals	The Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group shows of missiles and drones at its stand at Eurosatory 2024. (Lee Ferran / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — United Arab Emirates defense conglomerate EDGE Group has signed three international agreements focused on maritime capabilities and autonomous systems, and one to upgrade neighboring marine vessels this week during the 2024 Euronaval exposition in Paris. The first was sealed with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to codevelop underwater solutions in the UAE, the second was signed with the Brazilian navy to codevelop counter-drone systems, and the third was signed with French defense firm Lacroix to equip EDGE Group's RABDAN fast attack boats with decoy systems. The fourth agreement was with the Kuwaiti coast guard to repair some of its ships. 'The MoU [with Fincantieri] would see both groups collaborate on the design, development, and creation of advanced manned and unmanned underwater systems solution capability in the United Arab Emirates through their recently launched, Abu Dhabi-based shipbuilding joint venture, MAESTRAL,' a statement this week from EDGE Group said. 'This preliminary agreement will pave the way and boost for developing sophisticated solutions tailored to the unique underwater needs of navies worldwide.' EDGE Group and Fincantieri launched MAESTRAL in February this year to codevelop naval systems in the UAE. The joint venture has prime rights to non-NATO orders and a number of strategic orders placed by selected NATO member countries, EDGE said. The agreement will be the first step for the Emirati firm in underwater development. 'From the outset, we recognized that only through collaboration and partnership could we develop the technologies and expertise necessary for EDGE to lead in the air, land, sea, cyber, and space domains. Our ongoing partnership with Fincantieri exemplifies this strategy, opening limitless opportunities for both companies in the joint development and production of advanced surface and underwater naval solutions,' said EDGE Group CEO Hamad Al Marar in the statement. Gulf State Analytics analyst Leonardo Jacopo Maria Mazzucco told Breaking Defense that this agreement shows the evolution of the relationship between the two firms. 'Once a hungry buyer of Fincantieri’s products, the UAE has gradually sought to shift its role in the defense products marketplace, turning from a loyal customer into a reliable industrial partner for the Italian shipbuilder,' he said. Mazzucco stated that the benefits are not only to develop defense solutions 'capable of partially offsetting the shortage of manpower in the UAE Navy,' but also to support 'EDGE’s quest to generate revenue streams from the manufacturing of high added value military products for the export market.' EDGE’s agreement with the Brazilian navy aims to develop autonomous surface and aerial defense systems, specifically developing and deploying counter-drone systems 'This preliminary agreement to pursue the joint development and delivery of sophisticated counter-drone technologies and solutions will not only ensure that both parties benefit from the sharing of knowledge and innovation but will also enable us, as partners, to become leaders in the field, meeting sovereign needs and eventually those of other export markets in the face of modern naval and airborne threats,' said the Director General of Material for the Brazilian Navy Adm. Edgar Luiz Siqueira Barbosa. EDGE Group subsidiary Abu Dhabi Ship Building (ADSB) also inked a deal with LaCroix at Euronaval to equip its RABDAN FA-400 fast attack boats with decoy systems and countermeasures. The RABDAN fast attack vessel is a 45-meter long boat designed for patrolling territorial and coastal borders. 'This [agreement] greatly enhances its [RABDAN's] defence capabilities, ensuring it is fully prepared to support military operations, search and rescue, surveillance, and patrol activities in modern maritime environments,' said David Massey, CEO of ADSB, in a statement. Mazzucco told Breaking Defense that the pace and level of partnerships between EDGE and European original equipment manufacturers have significantly accelerated during the past four years. 'The UAE has cultivated solid industrial partnerships with leading weapon companies to advance its localization ambitions and bolster employment opportunities for nationals. Regarding strategic industrial cooperation, the UAE’s partner-seeking strategy has prioritized partnerships with top European defense companies in the air, naval, and automation sectors for two reasons: First, these three domains are critical to ensuring the UAE's national security; second, they manufacture high-value defense products for export,' he said. The Emirati firm didn’t leave the French naval expo without sealing a contract with Kuwait for the reconstruction, repair, development, and upgrade of Kuwaiti Coast Guard marine vessels. The work is expected to take place at the shipyard in Abu Dhabi, though the value and timeline of the deal were not announced.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/with-help-from-italy-to-brazil-uaes-edge-group-beefs-up-maritime-capabilities-under-new-deals/	2024-11-08T06:13:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/1000001673-scaled-e1718887127547.jpg
Israel signs $5.2 billion deal for 25 new F-15 fighter jets	Israeli Air Force F-15 Strike Eagles accompany a U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer over Israel as part of a presence patrol above the U.S. Central Command’s area of responsibility Oct. 30, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Jerreht Harris) JERUSALEM — The Israel Ministry of Defense has signed what it called a 'landmark transaction' to acquire 25 more F-15 fighter aircraft in a deal worth $5.2 billion, the ministry announced today. The warplanes will be delivered beginning in 2031, and it will take around five years for them all to arrive. The deal was widely expected and has been in the process of finalization throughout the year as Israel has been fighting a multi-front war against Iran-backed proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen. Israel used F-15s in its long-range strike on Yemen in July. The US has also deployed F-15s to the region amid Israel-Iran tensions, illustrating how the Boeing-made plane, which first flew in the 1970s, is increasingly relevant today. The deal was finalized Wednesday 'following negotiations between the Israel Ministry of Defense’s Mission to the U.S. and Boeing in collaboration with the Israeli Air Force,' the Israeli MoD said in its announcement, adding that Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir signed an earlier 'procurement authorization' during a visit to the US last month. 'Boeing takes pride in its longstanding partnership with Israel, a relationship that dates back to our nation's establishment,' President of Boeing Israel Maj. Gen. (Ret.) Ido Nehushtan said. 'The company will continue working with the U.S. and Israeli governments to deliver the advanced F-15IA aircraft through standard military procurement channels.' Zamir was accompanied to the signing by the head of the Israeli Ministry of Defense’s mission to the US, Aviram Hasson. Israel has been considering a number of major aircraft and helicopter deals in recent years. The Oct. 7 attack by Hamas instilled additional urgency for some of this procurement, even though these deals take years to see aircraft delivered. In August, the US Secretary of State approved the potential Foreign Military Sale of the aircraft to Israel. At the time, the approval covered not only the 25 F-15s, but also an option to purchase 20 more of them and modification kits for F-15s Israel already operates. Should Israel pursue the full authorized deal, it would be worth $18 billion, the US said then. The F-15 was first flown in 1972, and one- and two-seater versions were delivered to the US military throughout the 1970s. Israel acquired its first F-15s late that same decade, and they have been a mainstay of the Israeli Air Force ever since. Since 2017 Israel has been considering buying new F-15s of the F-15EX variant. The deal only gained moment in the last year and a half. In June 2024 Israel also signed an agreement to buy a third squadron of F-35s. The agreement for the F-15s is 'part of a broader package of U.S. aid approved by the U.S. Administration and Congress earlier this year,' the Israeli Ministry of Defense noted. 'The new F-15IA aircraft will be equipped with cutting-edge weapon systems, including the integration of state of the art Israeli technologies. The upgraded aircraft will feature enhanced range capabilities, increased payload capacity, and improved performance across various operational scenarios,' the Ministry added. 'These advantages will enable the Israeli Air Force to maintain its strategic superiority in addressing current and future challenges in the Middle East.' Neither Boeing or the ministry elaborated on the statement or went into details about which Israeli systems might be incorporated into the aircraft. Israel has incorporated unique systems into its F-35 Adir. Zamir, the Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, praised the F-15 deal. 'We have secured procurement agreements worth nearly $40 billion (approximately NIS 150 billion) since the onset of the war. While focusing on immediate needs for advanced weaponry and ammunition at unprecedented levels, we're simultaneously investing in long-term strategic capabilities,' he said. He noted that the new squadron of F-15s and the new third squadron of F-35s Israel agreed to buy earlier this year 'represents a historic enhancement of our air power and strategic reach &#8211; capabilities that proved crucial during the current war.' Israel’s Calcalist reported that the new jets are meant to replace aging fighters, such as legacy F-15s and F-16s.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-signs-5-2-billion-deal-for-25-american-f-15s/	2024-11-07T14:05:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241107_DVIDS_israeli_f15s_6916781-scaled-e1731016811525.jpg
A second Trump administration won’t be ‘automatic disaster’ for Ukraine, NATO: Analysts	Then-NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg (L) shakes hands with Donald Trump (C), next to Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R), during a family photo as part of the NATO summit at the Grove hotel in Watford, northeast of London on December 4, 2019. (Christian Hartmann/Pool/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A shakeup to US and European relations is assured under a second Donald Trump administration, but several analysts say that does not necessarily spell doom for American support for Ukraine or Washington's future in NATO. 'It's essential for us to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin in Ukraine, and what Trump means for that is still unclear,' John Herbst, former ambassador to Ukraine and senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center, said today in a briefing with other Atlantic Council experts. Herbst said Trump's public praising comments about Putin and calls to end the war quickly could be balanced out by some of the voices in the president's inner circle, like Trump's former CIA Director Mike Pompeo and former National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien, both of whom would likely push back on any plan to cut support for Kyiv. Herbst said the potential for criticism from Trump's own party 'will have an impact, because one thing [Trump] does not want to be is taken for weak men and giving Ukraine to Putin or facilitating Putin's control of Ukraine, which will lead only to worse things for the United States.' Both Matthew Kroenig, vice president for the Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security at the Atlantic Council, and Atlantic Council senior fellow Rachel Rizzo concurred with Herbst’s take, while also noting that they expect Trump to make an attempt at striking some sort of negotiated settlement right out of the gate. 'He'll want to start out his presidency looking like a leader on the world stage rather than handing Ukraine to Russia, and in turn, looking like a capitulator,' Rizzo said. 'And what that means for Ukraine, I think, we'll have to wait and see but I'm not as convinced &#8230; that his presidency spells an automatic disaster for our Ukrainian partners.' Trump’s return to the White House will not just mean a potential push for a negotiated settlement between Moscow and Kyiv, or change for US weapons flowing to Ukraine. World leaders are also preparing for what his second term will mean for NATO after he has spent years questioning the alliance's value and publicly bashing countries not meeting the 2 percent GDP defense spending goal. In the intervening years since his first White House tour and with a war on European soil, more countries are now hitting that target, and there are discussions on bumping that spending figure up towards the 3-percent range. With nine out of 32 countries still shy of that threshold, Rizzo speculated that the incoming administration could view NATO though as more of a series of bilateral security agreements based on defense spending, or if the nation’s leader holds a similar word view to Trump. Will that mean a two-tiered NATO system where the US is officially unwilling to defend countries not spending 2 percent of their GDP, as Trump has suggested? Kroenig said he doubts that would become a White House policy, in part, because of those rumored to be in Trump’s cabinet including the likes of O'Brien, Pompeo and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark. But what the analysts did agree on is the pressure placed on new NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte to continue acting as the 'Trump whisperer' by playing up NATO’s importance and the steady march towards getting all members up towards the 2 percent GDP benchmark. 'That number is now at 23 — obviously that number should be at 32 — but Rutte needs to tell the story, and if part of that is allowing Trump to take credit for those defense spending increases, then I think that's fine, and I do think there is probably actually some truth to that,' she added. Rutte has already done just that when he publicly congratulated Trump for his reelection. 'When he was president he was the one in NATO who stimulated us to move over the 2 percent and now also thanks to him, in NATO, if you take out the numbers of the US for a moment, is above the 2 percent and I think very much that is his doing, his success, and we need to do more,' Rutte said ahead of a meeting of the European Political Community.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/a-second-trump-administration-wont-be-automatic-disaster-for-ukraine-nato-analysts/	2024-11-07T11:55:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241107_trump_nato_GettyImages-1186403739-scaled-e1731005326780.jpg
Canada inks $1.85 billion CAD deal with Lockheed for Halifax-class frigate support	Royal Canadian Navy Halifax-class frigate HMCS Regina (FFH 334) transits with the amphibious transport dock ship USS Green Bay (LPD 20) in a photo exercise (PHOTOEX) during Talisman Sabre 2019. (Photo by: HUM Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images) EURONAVAL 2024 — The Canadian government recently awarded Lockheed Martin Canada a contract valued at up to $1.85 billion Canadian dollars ($1.33 billion USD) for the continued combat system integration and in-service support of the Halifax-class frigates for their remaining operational lives. Glenn Copeland, general manager of rotary and mission systems for Lockheed’s Canada branch, told Breaking Defense here on Wednesday that Lockheed’s original long-term contract began in 2008 and ended recently. This new deal, he added, has options that persist through 2045, which is when the last frigate is expected to retire from the Royal Canadian Navy’s fleet. As the systems integrator, Lockheed's job and the contract's purpose centers around continually updating the software running the fleet's combat management system. 'The Royal Canadian Navy’s fleet of Halifax-class frigates are the backbone of maritime operations at home and abroad,' Bill Blair, Canada’s minister of national defence, said in the government's Oct. 31announcement. 'This in-service support contract will ensure our frigates remain operationally effective until the arrival of our future fleet of River-class destroyers.' RELATED: For US Navy's new frigate, design changes carry risks and rewards Lockheed's combat management system, dubbed CMS330, is proliferated throughout Canada’s fleet, but the new contract, also speaks to the state of the Royal Canadian Navy's fleet and the challenges its top admiral has bluntly acknowledged his force is faces. The Halifax class is considered an integral workhorse for the RCN’s operations. But with the first-in-class having entered the fleet in the 1990s and the last one needed to remain operational into the 2040s, Ottawa is endeavoring to keep that class online well past its original service life projecting its retirement in the 2030s. It’s a necessary measure until Canada brings online the Canadian Surface Combatant, its new warship that was recently named the River-class destroyer. That new class of ship is being built by Canada’s Irving Shipbuilding, which subcontracted Lockheed Martin for the design, a derivative of BAE Systems’ Type 26 Global Combat Ship. Copeland said the first three ships are under contract, and a second contract for another six is anticipated following a full-rate production decision later this year. The first ship is scheduled to be operational in the early 2030s. Lockheed's CMS330 combat management system will also be installed on the River class, which Copeland hopes will help to boost its reputation in an effort to sell it abroad in Europe. 'There’s a lot of countries out there right now that have either a MEKO-class or something similar that they want to modernize, plus a bunch of countries that are doing new hull construction warships that don’t' require the Aegis Combat System — a competing CMS also made by Lockheed that's favored by the US Navy but one that is a more expensive and niche capability compared to CMS330, he said. A 'MEKO' class of ships is a term that originates from German firm Blohm+Voss's family of warships that are multi-purpose in nature and focused on ease of maintenance and low cost. 'We’re on 42 platforms right now and I think in 10 years, we’ll be on well over 75,' Copeland added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/canada-inks-1-85-billion-cad-deal-with-lockheed-for-halifax-class-frigate-support/	2024-11-07T10:13:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/2411076_halifax_frigate_GettyImages-1354511708-scaled-e1730992861868.jpg
The right drone for special forces ISR: Mobile, long-range long-endurance, and a VTOL	Manufactured by Edge Autonomy, the VXE30 Stalker is the program-of-record platform for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PMA-263) long-range, long-endurance program. (Edge Autonomy photo). Whether the battlespace is on the European continent or islands in the Indo-Pacific, long-range, long-endurance reconnaissance has become a necessity for mobile and expeditionary operations. That means runway independent, Group 2 vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) platforms that operate from anywhere with a fixed wing for distance and time on station. These small Uncrewed Aircraft Systems (sUAS) enable multi-domain operations and Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control (CJADC2), and are also reasons why the U.S. Army selected a VTOL aircraft for its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft program. It’s also why the Army has said its Future Tactical Unmanned Aircraft System (FTUAS) will be a VTOL, and why U.S. Marine Corps Littoral Regiments already employ such ISR systems to delay, degrade, and deny adversary aggression. 'In the past, operators would have an AC-130, F-16, or a Reaper nearby that they could call in for ISR and support,' said Allen Gardner, Chief Technology Officer for Edge Autonomy. 'Now, the modern battlefield requires operators to go in alone with all their own capability, oftentimes without air support. On covert and sometimes clandestine operations, they need to carry an entire airborne ISR capability. Being fully capable without support is the new, modern way of doing business, at least for the special operations community.' They demand a platform that can provide a full-scope solution that is light, mobile, flexible, and portable, an aircraft with a small logistics footprint that can launch vertically from a rooftop or alleyway, fly hundreds of kilometers to perform a mission, and fly back intact. That’s an accurate description of what Edge Autonomy provides to the Marines and special forces in the form of the VXE30 Stalker, a Group 2 UAS VTOL platform for long-endurance, long-range mission support. Silent Stalker Manufactured by Edge Autonomy, the VXE30 Stalker is the program-of-record platform for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps Small Tactical Unmanned Aircraft Systems (PMA-263) long-range, long-endurance program. The VXE30 is also flying with U.S. Army Special Operations Command and special forces with Five Eyes (FVEY) countries. In addition, the VXE30 is part of the UK MoD’s plan to bring a new generation of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR) UAS into the British Army through the TIQUILA program. 'What we’re seeing is an expansion in the role of small UAS beyond ISR,' said Joshua Stinson, Chief Growth Officer for Edge Autonomy. 'You're adding a kinetic delivery capability, a COMINT collection capability, and forward observer roles for precision fire correction – all at a high TRL (technology readiness level) and MRL (manufacturing readiness level).' Powered by either a solid oxide fuel cell or a rechargeable battery, the VXE30 Stalker provides the endurance needed to complete complex aerial operations. The whole system can be set up and flying in 20 minutes by a crew of two and is packed in ruggedized containers that are small enough to be transported in a single minivan, pickup truck, or helicopter. A payload-agnostic platform built with a modular open systems approach (MOSA), the VXE30 Stalker can be equipped for advanced ISR missions with EO/IR payloads for observation, inspection, and surveillance capabilities such as day and nighttime object tracking and small moving target indication. With a ruggedized and field-proven solid-oxide fuel cell (SOFC), the Stalker can carry out long-range missions under even the most challenging circumstances. 'Our operators – and this is something that's been developed over 10 years and refined with the Marine Corps, especially MARSOC – can take dirty propane from any barbecue stand in a remote, austere location and fly the aircraft for eight hours,' said Stinson. The Havoc configuration of the VXE30 improves a variety of subsystems related to fuel efficiency, resulting in a doubling of the flight endurance and payload capacity of the base Stalker platform. (Edge Autonomy photo). Wreaking Havoc The demand signal from special forces and others is for more long-range reconnaissance capabilities in a small form factor and minimal logistics footprint. Edge Autonomy has met that challenge through the recent introduction of the Havoc configuration for the VXE30 Stalker, which has been deployed on six continents and proven in all theaters through more than 100,000 flight hours. Havoc improves a variety of subsystems related to fuel efficiency, and Edge Autonomy’s efforts have resulted in a doubling of the flight endurance and payload capacity of the base VXE30 platform. 'Blurring the distinction between the capabilities of small and large UAS, the Havoc configuration is a direct response to the mission requirement for long-range reconnaissance, which is slightly different from long-endurance reconnaissance,' said Gardner. 'You need endurance to achieve the range. But endurance combined with payload capacity combined with a beyond-line-of-sight communications capacity enables extraordinary range.' Without altering the VXE30’s configuration or changing its logistics footprint, Edge Autonomy has also tripled the payload capacity through the addition of wing tanks. With the Havoc configuration, Stalker can now fly hundreds of kilometers deep into terrain to perform missions, but still retain the all-electric silent profile and the small logistics footprint that makes the VXE30 platform the desired solution for these operators. The Havoc configuration has also demonstrated the ability to launch first-person-view drones from customized wing mounts. Said Stinson: 'That's another way to present a short-range capability while using a long-range aircraft as a delivery mechanism.' Where Group 2 UAS excel The impacts of small UAS on the battlefield in Ukraine – across air, ground, and maritime domains – have exposed a greater need for long-range, long-endurance ISR and targeting, not only there but in numerous other European and Scandinavian NATO countries that share borders with Russia. To secure, monitor, and react to such threats, platforms like Edge Autonomy’s VXE30 Stalker and Penguin C VTOL – with an endurance of up to 25 hours and line-of-sight range of 180 km – have shown themselves to be force multipliers. 'Previously, in order to get the kind of sensing capabilities that are needed, you had to have a large aircraft like a Reaper or Global Hawk that flies from a runway and can carry a heavy payload,' said Gardner. 'Sensors have been miniaturized now and it's amazing the sensing capabilities we can put on these platforms. 'When you can fly silent and can bring powerful sensors into the target, underneath the cloud deck, close proximity, low altitude, and be silent and covert, you can perform the missions in many ways more effectively than you can with a larger platform.' Large Group 4 and 5 platforms are non-factors in arenas like Ukraine because of contested environments and sophisticated air defenses on the modern battlefield. Those threats are even blocking Group 3 UAS from operating, creating a unique opportunity for a Group 2 platform that is light and mobile while still able to perform many of the same missions as the larger platforms. For example, the Group 2 VXE30 Stalker Havoc configuration can fly from the Philippines to the Spratly Islands to monitor the area with time on station. That’s a capability previously unheard of for a Group 2 aircraft. For a mission like that, the U.S. and Australian navies would typically use a much larger and costlier MQ-4C Triton. When it comes to long-range, long-endurance ISTAR, small UAS are following the familiar pattern of regular advancements in computing, communications, and sensors. That’s why special forces around the world are quickly realizing how much more they can accomplish with small platforms.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/the-right-drone-for-special-forces-isr-mobile-long-range-long-endurance-and-a-vtol/	2024-11-07T09:26:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/vlcsnap-2023-01-25-09h34m31s9591.png
US Air Force hit 2024 recruiting goal by meeting Americans where they are, not lowering standards	Pentagon Press Secretary US Air Force Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder conductions mediation for the fiscal year 2025 recruiting discussion panel at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Oct. 30, 2024. (DoD photo by US Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders) In today’s strong economy, recruiting successfully for the all-volunteer United States Air Force means overcoming strong and persistent headwinds. The challenges aren’t hard to find. Low unemployment, competitive private sector wages and benefits, and broader societal shifts such as the legalizing of marijuana and rising obesity rates, to name a few, make a complex job even harder. That reality is why we are proud that the US Air Force not only met our 27,200 active duty enlisted recruiting goal for this year, opening the aperture for more high-quality recruits to join in the future, but we also achieved it ahead of schedule. This stands in stark contrast to 2023 when the Air Force missed its goal of 26,877 new recruits. But as important as the raw number is — and it is important — this year’s success highlights a lesser known but equally important story about the way the Department of the Air Force looked at the world as it is and moved decisively to eliminate out-of-date and indefensible barriers that blocked capable recruits from joining the service. For example, while our standards for physical fitness and health remain rigorous, some policies persisted solely due to the 'way things have always been done' mentality. Recognizing we were denying enlistment into the Air Force for things like certain tattoos or body fat composition, we optimized these policies without diluting the qualities and capabilities we need in each recruit. In the real world it means we are no longer instantly rejecting smart and physically fit recruits simply because they have a small tattoo on the back of a hand — something that was happening just last year and conveyed to young Americans that our entry standards were out of sync with our nation’s current cultural norms. We also instituted a two-year pilot program allowing recruits who tested positive for THC at entry a chance to retest after 90 days. Unlike before when they would be forever banned after failing the first test, if they pass the second and meet all other requirements, they are provided an opportunity to complete basic training and ultimately join the Air Force. This common-sense change is a clear example of how we are adapting to a reality in which 24 states have now legalized the recreational use of marijuana, not to mention the ever-expanding variety of over-the-counter products that include various levels of THC. It’s important to recognize that amid these changes, there are aspects of recruiting that have not changed. Most importantly, we have not lowered the high standards required for Air Force and Space Force recruits. Nor does purposefully seeking to recruit any American interested, willing and capable to serve mean we’ve embraced shortcuts or polices not rooted in data and clear-eyed analysis. In fact, of the 5,800 recruits who were accepted under our updated body composition standard, only one failed to meet the physical fitness test required to graduate basic training. One other element that hasn’t changed is the dedication and prowess of our active duty and reserve recruiters stationed in communities across America. Over the course of the last year, we made training more focused and refined while also providing additional support not just to recruiters but to their families as well. Despite this year’s achievement, we are not taking our eye off the ball. We continue exploring new ideas for attracting qualified individuals to careers in our high-tech force. We are looking at ways, for example, to provide resources and time for those coming to us without a driver’s license to obtain one at their first duty station, rather than turn them away from certain career fields. We need everyone, whether they are destined to fly supersonic airplanes, to test and maintain them, or to take mission enabling roles as cyber warriors, trauma doctors and nurses, search and rescue specialists, law enforcement investigators, among many others. We understand too that with an ever-increasing military-civilian divide, we need to find ways to educate — and even excite — the public about the Air Force and what military service means. We must do even more to reconnect with young people where they are and find new ways to engage those with the greatest influence on their futures: their parents, coaches, teachers, guidance counselors, and even social media creators. We will continue to invest in growing propensity to serve — telling our story in new places and to people that haven’t heard it before — rather than just bemoaning it. Due to rapid technological change and our focus on great power competition, the Air Force in 10 or 20 years from now won’t look like the Air Force of today. But the one constant is this: Without the best people to operate and support our platforms, the edge we enjoy against our competitors and adversaries diminishes. Only when we can leverage the unique talents and skills of every community in America can we be ready for the threats our nation faces around the world. Winning future wars on a distant battlefield starts by winning the war for talent here at home. That means we need to enable the next generation to see uniformed service for the lifechanging opportunity it truly is, not from afar, or just in a museum, but in their lived experiences, no matter who they are.

Amrhein is the commander, Air Force Recruiting Service.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-air-force-hit-2024-recruiting-goal-by-meeting-americans-where-they-are-not-lowering-standards/	2024-11-07T08:15:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8726988-scaled-e1730819969920.jpg
Fincantieri openly eyeing Germany’s TKMS, even if deal not close	Italy's Fincantieri displays models from its military product line at Euronaval (Breaking Defense) EURONAVAL 2024 — The head of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri says the company is 'giving our availability' to the German government as Berlin looks to secure the sale of Thyssenkrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) in the wake of US investment firm Carlyle withdrawing interest. Fincantieri CEO Pierroberto Folgiero told reporters at Euronaval that 'We don't have numbers, we don't have business plans,' because a valorization process 'unlocking the value' of TKMS has to first run its course. 'It's a very strategic and intuitive exercise. Numbers will follow,' he added. 'We are at the disposal of the German system as a commercial partner, as an industrial partner, depending on their strategy &#8230; we are giving our availability because we believe that from an industrial perspective, it will make huge sense.' He also spoke in positive terms about Fincantieri's 25 years of collaboration with TKMS, adding, 'We know each other, we have a high respect of the management, respect of the product. Enhancing European collaboration, enhancing defragmentation &#8230; is what Europe needs.' The TKMS surface range includes Class 123, 124, 125 frigates, Class 130 corvettes and MEKO vessels. It also builds the Type 212CD submarine on order by Germany and Norway as part of a six ship deal agreed on in 2021 and valued at approximately €5.5 billion ($5.9 billion). TKMS's financial records also indicate that it holds backlog orders worth €11.8 billion. In October, TKMS CEO Oliver Burkhard said on LinkedIn that Thyssenkrupp had been notified of Carlyle’s decision to 'no longer pursue the valuation process for a possible partial sale' of the German naval business, before stressing that the move from the would-be buyer had 'nothing to do with the quality and financial performance of our company.' Fincantieri's newly released PPA Evo multipurpose combat ship features an array of armaments to support Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) missions (Breaking Defense) Based on confidentiality limitations, Burkhard did not outline why Carlyle walked away. The Financial Times reported that the decision was linked to German government 'indecision and scepticism,' around the prospect of a private equity firm taking on a major, local defense company. Burkhard also shared on social media that talks between TKMS and the German government have not finished. TKMS declined to comment. Parent company Thyssenkrupp has a long history of attempting to sell off its naval division, including rejecting past Fincantieri proposals and passing on interest from France's Naval Group, according to German business newspaper Handelsblatt. Elsewhere, Fincantieri launched a new version of its PPA multipurpose combat ship at Euronaval, dubbed PPA Evo, brought to market to deal with emerging threats and distinguished by a modular and reconfigurable design. The ship can accommodate 64 vertical launcher systems, eight anti-ship missiles, two 76mm guns, secondary 30/40mm Close in Weapon System (CIWS) guns, and can also host one Leonardo AW101 helicopter and one NH90 helicopter or a pair of NH90s, according to a company presentation. The integration of adaptable mission bays also enables the platform to deploy UAVs, UUVs and USVs. A virtual Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) suite mock up shared with media also showed off a range of subsystems for detecting and engaging threats, including a combat management system, dual band radar, Infrared Search and Track (IRST) applications, Omega360 radar, a fire control radar and a decoy launching system. Lead time for construction, between initial steel cutting through to delivery is expected to last between 48-50 months, said Roberto Olivari, senior vice president of naval vessel development and military innovation and research at Fincantieri. Italy has ordered seven PPAs but plans on acquiring an additional two, designed to the Evo standard, to make up for two vessels that are committed to Indonesia, following a €1.2 billion deal with Jakarta announced in March.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/fincantieri-openly-eyeing-germanys-tkms-even-if-deal-not-close/	2024-11-07T06:30:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/IMG_2233-1-scaled-e1730890343210.jpg
AUKUS faces little threat from Trump, Aussie officials say	Royal Australian Navy Collins-class submarines are set to be replaced in the 2040's by a UK designed SSN AUKUS fleet. (Australia DoD) CANBERRA — Senior Australian officials declared their relations with the United States sound in the wake of the victory of president-elect Donald Trump, dismissing concerns that the tripartite enterprise of AUKUS would be harmed. 'AUKUS is in the strategic benefit and interest of Australia, the United States and the UK. That's the fundamental point here,' Defense Minister Richard Marles told a small group of reporters at the Submarine Institute of Australia conference two days before the election. 'And that will continue to be the case at the end of this week as it is at the beginning. And we're really clear, in all the engagement we've had in the United States, that whoever wins the United States election this week understands that.' Marles pointed to the bipartisan support for AUKUS demonstrated by Congress. 'And it's not a guess. We've got a voting record. When you look at the way in which Democrats, Republicans — Trump Republicans — voted in the Congress at the end of last year in support of AUKUS, it was across the political spectrum,' he said. 'So we do have a sense of confidence that, going forward, this is a program that will be supported in the United States, as it will in the UK, as it will here.' Following the election, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called Trump to offer his congratulations. 'We talked about the importance of the Alliance, and the strength of the Australia-US relationship in security, AUKUS, trade and investment,' he said in a tweet. 'I look forward to working together in the interests of both our countries.' Similarly, Foreign Minister Penny Wong extended the traditional congratulations to Trump on his election and said Canberra expects to work 'very closely' with the Trump administration. The morning after the election, she said, 'I think that this is an alliance that is bigger than any individual, that is bigger than any past comments, that is about the big issues that we face as a nation, as a region and as a globe. I have confidence that just as different [US] administrations and different Australian Governments have worked together, we will work very closely with the Trump Administration to deliver on things that are very important to Australia, including the AUKUS pact.' The Green Party here called again for Australia to exit AUKUS, a move Wong dismissed with prejudice. 'Well, the Greens continue to demonstrate their irresponsibility over and over again, but I would say this to Australians. First, remember what AUKUS is about, assuring the peace. It's about deterrence to assure the peace in a contested region,' she said, in a veiled reference to China's actions in the east and South China seas. 'Secondly, the capability we gain under the submarines to be delivered under AUKUS is a sovereign capability. And the alliance matters to Australia's interests. We are confident of our ability to continue to navigate these times, and I don't think that the Greens’ approach is a responsible one.' While AUKUS may be secure, there is likely to be a divide between the Albanese and Trump governments on another major issue with both economic and national security concerns: climate change. The strategically important Pacific Islands are at risk of, in some cases, total destruction as a result of climate change, meaning it is an existential issue for those governments. The American president-elect has pledged to pull out again from the Paris Agreement, the key international climate agreement. Much of the Australian public and its leaders take the issue of climate change seriously, domestically and in terms of foreign policy and national security, so how Australia copes with Trump's overall stance on climate change has become a hot topic this week. 'President Trump has campaigned on change. We shouldn't be surprised if there's change,' Wong told reporters today, according to a government transcript. 'One of the areas we know from the previous Trump Administration, as they did withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Australia didn't, because we don't believe it's in our national interest. You said, what is the point? Apart from the imperative of climate change, there is the imperative of the economic transition. We are going to have to be able to prosper in a world where many and much of the global economy is moving to net zero.' While she didn't mention the Pacific Islands, they will be watching.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aukus-faces-little-threat-from-trump-aussie-officials-say/	2024-11-07T05:15:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/20210212ran8108462_0099.t603ea3e9.m1200.x6jJkBKr4jkU3jQUm-e1679311612363.jpg
Aussies must be more open about AUKUS, work with communities, officials and experts say	Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles at biennial Submarine Institute of Australia conference. (Nic Douglas) CANBERRA — Australia's military and its ministers need to share more information with the public and press about the AUKUS plan for Australia to buy and build nuclear-powered attack submarines, key members of the coalition said Wednesday, in what would represent a shift in how the government here tends to interact with the public on defense issues. The defense minister, the UK high commissioner to Australia and a raft of industry experts spoke at the biennial Submarine Institute of Australia conference here and urged the government and military to reach out to the Australian public, especially communities that will be shaped by the vast effort, estimated to cost $368 billion AUD over the next 50 years. 'There needs to be a holding to account of government, of people sitting in this chair, constantly,' said Defense Minister Richard Marles. 'That needs to be done with intelligence, clearly, but please bring that intelligence to the table&#8230;..We need to know where balls have been dropped, where cracks are opening up. We need to know that so that we're doing everything we can to pick them up again, to fill in those cracks, to make sure that we are able to keep this thing on track. 'We are not going to get through this without intense scrutiny, so give it to us,' he said. Support for the AUKUS plan has slipped by 5 percent since it was announced three years ago and public criticism and questioning of the effort has ramped up over the last year. Australia 'has been a little bit slow off the mark,' in communicating with the public about AUKUS,' Tracey Hanley, deputy director of the Defense Research Institute at University of New South Wales and one of Australia's leading nuclear experts, told Breaking Defense at the conference. 'However, that is gaining traction now, and we need to get the media behind why AUKUS is so important to our nation, and that then brings people alongside, because they are starting to hear why it's so important.' Hanley added, 'Openness on things that they can be open about is absolutely crucial for gaining valid social license in the community.' While a more open approach to public information sounds good on paper, that will still require a cultural shift. A more typical approach to the media was seen at the beginning of the conference, when the head of the Royal Australian Navy chastised coverage of both the current fleet of Collins-class boats and of AUKUS. News broke last week about the fact that only one of the Collins subs was able to go to sea. (The Department of Defense later issued a statement that a second boat could sail if necessary.) 'They are meeting the operational requirements of the Australian navy,' Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said of the Collins. 'You don’t see the headlines in the media when we have two submarines at sea at the same time, as we did just a few months ago. Or, when two subs are operating thousands of miles from home port as I ordered just a few months ago.' He cited what he called a 'pattern of criticism' of the sub fleet and the prospects of AUKUS. 'To the critics I say, where we have succeeded in the past we will again.' One expert at the conference, who asked not to be identified, mocked Hammond's comments, noting that what he had described were basic requirements for the fleet. Also, the expert said, how could it be reported when the Navy had never told reporters about it. The British High Commissioner, Vicki Treadwell, told the audience of several hundred uniformed and civilian gathered that 'a big part' of what they could do 'outside this room' would be to pursue the 'social license' because 'this new endeavor for Australia requires the Australian people to believe in it, to understand its strategic importance.' Social license is a collection of techniques to inform, reassure and engage the public in complex and, in the eyes of some, potentially dangerous projects they might otherwise support. The UK envoy added, 'You all have friends, you all have families. You all have children. Talk about this endeavor in a positive and constructive sense, to explain why Australia is pursuing this. It's not the job of government alone. Referencing local media questioning whether the recent fire at one of Britain's nuclear submarine yards had derailed or delayed the AUKUS effort, Treadwell said, 'There is a role for the media to tell the right story — not to look for the sensational aspect of the fire, but to talk about the jobs and to talk about the new technology that will be transformational.' (BAE Systems issued a statement saying the fire had 'limited impact.') She also gave the example of how British communities near naval bases, once engaged, help improve security by reporting suspicious activity to the military. An intriguing idea was mentioned by the US ambassador to Australia, Caroline Kennedy. After comparing AUKUS in complexity and daring to the moonshot proposed by her father, President John F. Kennedy, Kennedy briefly discussed the idea of an AUKUS visa after noting challenges to the US sub industrial base. 'We need to expand and strengthen collaboration between governments, industry, academia, to speed up and truly support a trilateral submarine industrial base and put more allied, conventionally armed, nuclear powered submarines to achieve one of AUKUS' greatest and most enduring benefits, the ability to leverage the manufacturing capabilities of all three nations for our common benefit,' Kennedy said. 'Right now, America's sub industrial defense industrial base is challenged. We can't produce all the components needed to construct submarines. We need Australian companies to get into the Virginia-class vendor base. Currently, only a handful are going through the defense industry vendor qualification process, and we need more of you to do that.' Asked about the idea of an 'AUKUS visa' during a brief chat with reporters at the conference, Marles said 'certainly we need to be looking at ways in which we can have an easier facilitated movement of people between our three countries who are working on this program. We are working with the governments of the US and the UK to look at how that can be done.' He pointed to the fact Australian submariners and industry personnel are now working in both the US and UK.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aussies-must-be-more-open-about-aukus-work-with-communities-officials-and-experts-say/	2024-11-06T23:01:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Credit-Nic-Douglass-@sailorgirlhq-1349-e1730904051669.jpeg
Space Force expands Commercial Integration Cell for industry cooperation	US Space Force Lt. Gen Douglas A. Schiess, US Space Forces &#8211; Space Commander; and US Space Command’s Combined Joint Force Space Component Commander, speaking at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (Photo credit: John Ayre, USSPACECOM) WASHINGTON — The US Space Force's key forum for interacting with commercial space operators is expanding both in number and in mission areas, according to a senior service official. Lt. Gen. Doug Schiess, double-hatted as commander of Space Forces-Space (S4S) and the Combined Joint Force Space Component, told the Mitchell Institute today that the Commercial Integration Cell (CIC) has added five members. Two additional companies are in the process of joining and should be on board by early next year, he said. '[O]n the commercial side, we are continually trying to up our game in the commercial world,' Schiess stressed. S4S is the Space Force's component command for providing forces to US Space Command (SPACECOM). Established as a service field command in 2023, S4S 'exercises operational control of USSF forces conducting protect, defend, and deliver missions, and when delegated, tactical control of other service forces conducting these missions,' according to a command fact sheet [PDF]. The Combined Joint Force Component Command, headquartered at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., was established last December to consolidate 'authority over all space forces presented by the services' to SPACECOM. 'As of October 2024, there are currently 15 CIC commercial mission partners. This includes 10 legacy partners (Hughes, SpaceX, XTAR, Inmarsat, Viasat, Eutelsat, SES, Maxar, Iridium, Intelsat) and five new partners (BlackSky, Kratos, Leolabs, ICEYE and Telesat),' a Space Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense today. 'Hawkeye 360 and Exoanalytic have agreed to join, and we look forward to welcoming them to the CIC in the future,' the spokesperson added. According to a Space Force announcement released today, the CIC 'enables operational and technology exchange' between SPACECOM and commercial partners. 'This real-time and near real-time information flow allows for rapid, informed response to space events and improves Space Domain Awareness,' the release added. Up to now, the CIC partners have primarily provided satellite communications and imagery, the Space Force announcement noted. But the additional firms now bring 'an expansion of mission areas these partners support to include Space Domain Awareness and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance,' the release said. BlackSky, ICEYE and Hawkeye 360 are all remote sensing companies that also have contracts with the National Reconnaissance Office to provide imagery. Kratos and Telesat are satellite communications companies. Both Leolabs and Exoanalytic are companies that monitor the heavens. Interestingly, SPACECOM also recently announced that its multinational Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell, originally created to improve space domain awareness via unclassified commercial data, also has expanded its mission to include tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking (Tac-SRT). The JCO is a new name as of last December for the Joint Task Force-Space Defense Commercial Operations created by SPACECOM in 2020. It now involves 14 countries plus NATO, and gets commercial data and analytical products via the Unified Data Library, head of JCO Barbara Golf explained using a slide presentation. Commercial firms are given contracts to provide data to populate the library, which then can be used by US and allied military operators based on the terms of those contracts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/space-force-expands-commercial-integration-cell-for-industry-cooperation/	2024-11-06T11:20:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Lt.-Gen.-Doug-Schiess-scaled-e1730917788621.jpeg
Army’s FLRAA fuselage production staying in Kansas, Bell announces	Bell's V-280 Valor tiltrotor won the US Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition. (Bell) WASHINGTON — In a win for the aerospace workforce of Wichita, Bell Textron unveiled plans to keep the US Army’s new Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) fuselage production in the city despite moving work in house, the company announced today. 'As Bell prepares for the next stage of FLRAA’s engineering and manufacturing development phase, we are committed to investing in advanced manufacturing to ensure we deliver exceptional performance at an affordable cost to our customer,' Bell President and CEO Lisa Atherton said in a short statement. 'Textron has a rich history with the state of Kansas as well as the city of Wichita, and we are proud to deepen that relationship as we establish this new facility.' Two Kansas lawmakers — Sen. Jerry Moran and Rep. Ron Estes — praised that decision, with Moran calling it a 'historic day.' Additional fuselage work, the company added, will take place in Texas before the aircraft is assembled in Amarillo. In late 2022, Bell beat out a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky to win the high-profile FLRAA competition. At the time, Army officials said the contract was worth $1.3 billion but could end up being in the range of $70 billion if contract options and export opportunities emerge. For its part, the Army has kept the program moving forward, announcing in August that it had greenlit the engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase after receiving Milestone B approval. Bell Textron is now working on getting the first FLRAA prototype up in the air in 2026 before entering low-rate initial production in 2028 and ready for first fielding in 2030. And for now, Army officials tell Breaking Defense that despite the fuselage shakeup, that plan is on track. 'We’re ahead of that problem. It’s already been worked out,' Army acquisition head Doug Bush told Breaking Defense in early October. Days later, on the sidelines of the Association of the US Army annual conference, Program Executive Officer for Aviation Brig. Gen. David Phillips provided some additional details about the revamped plan. 'We believe that we’ve had very transparent discussions &#8230; with our OEM [original equipment manufacturer], and throughout the process, we're looking at every critical path item. The fuselage is not a critical path item. There's other items that are in the critical path to get the flight test,' the one-star general told Breaking Defense. 'They have a lot of experience with composite fuselages, and so they're going to use their experience to potentially design it… more modular,' he said of Bell Textron. 'That way, if there's parts of that fuselage that are ready earlier, you can go ahead and get it down to the production facility and not have to wait for the entire fuselage to be ready all at one.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/armys-flraa-fuselage-production-staying-in-kansas-bell-announces/	2024-11-06T10:57:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Valor-pic1.jpg
Saab makes play into autonomy software market aimed at unmanned ships	Saab's Enforcer-3 is a modified CB-90 combat boat equipped with various autonomy and sensing capabilities. (Photo provided by Saab.) EURONAVAL 2024 — Swedish defense contractor Saab is throwing its hat into the market of maritime autonomy software, debuting its new 'Autonomous Ocean Core' designed to offer navies the ability to command and control surface and subsurface platforms from afar — as far as the city of Paris sits from the islands off the coast of Sweden. 'Autonomous Ocean Core can boost key operational strengths for the dull, dirty, dangerous and dear. This control system gives our customers a tactical edge, increasing availability and efficiency and becoming less dependent on active manpower,' said Mats Wicksell, senior vice president and head of Saab’s business area Kockums. The Swedish company’s pitch, as Saab’s engineers describe it, is that AOC is capable of being integrated into any small or medium vessel — regardless of whether that boat was designed to be an unmanned platform — and turn it into it a remote-controlled craft that can be operated from ship or ashore. RELATED: How Saab is betting big on its C71 &#8216;Expeditionary' subs to win Canadian contest During the Euronaval exposition here in Paris, company officials showed potential customers, and an international group of reporters, a brief demonstration featuring a CB90 fast assault craft stationed in waters north of Sweden’s coastline, in the ballpark of 1,800 kilometers away. The craft, guided by the AOC software and being filmed by a small aerial drone, performed a handful of maneuvers including transiting around the complicated terrain and thousands of islands scattered off Sweden’s mainland. 'The autonomy and the core technologies for this is something that fits very well for us when it comes to what we also have been working with over a number of years with lean manning to make sure that the armed forces can do more using less people,' Lars Brännström, a Saab executive overseeing Kockums shipyard, said. 'We have this demonstrated in the highly advanced Visby stealth corvettes, our submarines and a number of different products.' While officials were tight-lipped about specific sales, the Stockholm-based company’s most natural customer, the Swedish Armed Forces, have already conducted trials with Saab’s Enforcer-3, a CB90 craft that was modified with autonomy software to experiment with how it could be used as an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance asset. Peter Karlström, the project manager for AOC at Saab, told Breaking Defense that while Enforcer-3's initial demonstrations with the Swedish military pre-dates AOC, that craft and others in Saab's inventory have since been updated with various baselines of the newer software. The trend of interest into unmanned and autonomous vessels has been a theme in recent years for both for the US Navy and its industrial base, as well as European militaries and their respective contractors. Just here in Paris this week, Naval Group, the state-owned French shipbuilder unveiled its first unmanned surface vessel designed, much like Saab’s Enforcer-3, to act as a detachable ISR asset alongside manned warships.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/saab-makes-play-into-autonomy-software-market-aimed-at-unmanned-ships/	2024-11-06T09:50:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Enforcer-3-scaled-e1666196418692.jpg
After USV export deal with Qatar, Turkish defense exec sees interest from ‘all the world’	A model of an ULAQ unmanned surface vessel sits on display at the Meteksan booth at DIMDEX 2024. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Fresh off signing a deal to export an armed, unmanned maritime surface vessel to Qatar, a senior executive at the Turkish defense firm Meteksan said demand is only growing. 'All the world is now much interested in attaining such unmanned surface vessels or unmanned maritime technology,' Meteksan’s Vice Chairman of the Board Selçuk Kerem Alparslan told Breaking Defense in an interview. Last week Meteksan inked a deal with the Qatari Coast Guard to export the ULAQ 11 USV — so named for being 11 meters long — which was developed alongside Turkey's ARES Shipyard, what Alparslan described as a first for Turkey. The contract will be executed in two phases, he said: a 12-month training phase and then a procurement phase. The training phase, with 'direct assistance to the customer,' has already started, after the first vessel was delivered during the Milipol conference last week. 'The second [phase] covers the actual ULAQ 11 PSV boats and command-control infrastructure,' Alparslan said. 'Therefore, Qatar's Coast Guard will have been immediately involved in attaining the unmanned technology capability.' The ULAQ 11 PSV (Port Security Vessel), will be dedicated to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions to aid in protecting critical infrastructure, according to Meteksan, though the company says it can also conduct other law enforcement activities, immediate response or search and rescue. The platform is equipped with a 12.7 mm automatic weapon system, radar and electrooptical system, encrypted communication systems, command and control station and autonomy software. It can sail up to 400 miles and is equipped with a number of link modalities on top of which is the line of sight data link and satellite links, the company said. The Meteksan official declined to disclose the value of the deal or the number of vessels contracted, but he said that the system was tested with Qatari officials in Turkey first, according to the Qatari requirements, and the platform structure has been verified by Qatar. 'With this export, we are acquiring products that are adapted to different seas and are further developed and recognized. We are moving forward with great motivation to continue bringing our customers technologies and capabilities that make a difference in this field,' Alparslan said. He specifically pointed to Gulf nations as further potential customers. To meet the demand, he said the company is 'coming up with new versions, new platform sizes, with new payloads for different missions. The most attractive mission nowadays is using these unmanned systems as one way-attack missile-like instruments on the sea or open seas and using swarming capabilities will be defense capability multiplier.' The export deal with Qatar comes as Turkish defense industry is witnessing increased export revenues of $820 million in October, a 61 percent increase compared to October 2023, according to a post by the secretary of Turkish defense industries Haluk Gorgun.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-usv-export-deal-with-qatar-turkish-defense-exec-sees-interest-from-all-the-world/	2024-11-06T08:50:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241106_meteksan_ulaq_model_HELOU-scaled-e1730907545792.jpg
HII’s Wilkinson to take over as Newport News Shipbuilding chief in 2025; Boykin to retire	A part of CVN-80's aft is held in place by Newport News Shipbuilding's towering crane, nicknamed 'Big Blue.' PARIS — American shipbuilding giant HII announced today that Kari Wilkinson will take the reigns at the company’s Newport News shipyard next year, with long-time executive Jennifer Boykin set to retire following a 37-year career. Wilkinson currently oversees HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, based in Mississippi and most widely known for producing the US Navy's destroyers and amphibs, and has been in that role since 2021. She will be succeeded by Brian Blanchette, who has served as vice president of quality and engineering at Ingalls since 2021. Boykin has been president of HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding since 2017. That yard is most widely known for being the sole prime contractor for the Navy’s aircraft carriers, as well as a key partner to General Dynamics in producing both the Virginia- and Columbia-class submarines. 'I have asked Jennifer to stay on in an advisory capacity through March to support a seamless transition to Kari,' HII CEO and President Chris Kastner said in a Nov. 6 statement. 'You will not find a more loyal advocate than Jennifer for her shipbuilders and the Hampton Roads community. Kari’s leadership has steered Ingalls Shipbuilding into its next phase of growth, having secured serial production contracts for both the destroyer and amphibious ship programs. She is a tremendous leader and now brings her great energy and expertise to Newport News.' The leadership change announcements come just days after the company was forced to report a bleak outlook to Wall Street, drastically reducing its projections for free cash flow in 2024 and mostly blaming those numbers on supply chain issues as well as the knock-on effects of the coronavirus pandemic. Asked about the announcement's timing, an HII spokesman told Breaking Defense today, 'The timing aligns with Jennifer’s retirement plans. HII has a long-term succession planning process working with our board of directors, and it was through that process that Kari Wilkinson and Brian Blanchette were elected. We are thankful for Jennifer’s 37 years of leadership and dedication — she will be greatly missed by shipbuilders and her colleagues across HII.' He added that Boykin provided the company notice of her intent to retire 'this year.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/hiis-wilkinson-to-take-over-as-newport-news-shipbuilding-chief-in-2025-boykin-to-retire/	2024-11-06T07:56:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/CVN80-Structure-scaled-e1661875696225.jpg
Trump admin will bring ‘uncertainty,’ opportunities for defense industry: Analysts	Republican presidential nominee, former President Donald Trump takes the stage during a campaign rally at the Santander Arena on November 04, 2024 in Reading, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) EDITOR'S NOTE: A version of this story was published last week. With Donald Trump's victory in Tuesday's election, we are republishing with updated commentary. WASHINGTON — A second Donald Trump administration will likely bring unpredictability in defense spending, but the final makeup of Congress will help drive the ultimate final number for the defense budget, analysts tell Breaking Defense. Trump's win over Vice President Kamala Harris is coming hand in hand with a takeover of the Senate. The House remains undecided, but even if Democrats take over the lower chamber, it seems likely to be with a razor thin edge. 'We have a [wide] range of uncertainty when it comes to Trump,' Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the American Enterprise Institute, said ahead of the election. 'Under Trump, we could see a huge shift in strategy to become much more isolationist, which could end up bringing major changes in the defense budget and a drastic reduction in force structure.' At the same time, Harrison added, 'the makeup of Congress, and specifically the makeup of the House, I think will actually matter much more to the future of the defense budget than whoever the president is.' In a note to investors this morning, Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with TD Cowen, said the budget outlook for national security is still to be determined. However, he added that the 'first 100 days of the new Trump Administration could represent a major reset in foreign policy and defense spending,' with a Trump Pentagon likely positive for space, shipbuilding, missile defense and defense startups. Meanwhile, recent public comments by industry executives suggest they're confident the demand signal for their products will remain strong. The Republican platform includes a promise to 'prevent World War Three, restore peace in Europe and in the Middle East, and build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our entire country.' Throughout the campaign trail, Trump reiterated those statements, potentially setting the stage for greater missile defense investments. At the same time, he has questioned whether the US should remain in NATO, a longtime point of skepticism for the former president, who has hammered alliance members for failing to live up to the 2 percent GDP commitment for defense spending. Trump has also signaled that he would oppose further military aid for Ukraine unless it enters peace talks, and stated in September that Ukraine should have made 'concessions' to Russia to avoid war, according to the Associated Press. RELATED: How US election might impact stalled Saudi-Israeli normalization, arms sales to Gulf During an end of campaign rally at Madison Square Garden, Trump said he would strengthen and modernize the military, reiterating an old 2020 claim that he had 'rebuilt our military in total.' But Harrison said those comments are somewhat contradictory, leaving it unclear how much defense funding Trump believes is actually needed. 'If you've got all new equipment, why do you need to procure anything else?' Harrison said. 'Of course, it's laughably untrue what he said. But what if he actually believes it?' While Trump’s first term brought rising budgets and a renewed focus on China to the Pentagon, Trump himself was sometimes a turbulent influence on the department, with moments that included personally involving himself in contract negotiations for the F-35 and Air Force One, and unilaterally promising to cut the defense budget, only to reverse course and boost the budget after meeting with key defense leaders. That volatility makes it hard to know whether Trump is serious when he talks about leaving NATO or signaling that he could revoke support for Ukraine, analysts said. 'Maybe none of this happens. That is one view that, ‘Oh, this is just rhetoric,’' Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners said ahead of the election. 'But I think that there would be a pretty profound period of uncertainty until those answers are known.' Robert Stallard, an aerospace and defense analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said that a more isolationist United States under Trump would likely support a continued trend for increased defense spending in Europe. 'It could also see a more ‘Buy European’ approach to procurement. Other parts of the world lack this domestic option, and so we could see continue strong demand for US defense exports,' Stallard said in a note to investors this morning. He added that there is also 'a possibility' that Trump gets involved in 'defense contracting minutia,' as he did in his previous term. Speaking to Breaking Defense before the election, Schweizer was optimistic about defense investments under a Trump presidency, characterizing the Republican platform as 'very supportive of defense.' He added that prominent national security Republicans in Congress and within the administration would likely be supportive of increasing the base budget, though they may be less likely to approve supplemental spending like the foreign aid bill passed last spring, which approved additional funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and key US defense industrial base priorities. However, even if the Trump administration is broadly supportive of defense spending, other campaign priorities could have negative impacts on the defense industry, Callan said. For instance, plans to enact a 20 percent tariff on all imported goods could result in financial pressure on defense contracts. Another complication could be the potential creation of a new organization, the Department of Government Efficiency, centered on reducing federal spending, Callan said. Trump has said he would tap SpaceX founder Elon Musk to lead the new department, and Musk said last week he believed he could cut at least $2 trillion from the $7.3 trillion federal budget requested for FY25. 'When you start hearing those numbers get thrown around, it's like, if you think defense is going to be rising with a $2 trillion cut, it's not going to happen,' Callan said. 'Not that I think a $2 trillion cut is likely, but just this period of uncertainty about, well, what's going to happen?' Ahead of the election, Schweizer said the single best scenario for defense contractors is a Harris win, coupled with a Democratic House and Republican Senate. That permutation of what he called the 'congressional Rubik’s cube' couples Harris’s likely support for Ukraine and Israel with a pro-defense Senate and — most importantly — a House where the far-right Freedom Caucus would have little power to stymie military aid for supplemental spending, he said. The worst-case scenario, according to Harrison, is a narrow Republican majority in the House — something currently in play — 'because the Freedom Caucus will continue to hold defense hostage to try to give more spending cuts overall,' he said. Callan, in a Nov. 3 note to analysts, labeled a GOP sweep as the worst outcome for defense, noting that his view diverts sharply from other analysts who believe Republicans would serve up tax cuts and a larger defense budget. Callan disagreed, positing that tax cuts could drive up the federal deficit, potentially 'cast[ing]t a larger cloud over U.S. fiscal capacity for defense.' Although defense companies announced third quarter results in late October, just a couple weeks before Election Day, the subject of the next president largely flew under the radar during earnings calls with investors. 'Right now, the stocks are really trading on results,' Callan said. 'They don't appear to be looking beyond results and into election scenarios.' Even when pressed, executives haven’t drawn a distinction between how a Harris or Trump presidency could impact defense spending — at least not publicly. Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden said she didn’t expect a 'significant difference' in defense spending between a Trump or Harris administration during an earnings call last month. 'What we have seen over time is that the defense budget more reflects the threat environment than any particular administration change, and so we fully expect that again, this time,' she said. 'The national defense strategy has remained consistent over the past several years, in the last couple of administrations, and we believe that's because it is responsive to the emerging threats around the globe and focused on both deterring and defending. And in that regard, it's well aligned to the program portfolio that Northrop Grumman has.' Similar sentiments have been shared by Frank St. John, Lockheed Martin’s chief operating officer. During an August interview with Breaking Defense, St. John said that the Pentagon is experiencing 'a flat or a declining real purchasing power' relative to inflation, but added that it was too early to say how defense budget toplines could shape up over the next couple years. 'With regards to the election, we think that deterrence and deterrence capabilities are an enduring theme, regardless of which party is in the executive branch or who’s in control of Congress,' he said. 'And so we think our programs are well supported in the budget, and we’re looking forward to working with whatever the new administration looks like.' Other defense executives pointed to the uncertain political environment as a factor underlying more conservative projections about how business could fare in 2025 and beyond. Speaking to investors during an Oct. 19 earnings call, Leidos Chief Financial Officer Chris Cage said the company sees 'growth momentum' in its defense unit but wants to be 'cautious' about giving more exact financial guidance for 2025 until there is greater certainty on the outcome of the election and ongoing FY25 budget process. 'You look at the backdrop, we're clearly in an election year. There is a risk of … an extended CR and some disruption,' he said. 'If we get more clarity in the several months ahead, we'll be in a better position to refine that point of view going into the early part of next year.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/trump-admin-will-bring-uncertainty-opportunities-for-defense-industry-analysts/	2024-11-06T07:20:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/trump-flag-scaled-e1730902938445.jpg
Here’s how Congress’s biggest defense advocates fared in the 2024 election	U.S. Army Spc. Austin Fry, right, an infantryman with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, and Spc. Elijah Cliver, an infantryman with Delta Company, 1st Battalion, 152nd Infantry Regiment, Indiana National Guard, provide security near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Feb. 23, 2021. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class R.J. Lannom Jr.) WASHINGTON — Donald Trump has decisively seized the presidency for a second time, a victory that could spell uncertainty for US relationships with Ukraine and NATO while also heralding a wider 'red wave' throughout government. Although results are still trickling in, the GOP has successfully taken control of the Senate. And while the House is still in play, Republicans are currently leading Democrats in terms of total seats flipped. Here are the big defense headlines from the 2024 election: In one of the tightest races of the night, Montana Democrat Sen. Jon Tester was defeated by Republican candidate Tim Sheehy, a Navy SEAL. Tester has fought for higher topline spending for defense during the FY 25 budget process, arguing that the lower funding levels mandated under the Fiscal Responsibility Act would create risk for military personnel and operations. Tester and Appropriations Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., worked across the aisle with Maine Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican for the appropriations committee and defense subcommittee, to put forward a FY25 defense spending proposal that included $21 billion in emergency defense funds. Representing the state that is home to Malmstrom Air Force Base — one of the three bases that operate intercontinental ballistic missiles in the US northern tier — Tester is also known as a fierce advocate for the Sentinel ICBM program set to replace the aging Minuteman IIIs. Although Sheehy was leading the polls in the final days ahead of the election, the Navy SEAL faced questions about his military record, specifically on an injury he claimed he received in a firefight in Afghanistan, The Hill reported. On national security issues, Sheehy on his website that the United States must 'fund our military and stand strong against China, secure our southern border, and once again, make America energy dominant and independent.' The race between House Appropriations defense subcommittee chair Ken Calvert, R-Calif, and his Democratic challenger, Will Rollins, for California’s 41st district is still too close to call, with the Associated Press reporting a percentage point difference between the two candidates with 69 percent of votes reported in. Analysts view this race as a key battleground that could help determine which party will control the House moving forward. Calvert became chairman of the House appropriations defense subcommittee in 2023 following four years as its top Republican. Throughout the FY25 budget cycle, Calvert championed a defense spending proposal that hews to the budget caps set out by the Fiscal Responsibility Act and contains numerous conservative provisions on abortion, LGBTQ rights and climate change. He held a hard line against additional funding for Ukraine and a second Virginia-class submarine during committee deliberations of the bill, instead prioritizing increased funds for Israel, F-35s and counter-drug operations. During his two-year tenure as head of the House appropriations defense subcommittee, Calvert has promoted Silicon Valley defense startups and Pentagon organizations focused on technological innovation, such as the Defense Innovation Unit. In the FY24 defense budget, he proposed a $1 billion hedge portfolio managed by DIU, which would field low-cost munitions, satellites and drones — a mechanism Calvert wrote in a Breaking Defense op-ed could help change the Pentagon’s 'culture of risk-avoidance.' While defense issues were not a major focus of the race, Rollins — who Calvert previously defeated in 2022 — touted his work for the Department of Justice’s National Security Division, which led to the prosecutions of 'individuals illegally helping the Iranian and Chinese militaries,' according to his website. Sen. Deb Fischer, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services strategic forces subcommittee, successfully beat back Dan Osborn, an independent challenger whose shock victory would have threatened to turn the tide of the Senate. Fischer, who is also a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee, is best known in the defense world for advocacy on modernizing all three legs of the nuclear triad, in particular her support for the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic system currently under development by the Air Force. As the likely pick to lead SASC’s strategic forces subcommittee under a Republican Senate, she would play a leading role in shaping the committee’s nuclear and space policy positions going forward. Fischer took office in 2013 and is the senior senator for Nebraska. As Osborn — a veteran of the Navy and the Nebraska Army National Guard — closed in on Fischer in the polls, he repeatedly refused to say whether he would caucus with Democrats or Republicans if elected, according to MSNBC. Osborn is critical of Pentagon waste and of lobbying efforts by defense contractors, and had instead pledged to raise pay for troops. 'From forty dollar hammers that cost ten bucks at the hardware store, to $10,000 switches that cost a couple hundred dollars to manufacture, price gouging is draining our military of the resources to defend this country. Meanwhile, military families struggle to put food on the table,' his website states. Rep. Don Bacon, who chairs the House Armed Services cyber, IT and innovation subcommittee, is currently leading in a tight race against Democratic challenger Tony Vargas for Nebraska’s 2nd district. The Cook Political Report had rated the race 'leans Democrat' in its latest Nov. 1 update, but the Associated Press currently has Bacon leading by almost 3 percent with 99 percent of votes counted. Bacon, who retired from the Air Force in 2014 as a brigadier general, was known in defense circles as one of Congress’s biggest advocates for the Air Force, with his background on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance and electronic warfare often informing his questions during HASC hearings. He is also a strong voice on nuclear modernization, representing the district that is home to US Strategic Command and Offutt Air Force Base, and — unlike a large portion of House Republicans — has continued to support military aid for Ukraine. A moderate Republican, Bacon has been a HASC member since taking office in 2017. Vargas, a senator for Nebraska’s state legislature since 2017, said he would support military aid for Ukraine and Israel during an October debate, the Nebraska Examiner reported then.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/heres-how-congresss-biggest-defense-advocates-fared-in-the-2024-election/	2024-11-06T06:50:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/231213_DVIDS_soldier_capitol_6530390-scaled-e1702501640138.jpg
Israel’s Netanyahu fires Defense Minister Gallant	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III is greeted by Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant in Tel Aviv, Israel, Oct. 13, 2023. (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shook up Israel’s political landscape by firing Defense Minister Yoav Gallant late this evening, saying 'significant gaps' had developed between the two over Israel's military campaigns in Gaza and Lebanon. Netanyahu said in a statement that 'in the midst of a war, more than ever, full trust is required between the prime minister and the minister of defense.' He said that while he and Gallant had worked well together in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, over time the relationship declined. 'Significant gaps were discovered between myself and Gallant in the management of the campaign,' he said. Netanyahu claimed he tried to bridge the gaps but said 'they only grew wider. These divisions even reached public knowledge in an unusual manner and, worse, became known to our enemies, who took pleasure in them and derived substantial benefit from them.' Netanyahu said that Israel Katz, the current foreign minister, will step in to replace Gallant. 'He brings with him an impressive combination of rich experience and executive ability,' Netanyahu said. After news of his firing broke, Gallant issued his own statement saying that the 'security of the State of Israel always was, and will always remain my life's mission.' Gallant was born in 1958, the child of a Holocaust survivor. He served in Israel’s Shayetet naval commandos and was a commander of the Gaza Division and Israel’s Southern Command. He began his political career in 2015 as part of the Kulanu party. In 2019 he joined Netanyahu's Likud party, which has been in power since 2009. He was construction minister in 2017. At the time he warned, 'We need to be ready for a confrontation with Hamas from [the start of] the coming summer. It is a sensitive period, and we need to be alert and to take actions to prevent it.' The removal of Gallant comes after months of simmering disputes between Netanyahu and the defense minister over the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. Netanyahu and Gallant disagreed over the priorities in the conduct of the war, with Gallant pressing for a hostage deal and seeking to draft ultra-Orthodox Jews who usually have an exemption from service. Netanyahu's decision to fire Gallant was met with stinging rebuke from opposition figures and some analysts. 'Firing Gallant in the middle of a war is an act of madness. Netanyahu is selling Israel's security and the IDF fighters for a disgraceful political survival,' opposition leader Yair Lapid said. The leader of the Democrats' party, Yair Golan, a former deputy Chief of Staff of the IDF, called on Israeli to take to the streets and protest the firing of Gallant. Netanyahu’s coalition partners supported the decision. Ksenia Svetlova, a former member of Knesset and Executive Director of the NGO Ropes, said that a prime minister 'that fires a minister of defense when Israel is fighting in [seven] fronts in its bloodiest war since 1948, is dangerous to Israel’s security.' She told Breaking Defense Netanyahu seemed more concerned with his own political survival and appeasing far-right members of his coalition. Yaakov Katz, author of 'Israel vs. Iran: The Shadow War' and a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense said that Netanyahu chose to fire Gallant when the US is focused on elections. 'It shows he [Netanyahu] is more concerned with how they might react as opposed to how Israelis might respond,' Katz said. He noted that Gallant was the main point of contact for the US administration with Israel during the course of the war. This is not the first time Netanyahu’s disputes with a defense minister have been at the center of a political crisis. In 2018 then-Defense Minister Avigdor Liberman resigned after he disagreed with the government’s policy on Gaza. At the time Liberman had pressed for action against Hamas, while Netanyahu preferred de-escalating. This is also not the first time Netanyahu tried to fire Gallant. He previously intended to push Gallant out in the spring of 2023 during the controversy over judicial reform, but there were major protests, and Netanyahu climbed down from the decision. Gallant had criticized the government for trying to pass a judicial reform bill at the time, expressing concern it was dividing the country. Gallant leaves office as Israel is fighting a war on multiple fronts. Iran has threatened to carry out more direct attacks on Israel in the wake of Israel striking Iran in October, which itself was retaliation for Iran launching 180 at Israeli targets earlier that month.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israels-netanyahu-fires-defense-minister-gallant/	2024-11-05T13:55:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/8069894-scaled-e1716995064595.jpg
MBDA reveals Anglo-French future cruise/anti-ship missile stealth and wind tunnel testing	MBDA displays FCASW RJ &#8211; a future supersonic cruise and anti-ship missile model (Breaking Defense) EURONAVAL 2024 — European missile house MBDA has disclosed Radio Frequency (RF) signature and missile propulsion system testing of its Future Cruise/Anti-Ship Weapons (FC/ASW) for France and the United Kingdom. Over the last 12 months, weapon assessment phase activities have included a first TP15 'ultra' Low Observable [LO] subsonic prototype missile undergoing 'extreme' RF trials, and wind tunnel propulsion system testing of a RJ10 supersonic variant, according to MBDA executives speaking to media at the Euronaval trade show in Paris. It was also revealed that France’s Thales and MBDA UK have jointly started RJ10 seeker testing, while warhead, fusing systems, aerodynamic trials and new engine tests are all planned for the future. The Anglo-French program, which will expand next year with the onboarding of Italy, has been founded to deliver both a LO cruise missile and a highly maneuverable supersonic munition to replace Storm Shadow/SCALP air launched long-range missiles, as well as Exocet and Harpoon anti-ship missiles. Due to sensitivities, limited details of the test activities were shared with reporters, but Pierre-Marie Belleau, deep strike product line owner at MBDA, provided a small glimpse into subsystem applications, saying that the TP15 prototype features a Rolls Royce and Safran designed turbojet engine. The TP15 and RJ10 tests took place over the 'last 12 months' he added. 'It’s a huge technical challenge, frankly speaking, one of the biggest technical challenges that the company has taken over the last [number of] years. Overall it has been an exceptional technical success,' outside of a software test that required repeating, Belleau added. He also shared that MBDA settled on the 15th version for the TP15 designation after looking at wide array of different configurations and test scenarios. Both the TP15 and RJ10 are being developed in parallel, 'in order to address the most difficult targets for the next decade,' according to Belleau. He explained that FC/ASW launch platforms include Italian Navy FREMM, UK Royal Navy Type 26 frigates, Italian and British Eurofighter Typhoons and French Rafale fighter jets. Customer decisions will dictate if the future weapons are fielded on sixth generation European platforms relating to the British, Italian, Japanese Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) and the French, German, Spanish Future Combat Air System/SCAF. In the near term, a convergence contract that enables Italy to join FC/ASW will be finalized at the start of next year. Additionally Belleau said, 'We [are] now working to prepare the development and the manufacturing of [these products] across the three nations and of course can welcome other nations at a later stage.' Although the UK has put a hold on long term acquisition and equipment program decisions until its Strategic Defense Review (SDR) reports in mid-2025, it is 'unlikely' that FC/ASW will be placed at risk, said Belleau. 'We have not stopped working in the UK, [across] all these tests,' he explained. 'There are some arbitrations made at political levels that will come but deep strike is such a priority mission we are confident on the future. It [a surprise] can always come but frankly that will be very &#8230; unlikely.' MBDA is the UK's preferred strategic weapons provider. In July, both parties renewed their long term partnership on 'complex weapons' under a new Portfolio Management Agreement 'worth at least' £6.5 billion ($8.4 billion). Separately, the manufacturer also unveiled the new submarine launched Exocet SM40 anti-ship missile at Euronaval. It has been designed with a new J-band RF seeker, new propulsion system with a turbojet engine, and can travel at twice the range of previous Exocet weapons, according to a statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/mbda-reveals-anglo-french-future-cruise-anti-ship-missile-stealth-and-wind-tunnel-testing/	2024-11-05T11:28:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/IMG_2197-scaled-e1730812445712.jpg
France’s Naval Group unveils Seaquest, its first unmanned surface vessel	Naval Group's new Seaquest USV. (Courtesy of Naval Group.) EURONAVAL 2024 — France’s national shipbuilder today unveiled its first ever unmanned surface vessel designed to operate in conjunction with manned warships following limited testing alongside the French Navy. The drone, dubbed Seaquest and measuring approximately 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, and can be equipped with payloads focusing on intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and targeting. It was designed by Naval Group, the French shipbuilder majority-owned by the state; Sirehna, a subsidiary of Naval Group; and Couach Shipyard, another French shipbuilder known for its commercial yachts. 'We see that an increasing number of navies are equipping themselves or thinking to equip themselves [with unmanned drones],' Aurore Neuschwander, executive vice president of drones and unmanned systems and underwater weapons at Naval Group, told a crowd here at the Euronaval exposition in Paris. 'It becomes a glimpse of what future naval combat is set to become. This new context calls for navies to adapt.' Neuschwander said the Seaquest can be operated from a ship or from ashore and was designed to be 'fully integrated' with a frigate, landing helicopter docks or supply ships. When Neuschwander said the USV is 'fully integrated' with the ship, she was referring to a short video that showed the vessel being deployed and recovered by French sailors using a davit attached to a warship. 'We wanted to have it available as soon as possible because operations don’t wait,' said Patrick Pennamen, CEO of Sirehna. 'So based on our own experience in hydrodynamics and dynamic positioning, we have developed in less than one year a brand new system following an agile and incremental process, and today it’s operational at sea.' Seaquest’s debut comes at a time when numerous international navies and their associated contractors have taken heightened interest in unmanned and autonomous maritime vessels. The Pentagon’s Replicator program has driven that home particularly hard with the US Navy which has been experimenting with numerous commercial-off-the-shelf USVs and UUVs with mixed success and at least preliminary investments into systems deemed worthwhile. But for a company like Naval Group, a product’s debut has more implications than simply marketing. The shipbuilding giant is majority-owned by the state — and partly by another French aerospace and defense giant, Thales — meaning its research and development efforts are in part a reflection of the interests of the Ministry of Armed Forces and the country’s navy, Marine Nationale.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/frances-naval-group-unveils-seaquest-its-first-unmanned-surface-vessel/	2024-11-05T10:20:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Visuel-FP-Seaquest®.png
US approves potential $4.9 billion E-7 Wedgetail deal with South Korea	Saab GlobalEye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) aircraft lost out to Boeing made E-7 Wedgetails in a recent NATO procurement (Saab) WASHINGTON — The US government has approved a potential deal for South Korea to buy four E-7 Wedgetail surveillance and early warning aircraft and related equipment for nearly $5 billion, should Seoul choose the Boeing bird in its race to expand its Airborne Early Warning &amp; Control Aircraft (AEW&amp;C) fleet. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced late Monday that the State Department okayed the would-be $4.9 billion arrangement, saying the 'proposed sale will improve the Republic of Korea’s ability to meet current and future threats by providing increased intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and airborne early warning and control capabilities.' 'It will also increase the ROK Air Force’s command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) interoperability with the United States,' the release said. 'Korea will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and support into its armed forces.' Seoul already operates a handful of Wedgetails — along with Australia, the United Kingdom and Turkey, according to planemaker Boeing — but late last year Seoul announced a competition to expand its capabilities. International offers have lined up, including from Sweden's Saab with its GlobalEye surveillance aircraft and from a team-up of America's L3Harris with Korean Air and Israel's ELTA. Beyond its current operating customers, the Wedgetail has been chosen as the latest AEW&amp;C for the US Air Force as well as NATO — though the US acquisition was bumpy as negotiations with Boeing dragged and NATO's came with its own criticisms. RELATED: &#8216;Political decisions': Saab CEO says NATO rush E-3 replacement decision in favor of E-7 Foreign Military Sale approvals are not final deals, but signify the US government's acquiescence if the Wedgetail is the direction in which Seoul would like to go. If it is the winner, the pricetag and unit numbers can change as final negotiations play out. Boeing did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-approves-potential-4-9-billion-e-7-wedgetail-deal-with-south-korea/	2024-11-05T08:29:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/20230221-en-4471121-2-scaled-e1709577371527.jpg
Boeing machinists vote to end strike, putting KC-46, P-8 programs back on track	A P-8 maritime patrol aircraft undergoes assembly at Boeing's Renton production line. Future E-7s, based on the 737 NG, will be slotted into this line for assembly. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s Seattle-area machinists union voted on Monday evening to end a seven week strike and accept a new contract with the planemaker, a move that will allow the company to restart production of commercial derivative military planes like the KC-46 tanker and P-8 Poseidon. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), which represents about 33,000 Boeing workers mostly in Washington state and Oregon, voted in a 59 percent majority to end the strike and will return to work on Nov. 6. Union workers first rejected a previous contract and voted to strike on Sept. 13. 'While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,' said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a statement. 'We will only move forward by listening and working together. There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.' IAM 751 President Jon Holden said the strike allowed Boeing workers to 'rebalanc[e] the scales' with a contract that provides improved wages and a better quality of life. 'This contract also creates a new foundation to build on for the future and that future begins today,' he said in a statement. 'We are ready to help Boeing change direction and return to building the highest quality and safest airplanes in the world. Our members are critical to that mission, and now have a stronger voice in the decision making process to ensure those needed improvements are made.' The strike had immediate financial consequences for Boeing, halting production of its 737, 767 and 777 jetliners and impacting military derivatives of those aircraft, which include the 737-based P-8 Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft and the the 767-based KC-46 tanker. Boeing also acknowledged it could see impacts to the Air Force's program to build E-7 Wedgetail prototypes due to the strike. The company recognized $6 billion in losses in the third quarter, including $2 billion on defense programs, which it partially attributed to the work stoppage. At the onset of the strike, Boeing said it was 'working with our suppliers and customers to ensure continuity to the extent we can' on the P-8 and E-7 Wedgetail programs, and that it had fulfilled its commitment to the US Air Force to deliver at least 15 KC-46 tankers during fiscal 2024, which ended on Sept. 30. During an earnings call with investors in October, Ortberg said that coming to a contract agreement with the union and ending the strike was the first step necessary for moving the company forward. 'I met with the union leadership the first week on the job and let them know that I was committed to resetting the relationship. And I remain committed to getting the team back and improving our relationship, so we don’t become so disconnected in the future,' he said on Oct. 23, hours before the union would vote to reject an earlier contract proposal. However, as the strike continued on, Boeing leaders showed signs of frustration with the impasse. During a Nov. 1 interview with The Seattle Times, Holden said Ortberg told union leadership that, should the union reject the company’s latest offer, the next proposal would contain less generous terms. Under the agreed-upon contract, machinists would earn a 38 percent general wage increase over the next four years, $12,000 in bonuses, the reinstatement of the company’s incentive plan, and additional contributions to 401(k) plans. As part of the deal, Boeing also agreed to build its next commercial aircraft in the Puget Sound region, should the company launch a new program during the contract’s duration. The deal is an improvement from the original Sept. 8 contract proposal, which offered a 25 percent wage increase, as well as the latest Oct. 19 proposal, which offered a 35 percent increase. However, it still falls slightly short of the 40 percent wage increase originally demanded by the union, and although the offer includes higher bonuses and improvements to benefits, Boeing has refused the union’s continued demands to reinstate the company’s legacy pension program, which was phased out 2014. IAM 751 recommended that members accept the contract proposal, calling for the union 'to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory' in an Oct. 31 post on its website. 'In every negotiation and strike, there is a point where we have extracted everything that we can in bargaining and by withholding our labor. We are at that point now and risk a regressive or lesser offer in the future,' the union stated. In a Nov. 1 message to employees, Ortberg said, 'It’s time we all come back together and focus on rebuilding the business and delivering the world’s best airplanes. There are a lot of people depending on us.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/boeing-machinists-vote-to-end-strike-putting-kc-46-p-8-programs-back-on-track/	2024-11-05T06:09:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/P-8-photo-scaled-e1704386404109.jpg
Netherlands orders 12 H225M helicopters for special operations	Dutch Special Operations Forces (SOF) will receive 12 newly configured H225M Caracal helicopters (Airbus Helicopters) EURONAVAL 2024 — The Dutch Ministry of Defence signed a contract with Airbus today for the acquisition of 12 H225M Caracal heavy-lift helicopters to equip special operations forces (SOF) and replace aging AS532 Cougars. The agreement was signed at the Euronaval trade show by Vice-Admiral Jan Willem Hartman, Head of the Netherlands Command Materiel and IT (COMMIT) agency, and Bruno Even, CEO of Airbus Helicopters. The deal was widely expected after Gijs Tuinman, Netherlands State Secretary of Defence, wrote a letter to lawmakers in October to explain that a proposed procurement of 14 aircraft had been reduced to 12 because funding was 'not sufficient' enough to absorb costs for aircraft modifications. The Netherlands has requested a tailored H225M configuration to support SOF requirements. 'Airbus Helicopters and the RNLAF [Royal Netherlands Air Force] will work closely together on the development of the H225M adapted to the requirements of the users, enhancing capabilities and efficiency for special operations missions success, through tactical communication and a unique design of interaction of the aircraft and its systems,' said the manufacturer in a statement. In October, the Dutch Ministry of Defence also announced that a new unit, 300 Special Operations Squadron, based at Gilze-Rijen Air Base, southern Netherlands, had been formally stood up to support the future rotary fleet. The Netherlands plans on issuing a number of other H225M-related contracts, including an agreement with Israel's Elbit Systems for self-protection systems — equipment already installed on Dutch Gulfstream G650ER aircraft and due for integration on future C-390 tactical airlifters. Additionally, in line with the Dutch Armed Forces Foxtrot communications program and combat net radio requirement, Airbus will integrate L3 Harris radios on the rotary wing platforms. At a design level, the H225M aircraft itself features 'new avionics, an enhanced main gear box, airborne communication systems and can be equipped with the HForce weapon system,' according to Airbus company literature. The Hague had previously put forward 2030 to 2032 as the period for deliveries of the new rotorcraft but that has shifted 'partly due to the technical complexity' of integrating specialised mission equipment and 'great pressure on the production lines of the Caracal helicopter due to international orders,' according to an online translation of Tuinman's letter. In response to the suggestion that the H225 production line is having problems keeping up with demand, an Airbus Helicopters spokesperson told Breaking Defense, 'I would not say that we are struggling, but the fact is there will be a lot of helicopters to deliver in the coming years.' He added: 'The other factor to take into account is the fact that the NL [Netherlands] are asking for a new advanced configuration of the H225M matching their specific needs. We can't go into specifics, but new development work will be needed. It's always the case when a customer asks for new types of equipment.' The spokesperson declined to share an updated delivery schedule. The Dutch Ministry of Defence declined to comment. Outside of the Dutch deal, this year alone Airbus has secured new H225M orders from the German Federal Police (38 aircraft), Iraq Ministry of Defence (12 aircraft) and Japan Coast Guard (3 aircraft). Other defense customers include Brazil, France, Hungary, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore and Thailand. Breaking Defense reported exclusively last year that the United Arab Emirates had decided to cancel a $800 million H225M acquisition, citing high lifecycle costs and modular design limitations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/netherlands-orders-12-h225m-helicopters-for-special-operations/	2024-11-05T04:46:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/unnamed-4-scaled.jpg
France begins delivery of 100 loitering munitions to Ukraine	French drone manufacturer Delair displays a model of the Ukraine supplied OSKAR short range loitering munition at Euronaval (Breaking Defense) PARIS — France has started transporting loitering munitions to Ukraine for the first time — just a little over six months since the suicide drones were rapidly developed from demonstration standard to war ready, according to an industry executive. Made by French drone manufacturer Delair and KNDS France, the OSKAR (Opportunity Strike Kinetics Aircraft Ruggedised) platforms are currently 'being sent' to Ukraine, Bastien Mancini, CEO of Delair, told Breaking Defense. Under the French Colibri (Hummingbird) project, 100 of the short-range loitering munitions are due for transfer to Ukraine, as part of broader plans by Paris to acquire 2,000 units of different types overall. Mancini declined to share additional details about the new deliveries but they fit with a timeframe shared on X, in October, by Sébastien Lecornu, France’s Armed Forces Minister. At the time, Lecornu noted that 'successful testing' of the loitering munitions had taken place and deliveries to Ukraine would begin in 'the coming weeks.' Evolved from Delair's UX11 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and modified to integrate a 2.3 kilogram (5 pound) warhead from KNDS France, OSKAR can fly for up to 45 minutes and has been designed to strike fixed targets, light vehicles and personnel. The back-packable loitering munition was selected as one of two solutions for acquisition under Colibri in March. In all, 'we had six months to transform [our] demonstrator into an operational product &#8230; operational with constraints of the ammunition,' Mancini told Breaking Defense. 'Now this phase is finished and the [OSKAR] drones are being delivered to Ukraine. They are being sent, I don’t have' further details. Loitering munitions have flown steadily into Ukraine since the war started and are widely considered cost effective solutions compared to antitank or cruise missiles. As an example, US manufacturer AeroVironment estimated in April that it had provided Ukraine with 'thousands' of drones, including Switchblade types. RELATED: France makes new &#8216;pact' with industry to speed small drone production, acquisition Similarly, Delair has already gained product feedback from Ukraine, having provided Kyiv with UX11 and DT26 surveillance drones. Mancini noted that Russian Electronic Warfare (EW) capabilities continue to present 'a real danger' to Ukrainian supplied equipment and stressed that because a platform 'works today' does not mean that 'it will work in three months.' The 'quality that we need is to remain very adaptive and alert &#8230; because so far, we have solutions that work, but &#8230; things evolve very quickly on the battlefield,' he said. To resist EW attacks, OSKAR also uses satellite navigation denied capabilities and can operate fully encrypted, out to a 25 kilometer (15.5 mile) communication range, according to KNDS company literature. Mancini also said that following Delair’s acquisition, late last month, of French swarming and inspection drone manufacturer Squadrone System, the company could decide to test multiple OSKAR’s in a swarm. He declined to share the value of the Squadrone deal. The Grenoble-based manufacturer is currently part of the DGA- and Defence Innovation Agency-led Tactical Multi-Objectives Swarming UAVs) TAMOS line of effort — a two-year research and development program exploring development of an interface capable of letting a human operator control the flight of several small-sized UAV’s for civil and defense markets.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/france-begins-delivery-of-100-loitering-munitions-to-ukraine/	2024-11-05T04:14:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/IMG_2223-1-scaled-e1730808912287.jpg
Navy will extend service lives of 3 cruisers following destroyer announcement	A Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block 1B interceptor missile is launched from the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie (CG 70) during a Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy test in the mid-Pacific. (U.S. Navy photo/Released) PARIS — The US Navy announced today it is extending the service lives of three Ticonderoga-class cruisers, a decision that adds 10 years of cumulative ship service to the fleet and follows a similar decision last week to extend 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers. 'All three cruisers received extensive hull, mechanical and engineering, as well as combat system upgrades as part of an extended modernization program,' according to a service statement published today. 'USS Gettysburg (CG-64) and USS Chosin (CG-65) completed modernization in fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024, respectively. USS Cape St. George (CG-71) is on schedule to complete modernization this fiscal year.' For years, the Navy has lobbied Congress to allow for certain Ticonderoga-class cruisers — as well as Littoral Combat Ships — to be decommission ahead of schedule, but lawmakers have repeatedly blocked those efforts, largely citing the need for the service to achieve a larger fleet. Those efforts have followed a large, and problematic, effort to modernize those ships, which is nine years old and counting. 'As a former cruiser sailor, I know the incredible value these highly-capable warships bring to the fleet and I am proud of their many decades of service,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in the statement. 'After learning hard lessons from the cruiser modernization program, we are only extending ships that have completed modernization and have the material readiness needed to continue advancing our Navy’s mission.' The Chosin (CG-65) was also recently part of a Navy demonstration that has been personally lauded by Del Toro for transferring and reloading missile cannisters at sea, a capability the Navy claims will be 'transformational' because it removes the need for a ship to pull into port.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-will-extend-service-lives-of-3-cruisers-following-destroyer-announcement/	2024-11-04T10:02:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/934664-scaled-e1713286156806.jpg
The next president must recognize Americans’ unwavering support for int’l leadership, engagement	NATO delegates come together at the 2024 summit in Washington, DC on July 11, 2024. (NATO) As Donald Trump and Kamala Harris make their closing arguments to voters around the country, both candidates must contend with an undeniable truth: Americans across the political spectrum favor strong U.S. leadership in the world. Regardless of who wins the presidential election and takes office in January, he or she would be wise to recognize this clear mandate from the American people. The American public’s commitment to an internationalist foreign policy is unwavering in recent years amidst chaos and conflict around the world, as shown in six years of consistent data from the Reagan National Defense Survey. Since 2018, the Ronald Reagan Institute has conducted an annual nationwide public opinion poll assessing Americans’ views on a wide array of defense, foreign policy, and national security topics. One message we have heard loud and clear: a rock-solid preference among the American people for U.S. leadership and engagement on the global stage. Even as public opinion has shifted on the particulars of some foreign policy issues, many core principles receive consistent support year on year. When asked whether the United States should be more engaged and take the lead or be less engaged and react to world events, a majority favors American engagement. Across six years of polling, there has always been a preference for global leadership—and in recent surveys, more and more Americans want the United States to take the lead, now up to 54 percent, from 40 percent in 2022. On a bipartisan basis, the American people have a clear preference for internationalism over isolationism. Americans also consistently support our forward-deployed global military presence. A remarkably constant supermajority of about two-thirds of Americans has favored the United States maintaining military bases around the world to deter attacks and provide a quick response. Almost eight in ten Americans, including majorities across party lines, favor increased defense spending, a figure that has remained consistent since 2018. Despite the four decades since President Ronald Reagan was in office, his philosophy of peace through strength still resonates with the American people. The American public maintains a steadfast commitment to standing by our allies and partners. Since 2018, about six in ten Americans have consistently reported having a favorable view of NATO. And they support NATO’s core principle of collective defense, with almost three-quarters saying United States should respond militarily if a NATO ally was attacked. On Ukraine aid, our polls have shown rock-solid support for sending U.S. weapons. Since 2022, around 60 percent of Americans across party lines want the United States to provide military aid to Ukraine—debunking speculation of 'Ukraine fatigue' among the public. This is what international leadership and engagement looks like. While foreign policy may seem distant, it is not abstract. And the broad, bipartisan mandate is clear. Over 80 percent of Americans believe that a strong U.S. military is crucial for peace and prosperity, both at home and abroad; 78 percent agree that American leaders is essential to promote trade and boost the economy; and 77 percent say the United States has an obligation to champion human rights and democracy whenever possible. While support for these core principles has remained steadfast, we have seen a remarkable shift when it comes to threat perception—particularly vis-à-vis China. A steadily rising percentage of Americans view China as the country posing the greatest threat to the United States. In the most recent Reagan National Defense Survey, released last December, 51 percent of Americans identified China as the top threat, up from just 21 percent in 2018. This shift reflects growing public concern about China across every domain: its military build-up, technological advancements, economic engagement, human rights abuses, and global ambitions. And yet, over half of Americans say that the United States does not have a clear strategy for managing its relationship with China. Beyond the bipartisan consensus that we are engaged in a great power competition, the next president should articulate how our country and the free world can win that contest. On the eve of the 1980 election, then-candidate Ronald Reagan made foreign policy part of his closing argument, saying, 'Many of us are unhappy about…our diminishing prestige around the globe, about the weakness in our economy and national security that jeopardizes world peace, about our lack of strong, straightforward leadership…I believe we can embark on a new age of reform in this country and an era of national renewal.' Now, facing similar circumstances, Americans desire a renewed commitment to strong U.S. leadership and international engagement, the approach that has long safeguarded peace in a dangerous, turbulent world. Whoever steps into the Oval Office in January should heed this call.

Austal eyeing European markets for US Navy’s new medical ship design	A graphic of Austal USA's expeditionary medical ship. (Courtesy of Austal USA) EURONAVAL 2024 — Austal USA is eyeing European markets for its relatively new medical ship that is being designed and produced for the US Navy, as the company looks to beef up future production to avoid fallow periods at its facilities. 'We’re interested in expanding our market — three to four years out — we want to be looking at a new set of programs,' Larry Ryder, a company executive, told Breaking Defense here at the Euronaval exposition. 'It’s a piece of the market we haven’t touched yet. We’ve come close on a couple of international [foreign military sales] deals, but we want to kind of gage the market over here.' Austal is slated to build three Bethesda-class Expeditionary Medical Ships for the US Navy, a specialized platform derived from the expeditionary fast transports and designed to provide a more mobile and agile version of the iconic hospital ships Comfort and Mercy. The interest to put the platform forward in markets abroad stems from the American shipyard’s recent history. As Breaking Defense reported, Austal’s Mobile, Ala.,-based yard was facing numerous programmatic closures and severe layoffs at the outset of the coronavirus pandemic as several US Navy programs were slated to close and no new work was on the horizon. Through a combination of facility expansion and contract wins, the shipyard, a staple builder for the US Navy, has come out of that period with a more diverse portfolio of programs than it held a few years ago. But, Ryder acknowledged, it also acted as a warning sign for the need to seek out new customers. 'We've got to be looking three, four years out, and if we sit and wait till we need work, it's too late,' he added. Europe is relatively fresh ground for Austal as a whole. While the Expeditionary Medical Ship is built by Austal USA, its parent company, Austal, based in Australia, is largely focused on its domestic market and Asia, especially as it pertains to defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/austal-eyeing-european-markets-for-us-navys-new-medical-ship-design/	2024-11-04T07:19:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/53440417469_c4b21d066d_o-scaled-e1704306136265.jpg
Australia kills $5.3B military space program with Lockheed	Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese (L), US President Joe Biden (C) and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak (R) during the AUKUS summit on March 13, 2023 in San Diego. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) CANBERRA — The Labor government of Anthony Albanese today cancelled Australia's largest space program ever, almost 18 months after killing the main civil space program, drawing sharp criticism from analysts and industry experts. The satellite communications program, known in typical Australian military fashion as JP 9102, was projected to be worth at least $7 billion AUD ($5.3 billion USD). The government began the project in 2021 and eventually chose Lockheed Martin's Australian arm to see it through, but the Department of Defence said in an announcement today that due to the 'acceleration in space technologies and evolving threats in space, Defense has assessed that a single orbit GEO-based satellite communications system would not meet strategic priorities.' 'Instead of a single orbit solution, defense must instead prioritize a multi-orbit capability increasing resilience for the Australian Defense Force,' the department said. 'Defence’s current satellite communications capabilities support the immediate needs of the organisation. This decision allows Defence to prioritise emerging needs, mitigate capability gaps and continue to support our transition to an integrated, focused force.' News of the cancellation was broken by The Australian newspaper, which said the decision was based on budget issues. After The Australian broke the story, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese spoke with Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio and offered justification for the government's defense planning and spending. 'We’re busy prioritizing all of our purchases when it comes to defense assets. We’ve got a considerable increase in our defense budget and we’ll make sure all of the decisions that we make are in our national interest,' the prime minister said. 'We are not only seeing advances with the AUKUS arrangements being on track and on time and on budget, we’re seeing our capabilities increased with increased asset purchases. We are also very much interested in this being part of our ‘Future Made in Australia’ agenda.' But the cancellation was cast as a broad example of the Albanese government's unwillingness to increase defense spending beyond inflation and currency changes and its lack of commitment to space programs. The Space Industry Association of Australia (SIAA) noted the government's decision with 'profound disappointment.' Its chairman, Jeremy Hallett, said in a statement, 'While other OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development] nations see sovereign space capability as critical to creating high-tech, high-value jobs and a military advantage, in our own backyard we seem to be doing the exact opposite.' Lockheed Martin Australia said it would try to keep the jobs created so far: 'We are committed to preserving our sovereign workforce with impacted staff being redeployed across other existing and emerging programs where possible.' Malcolm Davis, a defense expert with The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense in an email that If the government offers no alternative to JP 9102, it will mark 'a retreat back to dependency on foreign actors to provide our crucial upstream space segment.' Australia has already experienced this. It discovered the limits of access to the Boeing-built WGS defense constellation, even after paying to build one of the satellites. During the massive bushfires here in 2019 and 2020, the Aussies asked the US military for WGS coverage to help with command and control; US Army Pacific reportedly turned things around within 24 hours, but that was time lost and highlighted the limits of Australia’s access even during a time of peace. 'In the meantime, government doesn't send any signal of confidence to the Australian commercial space sector and that will only see that sector seeing greater risk,' Davis said. 'At a certain point, companies begin to close doors and relocate over to the US, or elsewhere. Jobs are lost, financial returns decline, and it snowballs.' Davis said the government is trying to cover the high cost of AUKUS and the Navy's surface fleet expansion, without making a 'real increase in defense spending.' He notes that 'other key projects' have been redefined, reprioritized, delayed or cancelled by Labor. 'And now, as the cost of AUKUS continues to increase (as it always was going to) they are having to continue to make cuts to avoid spending more on defense,' he said. Hallett of the SIAA ticked off space programs either cut or in limbo. 'We’ve seen a change in direction for Space Domain Awareness under JP 9360 after industry being led along for many years. We have the media-reported cancellation of the Resilient Multi-Mission STaR Shot program by DSTG, we have heard nothing public on Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing under JP 9380 even though that tender closed over a year ago, and now this news on JP9102 — not to mention cuts to civil space programs,' Hallett said in the SIAA statement. 'I am sure some companies will seriously consider the business case for dealing with defense as a customer in the future, which I worry will mean our warfighters will miss out on homegrown innovations that can make a difference on the battlefield,' he said. Hallett said Australia needs strategic autonomy and resilience for its 'future economic and national security' and it is central to AUKUS Pillar II, the cluster of capabilities such as hypersonics, autonomy, AI and other advanced weapons America, Britain and Australia are pursuing to rapidly improve their militaries in the face of China's rapid military modernization. 'Owning and operating significant military space infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific as part of a multi-orbit architecture would have achieved this, and provided meaningful contribution into AUKUS Pillar [II],' Hallett said, 'the advanced capabilities of which cannot function without space capability.' The DoD's statement suggested Australia would pursue an altered space program, one with a 'multi-orbit capability,' but did not provide further details.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/australia-kills-5-3b-military-space-program-with-lockheed/	2024-11-04T05:19:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/aukus_2023-scaled-e1678742636131.jpg
As Election Day looms, what Trump and Harris presidencies will (and won’t) mean for defense	US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris (R) shakes hands with former US President and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump during a presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 10, 2024. (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — On Tuesday, Americans will head to the polls to cast a vote for either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in an election where national security has taken a backseat to domestic issues like the economy, immigration and abortion rights. Neither Harris nor Trump have provided details on their defense priorities and the budget it will take to bring them to fruition. But both have spent four years in the White House, leaving plenty of clues as to how they could lead the most powerful military in the world. And while analysts told Breaking Defense a Trump administration would likely be a more unpredictable one on defense policy compared to a relative continuation of Biden administration priorities under Harris, they also said that equally, if not more important, will be whichever party controls the houses of Congress where the defense budget is crafted. 'We have a much wider range of uncertainty when it comes to Trump,' said Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert with the American Enterprise Institute. 'Under Trump, we could see a huge shift in strategy to become much more isolationist, which could end up bringing major changes in the defense budget and a drastic reduction in force structure.' At the same time, Harrison added, 'the makeup of Congress, and specifically the makeup of the House, I think will actually matter much more to the future of the defense budget than whoever the president is.' Meanwhile, public comments by industry executives suggest they're confident the demand signal for their products will remain strong, no matter what happens next week. With four days until America votes on its next leader, here are the key factors at play. The Republican platform includes a promise to 'prevent World War Three, restore peace in Europe and in the Middle East, and build a great Iron Dome missile defense shield over our entire country.' Throughout the campaign trail, Trump has reiterated those statements, potentially setting the stage for greater missile defense investments. At the same time, he has questioned whether the US should remain in NATO, a longtime point of skepticism for the former president, who has hammered alliance members for failing to live up to the 2 percent GDP commitment for defense spending. Trump has also signaled that he would oppose further military aid for Ukraine unless it enters peace talks, and stated in September that Ukraine should have made 'concessions' to Russia to avoid war, according to the Associated Press. RELATED: Zelensky implores US to continue aid for Ukraine amid election uncertainty During a rally at Madison Square Gardens on Sunday, Trump said he would strengthen and modernize the military, reiterating an old 2020 claim that he had 'rebuilt our military in total.' But Harrison said those comments are somewhat contradictory, leaving it unclear how much defense funding Trump believes is actually needed. 'If you've got all new equipment, why do you need to procure anything else?' Harrison said. 'Of course, it's laughably untrue what he said. But what if he actually believes it?' US President Donald Trump speaks during his meeting with Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg at Winfield House, London on December 3, 2019. (Photo by NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP via Getty Images) While Trump’s first term brought rising budgets and a renewed focus on China to the Pentagon, Trump himself was sometimes a turbulent influence on the department, with moments that included personally involving himself in contract negotiations for the F-35 and Air Force One, and unilaterally promising to cut the defense budget, only to reverse course and boost the budget after meeting with key defense leaders. That volatility makes it hard to know whether Trump is serious when he talks about leaving NATO or signaling that he could revoke support for Ukraine, analysts said. 'Maybe none of this happens. That is one view that, ‘Oh, this is just rhetoric,’' said Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners. 'But I think that there would be a pretty profound period of uncertainty until those answers are known.' Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with TD Cowen, was optimistic about defense investments under a Trump presidency, characterizing the Republican platform as 'very supportive of defense.' He added that prominent national security Republicans in Congress and within the administration would likely be supportive of increasing the base budget, though they may be less likely to approve supplemental spending like the foreign aid bill passed last spring, which approved additional funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and key US defense industrial base priorities. However, even if the Trump administration is broadly supportive of defense spending, other campaign priorities could have negative impacts on the defense industry, Callan said. For instance, plans to enact a 20 percent tariff on all imported goods could result in financial pressure on defense contracts. Another complication could be the potential creation of a new organization, the Department of Government Efficiency, centered on reducing federal spending, Callan said. Trump has said he would tap SpaceX founder Elon Musk to lead the new department, and Musk said on Sunday he believed he could cut at least $2 trillion from the $7.3 trillion federal budget requested for FY25. 'When you start hearing those numbers get thrown around, it's like, if you think defense is going to be rising with a $2 trillion cut, it's not going to happen,' Callan said. 'Not that I think a $2 trillion cut is likely, but just this period of uncertainty about, well, what's going to happen?' Analysts agreed that a Harris victory would likely bring a fair amount of continuity with the Biden administration in terms of both policy and personnel, should the new administration retain some Pentagon leaders like Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has expressed interest in serving under Harris. During her speech at the Democratic National Convention, Harris said she would ensure the United States retains 'the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world,' and that the nation wins the technological race against China in areas like space and artificial intelligence. Unlike Trump, she has vowed to 'stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies,' signaling she would seek further military aid for Ukraine going forward. And while Harris condemned the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, she said she would 'always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself,' confirming that she will also continue military aid for Israel. Still, that doesn’t mean a Harris presidency would mean a gold rush for defense contractors, Harrison said. His prevailing assumption is that a Harris administration would prioritize domestic spending, leading to defense budgets that are 'basically flat with inflation or maybe slight real growth.' 'The only way I would see significant defense budget growth in the Harris administration is if it is part of a deal with congressional Republicans to get through some of her priorities on the non-defense side of the budget,' he said. Vice President Kamala Harris waves after arriving at Ellington Field JRB and being greeted by Chief Master Sergeant Bennie Bellvin, 147th Attack Wing Command Chief and Colonel Bif French, 147th Attack Wing Commander, July 24, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Stacy Cooper) Schweizer said the single best scenario for defense contractors is a Harris win, coupled with a Democratic House and Republican Senate. That permutation of what he called the 'congressional Rubik’s cube' couples Harris’s likely support for Ukraine and Israel with a pro-defense Senate and — most importantly — a House where the far-right Freedom Caucus would have little power to stymie military aid for supplemental spending, he said. The worst-case scenario, according to Harrison, is a narrow Republican majority in the House, 'because the Freedom Caucus will continue to hold defense hostage to try to give more spending cuts overall,' he said. Although defense companies announced third quarter results in late October, just a couple weeks before Election Day, the subject of the next president largely flew under the radar during earnings calls with investors. 'Right now, the stocks are really trading on results,' Callan said. 'They don't appear to be looking beyond results and into election scenarios.' Even when pressed, executives haven’t drawn a distinction between how a Harris or Trump presidency could impact defense spending — at least not publicly. Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden said she didn’t expect a 'significant difference' in defense spending between a Trump or Harris administration during an earnings call last month. 'What we have seen over time is that the defense budget more reflects the threat environment than any particular administration change, and so we fully expect that again, this time,' she said. 'The national defense strategy has remained consistent over the past several years, in the last couple of administrations, and we believe that's because it is responsive to the emerging threats around the globe and focused on both deterring and defending. And in that regard, it's well aligned to the program portfolio that Northrop Grumman has.' Similar sentiments have been shared by Frank St. John, Lockheed Martin’s chief operating officer. During an August interview with Breaking Defense, St. John said that the Pentagon is experiencing 'a flat or a declining real purchasing power' relative to inflation, but added that it was too early to say how defense budget toplines could shape up over the next couple years. 'With regards to the election, we think that deterrence and deterrence capabilities are an enduring theme, regardless of which party is in the executive branch or who’s in control of Congress,' he said. 'And so we think our programs are well supported in the budget, and we’re looking forward to working with whatever the new administration looks like.' Other defense executives pointed to the uncertain political environment as a factor underlying more conservative projections about how business could fare in 2025 and beyond. Speaking to investors during an Oct. 19 earnings call, Leidos Chief Financial Officer Chris Cage said the company sees 'growth momentum' in its defense unit but wants to be 'cautious' about giving more exact financial guidance for 2025 until there is greater certainty on the outcome of the election and ongoing FY25 budget process. 'You look at the backdrop, we're clearly in an election year. There is a risk of … an extended CR and some disruption,' he said. 'If we get more clarity in the several months ahead, we'll be in a better position to refine that point of view going into the early part of next year.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/as-election-day-looms-what-trump-and-harris-presidencies-will-and-wont-mean-for-defense/	2024-11-01T11:30:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241101_harris_trump_shake_GettyImages-2170583836-scaled-e1730474242663.jpg
After French court intervenes, Israeli firms rushing to get to Euronaval	Rafael's c-dome design will be on display at Euronaval 2024. (Rafael) JERUSALEM — On the eve of the annual Euronaval show, a French court has overturned a ban that would have prevented most Israeli companies from showcasing their products at the event. And while that’s good news for Israeli vendors, it also has left key members of the defense industry here scrambling to see if abandoned plans to attend the conference can be salvaged last minute. In mid-October, it was announced that any Israeli firms whose products are being used in the war in Gaza would be barred from presenting at Euronaval, occurring in Paris Nov. 4-7, with the Jerusalem Post saying at least a dozen companies would be affected. It was the second time the rug had been pulled out from under Israeli firms in France, following the firms being banned from attending Eurosatory earlier this year — a restriction which French courts also overturned, though with too little time left for Israeli companies to react. Prior to Euronaval, the French government claimed that the ban didn’t prevent Israeli companies from participating, but rather prevented them from 'promotion of weapons used in Gaza and Lebanon, which cause unacceptable damage to the civilian population.' Companies that want to showcase their wares now have a logistics challenge. Generally, models or full-size products for these kind of defense shows need to be shipped in advance. The uncertainty left companies in the lurch on whether to ship items at all, and now some have to figure out if they want to bother getting equipment in place. Of the 'big three' Israeli firms, Elbit is not presenting at the show. Israel Aerospace Industries, which in the past has showcased radars for naval solutions, as well as missiles, electro-optics and drones, is still weighing the logistics of trying to attend the show on short notice after the court decision. (IAI’s subsidiary Elta has collaborated with Hensoldt in the past on solutions for submarines. Hensoldt, which is not an Israeli company, is attending EuroNaval.) And in a statement to Breaking Defense, a Rafael spokesperson said the company 'is readying for Euronaval where it is focusing on unique modular naval solutions, asymmetric warfare and layered air defense at sea. From C-Dome to the C-UAS capable Typhoon and its various configurations, there is a whole lot in store [for the exhibition].' In the past Rafael has showcased its naval remote weapon station to counter UAVs, the naval version of its Spike missile system, EW systems, including C-Gem which deceived missile seekers and the Torbuster anti-torpedo system. Over the past year Rafael’s C-Dome, the naval version of Iron Dome, has had its first operational interception and the company has been pitching a modular version of C-Dome. A major player when it comes to naval assets is Israel Shipyards. In a statement, the company told Breaking Defense it has already shipped products to France for the show and plans to attend. 'Israel Shipyards will unveil our newest platform, the Mini Shaldag, specifically designed to address the unique challenges of river and lake environments,' the company said. 'Regarding the recent French ruling, the issue of non-discrimination is a central factor in European law. As we have seen with the court’s decision following our petition, it is also upheld in France. However, our focus remains on showcasing our innovative solutions at Euronaval, where we aim to connect and collaborate on pressing maritime security needs.' Plans for smaller firms are unclear, including both DSIT and Orbit, neither of which responded to requests for information by press time. At the 2022 Euronaval DSIT described itself as one of the 'world’s leaders in underwater defence and security solutions' and said it would present 'together with parent company RAFAEL Advanced Defense Systems, a comprehensive, integrated Torpedo Defence System (TDS) for surface vessels.' In the past, Orbit showcased its satellite communication terminals at the show. Orbit announced on October 29 that it had secured a $3 million contract with 'a leading European integrator to supply advanced satellite communication systems for naval military surface platforms.' It did not name the integrator of the platform. The Israel Ministry of Defense did not comment on the developments, though Israel’s Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant previously said the French decision was a 'disgrace.' And in a post on social media, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz congratulated the Israeli companies who had petitioned the French court on the outcome of the ruling. The announcement was a 'significant victory against the unjust and undemocratic decision by the French government to prevent Israeli companies from participating in the Euronaval exhibition,' Katz said. 'This outcome, achieved in part through the legal and diplomatic efforts of the Foreign Ministry, is a critical win for justice and a clear message against attempts to weaken Israel in its fight against forces of evil.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-french-court-intervenes-israeli-firms-rushing-to-get-to-euronaval/	2024-11-01T10:03:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Rafael-CDome-JPEG.jpg
Pentagon developing ‘Responsible AI’ guides for defense, intelligence, interagency — even allies	Images of RAF Air Controllers aboard an RAF Boeing E-3D Sentry, aka AWACS, conducting a mission in support of NATO. (British Ministry of Defense) WASHINGTON — As part of the Biden administration’s global push for 'Responsible Artificial Intelligence,' the Defense Department is building a growing library of interactive online guides to help program managers and other officials develop safe and ethical AI. (AI-aided counter-drone defense? Sure. Algorithms to help draft contracting language? Maybe, with guardrails. Self-aware nuclear launch systems that don't wait for human input? No). Versions have already been published or are in the works for defense officials, the intelligence community, civilian agencies, and even foreign allies, Pentagon RAI director Matthew K. Johnson said this week, with updates addressing generative artificial intelligence and President Joe Biden’s recently signed National Security Memorandum on AI. The original version of the Responsible AI Toolkit, published last November, is essentially an interactive digital checklist. It’s meant to walk Pentagon program managers and other defense officials through the laws, regulations, ethics, and best practices on developing AI. But it was also made available to the public online from the very beginning. And even before that official rollout, RAI director Johnson made clear he saw the toolkit not just as a handy guide for bureaucrats, but as part of a much broader soft-power push to promote American values on AI — and to contrast them with the less scrupulous approaches of adversaries like China. RELATED: Clear guardrails mean faster progress on AI: Biden signs sweeping guidance for DoD &amp; IC Since then, Johnson and his RAI team have been busy, he told a Responsible AI in Defense conference convened this week by the Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Office (CDAO). 'We co-developed a version of the toolkit with NATO,' he said. 'That’s based on our version, [but] we mapped it to NATO’s principles of responsible use and NATO’s data, life cycle, and some other things.' (The NATO version isn’t publicly available, he told Breaking Defense after his remarks). The RAI team is also working with 'other allies and partners' and the US intelligence community, though he didn’t give any details. The long-term ambition is that allied nations will gain confidence in each others’ systems and feel safe connecting them for combined operations, Johnson said. 'If you think about things like CJADC2, Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control, our ability to share information and allow us to interconnect systems at speed is going to require us having streamlined assurance processes,' he said. 'It can also facilitate things like reciprocity. &#8230; If you certify a model through your country's process and our processes are aligned, we may not have to run it through our process,' saving considerable time. The Pentagon RAI team is also developing versions of the toolkit for other US agencies. 'We were appointed by the Executive Office of the President to create the recommended process for government agencies to meet the AI risk requirements under the [2023] Executive Order,' Johnson said. 'We also have integrated into it the ability to show how you meet the requirements under the National Security Memorandum on the issue last week.' Johnson said his team has seen 'a lot of interest across interagency.' 'We've gotten a lot of feedback from OSTP [the White House Office of Science &amp; Technology Policy] and NIST [the National Institute of Standards &amp; Technology], and we're working on getting that into a version two that'll be released to the interagency in the next couple of weeks.' Finally, Johnson and his team aim to expand the toolkits to include evolving guidance on one of the most rapidly advancing and controversial forms of AI: generative artificial intelligence, especially the powerful but hallucination-prone Large Language Models. 'We're currently… developing versions of the toolkit to support approvals and reviews for various use cases,' Johnson said. In particular, he went on, 'we're really focused on developing version of the toolkit right now for generative AI and Large Language Models. Our division wrote the Department's policy on generative AI.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-developing-responsible-ai-guides-for-defense-intelligence-interagency-even-allies/	2024-11-01T09:01:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240320_brit_computer_mod_45169437-scaled-e1710969350247.jpg
IAI ELTA air defense radars	Iron Dome’s Multi-Mission Radar detects rockets &amp; guides interception. (image IAI/ELTA). Maintaining airspace security is more critical than ever in a rapidly evolving threat landscape. Israel has established itself as a global leader in air defense technologies, with Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) ELTA Systems standing out as a Center of Excellence for radar solutions. This leadership position is derived from the constant threat and frequent attacks Israel is exposed to, which have driven the development of cutting-edge, operationally proven technologies. IAI ELTA Systems has positioned itself as a leading provder of advanced radar solutions that serve tactical and strategic air defense needs. With a broad range of radars catering to diverse military requirements, IAI ELTA’s air defense radar systems have earned their place as industry benchmarks, offering reliable, adaptive, and operationally proven solutions. A Comprehensive Approach to Air Defense At the core of any air defense system lays the radar, which provides the crucial capability to detect, track, and classify aerial threats. IAI ELTA Systems offers a comprehensive portfolio of air defense radars that meet various tactical, operational, and strategic levels. Every air defense need has a specific system solution characterized by unique parameters, technologies, and techniques. These systems are designed to detect, track, classify, and engage aerial threats ranging from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to ballistic missiles. What distinguishes IAI ELTA is the ability to tailor solutions that address both battlefield needs and homeland defense, providing continuous situational awareness and threat evaluation. Several radar families are at the core of IAI ELTA’s air defense strategy, including the MMR (Multi-Mission Radar), Green Pine, MS-MMR, Terra, and over-the-horizon (OTH) detection systems. Each is uniquely designed to cover different threats, utilizing advanced radar technologies that integrate seamlessly into various defense architectures. Green Pine &#8211; an advanced high performance strategic early warning radar. (image: IAI/ELTA). Building Blocks for Strategic Missile Defense The ELM-2080 Green Pine radar was developed specifically for Israel's Arrow Weapon System, one of the world’s most advanced anti-ballistic missile systems. Green Pine is designed for threat detection, early warning, and interception guidance and provides the long-range detection capability required for missile defense operating at ranges of hundreds of kilometers away. This radar can operate in a cluttered electromagnetic environment and detect incoming ballistic missiles at great distances, allowing for ample response time. Green Pine radars are not limited to Israel's defense needs; they are also exported to several countries for strategic missile defense roles, underlining the system's reliability and adaptability. Green Pine's performance has made it critical to creating an effective shield against long-range ballistic missile threats. ELM-2090 Terra systems provide unparalleled capabilities for strategic-level threat detection. Comprised of dual-band electronically scanned radar arrays operating in the UHF and S-bands, the Ultra and Spectra radars that make the Terra array detect threats over vast areas. They are particularly valuable for providing early warning of missile launches or airborne incursions by targets with low radar signatures. IAI ELTA's radar portfolio also includes the ELM-2040 OTH A/B system specially designed for over-the-horizon (OTH) detection. This radar offers the ability to detect airborne targets, including cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles, beyond the horizon, thereby extending the radar's reach well beyond the immediate theatre of operations. OTH radar capabilities provide a comprehensive air picture over a vast area of land and sea, that helps in early detection, especially for low-altitude and stealth threats that would otherwise go unnoticed by conventional radar systems. The ability to detect targets before they come within direct line of sight significantly enhances the preparedness and response capabilities of a nation’s air defense forces. Multi-Mission Radar &#8211; Proven Tactical Versatility The ELM-2084 MMR is one of IAI ELTA's most recognized systems, renowned for its exceptional versatility and operational reliability. The MMR is the backbone radar for Israel’s Iron Dome and David’s Sling air defense systems. The MMR is in service with several NATO air forces and other advanced militaries worldwide. It is designed to provide real-time detection and tracking of incoming threats like rockets, artillery, mortars, aircraft, and drones. The MMR's adaptability means it can seamlessly integrate with different air defense systems, making it suitable for addressing rapidly changing battlefield conditions. The MMR employs an S-band Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) technology, which enables simultaneous tracking of many targets, from low-flying drones and cruise missiles to high-altitude rockets, ballistic missiles, and aircrafts. Its software-based architecture allows the radar to be updated on the go, ensuring it remains a step ahead of evolving threats. The MMR family includes several variants that are operational in armed forces worldwide. The family includes the MS-MMR an enhanced version that adds passive detection capabilities to the radars, making it ideal for defending against advanced, low-signature threats, while CMMR, a compact version, is configured for mobile operation on tactical vehicles.

How US election might impact stalled Saudi-Israeli normalization, arms sales to Gulf	)US President Donald Trump, US First lady Melania Trump (2nd R), Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud (2nd L) and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi (L) put their hands on an illuminated globe during the inauguration ceremony of the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on May 21, 2017. (Photo by Bandar Algaloud / Saudi Royal Council / Handout/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images) BEIRUT — The outcome of Tuesday's US presidential election is unlikely to have much short-term impact on the diplomatic effort to normalize relations between the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and Israel, as the fallout of Israeli military actions over the last year has made such an agreement untenable politically, experts tell Breaking Defense. Saudi-Israeli normalization has been a foreign policy priority for the US over the last two administrations. Under the Abraham Accords, the Trump administration helped ink normalization deals between Israel and the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco, and had hoped to conclude such a deal with Riyadh. The Biden administration then tried to close the deal before the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel set off a regional conflagration. It stands to reason that whomever wins on Nov. 5, either former president Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris would also seek to tie the Saudis and Israelis together. But five experts told Breaking Defense they see no easy way forward for such an agreement, no matter how much a new US president may seek to encourage it — at least until Israel ends its operations in Gaza. 'Regardless of whether Harris or Trump wins this year’s presidential election, I don’t expect Saudi Arabia to normalize relations with Israel at any point in the foreseeable future,' said Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics, a US-based consulting firm. He added that 'any talk of Israeli normalization [is] toxic in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia’s leadership would be taking huge risks if they were to bring Riyadh into the Abraham Accords at a time in which images of death and destruction in Palestine are livestreaming 24/7.' Mohammed Soliman, strategic adviser at McLarty Associates and director at the Middle East Institute, said that seeking normalization between the two countries is a 'bipartisan priority' that should play out regardless of who wins the election. But he, too, is skeptical anything will happen anytime soon. 'The situation in Gaza and its trajectory will play a fundamental role in shaping the prospects for any potential normalization agreement, influencing how it is negotiated, its timelines, and its parameters. Whether this is successful or not is difficult to assess at the moment,' Soliman said. Mohammed Baharoon, general director of B'huth, a Dubai-based public policy research center, said that one way the US president can influence such an agreement is putting pressure on Israel to 'reach a political deal with Palestinian that provides them with a state and end the occupation which has been a major source of instability in the region.' Ali Bakir, professor at Qatar University and non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, noted that Saudi Arabia has signaled it has two key requirements it wants to see before moving forward with normalization. 'These include a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and a NATO-like security agreement with the US. Currently, it appears that the conditions are not conducive for Riyadh to advance in this area,' he said. The US-Saudi security deal, something that seemed extremely close before the Oct. 7 attacks upset the regional balance, is a key lever here, said Abdallah Al Junaid, a Bahraini strategic expert. 'Saudi Arabia is clear on that, no normalization without 1) Addressing the Palestinian Israeli solution, and 2) The Saudis won't sign a deal that constraints their strategic security options. So if the next president of the USA secures that, the Saudis will,' he told Breaking Defense. In April, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced that a new defense pact between the United States and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is 'potentially very close to completion.' Getting that agreement in place could give either a Trump or Harris administration a modicum of power in trying to find peace between Riyadh and Jerusalem. But summing up the tone of the analysts, Cafiero said, 'I don’t see either a Harris or Trump administration having much success in terms of bringing new Arab-Islamic countries into the normalization camp.' Another tool the US president could employ in the region is a tried and true one: dangling arms sales for policy wins. The Trump administration put an emphasis on 'economic security as national security,' and loosened guidance on arms sales in order to make it easier to sell weapons abroad. In contrast, the Biden administration put an emphasis on human rights when judging potential arms sales, and is seen as less willing to open the armaments chest to the Gulf nations. How a new administration could handle weapon sales to the region is of great interest, with eyes likely to fall on Trump should he win the presidency, especially as one of the signature moments of the Trump administration was his visit to Riyadh and announcement of a major arms sale package to the Saudis. 'Buyers might perceive Trump as more transactional, potentially leading them to believe that purchasing more weapons would grant them greater influence over him,' said Bakir, the Qatar University expert. But, he warned, 'Trump would likely aim to increase arms sales to the Gulf States, possibly pressuring some of them to buy more, even if it's not in their best interest.' That could also mean revisiting arms sales announcements from before the Biden administration. Most notable is plans to sell the UAE F-35 Joint Strike Fighters, alongside MQ-9 SeaGuardian UAVs. That deal fell apart over US concerns about UAE's Chinese 5G wireless technology. In the intervening time, the UAE seems to have moved on to other plans, meaning it's no guarantee that the F-35 deal happens if Trump returns. 'Most [Gulf Cooperation Council] air forces have acquired 4.5 generations fighters, the next strategic step is to pool their resources in R&amp;D to develop the smart munitions that their armed forces need,' Al Junaid told Breaking Defense. 'Saudi Arabia and the UAE have opted to different strategic approach by partnering [with] others in the development 5th and 6th [generation] solutions rather than acquiring solutions.' And of course, each country in the region has slightly different desires when it comes to arms. 'For the UAE, the F-35 deal could be contingent on other issues, such as their potential role in Gaza,' said Bakir. 'Israel expects the US to maintain its regional military edge. For Saudi Arabia, the primary goal is to secure a NATO-style agreement with the US, which would obligate the US to protect Saudi Arabia from foreign threats. Qatar, on the other hand, may seek a more robust military-partnership and US military presence in the country.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/how-us-election-might-impact-stalled-saudi-israeli-normalization-arms-sales-to-gulf-experts/	2024-11-01T07:56:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/trump-orb-e1730389404351.jpg
‘Alarming’ but ‘not surprising’: Australia reportedly left with 1 operational sub amid repairs, upgrades	A Collins Class submarine at Henderson Marine Complex, Western Australia. Credit Australian DoD SYDNEY — Five of Australia's six aging Collins-class submarines are undergoing repairs or are awaiting upgrades, according to a new report here, leaving only one fully operational boat to prowl the Pacific. It's a development that could hobble Canberra's ability to project power in the region and one that analysts said was 'alarming' if not predictable. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation broke the story today, quoting 'defense sources' who said that two of the Collins boats are currently in Adelaide's Osborne shipyard. Workers there are striking, which is reportedly also causing delays to the in-depth maintenance underway. Unexpected levels of corrosion are reportedly slowing work as well. The three other boats are at HMAS Stirling's Garden Island naval base in Western Australia The Defense Ministry issued a statement to the ABC that it has 'more than one boat available' for operations 'if required.' The statement said that the Collins boats 'meet government-directed levels of operational availability.' The ministry did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment. Analysts expressed concern about the news, noting successive Australian governments have deferred and delayed making decisions about what was to replace the Collins class and how they should be maintained and upgraded. The Collins-class subs are being upgraded to extend their projected lifespans. The 'Life-of-Type Extension' (LOTE) was announced in June. Australia had already scaled back earlier planned upgrades to optronics for the Collins. Optronics refers to a visual sensor technology widely used on submarines. The boats will also not receive the Tomahawk cruise missile. The new report is 'pretty alarming news, especially since these boats have to operate through to the 2040s (alongside the Virginia class SSNs) and much was riding on LOTE, which has now been significantly scaled back. If our Collins class SSKs are non-operational in 2024, I really doubt that they will be a credible force through the remainder of this decade, let alone into the next one,' Malcolm Davis, a defense expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, said in an email. The so-called capability gap between the planned lifespan of the Collins class and the arrival of the first Australian-owned Virginia class nuclear-powered attack submarines has long been a topic of concern here. The United States intends to sell Australia three Virginia class boats as soon as the early 2030s. Australia has an option to buy up to two more. If the Collins fleet remains as hobbled as they are now, that gap may need to be addressed more urgently. One UK and up to four US nuke boats will rotate regularly to HMAS Sterling starting in 2027 in what is called Submarine Rotational Force &#8211; West (SRF-West). That force may be used to bridge the capability gap. 'My guess is that government will try to explain that SRF-West will carry the burden if the Collins class boats can't deploy, but that argument is pretty unconvincing given that the SRF-W boats are US Navy and occasional Royal Navy Astutes,' Davis said. The AUKUS Optimal Pathway, the government's plan for acquiring next-generation subs, should have included an option to purchase Japanese or South Korean conventionally powered subs to replace Collins immediately rather than pursuing the LOTE upgrades, argued Davis. He said the Royal Australian Navy was opposed to such an option because they worried that the nuclear option would be canceled. The state of the Collins fleet was 'not surprising,' according to Jennifer Parker, a former Royal Australian Navy officer now at the National Security College of the Australian National University. 'If the reporting is correct, it’s not surprising given the state of the aged boats outlined by Defense in estimates and the plan to extend their life,' Parker said in an email. 'The lesson here is that successive governments have delayed decision making on recapitalization of the Navy. Now the issues can’t be immediately fixed. We must learn to start planning for replacement capabilities when classes of vessels are first commissioned and make timely decisions.' At the end of May, officials with the Australian Submarine Corporation (ASC) told a parliamentary hearing that half of the Collins fleet would be unavailable for the rest of the year as they were being upgraded and treated for unexpected corrosion problems discovered on two of the boats.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/alarming-but-not-surprising-australia-reportedly-left-with-1-operational-sub-amid-repairs-upgrades/	2024-11-01T06:43:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/20230207adf8630742_0011.jpeg
Army eyes balloon motherships to drop ‘lethal and non-lethal’ drones, aid in counterspace ops	The 3D Multi-Domain Task Force, in conjunction with the Office of the Undersecretary of Defense, launched High-Altitude Balloons (HABs) from Won Pat International Airport in Guam on June 10, 2024. (US Army photo by Sgt. Perla Alfaro) WASHINGTON — As the US Army contemplates floating extremely high-flying balloons into the stratosphere for a variety of missions, service space officials suggested recently that one of those missions might be carrying and launching drones that would disrupt or destroy enemy space assets on the ground, like jammers or satellite control stations. Col. Donald Brooks, commander of the Army's 1st Space Brigade, told the annual Association of the US Army conference earlier this month that the service will have 'multi-form factor balloons operating at various altitudes, executing different mission sets, ultimately increasing the target problem set and dilemma for our adversaries, which directly supports the Army and [Defense Department] resiliency efforts and makes us more lethal.' The balloons are envisioned as aiding in 'deep sensing and support long-range precision fires, enable navigation warfare, provide network extension via voice and data, enable assured access to PNT — our position navigation and timing — and have both lethal and non-lethal payloads.' But, as a senior Army space official, Brooks also said the Army is 'integrating high-altitude platforms with the ability to reconstitute, augment and surge space effects, if and when our adversary interferes with our freedom of access and movement maneuver in the space domain.' A chart shown during his presentation offered more detail, depicting drone-dropping balloons for missions deep into enemy territory and apparently targeting terrestrial space assets. An Army graphic shown during an Oct. 15 AUSA presentation by Commander of the 1st Space Brigade Col. Donald Brooks. (Photo: Theresa Hitchens/Breaking Defense) Comparing the idea to 'Russian stacking dolls,' Andrew Evans, director of the Army’s Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Task Force, told Breaking Defense on Oct. 16 that 'the concept of having a balloon drop something else is not new.' The Army, he explained, is looking at a number of potential payloads that could be dropped from balloons, as well as other types of high-altitude platforms. 'So, the idea would be that if we do successfully exploit the stratosphere, which we will do eventually &#8230; it won't be exclusive to a sensing mission, it won't be exclusive to an [intelligence] mission, it won't be exclusive to a comms relay mission. It'll be all of the above, in a variety of different forms and factors. &#8230; [W]e'll probably fly decoys as well,' Evans said. 'That's how you win, I think, in the future, is that you deliver multiple different payloads in multiple different ways for different missions,' he added At the moment, however, there isn't any formal Army solicitation to industry for employing counterspace drones launched from high-altitude platforms of any sort — whether those be balloons, crewed aircraft, bigger drones or helicopters, according to a service spokesperson. Rather, a number of different Army organizations across mission areas and within Army Futures Command are involved in experiments to test out potential applications. 'The Army is considering applications in which high-altitude platforms employ launched effects, aiding in the ability to see and sense further. Currently, there is no formal RFP [request for proposal] or RFI [request for information] for launched effects from a high altitude platform. However, the Army continues to learn more from its experiments and Soldier feedback about the unique potential military capabilities these platforms could provide,' the spokesperson said Oct. 25. 'Launched effects' is the Army term of art for small drones that shoot out of something else mid-flight to collect info or strike targets, and the service is studying a number of options for short-, medium- and long-range missions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-eyes-balloon-motherships-to-drop-lethal-and-non-lethal-drones-aid-in-counterspace-ops/	2024-11-01T05:16:56-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/8498180-e1721841254694.jpg
Marine Corps reveals what went wrong in 2023 missing F-35 saga	A U.S. Marine Corps F-35B with Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron 265 (Rein.), 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, takes off aboard the amphibious assault ship USS America (LHA-6), in the Pacific Ocean, June 12, 2023. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Cpl. Christopher R. Lape) DENVER — The US Marine Corps revealed today that the F-35B stealth fighter that captured the nation's attention after going missing for a full day in September 2023 pulled off its inadvertent technological vanishing act due to an electrical malfunction — though the service still said the surviving pilot was to blame for the plane's eventual crash. According to the Marine Corps, on Sept. 17, 2023 the F-35 pilot was attempting to climb out of a 'missed approach in instrument meteorological conditions and heavy precipitation near Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina,' when he ejected from the plane. The release said there had been an 'electrical event during flight' that took out several on-board systems, and there was a 'probability that the helmet-mounted display and panoramic cockpit display were not operational for at least three distinct periods.' Still, the service said, the plane was airworthy. 'The pilot incorrectly diagnosed an out-of-controlled flight emergency and ejected from a flyable aircraft, albeit during a heavy rainstorm compounded with aircraft electrical and display malfunctions,' the Marines Corps said. Though the pilot punched out successfully and landed safely, the plane went on to fly by itself for 11 minutes and 21 seconds due to the jet’s 'advanced automatic flight-control systems,' the service said, before crashing '64 nautical miles northeast of the airfield in Williamsburg County, South Carolina.' That 11 minutes-plus of flying proved a problem for the military as officials scrambled to find the jet shortly after the pilot ejected. Joint Base Charleston even appealed to the public for help in locating it. Predictably, the fiasco led to a flood of jokes on social media, along with statements from bewildered elected officials. The F-35 is supposed to be masked from radar in combat conditions, but when flying under circumstances like those surrounding the crash, the stealth fighter often flies with a transponder that transmits its location. The transponder’s failure stemming from the electrical issue, the jet’s low observable coating and its 'eventual descent below the air-traffic control radar horizon' all contributed to its loss of radar contact and subsequent prolonged disappearance, according to the Marine Corps’s release. 'The mishap resulted in no ground-related injuries, but it did result in property damage in the form of lost forested land and crops' in the rural area where the F-35B crashed, the release says. The jet was assigned to Marine Fighter Attack Training Squadron (VMFAT 501) under the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing, and the pilot 'was qualified and current to conduct the scheduled flight,' according to the service’s release. The F-35B is the short takeoff and vertical landing version of the tri-variant fighter. The Marines Corps said that 'no punitive actions [were] recommended.' The Military Times reported the pilot was given a new command nearly a year after the incident, but was relieved months after taking the helm. The investigation concluded that the electrical malfunction 'was not related to any maintenance activities.' Asked about the crash investigation, Russ Goemaere, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office, said in a statement that '[t]he F-35 electrical power system performed as intended in accommodating the malfunction of an electrical component, and the aircraft remained fully controllable throughout the event. The F-35 remains safe to fly worldwide.' 'The safety of F-35 pilots is our number one priority and we will continue to work with the Services and our industry partners to ensure the safety of our warfighters,' Goemaere said. F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin referred a request for comment to the Marine Corps and Joint Program Office. Lee Ferran contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/marine-corps-reveals-what-went-wrong-in-2023-missing-f-35-saga/	2024-10-31T14:58:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/7857161-scaled-e1716997784745.jpg
Crew safety for units under armor: Accurate sensors are the key	Thales' Catherine thermal image sensor is seen on the gun turret of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle, ACV-30, to provide advanced threat detection and imaging for the weapons station and crew. (Thales photo) The threat environment for ground vehicle platforms has evolved significantly. Maneuver formations now face a multifaceted threat that includes both kinetic force-on-force and unmanned systems threats and non-kinetic effects such as active electronic warfare, or a combination of both. EW is a particular challenge, not only being able to detect and react to threats but also being able to understand and mitigate the formation’s own EW signature in order to be less visible to the enemy. These combined threats are being mitigated with a three-fold operations construct that provides a comprehensive understanding of the battlefield, an ability to detect threats, and capability to deny or degrade those threats. Together they give maneuver forces a means to understand what’s going on around the formation and each individual platform. Situational awareness in those scenarios come about through three enabling buckets of technology: The specific threat and capability requirements may vary across Areas of Responsibility such as U.S. Central Command or European Command, but the core principles of situational awareness, threat detection, and counter-measure capabilities remain critical for ensuring vehicle and crew survivability. 'We now must assume we are always operating in contested environments,' said Erik Balascik, director of business development for ground vehicles, Thales Defense &amp; Security, Inc. (TDSI). 'If you're an armored platform commander you are now operating in a closed environment, inside your vehicle. 'Now, given the threats and technology for crew and vehicle survivability, crews operate closed hatch. They are physically inside the vehicle either in the turret or hull of the vehicle, and they must rely on external sensors for situational awareness.' Sensors for closed-hatch operations The most important sensor types for vehicle survivability include infrared sensors for vision, acoustic sensors for shot protection, and thermal imagers for targeting. HD Minerva is Thales’s latest uncooled thermal imaging sensor, which is the outside eyes for driver vision enhancement (DVE) and local situational awareness (LSA) as the vehicle crew conducts under-armor maneuvers. Thales’s Minerva HD uncooled thermal imaging sensor is the ‘outside eyes’ of the vehicle crew as they conduct under armor operations, and its 1280&#215;1024 HD detector provides 2x more pixels than previous VGA sensors (Thales photo) Designed and manufactured by Thales in Canada, home to Thales’ global center of excellence for uncooled technologies, Minerva integrates uncooled Long Wave Infrared (LWIR) HD 1280&#215;1024, 12-micron detector – a rarity in uncooled devices – and a full HD 1920&#215;1080 visible module. Minerva’s sensor outputs fully digital 60 Hz video (3G-SDI), and its low-latency and automatic image processing algorithms ensure users experience no delays in optimizing situational awareness without needing to make adjustments. That means users can trust the live images to give them the information they need to act fast, feel safe, and gain a crucial tactical advantage. 'Our camera provides twice the pixels than the previous sensors, and the crews will immediately see the difference based upon what they had in the past,' said Balascik. 'You can see farther and even better than you would see standing outside a vehicle with your own eyes. It's a completely different way to experience the world around you to understand what your vehicle and the vehicles in the formation are doing.' If HD Minerva is the eyes of an enhanced DVE/LSA system, then gunshot protection through a Thales system called Acusonic is the ears. Acusonic gunshot detection overcomes an established weakness in other shot-detection systems. Rather than relying solely upon picking up muzzle blast to provide accurate bearings alone – the Achilles Heal of other systems due to false alarms – Acusonic also utilizes the projectile's supersonic shock wave and wake signature to augment the weapon muzzle blast to provide detection and threat location capabilities in diverse battlespace. Thales Acusonic for robotic applications transforms the system into a multi-functional sensor by providing a telepresence capability to the robotic vehicle operator. (Thales photo) 'That's what sets us apart from prior systems,' said Balascik, noting that Acusonic was selected for both the British Army’s Ajax armored fighting vehicle and Boxer mechanized infantry vehicle programs. 'It is being evaluated on multiple prototypes in the United States, and the reason that we're getting that acceptance is because the system's not constantly giving you false alarms. It is actually a force multiplier instead of the hindrance for the operation.' It has also shown it can provide accurate bearings to firing positions from moving platforms not just on land but also on the water for special forces operating in littoral or riverine environments where hostile firing positions may be concealed, for example. Interestingly enough, the collection of signals from Acusonic can also play an important role in ground robotics on platforms like the XM30 Mechanized Infantry Combat Vehicle to provide what’s called 'telepresence.' Most robotic vehicles only provide visual sensing, but one equipped with Acusonic would let the operator not only see what the robot is seeing but actually hear what it picks up to get an even better understanding of the surroundings. The third key category of sensor for vehicle survivability is thermal imaging and laser range finding for targeting. Thales has a broad portfolio when it comes to targeting, including a cooled thermal imager called SharpView that the U.S. Marine Corps has integrated onto its Marine Air Defense Integrated System (MADIS) air-defense vehicle, and a system called Panoramic Above Armor Gimbal (PAAG). PAAG is a stabilized 360-degree electronic surveillance and sighting system in a compact package that gives vehicle commanders and crews a wide range of capabilities through a combination of sensors. They include a cooled thermal imager and high-resolution daylight color camera, both with continuous zoom, along with a laser rangefinder and laser target designator. Together they give crews long-range threat detection and identification, weapon aiming and fire support capabilities, day and night, in all weather conditions. Everything is remotely controlled from inside the vehicle to keep crews protected at all times. 'Whether it is for air defense systems like MADIS or new vehicles like the Marine Corps’ Advanced Reconnaissance Vehicle, our camera system provides those vehicle crews with the next generation of thermal imagers,' said Balascik. 'It’s critical because the military is up-gunning to 30mm, Medium Caliber Weapon System turrets. That means you need additional distance from your thermal imagers so you can see to the same maximum effective range of that weapon system.' Power management and standards for SA In space-constrained vehicles, integration of these systems presents its own particular challenge. For example, the vehicle systems themselves need to have certain smart capabilities like intra-vehicle network management and especially energy management. 'We can make decisions with our vehicles today that are more capable than our vehicles from years past, but they still roll from point A to point B and have a finite amount of power to drive these vehicles and also power the systems that are inside,' said Patrick Allison, director of DoD business development for TDSI. 'You can't go to the battlefield without power. It's absolutely necessary. And how you manage power can make or break your battle plan.' Thales has a family of power management systems that not only distribute power, they channel the right amount of power to various systems across the vehicle, which can also help mitigate vehicle signature management. The power loads are smartly managed to let operators take power from one area and reserve it for another when necessary. That’s especially valuable at night and during obscure operations so crews can have a silent-watch capability where systems are running without the vehicle being turned on. Finally, compliance to standards like CMOSS and VICTORY are critical enabling technologies that allow new capabilities to be integrated onto vehicles by the government and OEMs as threats and requirements evolve. 'In the Command, Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I) arena, vehicles introduced post-2030 will have a requirement written around CMOSS and CMFF compliance,' noted Allison. 'That will let the Army upgrade or add systems to these platforms all based on open standards and architecture with interfaces that permit systems to be swapped between platforms. Thales is working the C4I aspect of CMOSS and bringing in capability for both voice and data on the battlefield.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/crew-safety-for-units-under-armor-accurate-sensors-are-the-key/	2024-10-31T12:25:17-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Thales-lead-image-scaled.jpg
Full house: Google to be final JWCC partner authorized for Secret-level cloud work in 2025	Warfighters operate equipment at the lab located at Defense Information Systems Agency Headquarters at Fort Meade Md. (David Abizaid / Defense Information Systems Agency) DoDIIS 2024 — By the beginning of next year, all four of the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability (JWCC) providers will have reached Impact Level 6 (IL-6) security authorization, which deals with information classified Secret, as Google becomes the last to join the pack, a military official said Tuesday. Having the four cloud service providers that can operate in the IL-6 environment is a 'massive help' in JWCC's development, according to Lt. Col. John Hall, who serves as the joint program lead for the JWCC at the Defense Information Systems Agency. He added that having all four at IL-6 will prevent any vendor lock. 'It allows you to get the right [cloud provider] for the job, and then potentially allows competition. So you know when they start to do things like rates, it gives you that capability,' he told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Department of Defense Intelligence Information Systems conference Tuesday. 'So it's been massively helpful to have four different [cloud providers]; it keeps [the vendors] honest too.' The other three providers, Oracle, Microsoft and Amazon Web Services, already have authorization to operate on an IL-6 environment in the JWCC. IL-6 is reserved for the storage and processing of information classified up to the 'Secret' level. Migrating data to the JWCC has been on the top of the Pentagon's to-do list since it announced the initiative in 2022. The contract is worth up to a collective $9 billion, and recently crossed the $1 billion mark in task orders back in September. As the Pentagon continues its mass migration to the JWCC, it’s important for the department and its business partners to think of operating on the cloud as a fundamental part of one’s information technology architecture, Hall said during a breakout session Tuesday. 'Cloud should be something that is part of your larger IT infrastructure. I don't think it is one or the other, [the cloud] should be built in to help you with your IT, services and delivery,' he said. 'Thinking about how you integrate multiple different clouds is important, because if you think about them as siloed like, ‘This is my Google cloud; this is my AWS; this is my Microsoft; this is my Oracle,’ you're not achieving the efficiencies that all of them will achieve together as a whole,' he said. 'So I encourage everybody, when you look at these things, think of it as multi-cloud, not separate multiple standalone instances.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/full-house-google-to-be-final-jwcc-partner-authorized-for-secret-level-cloud-work-in-2025/	2024-10-31T12:14:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241031_DVIDS_DISA_lab_8558227-scaled-e1730382574632.jpg
The truly spooky munitions shortage for the Pentagon: Silver bullets	This mystical creature is rolling his eyes because someone came up and said to him, 'A werewolf? More like a war-wolf, amirite?' (Graphic Breaking Defense, original images via Getty/DVIDS; caption to be blamed on Editor-in-Chief Aaron Mehta) WASHINGTON — With werewolves on the prowl and vampires stalking the shadows, there's no more valuable munition on Halloween than silver bullets, legendarily capable of felling supernatural foes. The concept of a silver bullet may have its origins in folklore, but the term long ago evolved to signify a simple, quick solution to an intractable problem. And to listen to Pentagon officials and others in the US national security establishment beset with intractable problems — from Russia's invasion of Ukraine to tech innovation to spooky drone incursions — the Defense Department could really use a few in their five-sided Trick or Treat baskets. (The military does actually employ a 'Silver Bullet,' an all-in-one secure comms capsule that can be loaded aboard transport aircraft to keep senior officials in communication, and apparently in comfort, while they're in the air. But why let that get in the way of a good gag?) This Halloween, Breaking Defense has collected a list of times defense leaders have openly wished that a silver bullet would appear, or lamented that one doesn't seem available. This is a non-exhaustive list of all mostly from 2024, but still gives a sense of how the munitions shortage facing the US and its allies extends to the realm of the mystical. Earlier this month, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin made an impassioned speech (at least for him) in defense of America's commitment to backing Kyiv. But, he said, no one thing the US or any of its allies could give Ukraine would be the 'silver bullet, no single capability will turn the tide.' 'What matters is the way that Ukraine fights back. What matters is the combined effects of your military capabilities. And what matters is staying focused on what works,' he said. The speech could serve as a summary of US policy when it comes to capabilities provided to Ukraine, in which just about every major weapon system announced for Kyiv came with the same caveat: it's not a silver bullet that will end the conflict. That's true of the decision to send American Abrams tanks, when then-Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley said in April 2023, 'I would also caution, there's no silver bullet in war. &#8230; The outcomes of battles and wars are the function of many, many variables.' Or in August 2023 when Gen. James Hecker, commander of US Air Forces Europe, said the F-16's future introduction to combat is 'not going to be a silver bullet, [that] all of a sudden they're going to start taking down [Russian air defenses] because they have an F-16.' This year, officials used the phrase when discussing sending additional Patriot air defense batteries and the Ukrainian employment of the Army Tactical Missile System, better known as ATACMS. 'I believe they will make a difference. But as I've said before at this podium — and as you've heard from Secretary Austin, the Chairman, and other senior military officials — there is no silver bullet in this conflict,' White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters in April. A few times this year officials have employed the silver bullet rhetoric to make the case against allowing Ukraine to strike more deeply into Russia with American arms than they are comfortable with — a long-running and ongoing controversy. 'You heard me say the other day that there is no silver bullet when it comes to things like this,' Austin said in September when asked about loosening restrictions on Kyiv. 'One thing doesn't determine the end of the end of a conflict or the transition in that conflict. It's a combination of different things that create the effects that you want to create. But I think as you make those decisions, the goals and objectives need to be clear, what are you trying to accomplish as you employ those weapons systems?' Based partly on lessons they've learned from Ukraine, US officials have been increasingly concerned about the novel threat that drones present, combined with the older but still potent threat from missiles. And while none of those unmanned systems are haunted (we think), it sounds like a silver bullet would still be useful. In April, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy John Plumb praised Integrated Air and Missile Defense (IAMD) systems, specifically saying that in both Ukraine and Israel, 'air and missile defense systems have proven to be indispensable, life-saving assets: defending military forces, civilian populations, and critical infrastructure against unprovoked terror and aggression.' But, as the reader may expect by now, he cautioned, 'I don't want to leave you with the impression that IAMD systems are a silver bullet against every type of sophisticated adversary threat.' 'Relying solely on traditional air and missile defense systems — with a limited number of interceptors, guided by large, detectable radars in closed fire control systems — can no longer be the only response against the array of technologically sophisticated offensive air and missile systems threatening U.S. interests,' he said. Similarly, in December a senior US Army official said the service was purposefully not seeking a 'silver bullet' solution to the growing drone problem, but a layered defense system. There's certainly no shortage of specific tech problems that could use silver bullets. One involves hardening US forces' position, navigation and timing (PNT) so that they can operate in GPS-denied environments. 'There is no silver bullet,' Nikki Markiel, senior GEOINT authority for geomatics at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), told Breaking Defense in May. 'Everybody would like to have one. And I think that is where a lot of the struggle comes, because GPS has been easy. It’s ubiquitous.' Another revolves around the Pentagon's sprawling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) initiative and the data-sharing its meant to do in an incredibly complex network environment. 'Our ability to push data in the places and to the people that need to get it right now is confined by whether or not you’re on a network that allows me to talk to you,' Brig Gen. Luke Cropsey, the Air Force’s integrating program executive officer for Command, Control, Communications and Battle Management (C3BM), said in July 2023. To broaden JADC2 capabilities, Cropsey said he needs new tools to enable better data transfer, ones he cautioned would not materialize in a 'silver bullet' solution. More broadly, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks highlighted the silver bullet problem when looking back over her tenure in a 30,000-foot view of the defense industrial base's ability to innovate within Pentagon acquisition structures. 'I think the biggest takeaway I could give you is that &#8230; any attempt to simplify to some kind of silver bullet system, fix to the system, you know, those will fail,' she said in March. 'We have needs across the department that are vast and that kind of fall all across the spectrum, software, hardware, everything in between, and most importantly, integration of all of that.' Just a few weeks before that, Hicks specifically discussed the institutional roadblocks when it comes to the development and adoption of artificial intelligence. 'So for three years, we've been taking a comprehensive, iterative, warfighter-centric approach to defense innovation writ large — recognizing we face an accumulation of challenges and barriers, and there is no silver bullet that will lower them all,' she said at the February Global AI Contest event. More recently, she decried budgetary delays and its affect on the Pentagon's plans. 'We've been able to deliver real outcomes,' Hicks said. 'There is no silver bullet at a level that we're talking about, [which is] the scale of the Defense Department.' Perhaps Hicks, in her push for innovation, should have simply asked industry to come up with schematics for a truly devastating weapon: a silver bullet for all the DoD's problems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-truly-spooky-munitions-shortage-for-the-pentagon-silver-bullets/	2024-10-31T10:00:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241031_werewolf_soldier.png
HII slashes financial outlook for 2024 due to contract delays, supply chain issues	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Supply chain problems, COVID-era contract terms and lagging contract negotiations with the Navy hampered shipbuilding giant HII during the third quarter, forcing the company to lower its financial guidance for the year, the company announced today. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to top out at $100 million, a drastic reduction from a previous estimate of between $600 million and $700 million. HII also withdrew its five-year cash flow outlook, which spanned from 2024 to 2028. Shares of the company plummeted 23 percent today as the company failed to meet Wall Street expectations. 'The long-term value equation for HII has not changed. There's unprecedented demand for our products and services,' CEO Chris Kastner told investors during an earnings call. 'We remain confident in our mid- to long-term guidance of nine to 10 percent shipbuilding margins, and we firmly believe the actions we are taking will enable us to stabilize performance as we continue to work through these shifts.' The company’s Newport News Shipbuilding division — which builds aircraft carriers and submarines — took a total $78 million in charges, including $34 million related to design changes for Block IV Virginia-class submarines, with the rest of the impact spread between two Ford-class carriers and the refueling and overhaul of the John C. Stennis (CVN-74), said Chief Financial Officer Tom Stiehle. Executives broke down the company’s challenges into two buckets. First, it is unclear whether HII will wrap up contract negotiations with the Navy for 17 Virginia-class Block V and Block VI and Columbia-class submarines by the end of the year, which could alter the company’s profitability and cash flow for the year and beyond. RELATED: Supply chain issues slowing down General Dynamics sub construction, CEO says Second, HII’s shipyards have underperformed due to late deliveries from its supply chain and a lowered experience level among its own workforce, which has led to greater than expected rework. 'It bears repeating that nearly all of the ships currently under construction were negotiated prior to COVID, and since those contracts were signed, we have seen a significant loss of shipbuilding experience in our yards,' Kastner said in a statement accompanying the results.'Those ship contracts, which we are still operating under at Newport News, did not anticipate in their cost targets and risk limiting clauses the significant disruption of our workforce and supply chain, or extended periods of heightened cost inflation.' On the ongoing negotiations with the Navy, Kastner said the discussions were a chance to 'reset' contract terms to reflect those post-COVID realities. 'We've been working very hard with the customer to try to get those 17 ships right. It's a broad-based sort of contract that we're working on that really unlocks investment in in labor and infrastructure and technology across the portfolio,' he said. 'We thought we were pretty close to getting it done. It's in review still, and alternatives are being reviewed, and we're supporting that conversation, but it's just created some unpredictability.' RELATED: From Kabul to keel laying, Afghan immigrants find new careers at US shipyards In a note to investors, J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said the company's third quarter results and withdrawal of its cash flow guidance was 'a worse outcome than we expected.' 'Shipbuilding, and especially submarine building, is a top national priority that is attracting significant funding,' he wrote. 'As parts of industry struggle to keep pace with demand, however, the Navy and Congress may need to take more dramatic action to advance their plans if they are not content to muddle along.' Among the challenges at Newport News is an investigation into reports that workers had improperly welded noncritical structures on carriers and submarines. An initial assessment found that fewer than two dozen welders did not consistently follow procedures in their weld process, Stiele said, adding that the company continues to work with the Navy on a comprehensive investigation. HII took an initial charge connected to the welds, which Stiehle characterized as 'immaterial,' but the total financial impact will not be known until the investigation is over, he said. Cash flow for the next couple of years will be 'choppy' and heavily dependent on whether the company is able to improve performance as it enters its new contracts, Kastner said, adding that the company is also taking a 'hard look' at its expenses. HII’s supply chain issues echo concerns raised by General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic, who said the company would slow submarine construction because its supply chain could not keep pace with General Dynamics Electric Boat. 'We’re going to control what we control,' Novakovic said last week on a GD earnings call. 'We’re going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see is more of a predictable supply chain schedule that is elongated. We’ll take cost out of our business, and we’ll continue to work productivity on the deck plates with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce.' While the money flowing to the submarine industrial base is helping HII’s supply chain, it will take time for the company to reap the benefits that come from those capital investments in new facilities, equipment and tooling, Kastner said. This morning, HII announced that its mission technologies division received a $3 billion contract to provide the Defense Department strategic-level support 'to enhance joint force capabilities and accelerate the application of solutions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hii-slashes-financial-outlook-for-2024-due-to-contract-delays-supply-chain-issues/	2024-10-31T09:30:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231108_DVIDS_submarine_construction_820194-e1699443296744.jpg
UK vows to ‘closely monitor all our supply chains’ after collapse of hypersonic supplier	UK firm Reaction Engines specialises in high speed propulsion and cooling technologies, but collapsed today after failing to secure a rescue deal (Reaction Engines) BELFAST — The UK Ministry of Defence said it will continue to 'closely monitor all our supply chains' as it reels from the collapse of Reaction Engines, the high speed propulsion manufacturer and industry lead on London's quest to develop a reusable Mach 5 and beyond aircraft under the Hypersonic Air Vehicle Experimental (HVX) program. The aerospace company, best known for its cutting-edge cooling technology and Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE), is also part of the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) Hypersonic Technologies &amp; Capability Development Framework (HTCDF) effort to build and deliver a first UK hypersonic missile, but was plunged into administration today after failing to secure a financial rescue deal, according to Sky News. The company reportedly conducted weeks of talks with potential buyers, including an unsuccessful attempt to win over £20 million from the United Arab Emirate's Strategic Development Fund (SDF), the investment agency of the UAE's Tawazun Council. Sky News noted that accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had officially taken on Reaction administration duties today. PwC did not immedately respond to a requst for comment from Breaking Defense, nor did the UAE's SDF. A spokesperson for Reaction declined to comment. Analysts told Breaking Defense it remains to be seen what impact Reaction's troubles will have on hypersonic programs, but there are few who could replace the company's share of the hypersonic work. The UK MoD only told Breaking Defense in a statement on Wednesday, prior to the official news, that the MoD has a 'long running relationship with Reaction Engines Ltd and closely monitor[s] all our supply chains to ensure the continued delivery of key capabilities, including research and development.' Reaction, Rolls-Royce, the Royal Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), the UK Government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and the UK’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) are jointly involved in HVX, which has been designed to 'rapidly develop critical high-Mach/hypersonic technologies, including novel air-breathing propulsion architectures, innovative thermal management systems and advanced vehicle concepts,' according to Rolls-Royce. SABRE and patented cooling technologies are critical parts of HVX. Progress on the effort includes launch of a full-scale experimental engine test campaign, partners carrying out design work on hypersonic vehicle concepts and the unveiling of Concept V — a single engine hypersonic concept vehicle. Regarding the separate hypersonic framework effort HTCDF, Reaction was picked by the UK in May, as one of 90 small and large organizations from industry and academia, eligible to bid for contracts in support of developing indigenous hypersonic missile capabilities. A total of eight hypersonic technology lots for the project cover: design and integration, modelling and testing, airframe and power generation, low Technical Readiness Level (TRL) concepts, a lethality package (including warhead and fuse), propulsion, on board computing, and seekers. London has settled on a three-step strategy of buy, collaborate and develop to build out hypersonic missile capabilities, which also focus on potentially acquiring a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV) as part of AUKUS Pillar II. Like all other major projects, the long term future of HVX and HTCDF remain on hold until the UK's Strategic Defence Review (SDR) reports in mid-2025, but Reaction's collapse could have a troubling impact on both high profile projects, analysts said. William Freer, research fellow at the Council on Geostrategy, a British think tank, told Breaking Defense on Wednesday following early reports of Reaction's then-potential downfall that 'going into Administration would certainly cause headaches for the HVX programme, but it is difficult to say exactly what the direct impact would be.' He noted the 'outcome is highly dependent on exactly who is brought in for administration and how they decide to carry out the process.' Christie Maddock, an associate professor at the Aerospace Centre of Excellence at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, questioned how UK industry could replace Reaction. 'The biggest impact will be that the UK loses its its leadership in this field [cooling technology], and I don't know that anybody at the moment has enough momentum or enough investment to be able to pick it up again,' she noted. The financial difficulties that led to Reaction's demise were not altogether new. Asked about company challenges on the Aviation Extended podcast last year, Mark Thomas, Reaction Engines CEO said, 'Historically, it's been money raising &#8230; having to continually, on an almost annual basis, raise money for the business to fund the projects and the demonstrations and the trials. That's becoming less of a concern, but now it's shifted more into the need to penetrate the markets, generate revenue, to pour that back into the business to be self sufficient.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/uk-vows-to-closely-monitor-all-our-supply-chains-after-collapse-of-hypersonic-supplier/	2024-10-31T08:40:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/F-_S4BBXcAAwEVu-e1730370198366.jpg
More soldiers, control vehicles may be required to maneuver Army’s early Robotic Combat Vehicles	A Robotic Combat Vehicle Light prototype during Soldier Experimentation at the National Training Center, NTC, Fort Irwin, Calif. from July to September 2023. (US Army/ Savannah Baldwin) WASHINGTON — Testing has found that additional US Army soldiers are likely needed to operate early Robotic Combat Vehicles than anticipated even just months ago, the service disclosed this week. Under the Army's envisioned 'human machine integrated formations,' the service wants a future where RCVs are out ahead of soldiers on the front lines, taking on dangerous missions without potential loss of life. However, the service is not expecting early versions of those robots to have high levels of autonomy, which means soldiers will need to stay close by teleoperating them for the foreseeable future. Based on testing earlier this year at Fort Irwin, Calif., service leaders believed that for every two RCVs, it would need one control vehicle containing five soldiers — one driver and two teams with two each remotely manning an RCV. But in late July, as part of the Army Futures Command’s RCV Pilot-24 exercise, soldiers with the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Division, again used the four RCV surrogates. The idea, the service explained in a Tuesday press release, was to have soldiers inside two trailing control vehicles operating a total of four RCVs on reconnaissance and security missions. The verdict? That wasn’t an adequate pairing that time around, and the platoon needed a third control vehicle to effectively operate the four robots, according to Brig. Gen. Chad Chalfont, the commandant of the Army Armor School at Fort Moore. As a result, the unit was 'restructured' and a third control vehicle was folded into the mix, the service explained. The service did not detail how many soldiers were now in each control vehicle, but if the math holds, that would be an additional five soldiers needed towards the front lines. While that July test event is moving the manned vehicle to robot ratio in the wrong direction, service officials previously told Breaking Defense that it is going to take time to develop and field RCVs. And part of that process may mean soldiers closer to the robots they control, as well as using them for limited missions while work continues evolving on a number of fronts. The service is testing out those RCV surrogates and control vehicle to examine how they may operate them in battle and tech limitations but still hasn’t selected which company will build the initial RCVs. That decision is expected to come in early 2025 when one company is picked to proceed with platform development. (McQ, Textron Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Oshkosh Defense are all under prototyping contracts today.) And it has broadly laid out plans to use an Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) as the future control vehicle. In recent months industry sources from all sectors have raised questions about how DEVCOM’s work and the GVAP project will ultimately converge, and the service is now hosting a Nov. 20 industry day to try and clear up confusion. There, it said, it will unveil a 'technology roadmap' to help each company 'make its best effort to align their technology against timing of future opportunities nested with the forecasted needs of the RCV program.' 'The industry day will clarify key points and provide updates regarding the RCV platform as it relates to tele-operation and growth to autonomous movement,' the Army wrote in an announcement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/more-soldiers-control-vehicles-may-be-required-to-maneuver-armys-early-remote-combat-vehicles/	2024-10-31T08:01:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/231213_army_robot_combat_8069610-scaled-e1702489865317.jpg
US Navy to extend service lives of 12 destroyers	The guided missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG-52) enters Naval Station Mayport, Fla. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Shane Cameron Ross/Released) WASHINGTON — The Navy announced today it will extend the service lives of 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, resulting in an anticipated 48 years of combined additional operational service from those vessels between 2028 to 2035, according to a statement from Secretary Carlos Del Toro. 'Extending these highly-capable, well-maintained destroyers will further bolster our numbers as new construction warships join the fleet,' Del Toro said in a statement. 'It also speaks to their enduring role in projecting power globally, and most recently in the Red Sea, their proven ability to defend themselves, as well as our allies, partners and friends from missile and drone attacks.' The ships included in the announcement are the oldest destroyers in the fleet ranging from the Barry (DDG-52), which will be extended for three years, to The Sullivans (DDG-68), also slated for a three-year extension. The Navy in March 2023 opted to extend the life of the class’s lead ship, the Arleigh Burke (DDG-51). The ships and their associated life extensions included in the announcement are: The statement did not include any information about the costs associated with the service life extensions, but did say the Navy had already proposed funding in its budget plans for fiscal 2026 and will update the long-range shipbuilding plan accordingly. 'Today’s budget constrained environment requires the Navy to make prioritized investments to keep more ready players on the field,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said in the same statement. 'The Navy is actively pulling the right levers to maintain and grow its battle force inventory to support the United States’s global interests in peace and to win decisively in conflict.' The choice to extend the service lives of a dozen destroyers is multifaceted one for the sea service. During the Trump administration, lawmakers repeatedly hounded top Navy brass to lay out a plan to reach an overall fleet of 355-manned warships. (The Navy’s current fleet size fluctuates between 285 and 290 ships depending on the time of the year and how it lines up with commissioning and retirement ceremonies.) The service responded with a plan that eventually reached the 355-ship figure in the 2040s and 2050s through a combination of building more destroyers than originally planned as well as extending the service lives of those currently in service. The thought process, Navy leadership said at the time, was that while the fleet’s composition would not be optimal, destroyers were the best choice of ship to have in excess. Since the Trump administration ended in 2021, Navy leadership have overall tamped down on their zealousness to achieve a fleet size of any particular number, but Franchetti has repeatedly called for 'more players on the field,' invoking the service’s bottom-line need for a larger fleet. On the flip side, service life extensions necessarily mean operating a vessel for longer than intended which can lead to costlier maintenance periods and longer delays depending on a ship’s materiel condition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-navy-to-extend-service-lives-of-12-destroyers/	2024-10-31T06:52:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/909174-e1730380760174.jpg
Hypori CEO: Air Force, Space Force to soon get access to non-classified mil networks on mobile	Spc. Acxel Budet Gonzales, Papa Company, 244th Quartermaster Battalion, takes a phone call while awaiting bus transport to his unit during Holiday Block Leave return processing Jan. 3 at the MacLaughlin Fitness Center. On Tuesday Hypori CEO Jared Shepard told Breaking Defense the Department of the Air Force will start gaining access to Hypori Halo on Nov. 15. A spokesperson from the DAF confirmed in an email that the transition to the mobile tech began in mid-October 'with the process being initiated in phases over several weeks.' 'With the Air Force deploying Hypori as part of the Workspace Anywhere program, we empower airmen and air guardsmen to interact securely with government CUI [controlled unclassified information] data from their own devices — whether at home, on the go, or even during their kids’ activities,' Shepard said. 'As global threats rise, it's crucial that our personnel have confidence in their mobile solutions to maintain mission readiness without compromising security,' he added. In August, Hypori was awarded a $4.1 million contract to provide 10,000 licenses of Hypori Halo to the DAF. Since then, more DAF service members have shown interest in registering for the program, Shepard said. The DAF’s adoption of the Halo software comes after it underwent a trial of Hypori’s Workspace Anywhere program, which ended in March. Before that, some Army service members adopted Halo in line with a new policy requiring secure virtual desktop access for soldiers, Guardsmen and Reservists, which included the option to use Halo on their mobile devices. The Army currently has 50,000 Hypori licenses, Shepard said. The Air Force will be looking for a smoother rollout than the Army's, in which some Reserve and Guardsmen said they felt left behind, as Breaking Defense previously reported. At the time, the Army expressed confidence that the virtual platforms, including Hypori, worked for the majority of users. Additionally, Shepherd said that the software is designed around zero-trust access, meaning the software assumes that no user trying to access the platform should have free rein of the network, and users have to go through particular verification processes. This is all done on a Level 5 cloud environment — the most secure environment for controlled unclassified information. As DAF users start to migrate onto the Halo platform, Halo is transitioning from a platform-as-a-service model with Microsoft’s Azure cloud to a software-as-a-service model with Amazon Web Service’s cloud. 'From a performance standpoint, that means that each individual is actually getting dedicated processing power and compute power in their virtual device. So it's going to significantly improve performance. It reduces late latency and lag and touch latency,' Shepard said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hypori-ceo-air-force-space-force-to-soon-get-access-to-non-classified-mil-networks-on-mobile/	2024-10-31T05:33:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/231019_soldier_iphone_crowd_7580394-scaled-e1697732209145.jpg
Air Force’s new cloud-based cyber defense system to protect ‘soft unbelly’ of cyber ops networks	U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Hensley, 16th Air Force deputy commander, is greeted by Col. Craig Bailey, 9th Maintenance Group commander, on Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 24, 2023.(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Alexis Pentzer) DoDIIS 2024 — When it comes online, the Air Force expects a new, more robust cloud-based system for cyber operations to allow airmen to better understand their network ecosystem and spot weak spots before adversaries do, Gen. Thomas Hensley, commander of the 16th Air Force said Tuesday. The new system, dubbed the Integrated Defensive Cyberspace System (IDCS) is intended to replace the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/Hunter (CVA/H) and the Operations Platform Fly Away Kits (IOP-FAK), and offer data sharing through the cloud so airmen from different bases can share sensitive information regarding cyber threats. Hensley’s goal: have two IDCS kits installed at each Air Force base. 'So what we are trying to do as an Air Force is make sure that our networks are not the soft underbelly to our war fighting capability,' Hensley said at the Defense Intelligence Information Systems conference Tuesday. He later told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the conference that the new IDCS are 'bigger and more expensive' compared to their predecessors, and they will help with information gathering and defensive cyber operations. The CVA/H and IOP-FAK are technically referred to as 'weapons systems,' but practically they’re defensive structures that identify, track and abate potential cyber threats with software- and hardware-based sensor platforms. With these older systems, airmen were still able to share data, but not on a cloud environment. Now with the IDCS, the data collected from within the system will be transported from the kits and through a cloud platform into the service’s wide-ranged data platform for additional analysis. Hensley explained that when implementing the IDCS, airmen will first have to perform a 'terrain analysis,' which is a cybersecurity evaluation of the network, so they can decide where to embed the system’s sensors that will gather information on potential cyber threats. 'Buying sensors to cover everything in our ecosystem is cost prohibitive. So where is the key terrain that we need to put the sensors to protect the data to go where it needs to go?' Hensley asked. 'So that's precision sensor deployment, but you got to understand the terrain to begin with.' The timeline on replacing the older systems with IDCS is not clear, as it is dependent on when the Air Force gets the 'sustained funding' to make the transition, Hensley said. However, the initiative appears to be behind schedule. When solicitation for this program first came out, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center said it expected IDCS to be fully underway by mid-to-late fiscal year 2024.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/air-forces-new-cloud-based-cyber-defense-system-to-protect-soft-unbelly-of-cyber-ops-networks/	2024-10-30T12:49:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/7995666-scaled-e1726608345988.jpg
NRO taps 3 startups for innovative launch experiments	An artist's rendering of Starfish Space's Otter satellite servicing vehicle. (Courtesy Starfish Space) WASHINGTON — Ther National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) today announced it has awarded study contracts on innovative launch capabilities to three US-based startups: Cognitive Space, Impulse Space and Starfish Space. The contracts come under the spy satellite agency's Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) for Agile Launch Innovation and Strategic Technology Advancement (BALISTA) program, which is exploring 'in space mobility and maneuver, on-orbit logistics and sustainability, mission acceleration, artificial intelligence for ground operations, and spacecraft propellant particle count,' according to the NRO's press release. The NRO said the contracts, managed by NRO's Office of Space Launch (OSL), are 'smaller in scope' — though NRO has provided no specific value, as usual for the agency as its budget is classified — and intended to assess the potential for emerging space launch providers to provide new types of capabilities. 'This BAA helps NRO advance emerging technologies across launch, on-orbit support, and command &amp; control,' said OSL Director Col. Eric J. Zarybnisky. In it's initial solicitation back in March, NRO explained that it was looking for companies that could provide a number of novel space launch services, including docking, moving between orbits, and AI to manage satellite constellations. Houston-based Cognitive Space specializes in AI for autonomous management of space systems and satellite constellations. Impulse Space, headquartered in Redondo Beach, Calif., provides in-space transportation services from low Earth orbit to other orbits. The company on Oct. 3 announced that it had won a $34.5 million Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III contract from the Space Force's Space Safari in partnership with the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit office to support the next two experiments in the services next two Tactically Responsive Space program, called VICTUS SURGO and VICTUS SALO. Both missions will use the firm's Mira vehicle, and are aimed at demonstrating 'how prepositioned capabilities can improve responsiveness to on-orbit situations, enabling the dynamic operations aspect of space domain awareness,' the company said. Based in Tukwila, Wash., Starfish Space also has previously won a Space Force contract. On May 20, the service announced it had awarded the company a $37 million Strategic Funding Increase (STRATFI) contract to build, launch, and operate one of its Otter vehicles for a 'first-of-its-kind docking mission' designed to provide two years of 'augmented maneuver for National Security Space assets.' Essentially, the Space Force target satellites would use the Otter as an attached engine.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/nro-taps-3-startups-for-innovative-launch-experiments/	2024-10-30T12:33:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Starfish_Space_Otter_GEO_Earth-e1730316131187.png
South Korea eyes pathway for AUKUS Pillar II with new defense tech agreement	Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun stand for the playing of the US and South Korean national anthems prior to a US-Republic of Korea Security Consultative Meeting at the Pentagon on Oct. 30, 2024. (DoD photo/US Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) WASHINGTON — The defense ministers for the US and South Korea today announced a new joint defense science and technology executive committee, one that expressly will consider options for Seoul's participation in AUKUS Pillar II. 'Based on the defense vision of the alliance, we plan to establish a vice-minister level defense science and technology executive committee within this year to explore the application of cutting-edge science and technology in the defense sector, as well as cooperation on AUKUS Pillar II,' Kim Yong Hyun, the minister from South Korea, said during comments at the Pentagon. Kim’s announcement came on the heels of the US-Republic of Korea security consultative meeting today that included US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Tomorrow, the duo will join Secretary of State Antony Blinken and ROK Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul for a 2+2 meeting. While North Korea’s deployment of upwards of 10,000 troops to Russia is a hot-button topic for the two nations this week, the Pentagon announced beforehand that the S&amp;T expansion will remain a focal area, particularly in the areas of autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and quantum technologies. That fits in nicely with the six technology areas identified as priorities for Pillar II: undersea, quantum, artificial intelligence and autonomy, cyber, hypersonic work, and electronic warfare. While US officials said in September that they are open to other areas of opportunities, the goal is to keep the focus on those areas as much as possible. Ever since the creation of AUKUS, there has been a question of whether other nations would be allowed to join the tripartite agreement. Officials have made a delineation: Pillar I, which is focused on nuclear submarine technology and tighter military alliances between the US, UK and Australia, is closed. But Pillar II would offer opportunities for other countries to get involved. That has led to some confusion about whether outside countries can 'join' Pillar II. Inside the Pentagon, at least, the issue is viewed less as one of other nations 'joining' and more about allowing outside parties to work on technological efforts the three core AUKUS nations are developing. Speaking to Breaking Defense in August, Richard Marles, Australia’s defense minister, said that while he expects Pillar II to 'grow,' the focus has to be on making sure 'we get Pillar II into a place where there is something to, kind of, offer. 'I think what’s really important is that we get this better down amongst the three of us first, so that we really know what the architecture of our collaboration looks like, and what the specific projects are,' he said. The first country to be formally tied to Pillar II was Japan, in an April announcement that the AUKUS nations are 'considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.' (As an example of the confusion about how Pillar II works, that statement was followed almost immediately by a statement by Australia’s prime minister that 'What is not proposed is to expand the membership of AUKUS.') Officials in New Zealand have had preliminary talks with Australian counterparts about participation in Pillar II, New Zealand’s defense minister told Breaking Defense earlier this year. And there have been calls for Canada to take part as well. (Given New Zealand and Canada are the two non-AUKUS members of the 5 Eyes intelligence sharing network, they both have close connections to the AUKUS partners.)	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/south-korea-eyes-pathway-for-aukus-pillar-ii-with-new-defense-tech-agreement/	2024-10-30T12:21:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/kim-austin-scaled-e1730315341861.jpg
Lockheed completes acquisition of smallsat maker Terran Orbital	SDA Tranche 0 Transport Layer (Image: Terran Orbital Corporation) WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin has completed its acquisition of small satellite maker Terran Orbital, the company announced today. The smallsat producer — now known as Terran Orbital, a Lockheed Martin Company — will report to Lockheed’s space unit and serve as a merchant supplier to other major space primes, Lockheed said. The $450 million deal, which was announced in August, resolves Terran Orbital’s mounting debt problems by uniting it with its biggest customer, which has previously bought the startup’s products for the Space Development Agency’s (SDA) transport and tracking layer of small satellites. The acquisition also gives Lockheed the opportunity to expand from its legacy position making large satellites for the defense sector into the small satellite business, where it may be able to pick up commercial sales. 'The addition of Terran Orbital's spirit of entrepreneurship to the scale of Lockheed Martin means there is a great deal of opportunity to keep pushing the boundaries of technology and space solutions together,' Robert Lightfoot, president of Lockheed Martin Space, said in a statement. 'We welcome their ingenuity and dedication to ensuring mission success and we've always valued those aspects of our working relationship.' Lockheed has had a longstanding relationship with Terran Orbital, having invested in the company multiple times since 2017 through its venture capital arm. Terran Orbital is the first company that Lockheed has acquired from its ventures portfolio. In August, Terran’s Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems subsidiary announced a $254 million contract to build 10 satellites for SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) Gamma contract. The company also brings its expertise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for remote sensing, with its PredaSAR subsidiary. In 2023, Terran Orbital received $500 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the organization’s Digital Radar Image Formation Technology (DRIFT) program. Under that effort, the company is expected to demonstrate at least two SAR satellites, which will fly in formation to better see a target area and allow fusion of imagery via advanced processing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-completes-acquisition-of-smallsat-maker-terran-orbital/	2024-10-30T11:52:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/SDA-Tranche-0-Tansport-Layer-Image-Terran-Orbital-Corporation-e1710347311201.jpeg
UK pledges additional $3.8 billion on defense spending, stops short of 2.5 percent GDP timeline	F-35B fighter jets from the UK Carrier Strike Group launch from the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier to undertake sorties under NATO command in the Atlantic (UK MoD) BELFAST — The United Kingom announced today it intends to increase its defense spending by £2.9 billion ($3.8 billion) next year, according to a newly released budget. Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, shared the uplift with lawmakers in a parliamentary speech, though she said that a Labour Party election manifesto commitment of reaching 2.5 percent GDP on defense spending will be met at a 'future fiscal event.' 'I am announcing a total increase to the Ministry of Defence’s budget of £2.9 billion next year, ensuring that the UK comfortably exceeds our NATO commitments and providing guaranteed military support to Ukraine of £3 billion per year for as long as it takes,' added Reeves. Across the 2023 to 2024 fiscal year, London spent £54 billion on defense, according to government figures, tracking at around 2.33 percent GDP and to date has pledged £12.8 billion to Kyiv for military, economic and humanitarian aid. Earlier this month, the UK also announced a new £2.3 billion loan for Ukraine, funded by frozen Russian assets. A supporting Autumn Budget 2024 document [PDF] says that the new funding, approved by Reeves, will allow UK armed forces to 'modernise' and sustain Britain's 'leading role in NATO, including through the nuclear deterrent, combat and surveillance aircraft, surface and submarine fleets, forward land forces, Special Forces and cyber and space capabilities.' Experts have long questioned the ability of the UK to meet its NATO commitments, especially with respect to the British Army delivering a Strategic Reserve Corps, made up of two divisions and additional corps echelon troops. 'The current British Army actually fields half of one heavy brigade’s worth of equipment, split between two, and one regiment of artillery,' Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at RUSI, wrote in a July analysis. The decline in size and capability of the force in its current state falls far short of a 2015 effort to deliver a 'warfighting division of two heavy and between one and two medium combat brigades, an artillery brigade, an engineering brigade, an air defence group, a logistic brigade and an ISR brigade,' he noted. Patrick Sanders, former head of the British Army, also admitted that UK aid to Ukraine in the form of warfighting platforms, amounting to 14 Challenger 2 main battle attacks and 30 AS90 155mm self-propelled guns, would 'leave us temporarily weaker as an army.' As for increasing spending further, before losing office, the Conservative government had committed to hitting the 2.5 percent GDP target by the end of the decade, which would have resulted in a 2030 annual defense budget of £87 billion, but Labour has still to put forward an exact timeframe for making good on the same GDP pledge. The new government has launched the Strategic Defence Review (SDR), set to report in mid-2025, 'in recognition of the urgency of the threats' it faces and designed to assess national defense priorities and policy. Chief among the threats sits Russia, conflicts and increasing instability in the Middle East and an assertive China in the Indo-Pacific. Though equipment planning remains in limbo until the SDR is published, financial challenges persist, largely owing to a £43 billion, 10-year spending plan deficit, according to figures [PDF] from the National Audit Office, a government watchdog.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/uk-pledges-additional-3-8-billion-on-defense-spending-stops-short-of-2-5-percent-gdp-timeline/	2024-10-30T10:44:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/FLEET-20231105-XN0184-136.jpg.iCexsZ_kMWATAA.lYYOVfIex0-e1719261083813.jpg
First German Leopard 2 tank gets Israeli Trophy Active Protection System	On Oct. 29, 2024 the Israeli and German governments presented the first Leopard 2 tank outfitted with the Trophy Active Protection System. (Israeli Ministry of Defense) JERUSALEM — The Israeli and German ministries of defense held a ceremony in Germany today to inaugurate the first Leopard 2 tank to be upgraded with the Trophy Active Protection System. The system was developed by Israel's Rafael and has been active on Israeli tanks for more than a decade. The installation is the culmination of a government-to-government agreement signed in 2020. Israel’s Ministry of Defense noted that its Directorate of Defense Research and Development had spearheaded this initiative to 'equip Germany’s Leopard 2 tank fleet with Israel’s premier active protection system.' Carsten Stawitzki, national armaments director in the German Ministry of Defense, was present at the ceremony along with the head of the Israeli Ministry’s Survivability Systems Branch, who was unidentified and whose face blurred in photos due to security reasons. Germany conducted live fire tests with Trophy in 2021. The tests took place with Rafael and Germany’s KMW, which developed and manufactures the Leopard. At the time Israel’s Ministry of Defense underlined how the system was combat proven and integrated on the IDF’s Merkava tanks. 'The advancement achieved by our industries in cooperation with our German friends and partners will further strengthen the capabilities of both our defense establishments. We will continue to work at the forefront of tech capabilities, prepare for every operational scenario, and deepen our relations with partners around the world,' Israel’s then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz said then. Rafael has also established a joint venture in Germany called EuroTrophy, modelled on its success supplying European countries with the Spike family of missiles as part of the EuroSpike enterprise. The Spike family includes a number of precision guided and anti-tank missiles made by Rafael. The EuroTrophy venture includes General Dynamics European Land Systems, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rafael. The Trophy system has also been integrated on the IDF’s Namer armored personnel carriers, as well as on US Abrams tanks and has been integrated on Challenger 3 tanks. Trophy will also be used on Leopard 2 tanks in Norway. Rafael also announced updates to Trophy at AUSA in early October, in part inspired by Israel's experience fighting in Gaza and Lebanon. The system can now defend against top attack threats. The Leopard 2 deal is part of a number of high profile deals for Israeli defense industries in Europe. In 2023 Finland signed a deal to acquire David’s Sling, the medium-range air defense system made by Rafael. Israel also finalized a deal to sell Israel Aerospace Industries Arrow 3 to Germany in 2023. 'This [Leopard/Trophy] milestone adds to a series of recent high-value defense agreements, including Germany’s purchase of Israel’s Arrow missile defense system, reflecting a shared commitment to advancing defense capabilities,' Israel’s Ministry of Defense noted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/first-german-leopard-2-tank-gets-israeli-trophy-active-protection-system/	2024-10-30T10:22:07-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_trophy_leopard_israeli_MOD-e1730234696944.png
GPS resiliency is falling short, but there is a solution	The GPS constellation that provides positioning, navigation and timing signals to the US military and civilians around the world, is made up of 31 active satellites. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images) The third generation of GPS satellites continues to deploy, and US Space Force has selected companies to introduce new Low Earth Orbit augmentation (LEAP) under the Resilient GPS program – yet these upgrades, while necessary, are not sufficient to adequately address growing risk from attacks to GPS. Ground-Based Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) must be a part of efforts to upgrade and back up GPS if we are to meet rapidly evolving threats. Among the obstacles keeping us from addressing growing adversary counter-space capabilities is the failure to imagine what a day without space might look like. The seams between space, air, ground, electronic warfare and cyber are preventing full appreciation of cross-boundary threats to PNT. We should be organizing more holistically around a diverse set of PNT solutions, including adding a ground-based element to provide PNT signals receivable by our smartphones and other critical receivers. For decades, the civil-military success of the GPS program has supported unprecedented automation stemming from the widespread availability of accurate PNT. The nation’s critical infrastructure: telecommunications networks, the energy grid, and the financial sector all rely on GPS signals to operate. Legacy routines that used to operate independently from space-based signals have long since been retired. Recently, jamming, spoofing, cyber, and physical attacks have brought into question whether we have become overly dependent on space-based PNT signals. An attack (kinetic or electronic warfare) or mishap in the crowded low earth orbit could have cascading impacts and degrade or even eliminate the weak signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites in medium earth orbits. Without access to space, the day to day technologies we take for granted — navigation, logistics, travel, alarms, AI sensors, robotic actuators, ATM machines, agriculture — stop working. 911 calls spike in volume, quickly overwhelming systems designed around automated location, and over time, telecommunications networks fail as they lose synchronization. The public, having built much of their lives around ever-available communications and location information, would further place a surge of demands on critical infrastructure that has lost control of essential functions. In short, if GPS goes down, critical infrastructure fails and our nation plunges into chaos. This scenario is not science fiction. Heightened tensions around the world include adversaries that have demonstrated attacks on space systems. These threat actors know that Space provides an asymmetric advantage to the United States and our allies. In their perverse calculus, an attack on space assets, intended to reset a losing hand, would be an escalation preferred over a nuclear exchange. What was a high bar for an attack on space systems is being lowered daily as Ukraine and the Middle East showcase adversary exploitation of GPS and other space-based PNT signals. RELATED: GPS shows some Lebanese citizens in Jordan, likely result of combat-related ‘spoofing’: Experts We need to add resiliency to our current space-based PNT, creating services to complement and back up GPS. Admiral Thad Allen, USCG (ret.), the current Chair of the Space-based PNT Advisory Board, said that 'America’s continued over-reliance on GPS for PNT makes critical infrastructure and applications vulnerable to a variety of well documented accidental, natural, and malicious threats.' The Board reported this summer that China and other nations are already ahead of the United States in building out resiliency to GPS and PNT. They concluded that the United States has 'fallen behind,' presenting a 'troubling shortfall in GPS’s greater vulnerability to jamming and spoofing.' China continues to build more capable and resilient PNT systems with an integrated architecture. The Chinese approach to PNT enhances their efforts to gain global technology market share for critical infrastructure industries. We need a whole-of-government approach, working together with the private sector to counter Chinese PNT gains. PNT services underpin the smooth functioning of our economy, and we need a ground-based component to compete. The United States should heed the board’s warning. A ground complement to GPS would address both today’s PNT availability issues and provide needed backup. This would be a deterrent to any adversary considering an attack on GPS. When space-based GPS is threatened, a ground-based system, receivable by smartphones and other widely available devices, would greatly reduce adversary motivation for counter-space escalation. There is widespread agreement on the need for ground based PNT as space-based alternatives share common GPS vulnerabilities but there is also much debate on the approach. Some PNT professionals advocate bringing back an enhanced Long Range Navigation (eLORAN) capability that would upgrade ground-based transmitters using Low Frequency signals from the decommissioned LORAN system, creating excellent propagation characteristics but needing either larger receiver antennas or new antenna technology breakthroughs to be receivable by smartphones. Others point to FM Radio and TV broadcast signals that can support distribution of accurate timing reference after disasters with new protocols. Ultimately, however, we will need to provide signals that are receivable in the devices we rely upon every day. Shifting our National policy from Resilient GPS to Resilient PNT, would ensure that we build an architecture and systems that degrade gracefully under the full spectrum of conflict using multiple ground-based approaches. The FCC is currently reviewing the record on a proposal that would enable a ground-based complement and backup to GPS. The act of establishing a ground-based PNT service category, as the proposed FCC order would do, would let the market introduce and sustain competitive solutions without the tail of a new federal program. The proposal is a strong step towards addressing our national security PNT risk. In the meantime, DoD and other agencies with GPS oversight, should replace governance of GPS with resilient PNT, motivating a mix of diverse PNT solutions capable of supporting society’s needs anticipating a day without space. Now is the time to act. Establish a complement and backup so that if GPS is denied, we have ground based PNT signals at the ready. Rear Admiral USN (ret.)

Lockheed Martin successfully demos Navy combat system on hardware destined for ICS	Aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) transits the Atlantic Ocean. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class K. H. Anderson/Released) WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin, in conjunction with roughly a dozen industry partners and the US Navy, successfully demonstrated it could run a virtualized version of a key combat system on hardware anticipated for use in the service’s forthcoming Integrated Combat System, according to a company executive. The demo, which took place in late September at the Navy’s Maryland-based software factory known as The Forge, focused on running the Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS), the multi-functional combat system used by aircraft carriers and certain Navy amphibious ships that lack the Aegis Combat System, Shireen Melvin, integrated combat management systems director at Lockheed Martin, told Breaking Defense. RELATED: App Store For Warships: Inside The Navy’s Project To Revamp How The Fleet Gets Software It was a necessary show of agility since the stated purpose of the Navy’s Integrated Combat System is to outfit its ships with hardware and software capable of running independently from one another. Among other benefits, the service hopes this will lead to the sorts of rapid, over-the-air software updates for its warships similar to those routinely done by America's technology behemoths. Operating a key piece of software for aircraft carriers and amphibs, the SSDS, on the latest developmental hardware being designed for ICS is another major step towards that goal of software and hardware independence. 'The team was able to do that successfully and virtualize a recent software build of SSDS, and then have it run on the new hardware that’s been selected for the ICS,' Melvin said. 'We’re going to keep adding to these demonstrations that we’re doing &#8230; as we continue to develop the ICS and as we move along and showing the progression of it.' Breaking Defense exclusively reported this February an in-depth view of the other key Navy facility developing the ICS, which the service has dubbed 'The Foundry.' Whereas 'The Forge' is focused specifically on software development, the otherwise incognito Navy building in Dahlgren, Va., has been tasked with producing the hardware destined for the ICS. Notably, most of that hardware is coming directly from products already being mass produced by industry, Navy officials told Breaking Defense at the time. RELATED: Inside The Foundry, The Navy’s Program To Modernize Hardware Across The Surface Fleet 'The technology that we’re taking is really technology that’s coming from the industry side, that has been out there and we’re now applying it to warfighting,' said Capt. Brian Phillips, an officer overseeing the Foundry. 'The world has become much more dynamic,' he continued. 'It changes much more quickly. We’ve really had to put a lot of thought into how do we incentivize industry … and empower them to sort of unleash their power to give us the technology we need, rather than dictating everything to them?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-martin-successfully-demos-navy-combat-system-on-hardware-destined-for-ics/	2024-10-30T08:32:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/2065424-scaled-e1706551345299.jpg
‘New Indo-Pacific missile age’ drives Australia to domestic GMLRS, munition production deals	Part of the forging process at the Maryborough munitions plant, a joint venture between Germany's Rheinmetall and a privately owned Australian company, NIOA. (Colin Clark/Breaking Defense) 'Why do we need more missiles? Strategic competition between the United States and China is a primary feature of Australia's security environment,' Pat Conroy told the National Press Club here. The most immediate commitment to increasing missile capabilities here came when Conroy said Australia would spend $316 million AUD ($207 million USD) to create a local factory to build Lockheed's Martin's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), starting in 2029. It will be able to produce 4,000 missiles a year, roughly one quarter of current global production, he added. 'Producing GMLRS missiles in Australia is the stepping stone towards local production of more advanced, longer-range strike weapons in the future — local production that is essential to our sovereignty and our security,' Conroy said. Breaking Defense contacted Lockheed Martin and the ministry for more details about the plant. Lockheed declined to comment. At press time, defense had not responded. Australia recently committed to jointly manufacture Naval and Joint Strike Missiles with Norway's Kongsberg Defense in the city of Newcastle on Australia's eastern coast, the only site outside of Norway. The JSM can be carried internally by the F-35, preserving its stealth profile. Reinforcing that made-in-Australia penchant, Conroy announced that BAE Systems Australia received a $160 million contract to triple production of the Passive Radio Frequency Sensor (PRS) used in the JSM. However, those sensors, at least in the short term, will primarily be put into missiles procured by the US Air Force, Japan and other countries, BAE Systems said in a statement. 'This is a significant achievement for our manufacturing teams at Edinburgh Parks and an innovation success story that has required more than a decade of commitment from our employees and our partner Kongsberg,' Andrew Gresham, managing director of defense delivery at BAE Systems Australia, said in a statement. 'The Passive Radio Frequency Sensor is highly innovative technology designed, developed, and built in Australia.' Speaking to Breaking Defense last week, Conroy pledged that a new contract for manufacturing 155mm shells would be announced 'shortly.' That turned out to be true, with Thales Australia winning a hotly contested contract to manufacture the shells, part of the Lucky Country's effort to better able to handle supply chain disruptions and build stockpiles of crucial weapons. That contract includes building a new forge to make the shells, notable because Australian-owned NIOA, which had been competing with Thales for the contract, already has a custom-built forge in operation to produce 155mm shells. However, those shells are under contract to be exported to Germany, whose company Rhenimetall has a majority interest in the shell-making joint venture. Australia currently imports its finished 155s from a South African subsidiary of Rhenmetall. The artillery shells are the most in-demand military product in the world and mark an important commitment by the Labor government to ensure the Lucky Country's supply chains are more organic and less subject to the vagaries of global manufacturing and shipping. As usual, the opposition's defense expert, Andrew Hastie, cast scorn on today's announcements, saying the government had provided very few details about either GMLRS or 155s. 'Part-time Defence Industry Minister, Pat Conroy, used his National Press Club speech to announce Labor’s preferred tenderer to build a new forging capability for 155mm artillery ammunition – excluding any details around the costs associated. We are left scratching our heads once again,' Hastie said in a statement. 'Meanwhile, Labor’s announcement to establish a new $316 million Australian Weapons Manufacturing Complex comes with no plan or details for implementation. We must now wait for the Albanese Government to identify a site sometime next year for the facility which won’t be operational until 2029. But the clock is ticking and we have no time to waste.' Outside of the munitions announcement, Conroy was asked about a Chinese ICBM test from September, which flew more than 11,000km and landed in the Pacific Ocean off of Australia's north-east. It was the first such test by China in more than 40 years. Australia 'expressed significant concern about that ballistic missile test, especially its entry into the South Pacific given the Treaty of Rarotonga that says the Pacific should be a nuclear weapons free zone,' Conroy told reporters during Q and A.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-indo-pacific-missile-age-drives-australia-to-domestic-gmlrs-munition-production-deals/	2024-10-30T07:15:23-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_3175-scaled-e1727963129906.jpeg
Secretary Wormuth’s advice to next administration: ‘Stay on the path’ on Army programs	Secretary of the Army, Hon. Christine Wormuth, visits Japan, August 1, 2024. Secretary Wormuth had bilateral meetings with Japanese defense leaders and visited soldiers at the 5th Composite Watercraft Company at Yokohama North Dock. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. David Resnick) Wormuth, whose name has been floated in news reports as the potential next Secretary of Defense should Democratic candidate Kamala Harris win in November, said she wouldn't speculate on what the future has in store for her. 'I am going to run through the tape as Secretary of the Army, wherever that tape ends,' she said. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: Looking at the broader picture, what are your key takeaways after nearly four years on the job? Concerns? The road ahead? WORMUTH: There's a benefit to having the duration of leadership for multiple years, because it provides consistent direction for where we're trying to take the Army. We have had clear objectives, and we've been able to follow them through. We've really moved the needle on a lot of our acquisition programs … [with] a lot of that progress because we're using new authorities. We have consistent resourcing, as much as we can, given [continuing resolutions] and things like that. But we haven't changed direction. We haven't zigged and zagged. So, I think, there's a lot of benefit to that consistency over time. Looking ahead, the Army still has a lot of work to do. … We need to have a mindset that reflects a greater sense of urgency and a somewhat higher willingness to take prudent risks, because the security environment is really challenging and technology is changing rapidly. As you have worked through the upcoming five-year budget, will you talk about some of the priorities you're looking at? Frankly, we are going to need to remain consistent across a lot of our big portfolios — long-range fires, future vertical lift, ground combat vehicle — [and] all the things we've been working on. It would be my hope and advice to the next administration, whatever party that may be, that they kind of stay on the path that the Army is on because I think we're on the right path. I've talked publicly about the fact that the next budget that [Chief of Staff Gen. Randy] George and I have been working to build a greater investment still in UAS [unmanned aerial systems], counter-UAS and electronic warfare (EW). The Army has been the service that's most invested in counter UAS to date, but we're going to increase that some more. But frankly, I think, a lot of what we need to do is just keep on, keeping on and see things through. Get the [Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft] to first flight, have a successful hypersonic weapon test, things like that. Part of that push has been this flexible spending pots of money for groups of systems. What are you hearing from Congress? And do you think that this will actually, you'll be able to get this over the line? I’m cautiously optimistic. &#8230; I was a little skeptical, just because of my experience with appropriators and with the appropriation staffers, they don't like what they see as slush funds. We're really trying to work with them to talk about what approach would work for them. I think the fact that we're targeting it narrowly to UAS, counter-UAS and EW, rather than kind of trying to have it encompass all of our different kinds of programs may be helpful. We're in an active conversation with on the appropriation side, in particular about what kind of mechanisms do they need to feel comfortable? What kind of transparency mechanisms would they need to feel comfortable enough to give us the ability to bin things into larger pots. …The proof will be in the pudding and we'll see what comes out in the ‘25 appropriations bill when it passes but I'm a little more optimistic than I was nine months ago. You have mentioned concerns about the negative impact a flat budget will have on Army programs and the hard choices the service might need to make. When will the service need to start making those tough decisions? We have to see what's going to happen in a couple areas. The quality-of-life panel [from] the House Armed Services Committee was proposing a 15 percent pay increase. If that passed in that form, that will be a very, very big bill that will absolutely crowd out other things that are important for our soldiers, to their readiness, to be combat effective, to give them the equipment they need. So, that's a variable…. But certainly, a 15 percent pay increase for junior enlisted soldiers is a big bill that would put further pressure on our modernization programs. What should I be asking you about or topics the media isn’t covering? The United States Army needs to look hard in the next couple of years at kind of what I call the Army lifestyle, the burden of our frequent PCS [permanent change of station] moves. A lot of our younger officers are choosing to get out of the Army because they feel like they don't have enough stability and predictability. Their spouses want to work and have a lot of challenges doing that when they're having to move every two years. And so, I think, that's something we really need to take a very hard look at &#8230; are we going to be able to attract the best people? Are we going to be able to retain the best people? 'Embrace the suck' is sort of part of the Army philosophy, but there are limits to that, there are limits to individuals' selfless service. We've had a model that's static for a very, very long time. It's not going to be easy to change that, but it's really important.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/secretary-wormuths-advice-to-next-administration-stay-on-the-path-on-army-programs/	2024-10-30T06:20:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_wormuth_helicopter_8683810-scaled-e1730223933875.jpg
E-2D Hawkeye: Flexible airborne command and control for sea, land and joint operations	The E-2D supports a wide variety of missions: defensive and offensive counter-air, integrated air and missile defense, electronic warfare, air traffic control, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, border security, and counter-drug operations. (Northrop Grumman photo). Initially designed for airborne early warning (AEW) and defense of carrier battle groups, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye has evolved into a versatile platform that provides airborne command and control (C2) for multiple nations. The U.S. Navy has invested more than $1 billion in a technology roadmap to modernize and sustain this aircraft, positioning it as a critical node for joint command and control. Breaking Defense discussed the platform’s capabilities with Janice Zilch, Northrop Grumman vice president and Integrated Product Team (IPT) lead for Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2). Breaking Defense: How has the E-2D evolved to include airborne command and control alongside its traditional AEW role? Janice Zilch: The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye represents the latest in a legacy of AEW aircraft that stretch back over 60 years. While its original focus was defending carrier battle groups and monitoring long-range threats over water, it has now evolved into a cutting-edge platform capable of identifying and neutralizing a diverse range of threats in various environments. It’s similar to the evolution of mobile phones. When those were originally designed, it was to make a voice call. Think about how much has expanded in terms of functionality available. The same applies to the E-2D. Our advancements in bandwidth, processing power, and organic sensors – a radar, ESM (electronic support measures), IFF (identification, friend or foe), AIS (automatic identification system) – as well as our comms suites, allow the E-2D to offer unmatched detection and connectivity. This ensures seamless data sharing across U.S. and allied forces, enhancing joint operations across air, land and sea domains. Today, the E-2D supports a wide variety of missions: defensive and offensive counter-air, integrated air and missile defense, electronic warfare, air traffic control, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, border security, and counter-drug operations. This platform has become an indispensable element of JADC2, and the Navy’s continuous investment in its modernization ensures it remains a critical operational asset. For nations needing to protect their borders, the E-2D’s capabilities and performance are attained through its ability to detect smaller targets early and often before other AEW platforms, coupled with mission processing power that give it unsurpassed surveillance volume.

For nations needing to protect their borders, the E-2D’s capabilities and performance are attained through its ability to detect smaller targets early and often before other AEW platforms, coupled with mission processing power that give it unsurpassed surveillance volume. The robust communications suite helps create an integrated common operating picture across allied forces and provides real-time data contributing to greater situational awareness. One of the E-2D's key advantages is its operational flexibility. Thanks to its carrier design, it requires shorter runways and has a smaller infrastructure footprint when compared to larger AEW aircraft, making it ideal for rapid deployment. Additionally, the platform offers day one readiness with interoperability capabilities that provide enhanced performance to numerous allied assets including ground-based air and missile defense systems, such as the U.S. Army’s and Poland’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS). The combination of these two assets alone provides an increase in decision space and clearer situational awareness to optimize threat deterrence. E-2D also enhances and integrates seamlessly with fighters such as F-16s, F-35s, and unmanned systems such as NATO AGS, in addition to other allied systems. Moreover, Northrop Grumman’s 40 years of experience in supporting international partners operating E-2 platforms ensures we are well-equipped to train, sustain and modernize these systems globally. Our work with France, for instance, highlights the potential for operational synergies across Europe. As France transitions from E-2C to E-2D, we expect to see efficiencies in training, material procurement, and sustainment that could reduce maintenance lead times for European operators. Describe the E-2D's multi-functional role in providing AEW and C2? There is a wide spectrum of operations and use cases for a platform as versatile as the E-2D and its crew members. The E-2D can support civilian missions, such as emergency and disaster relief. We can clear the path for time-sensitive emergency operations, direct military aircraft for humanitarian aid, and we can sequence aircraft for safe takeoff and landing in the absence of air traffic control. In addition, as an airborne air traffic controller, E-2D increases national border security and helps mitigate occurrences of escalating incidents. For example, in the on-going NATO air policing efforts in the Baltic region, E-2D could play a critical role in enhancing the allied posture and effectiveness of these efforts. We can also provide data reports on drug interdiction, surveillance and pattern of life tracking, as well as search and rescue, in addition to enhancing air policing by providing maritime security through the collection of intelligence on ships that aren't emitting AIS. The bottom line is that E-2D offers mission versatility and operational mobility while it plays a pivotal role as a central node across mission areas. That’s enabled by its ability to communicate with numerous assets, providing real-time data for onboard and offboard commanders leveraging its massive surveillance volume on continuous refresh cycles. What does continuous modernization look like for the E-2D, particularly regarding radar and weapon system upgrades? We’ve entered a new era of upgrades with the Delta System Software Configuration (DSSC) 6, or Block II. Awarded last year, Block II represents the most significant upgrade since the E-2D's inception in 2003. This upgrade involves a complete technology refresh for the cockpit, mission computer, and operations station. Most importantly, the new open mission systems architecture will enable rapid integration of new capabilities, including non-proprietary applications from industry partners. Beginning in 2027 and continuing into the 2030s, the entire U.S. Navy fleet will be retrofitted with this cutting-edge technology at the forefront of airborne command and control. How does artificial intelligence and machine learning fit into the future of E-2D operations? With E-2D Block II, we're setting the stage for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tactical decision-making aids. These technologies will enhance the speed and accuracy of our decision-making processes, ensuring that critical information is disseminated faster. Thanks to the E-2D's open mission systems architecture, we’ll be able to rapidly import and integrate AI/ML capabilities as they develop, ensuring we stay ahead of the curve in partnership with the U.S. Navy and allied nations over the next two decades, and beyond. Final thoughts? The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is the world's premier airborne command and control surveillance platform operating in theater today. For European nations, especially those protecting land-locked borders, the E-2D offers critical capabilities for homeland protection. We will continue modernizing this platform to ensure it outpaces evolving threats, making it a combat-proven and trusted solution for decades to come.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/e-2d-hawkeye-flexible-airborne-command-and-control-for-sea-land-and-joint-operations/	2024-10-30T05:25:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/E-2D_AR_11.png
Swedish defense minister: ELSA long-range strike development lesson from Ukraine	Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson speaks to the media ahead of a joint training exercise with the Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish armies, on the Finland/Norway border during the Nordic Response military exercise on March 09, 2024 in Kivilompolo, Finland. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — Sweden is 'eager to participate' in the new European Long Range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, with Defense Minister Pål Jonson telling Breaking Defense he sees an industrial role for companies like Saab and MBDA in the new effort. 'The companies have to speak for themselves. But of course, Saab has capabilities. So that could certainly be an option. Of course, I'd see strong participation from MBDA also.' Jonson said on a call from Qatar, where he was visiting this week. The ELSA project was initiated in July 2024 by France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, with the goal of developing a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers. This range for ground launched missiles was previously banned by the US and Russia by the Cold War INF Treaty, which imploded in 2019, when both countries left the agreement. A few months later, the UK announced it would also have a role in the project, and at the Oct. 18 NATO defense ministers meeting, Jonson signed a letter of intent for Sweden to join the ELSA coalition. Sweden is not currently prioritizing ground-based strike options, but Jonson said that the ELSA effort could have applicability in the aerial and naval domains, which are more a focus for Stockholm. 'The missile will probably be compatible with all the alliance's aircraft, all the surface vessels that have cruise missile launch capability, and simple launch trucks on land,' said William Alberque, former director of arms control at NATO and former director of strategy and technology at IISS. Saab is developing the next generation of corvettes (the Luleå class), fighter jets (Jas Gripen E), and the next generation of submarines (A26). Jonson said that the new subs will not have a long-range strike capability, but that Stockholm wants it for their other modernizing assets. 'We are developing long-range strike capabilities, predominantly for the air force,' Jonson said of Sweden’s focus. 'We are also adopting more long-range strike capabilities for our navy, predominantly for our corvettes.' Strategically, the ELSA effort is 'is very clearly coming out of the lessons learned from Russia's war on Ukraine, and the realization that there are huge gaps in the long-range strike capability of the NATO alliance,' Alberque said. Jonson did not shy away from that idea, telling Breaking Defense that 'The lesson learned from the war in Ukraine is that long-range strike capabilities are becoming increasingly important on the battlefield, and of course, also with stronger air defense capabilities.' Sweden plans to spend 2,4 percent of its GDP next year and 2.6 percent in 2028, which is above NATO’s minimum defense spending target. Jonson said it's too early to give a timeline when ELSA can be operative. 'We joined this project a few weeks ago. Now our ambition is deepened interaction between our government agencies, but also the industry as well, as it depends on our partners and the other countries.' Could it be ready within five years? 'I don't exclude that possibility,' he said. Jonson was in the Middle East to meet with counterpart Khalid bin Mohamed Al Attiyah. Qatar is a NATO partner, and the visit serves as a follow-up to the September visit to Stockholm by Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Jonson told Breaking Defense that the two men had top-level discussions about enhanced situational awareness in air and at sea. 'They're interested in enhanced situational awareness, both in the aerial domain and on the seas,' the Swedish official said, noting that Saab produces an 'agile platform in GlobalEye' that would meet the requirement. However, Jonson said 'it was a more general discussion. discussions about Qatar needs in this regard.' In September Saab delivered a Global Eye to the United Arab Emirates. The recent delivery is the fifth in the series of five Global Eye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft delivered to the UAE since 2020.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/swedish-defense-minister-elsa-long-range-strike-development-lesson-from-ukraine/	2024-10-30T03:15:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/GettyImages-2070957235-scaled-e1715612311169.jpg
Hundreds of drone incursions reported at military installations over past few years: NORTHCOM	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019. (Staff Sgt. Timothy Gray / 5th Armored Brigade) PETERSON SPACE FORCE BASE — The US military has collectively reported hundreds of drone flights over Pentagon installations on American soil in the past few years, and that's just the ones US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) knows about. 'I have no doubt that there's significantly more incursions that we don't see, either with a system or with our eyeballs,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said during a roundtable today with a small group of reporters at Peterson Space Force Base, the dual headquarters for both commands. Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) sightings over US military bases have raised alarm at the Defense Department, as incursions at sensitive installations like Langley Air Force Base — where the Air Force keeps F-22s — have mystified officials, as the Wall Street Journal previously reported. According to data shared by NORAD, drone sightings in 2022 numbered 250, but that figure has dipped somewhat in recent years, numbering 202 in 2023, and 163 so far this year. Guillot said the events are likely gaining more attention due to the spread of systems that are able to detect and track UAS with greater 'fidelity.' The UAS sightings at places that contain highly classified programs have also raised questions about the drones’ provenance, including whether they reflect operations of an adversary nation, though Guillot said today that he has not yet seen evidence of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus.' Instead, he said 'the overwhelming majority of them are probably local hobbyists that are just flying too close to the base.' RELATED: The Army's &#8216;most challenging' unmanned threat? Group 3 drones And while he said there are certainly more events that have gone undetected, Guillot cautioned that many observed phenomena could be duplicate sightings, such as multiple servicemembers calling in the same event. Others could be a case of mistaken identity, like if a servicemember mistakenly identifies blinking lights on a civilian airliner miles away as a closer UAS. Several reports could even concern the same drone flying back and forth over a base repeatedly, he said. Tackling the UAS problem on US soil has flummoxed officials, in part, because of regulations that protect civilian air travel — preventing commanders from taking steps like simply shooting down potential threats or taking other steps to disable them. 'The threat, and the need to counter these threats is growing faster than the policies and procedures that [are] in place can keep up with,' Guillot said. One solution the general pointed to is disrupting position, navigation and timing capabilities for a UAS, otherwise known as GPS jamming or spoofing. But as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have shown, GPS interference can pose hazards for civilian travel if painted with too broad a brush. Tight coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is needed, Guillot stressed, to ensure counter-UAS capabilities are responsibly used. With established ties to the FAA, Guillot said NORTHCOM can step up to play a greater role in defeating drone incursions. One example would be developing preset approvals to engage UAS under specific parameters, obviating the need for a potentially days-long process to get an FAA greenlight. NORTHCOM could also help distribute key systems needed to fend off drone flights by bringing in new capabilities and 'fast-tracking' approval to use them, 'hopefully' within hours. Ultimately, Guillot said NORTHCOM could be a 'clearing house' of counter-UAS capabilities that serves as the 'lead synchronizer' for numerous government agencies. Other UAS challenges stem from properly detecting and tracking certain systems. While Guillot said he was 'pretty confident' that the Pentagon can sufficiently track larger objects, smaller Group 1 and Group 2 systems can pose more of a challenge since they can blend in with the clutter of airspace. (The Pentagon classifies drones in five 'groups,' with the first group being the smallest and the fifth being the largest.) Besides the UAS conundrum, Guillot has plenty of other issues keeping him busy. Toward the end of the discussion, an aide beckoned him away, bringing an abrupt end to the roundtable. 'I’m sorry, I’m going to have to run for a second,' Guillot said before sprinting out of the room.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hundreds-of-drone-incursions-reported-at-military-installations-over-past-few-years-northcom/	2024-10-29T14:53:29-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_drone_quadcopter_5816882-scaled-e1730238738198.jpg
