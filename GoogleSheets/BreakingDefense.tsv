From a runaway ICBM pricetag to AI dogfighting: 5 air warfare stories from 2024	US Air Force artist's rendering of the Sentinel in flight. (Credit: US Air Force) WASHINGTON — For the US Air Force, 2024 was supposed to mark the beginning of the next generation. That was true in many cases: The service made significant headway for its drone wingmen program and in a related effort demonstrated that an AI-piloted jet can make for a formidable adversary, as well as certifying the F-35A to carry a nuclear weapon. But other efforts experienced setbacks. From the Air Force’s ballooning costs for a new, nuclear-tipped ICBM to a pause for its Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, questions now hang over some of the service’s leading priorities. In semi-particular order, here are the top five air warfare stories of 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘No alternatives’: Pentagon doubles down as new Sentinel ICBM’s cost jumps to $141 billion Air Force leaders had long warned the Sentinel ICBM would run into trouble, but even after an early preview of rising costs, many in Washington were caught flat-footed by a startling new price tag estimated to be 81 percent higher than originally forecast. Sentinel is now consuming the Air Force’s budget, much to the dismay of service leaders eager to fund other priorities. Despite its exploding costs, officials determined through a congressionally-mandated review that there are 'no alternatives' for the new ICBM, casting aside other options like road-mobile ICBMs or an extension of the Minuteman III fleet. And what drove the new estimate? Bad assumptions and 'unknown unknowns,' Air Force officials explained. It’s been decades since the Pentagon has undertaken a similar project, leading to unwelcome discoveries — the bulk of them concentrated in the construction element of the project. Multiply that problem over hundreds of silos, thousands of miles of cabling and countless easements, and the bill quickly runs up. 2. F-35A officially certified to carry nuclear bomb Reporters sweat the details of their stories, but being drawn into the global nuclear balance of power can be particularly daunting. And that’s what happened when Breaking Defense reported the F-35A was certified to carry the B61-12 thermonuclear gravity bomb — news apparently noticed by the Kremlin, as it was quickly picked up by Russian state media. The certification meant that the F-35 became the first stealth fighter in the world approved to carry a nuke. Alongside the US, fellow NATO nations and F-35 operators Belgium, Italy and the Netherlands — and Germany once Berlin’s jets are delivered — can now complement the traditional nuclear triad of submarines, ballistic missiles and bombers with fast-moving, forward-deployed stealth fighters. All as nuclear tensions ratchet higher over the war in Ukraine. Looking to you, proponents of deterrence theory. 3. V-22 Ospreys barred from full mission capability until ‘mid-2025’: NAVAIR boss After a long string of incidents, a crash of the V-22 Osprey in November 2023 prompted officials to significantly scale back operations with the troubled tiltrotor, later admitting that the aircraft won’t resume its full mission profile until mid-2025. The incident ignited anger among lawmakers, leading some to threaten canceling the program altogether if another aircraft crashed. Recent reporting has also shed light on the aircraft’s troubles, such as an internal report showing that warnings of a mechanical issue that caused the November 2023 crash were known for at least a decade. Other reporting has revealed a recent concerning rise in severe incidents and that underlying manufacturing issues carry wider implications for military and civilian aircraft. The aircraft’s woes continue: On Dec. 9, officials confirmed that the Osprey’s operations would once again be paused following a recent in-flight incident. 4. In a ‘world first,’ DARPA project demonstrates AI dogfighting in real jet Few announcements this year had a bigger impact on the future of warfare than when DARPA, the Air Force and industry vendors revealed that an F-16 tricked out to serve as an autonomy testbed can not only fly itself, but also dogfight. Officials declined to disclose specifics results from those trials like a win/loss ratio, but after Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall took a ride himself in the special F-16, he described the AI as putting on roughly an even match against a seasoned pilot. Many officials think human pilots will stick around for the foreseeable future, their abilities augmented by manned-unmanned teaming arrangements. And, Kendall has emphasized, any highly autonomous weapon systems will only be flown under tight human control. As more experiments like the DARPA project proceed and autonomous capabilities only get better, time will tell whether the future is closer than it seems. 5. Air Force picks Anduril, General Atomics for next round of CCA work The Air Force made significant strides this year for its effort to field drone wingmen, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft. After Breaking Defense first reported the five industry vendors in play for the CCA program’s first round of procurement, the Air Force winnowed that group to two, leaving startup Anduril and legacy dronemaker General Atomics still standing. Heralding a revolution in airpower, officials hope CCA can offset numerical advantages enjoyed by China as the Air Force’s own fighter inventory shrinks. One day, these drones might even take the place of manned fighters — and if incoming Department of Government Efficiency co-lead Elon Musk has his way, that day could come sooner rather than later.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-a-runaway-icbm-pricetag-to-ai-dogfighting-5-air-warfare-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T10:58:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220405_USAF_sentinel_gfx.png
Trump names picks for top Pentagon posts, with financier as No. 2	U.S. Army Reserve soldiers receive an overview of Washington D.C. as part of the 4th Annual Day with the Army Reserve May 25, 2016. The event was led by the Private Public Partnership office. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has made his picks for a handful of top jobs at the Defense Department, including several who served in national security jobs during his first term of office and a billionaire financier for the number two spot. Trump announced the choices late Sunday, saying the team would 'work in conjunction with our GREAT Secretary of Defense Nominee, Pete Hegseth!' — signaling the Trump team is standing by Hegseth, the Fox News host despite allegations of sexual misconduct, which he has denied. For Hegseth's would-be deputy, Trump nominated Stephen Feinberg, billionaire investor and co-founder of private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management. Feinberg's firm, which is active in the defense space, owns Stratolaunch Systems, which provides hypersonic vehicles for testing including to DoD. He also has been a major funder to political organizations backing Trump. Zachary Krevor, Stratolaunch CEO, told reporters on Dec. 5 that Feinberg would 'be a phenomenal choice,' even though Stratolaunch would then face 'heavy, heavy conflict of interest rules and precedents put in place such that we will be treated no differently than any other company.' During Trump's first term in office, Feinberg headed the President's Intelligence Advisory Board, which gives private citizens access to classified information so they can assess how the Intelligence Community goes about its normally cloistered business. Dan Coats, Trump's Director of National Intelligence, told lawmakers in February 2017 that he knew Feinberg 'personally' and considered him a 'patriot.' Elbridge Colby, a well-known Washington voice on national security affairs with a long government career, was nominated as DoD undersecretary for policy. Colby, the grandson of Nixon-era CIA Director William Colby, held the position of DoD deputy assistant secretary for strategy and force development from 2017 to 2018. As an analyst at the Center for a New American Security and the Center for Naval Analyses known for his 'realist' views, Colby was active on issues surrounding space security — arguing for the US military to build up the capacity to fight a 'limited' space war with China and Russia. Michael Duffey, who served in several roles including at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) during the first Trump administration, was nominated as undersecretary for acquisitions and sustainment. A former head of the Wisconsin Republican Party, Duffey was reportedly a key figure in Trump's first impeachment saga as an administration official involved in the freezing of aid to Ukraine. Emil Michael, a former Uber executive, was tapped to be undersecretary for research and engineering. Michael led the ride-share company's expansion into Russia and China, negotiating co-investment deals worth billions, according to accounts he's provided publicly. Michael was linked to controversies while at Uber, including a suggestion in 2014 that the company dig up dirt on reporters critical of the firm, according to a Buzzfeed report. (Michael apologized at the time.) Also in 2014 Michael was appointed by then-President Barack Obama to the Pentagon's Defense Business Board. According to his website, he also is an investor in or advisor to Elon Musk's SpaceX. Joe Kasper, who served at DoD and the Department of Homeland Security during Trump's first term, was nominated as chief of staff to the secretary of defense. Kasper began his career as an aide to then-Rep. Duncan Hunter, R.-Calif., and left the job in 2017, months after Hunter came under investigation for misusing campaign funds from 2010 to 2016. Kasper was not accused of wrongdoing in that case. (Hunter pleaded guilty in 2019 but was later pardoned by Trump.) Kasper currently serves as managing director at consulting firm Ervin Graves. Finally, Keith Bass, a retired Navy commander, was nominated as assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. Bass since June 2023 has been medical center director of the West Texas VA Health Care System for the Veterans Integrated Service Network, having previously worked as a senior vice president for business development at GlobalMed, a Vienna, Va.-based provider of telemedicine including for DoD and the Veterans Administration. While not a physician, he also served as the director of the CIA Office of Medical Services.

To win, US must eliminate gap between the supply chain and the kill chain	Contractor employees at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant prepare 155 mm artillery rounds to be filled as a part of the load, assemble and pack operation. (Photo by JMC) In early October, when Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles at Israel, two US Navy destroyers were strategically in place in the Mediterranean Sea. The USS Bulkeley and USS Cole fired off a dozen interceptors to aid in Israel’s defense. Those interceptors, which proved their life-saving abilities, cost up to $30 million a copy. Each one takes years to build. In an era of on-demand everything, a reasonable American might think that the expenditure of this costly, munition, immediately kicked off replenishment at the Alabama factory where it’s made. One might reasonably assume that a sophisticated tracking, production, and resupply system keeps our servicemembers armed and our military at a heightened state of readiness. The reasonable American, conditioned to these expectations by the suggestive powers of 'smart' homes, cars, grocery shopping apps, and more, would be completely wrong. Today, no such system is in place and it often takes years to replenish weapons used on the battlefield. The American factory is separated from the fight. This gap must be closed, the need is urgent, and the technology to fix this is available. Historically, this type of system wasn't actually needed. For most of human history, armies lived off the land. They acquired food and supplies from local populations. Armies stashed supplies at magazines, transported equipment like artillery, and acquired goods and services from sutlers and camp followers. Likewise, navies operating far from home ports relied on local supplies of fresh water, food, and naval stores. Pre-industrial forces, therefore, lacked the logistical umbilical cord that stretches back to home territory. Logistics was a local affair conducted by forces in the field, rather than supplied by a dedicated corps. This created freedom of maneuver at the cost of the ability to sustain large forces in the field over time. The second industrial revolution changed all of this. It freed up labor and created the means to outfit huge forces with materiel. Railroads and steamships could quickly and reliably transport these armies, along with their increasingly sophisticated equipment and supplies over great distances. Telegraphs allowed for rapid communication of orders and logistical requests. Armies and navies still acquired some supplies locally, but on balance, sustainment now came over supply lines. This change propelled the emergence of a standing military staff to manage the complexity of industrial logistics. Militaries created large supply corps and dedicated infrastructure to keep forces and equipment sustained in the field. As military operations became larger and more far-flung, these processes and organizations expanded in size and complexity to keep pace. Over time, this specialization increasingly divorced rear-area support functions from frontline combat forces. Which is why today, the supply chain and the kill chain are separate, distinct functions in the American military. There have been some modest technology advancements to help connect logisticians to warfighters, but nothing has bridged the gap between supply and demand. Rather, we remain largely stuck in a 20th century model in which combat forces rely on a distant and labor-intensive process to provide them with materiel, ranging from bombs to blood, when and where it is needed. The separated military functions of supply and demand systems have created bloat in civilian and military bureaucracy and a disconnect between what the warfighter needs and America is producing that does not exist in the commercial sector. The sad reality is that because the Pentagon does not typically invest in technology for the 'staff functions' of DoD, the on-demand technology in the hands of an American consumer right now is more powerful than that in the hands of an American logistics officer. The good news is that changing this requires exactly zero new authorities from Congress, acquisition reforms, changes to the FAR, or new blue star commissions. The military can solve this today by leveraging the same software and AI that the commercial sector has relied upon for decades. Today, units manually calculate supply consumption and communicate it to the next echelon. Resupply is then aggregated across units and fed into plans, at which point they are locked in for that planning cycle. As a result of this slow, sequential process, forward-deployed units often depend on establishing surpluses of supply in theater—surpluses that we now know are difficult to maintain, and that are vulnerable to disruption in a contested environment. The supply chains and manufacturers that ultimately power these operations have rationally organized around this intermittent cadence. Now imagine a process that runs more like the always-on systems Americans have come to expect in every other industry. In the case of Navy missiles fired in the Mediterranean, the weapons used in the kill chain are Standard Missile-2 (SM-2) surface-to-air missiles, built by Raytheon and fired using a Vertical Launcher System (VLS). That VLS would be equipped with software to measure SM-2 expenditures, allowing accurate inventory and consumption to be readily visible across echelons. These same command and control (C2) systems would provide proactive recommendations on replenishment actions for the supply chain, transforming unreliable stockpiling into data-backed predictive logistics. This can and should be replicated across a variety of weapons systems and other critical equipment. The harder piece will be fully restoring the size and strength of the American industrial base to meet the production and manufacturing demands that today’s challenging global environment requires. There are signs that a resurgence is underway, but a full transformation of American production cannot take place without a clear and sustained demand signal from the Pentagon. Making the changes described here actually helps this big challenge. Sending industry a much earlier demand signal and reducing delays in getting industry gears turning is the goal. Furthermore, everything purchased under DoD’s Operations &amp; Maintenance account—repairs, fuel, medical supplies, and more—enjoys significantly more flexibility in terms of DoD’s flexibility and discretion to buy when needed. You simply have to look at the attendance at this month’s Reagan National Defense Forum to see that American companies, old and new, are rising up to meet the needs of the warfighters. It is incumbent on military leaders to put in place the efficient, direct, real-time connectivity between what those companies supply and what our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and guardians need for today’s fight, and tomorrow’s.

From drone red tape to an aviation shake up: 5 Army stories from 2024	An RCV light at desert testing. (Original image by Savannah Baldwin/ US Army; Code image by Markus Spiske via Pexels; Graphic by Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — US Army leaders spent the year teasing changes both big and small. After kicking off 2024 with an aviation upheaval and revamping artillery plans, they foreshadowed additional changes to acquisition programs and policy alike. Here are my five top Army stories from the past 12 months, ranging from red tape hamstringing soldiers from using smaller drones to Army leaders butting up with tech challenges developing a fleet of future robotic combat vehicles. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 2. US Army takes on most effective counter-drone system yet: Red tape Every time a US Army soldier loses or breaks a drone — regardless of its size or price tag — they are saddled with reporting paperwork, a mandatory investigation and possibly a loss of pay. That red tape has left soldiers hesitant to fly smaller drones and the service officials looking to reclassify ones tipping the scales below 55 pounds as expendable. 3. Army looks to limit early Robotic Combat Vehicle missions to keep soldiers out of harm's way Army plans to team up soldiers with machines kicked into high gear this year with part of that push centered around the revamped Robotic Combat Vehicle program. But questions about the service’s autonomy approach coupled with the state of technology, mean it is relying on a radio 'tether' that can break if soldiers in control vehicles are too far behind the robots, obstacles get in the way or an adversary is jamming the signals. As a result, too many troops are needed to control those ground robots and they are in the line of fire. 4. Army open to replacing Microsoft as prime under &#8216;IVAS Next,' industry sources say The Army and Microsoft are still teamed up on the futuristic mixed-reality goggles dubbed the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). However, change is afoot after multiple years of starts and fits with the heads-up display. Several tech companies, for example, spent 2024 preparing to jump into the IVAS Next competition after receiving briefings from the service about a decision to recompete the prime contractor position. 5. Inside the US Army's race to apply Ukraine lessons to future Abrams, Bradley replacement Loitering munitions and cheap one-way drones inside Ukraine have left a string of combat vehicles from both sides of the conflict destroyed in battle. The US Army leaders are using the conflict as a crash course in how their own tactics and technology could end up on the wrong side of a war, while also rushing to incorporate lessons into the development of tracked combat vehicles like the Abrams tank and Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-drone-red-tape-to-an-aviation-shake-up-5-army-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T07:30:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240719_RCV_desert_gfx.png
The Navy’s never-ending quest for 355 ships: 5 Navy stories from 2024	The Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group transits the Pacific Ocean Jan. 25, 2020. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Jason Isaacs) WASHINGTON — In 2024, the US Navy didn’t have enough ships or subs it wanted in its fleet. And it showed. A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers as well as top Navy leadership have bemoaned the fleet’s size for years now. Despite federal law stating the service must maintain more than 355 ships, the fleet’s actual size currently fluctuates between the high 280s and low 290s. But what distinguished 2024 were the numerous fronts on which the Navy, and other parts of the federal government, has pushed to stop the bleeding before 2027 — the year the US believes China wants to have the ability to invade Taiwan, should leader Xi Jingping call them to do so. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti herself has seemingly coined the phrase 'more players on the field' since the start of her tenure. It's a motto that encompasses several aspects of the Navy's capabilities and arsenal, the overall number of warships being one of them. From calling out industry to making a big bet on venture capital, these are five stories from 2024 where the Pentagon’s anxiety about ship counts was showing. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Navy lays out major shipbuilding delays, in rare public accounting Not too long after the president’s budget request was published in March, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro released a brief but damning document outlining massive delays on nearly every premiere shipbuilding program in the service’s repertoire. The news that those programs were behind wasn’t inherently surprising; Pentagon observers use a combination of public statements and budget justification documents to keep tabs on the general status of all new ships and submarines. But this story makes it to the top of this list because of how unusual it was for a senior Defense Department official such as Del Toro to so outwardly and publicly proclaim some of the country’s most important national security programs are lagging behind. And as has been a pattern for Del Toro, to which the next story on this list will allude, he also made sure to call out prime contractors for each program on that list of delays. 2. How SECNAV’s claims about S. Korean, Japanese shipbuilders do and do not line up In the first half of 2024, Del Toro on multiple occasions let industry know that, as he saw it, they had their share of the blame to carry for the Navy’s problems, particularly when it came to ship construction and maintenance. At major expositions that are otherwise meant as opportunities for industry to get face time with senior military leaders, Del Toro laid into unnamed C-suite executives for excessive 'stock buybacks' and failing to re-invest in their facilities for the benefit of the Navy. That leads into this story, which explored Del Toro’s proposal for Japanese and South Korean shipbuilders to invest in American shipyards. These Asian companies, Del Toro argued, are technologically ahead of their American counterparts and their work output reaps the benefits. It was a premise with which some American officials took exception. (At least one major Asian company, the Hanwha Group, has taken Del Toro up on his offer and started making inroads with the American industrial base since then.)

(U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 3rd Class Briana Carter) 3. ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers This next story also featured the US reaching out to allies for a helping hand in shipbuilding. The ICE Pact came out of this summer’s NATO summit and was one of the last big foreign policy initiatives by the Biden administration. While icebreakers are technically the purview of the US Coast Guard with regards to shipbuilding, the operations of the US Navy — and the wider joint force — are dependent upon the United States and allies being able to access existing and emerging sea lanes in the High North. This was clearly on the minds of Biden administration officials when it enlisted the assistance of Canada and Finland, both of whom are proficient at icebreaker shipbuilding and Arctic navigation, to join forces with the American defense industrial base for the benefit of all three nations’ fleets. The story linked above dives deep into the circumstances surrounding the ICE Pact including why the US needed help from its northern allies and where Russia and China stand in their own push in the Arctic. 4. Navy takes ‘really big swing with private investment to boost sub industrial base The advent of the AUKUS trilateral security pact in 2021 has put a massive spotlight on the submarine industrial base and its challenges. This story is a highlight for the year because of the unusual nature of the deal in play. The Navy teamed up with a private investment fund to purchase and develop a plot of land in Mobile, Ala., aimed at prioritizing 'maritime infrastructure investments and sustainment activities with the goal of developing an additional 75 [percent] of the site to support submarine production, workforce training, and industrial capacity.' The business arrangement is a novel one for the Navy and speaks to the service’s willingness to use outside the box thinking if it means bolstering the submarine industrial base. That thinking is why it makes this list. (Some readers might notice this story was written by Breaking Defense’s managing editor Lee Ferran, who insists on calling it 'eloquent prose.' I'll leave that to the reader to decide. [Editor's Note: Eloquent or elegant, either fits.]) Sailors stand watch aboard the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Truxtun (DDG 103) while it transits the Turkish Straits. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Scott Barnes/Released) 5. US Navy to extend service lives of 12 destroyers This last story is short, but to the point. The service announced it would extend the lives of a dozen Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, which will add an anticipated 48 years of operational life to a fleet of ships regularly dubbed the workhorse of the US Navy. During the first Trump administration, Navy officials went on record to say that extending the service lives of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, combined with producing additional ships beyond previously planned amounts, was the surest way to reach 355 ships. The fleet's composition would not be optimal but, they argued, having too many destroyers was the best place to be imbalanced. Given this announcement, that thinking is clearly still resident in the US Navy’s leadership.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-navys-never-ending-quest-for-355-ships-5-navy-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-23T06:01:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220420_dvids_roosevelt_strike_group_6046018-scaled-e1650476195702.jpg
Pentagon awards Lockheed $11.8 billion undefinitized F-35 production contract	Airmen assigned to the 34th Fighter Squadron and Fighter Generation Squadron perform pre-flight checks on F-35A Lightning IIs during an agile combat employment exercise at Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, March 28, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman Keagan Lee) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has awarded Lockheed Martin a roughly $11.8 billion contract to continue production of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, as the two parties inch toward finalizing an agreement for the stealth fighter. In a contract announcement posted tonight, the Pentagon said the award covers 145 copies of the tri-variant fighter between the US Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy as well as foreign customers. The contract is undefinitized, meaning dollar values and quantities could change as negotiations continue, and only covers production lot 18 of the stealth fighter. Lockheed referred questions to the Pentagon. Russ Goemaere, a spokesperson for the F-35 Joint Program Office, told Breaking Defense that the Pentagon aims to finalize the lot 18 contract in the spring. Additionally, Goemaere said officials expect to similarly issue an undefinitized contract for lot 19 production when the fiscal 2025 budget is approved — which may not occur until March at the earliest, following a last-minute, stopgap measure lawmakers passed today. After originally aiming to reach an agreement last year for production lots 18 and 19, the Pentagon and Lockheed have remained at an impasse amid inflation and other challenges. The parties reached a 'handshake' deal for the two lots in November — though the announcement did not share quantities or prices — and a Lockheed official later said the program may first move forward with an undefinitized contract as talks continued. Getting a contract award was critical, Lockheed officials have previously said, to provide a cash injection for the program that the company resorted to partially funding out of pocket to ensure production could continue smoothly. The F-35 has also been a target of top Trump ally Elon Musk in recent weeks, who is set to co-lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) commission that could recommend cuts to government spending. Musk has called officials 'idiots' for continuing to build the jet, while DOGE co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy recently advocated for shifting funds away from manned fighters and into other platforms like drones — raising questions of the Joint Strike Fighter’s fate under the new administration. Yet the jet still has defenders. Outgoing Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has long been critical of the F-35 program’s many problems, hit back at Musk’s comments Thursday, arguing that the US should continue to buy and upgrade the stealth fighter.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagon-awards-lockheed-11-8-billion-undefinitized-f-35-production-contract/	2024-12-20T17:54:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240728_f35s_fog_USAF-scaled-e1722204407178.jpg
Top defense insights from 2024	In my intro to last year’s collection of opinion and analysis pieces, I started with this line: 'In many ways, 2023 was a year of chaos.' Rather than writing this, I really could have just cut and pasted that intro and changed some dates, because 2024 wasn’t any calmer. The wars in Ukraine and Israel expanded, major Pentagon programs found themselves fighting for their lives and a presidential election dominated America’s attention. All of which is to say, the defense community had a lot of thoughts in 2024, which is why Breaking Defense published over 85 opinion and analysis pieces this year. Below, we’ve collected a small handful of those that we think really stood out, whether because they came from newsmakers, because of their topicality, or because of the way they drove the conversation. Of course, we could only select a limited number of the pieces we ran for this eBook, which means a lot of great stuff got left on the cutting room floor. For this collection, we largely avoided the many excellent news-of-the-moment pieces (such as how Congress should approach the budget) that are less relevant months later, even though those pieces helped define the discussion at the time. Also not fully represented here is our 'NATO’s Northern Edge' collection, published around the alliance’s 75th Anniversary in Washington and featuring pieces from top officials from Norway, Finland, Canada and the United Kingdom.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/top-defense-insights-from-2024/	2024-12-20T15:35:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Defense-Influences-Featured-Image-2024-V2.png
Air Force reopens F-16 ejection seat deal, setting up contest between Collins, Martin-Baker	Three F-16s from the 93rd Fighter Squadron prepare for takeoff at Homestead Air Reserve Base on Aug. 3, 2022, during the Golden Gecko Airmen Readiness Exercise 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Lionel Castellano) WASHINGTON — The Air Force is formally recompeting a deal with Collins Aerospace to provide modernized ejection seats for the service’s F-16 fleet, and could do the same for the F-22 and B-1 based on the results, the service announced tonight. Work already underway to integrate Collins’s ACES 5 ejection seat on the Air Force’s F-15 fleet will continue, according to the service’s press release. But officials will now compete a deal to reseat the F-16, and 'decisions following the competition could extend to other platforms, including the F-22 and B-1,' the release said. A new request for proposals will be issued, the Air Force said. As Breaking Defense covered last month, the decision puts up for grabs the safety of upwards of thousands of Air Force pilots, hundreds of millions of dollars and a chance for sole competitor Martin-Baker to steal away at least some business from RTX subsidiary Collins. 'With 713 lives saved, ACES is the safest ejection seat available. We look forward to working with the US Air Force to qualify and install the latest generation of our ejection seats, the ACES 5, on the F-16 fleet,' Collins said in a statement. Martin-Baker, whose US18E seat is on contract for foreign sales of the F-16, said in a statement that '[w]e have a qualified seat for the F-16, and we look forward to the opportunity to compete.' The service said an original sole-source award to Collins under the Next Generation Ejection Seat (NGES) program was 'based on previous market research and assessment of technological maturity.' But the program has been hit by delays, and officials decided to review the deal with Collins by querying industry again in August. Officials chose a new approach based on that market survey, as well as 'new data' and 'evolving operations demands,' according to the release. 'The decision to re-open the competition underscores our commitment to continually assess our strategies to ensure we meet warfighter needs and timelines,' Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter said in the release. 'By reassessing market conditions and fostering competition, we ensure industry delivers the best possible solutions for both current and future Air Force requirements.' The Air Force’s original NGES plan called for reseating the A-10, though officials have since decided to retire the platform — mirroring a shrinking fighter fleet. Collins is on contract separately to provide a new seat for the B-2 fleet, and the first bomber got its new seats last month. It’s unclear how a competition might impact the already-delayed seat plan. For each platform under the NGES effort, 'the Air Force projects a 36-month integration and test program, followed by a 24-month manufacturing lead-time, followed by aircraft modifications,' an Air Force spokesperson previously told Breaking Defense. Asked how a competition could impact that timeline, the spokesperson replied that '[i]nformation gathered from industry in the [August] sources sought notice will inform us on potential impacts to platform integration timelines.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/air-force-reopens-f-16-ejection-seat-deal-setting-up-contest-between-collins-martin-baker/	2024-12-20T15:28:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/7963466-scaled-e1695394371635.jpg
Continuing resolution with $14B in submarine funds survives House vote	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Just hours before a midnight deadline is set to trigger a government shutdown, the House overwhelmingly approved a stopgap funding bill that keeps federal funding rolling until mid-March and adds $14 billion for submarines. The bill, approved in a 366-34-1 vote in which Republicans made up the only 'nay' votes, was the third deal floated this week amid a Republican back-and-forth in which President-elect Donald Trump and billionaire tech mogul Elon Musk played starring roles. In the end, House Democrats overwhelmingly backed the bill after the White House voiced reluctant support. 'Following an order by President-elect Trump, yesterday Republicans walked away from a bipartisan deal and threatened to shut down the government at the 11th hour in order to pave the way to provide tax breaks for billionaires. This revised legislation does not do that,' White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. 'President Biden supports moving this legislation forward and ensuring that the vital services the government provides for hardworking Americans — from issuing Social Security checks to processing benefits for veterans — can continue as well as to grant assistance for communities that were impacted by devastating hurricanes,' she added. The measure now moves to the Senate, which is expected to pass the bill as early as this evening. Like previous proposals, the latest bill included more than $14 billion in additional funds for the Virginia-class and Columbia-class submarines. That sum includes $5.7 billion in emergency funds for Virginia-class submarine construction for 'the improvement of workforce wages and non-executive level salaries.' That funding, which the Navy could incrementally dole out until the end of fiscal 2029, is aimed at mitigating ongoing instability in the submarine industrial base, which has had difficultly recruiting and retaining skilled shipbuilding technicians since the pandemic. It also included $9 billion for Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine procurement. The additional submarine funding was an uncontroversial provision that drew little conversation during the past week of negotiations. 'Importantly, the final Continuing Resolution maintains the Biden Administration’s request to Congress of over $14 billion for the Virginia and Columbia class submarine programs and the industrial base, which will help the Navy and industry boost production cadence and grow the supply chain.' Rep. Joe Courtney, the Connecticut Democrat who is ranking member on the House Armed Services seapower subcommittee, said in a statement. Other defense related increases that remained in the latest bill were the addition of disaster relief funding for military installations for damages caused by Typhoon Mawar as well as various hurricanes. However, previous language that would transfer a District of Columbia Air National Guard wing to the Maryland Guard was not included, as that move was part of a deal that would transfer the RFK stadium site to DC, which was not addressed in the current CR bill. The road to the current deal has been fraught with drama. The initial CR deal, negotiated between House GOP and Democratic leadership and released on Tuesday, included billions of dollars in farm aid and disaster relief, as well as a laundry list of additional provisions spanning from the ownership of Washington’s RFK stadium to a pay raise for congressional salaries to music tourism. Without Democrat buy-in to ensure passage of the bill, House Speaker Mike Johnson risked the CR being derailed by hardline fiscal hawks in his own party. However, Republicans were incensed by the unrelated items attached to the CR, which had ballooned into more than 1,500-pages. The wheels came off on Wednesday as Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who have both been tapped to lead Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency effort, took to social media and issued a string of posts decrying the bipartisan agreement as a waste of taxpayer dollars and calling for a shutdown unless a clean CR was put forward. Trump’s disavowal of the deal — and his demand that any agreement also tackle the debt ceiling — proved to be the final death knell, leaving Republicans scrambling to figure out a new plan with only two days left before federal funding ran out. With Trump’s blessing, Johnson put forward another bill yesterday: a clean CR with disaster relief and the farm bill, as well as suspend the debt ceiling. However, the bill failed in a 174-235 vote in which 38 Republicans voted against the measure. Republicans spent all day trying to put forward another option, at one point considering conducting four different votes for the CR, the farm bill, the disaster relief and the debt ceiling. Ultimately, House leadership opted for a single bill that dropped the debt ceiling issue. Democratic leaders repeatedly stated that Republicans would be responsible for getting a funding bill over the line without Democrat help, with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stating on a Wednesday post on the X social media site, 'You break the bipartisan agreement, you own the consequences that follow.' Connecticut Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, criticized Musk’s involvement in the process in a floor speech ahead of the vote. 'We need to rely on each other to keep our word, that when we have an agreement, we keep that agreement,' she said. However, both Democrats ended up voting for the bill. Appropriations Committee Chairman Tom Cole, R-Okla., implored Democrats to consider funding measures that included in the bill on their own merits, not what had been stripped out from the previous bipartisan agreement. 'If you vote no on this bill, you are effectively voting to shut down the government,' he said. 'These are things that we agree on, and there is nothing in this bill certainly that my friends on the other side disagree with.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/continuing-resolution-with-14b-in-submarine-funds-survives-house-vote/	2024-12-20T15:14:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231108_DVIDS_submarine_construction_820194-e1699443296744.jpg
Spain orders 25 additional Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets, links arms on Turkish trainer	Spain is set to operate a total of 115 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets after placing a new order for the fourth generation type (Airbus) BELFAST — Spain has signed off on an order for 25 Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation fighter jets under its Halcon II program. A contract between the Spanish government and the NATO Eurofighter and Tornado Management Agency (NETMA) was inked today and covers the acquisition of 21 single-seat and four twin-seat aircraft. The Eurofighter consortium said in a statement that deliveries to the Spanish Air and Space Force will take place between 2030 and 2035. 'The Spanish Eurofighter Typhoon jets will replace part of the legacy F-18 fleet, based in Torrejon and Zaragoza, and bring the total number of Typhoon aircraft in the Spanish Air Force to 115,' it added. In a related statement, Airbus, which builds all Spanish Air Force Eurofighters out of its Getafe site, said that the 'new aircraft will: boost Spain’s air-power capabilities and operations; reinforce its prominent position at the heart of NATO, and secure the programme’s industrial footprint.' Halcon is Spain’s national two-phase acquisition program to replace all F/A-18C/D Hornets, split between the already contracted $2.15 billion Halcon 1, covering 20 aircraft, and the new second batch order. The Halcon II effort, valued at €4.6 billion ($4.8 billion), was cleared by Spain's Council of Ministers in 2023. Alongside aircraft, the program also covers engines and support services. Gen. Javier Salto Martínez-Avial, chief of the Spanish Air and Space Force has long pressed for the Halcon II order not to be delayed, warning last year that deliveries could take 10 years. Halcon aircraft are to be equipped with state of the art avionics, electronically-scanning radar (E-Scan), and weapon systems that can support launch of Brimstone III and Full Meteor missiles, alongside new sensors and improved connectivity, according to Airbus. Separately, Spain has also decided to partner with Turkey to support development of the Hurjet advanced jet trainer. A Memorandum of Understanding for the collaboration was signed today between the Spanish Ministry of Defence and the Turkish Presidency of Defence Industries. The move could lead to Madrid acquiring the platform as a replacement for Northrop SF-5M aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/spain-orders-25-additional-eurofighter-typhoon-fighter-jets-links-arms-on-turkish-trainer/	2024-12-20T11:45:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/pm_38_677_677584-e8nd1ey288-scaled-e1734715882530.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: New Air Force review supports manned 6th-gen NGAD fighter concept	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — A recent internal Air Force analysis supports the development of a manned, next-generation fighter jet, three sources told Breaking Defense — a finding that comes amid a high-profile debate over the future of the multi-billion-dollar Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program. While the Trump administration will make the final decision of whether to press forward with NGAD, which was paused earlier this year, the review’s results could strengthen the case to keep the program alive and award a contract for the future fighter. In a statement to Breaking Defense today, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall did not dispute that the overall conclusion of the analysis supports a next-gen manned fighter, though he did caution that other factors including cost would determine its outcome. 'While our analysis does demonstrate that there is value in a next generation crewed platform, the current NGAD design comes at high total and unit costs that may be unaffordable,' Kendall said. 'Our analysis also highlights that there may be significant opportunity costs associated with proceeding with NGAD, given the DAF’s [Department of the Air Force] strategic priorities and the potential level of Air Force and Space Force budgets. There are a number of interdependencies and alternative options at various risk and resourcing levels which the next administration will have to consider before making a decision. All options remain on the table,' he added. The NGAD program was temporarily suspended as the Air Force weighed whether it could afford an expensive next-generation fighter in light of ongoing budget constraints, the breakneck pace of adversary threats, and technological progress on competing spending priorities, especially a budding effort to field drone wingmen dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft. The CCA wingmen are expected to be a critical force multiplier for manned Air Force aircraft and have been described as a key component of the envisioned NGAD family of systems. Kendall said in public comments Thursday that other concerns also influenced the delay, like how the platform would fit into the service’s Agile Combat Employment — a method of dispersing operations to avoid a crippling attack, relying on a network of bases officials fret may not have adequate defenses. The service is also weighing what elements are needed to support an NGAD fighter, like a next-gen tanker, whose fate is currently in limbo. Air Force leaders decided to use the fall to review the NGAD concept, calling in help from former officials and researchers to conduct additional analysis. The process was expected to wrap up in time to inform the Air Force’s fiscal 2026 budget request, though the service recently announced it would punt a decision on the platform’s fate to the incoming Trump administration. Without sharing the results, Kendall said publicly Thursday that the NGAD analysis was 'mostly done' with the caveat that the new Trump team 'may want some additional analysis when they show up.' He noted that the Air Force is 'very close to being ready to proceed if that program continues its current form.' The Air Force’s NGAD hesitancy sent shockwaves through the defense industry, which after a decade of development was gearing up for a decision on the jet originally expected this year. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are believed to be the prime contractors vying for the jet’s lucrative contract, which would likely be the world’s first sixth-gen fighter. RELATED: As Air Force deliberates sixth-gen fighter plans, much at stake for Boeing A next-gen fighter effort also carries profound implications for the engine industrial base. The NGAD platform is the only aircraft publicly planned to use an 'adaptive' powerplant, which could offer leaps in fuel efficiency and thrust. GE Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney are competing to build the NGAD engine under a program called Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion. While the Air Force’s analysis substantiates the requirement for a sixth-generation fighter, it’s unclear whether the service will be able to find the funding to continue development of the NGAD aircraft and engine given significant budget pressure from other programs such as the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the B-21 Raider stealth bomber and the nuclear-tipped Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system, whose price recently ballooned by 81 percent. Kendall told Breaking Defense earlier this year he was confident that a sixth-generation fighter would be built, though he left the door open to an optionally manned version. Kendall said the operational challenges, primarily due to the rise of China, have been defined by an 'accumulation of threats,' noting that Cold War-era assumptions can no longer hold. 'We’re not up against the Soviet Union anymore,' Kendall said. 'We’re up against China, primarily, as the pacing challenge. And we’ve got to be sure we’re doing the right thing.' How the incoming Trump administration will handle the NGAD issue is unknown. President-elect Donald Trump has yet to name his nominee for Air Force Secretary, but Elon Musk — an influential associate of Trump who will run his Department of Government Efficiency initiative — has made his views clear. '[M]anned fighter jets are obsolete in the age of drones,' Musk recently posted on X, the social media platform he owns.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/exclusive-new-air-force-review-supports-manned-6th-gen-ngad-fighter-concept/	2024-12-20T11:06:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
State of Play: Industry readying for second chance at US Navy’s frigate program	One of the bays of 'Building 34' at Fincantieri Marinette Marine. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The Navy’s search for a second Constellation-class frigate shipbuilder has officially commenced, and the top shipbuilders in industry have begun staking out their positions for what will likely be another high-profile competition. The service last month put out a call to industry to start determining which shipyards might be capable of building the Constellation-class frigate, the first batch of which were awarded to Wisconsin-based shipbuilder Fincantieri Marinette Marine in 2020. Since then, the service has engaged in private discussions with at least six shipbuilders, and a contract could come in fiscal 2027, USNI News reported. It was not immediately clear which companies began discussions with the service, and a Navy spokesman declined to make that information public when contacted by Breaking Defense this week. Government RFIs are not legally binding, meaning the Navy has the right to discontinue its search at any time, but that scenario is unlikely. Since the 2020 award to Fincantieri, lawmakers — particularly those who represent constituents that work in shipyards — have pressed service officials year after year to select a second shipyard. That pressure is compounded by a review of Navy shipbuilding programs earlier this year by Secretary Carlos Del Toro, which acknowledged the current frigate program is already facing steep delays — up to three years in the worst-case scenario. Breaking Defense reached out for comment from the four shipbuilders who, alongside Fincantieri, sought the first frigate contract, as well as one potential new entrant to the competition. At the top of that list are Austal USA, based in Mobile, Ala., and HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, located just down the road in Pascagoula, Miss. Both shipyards have long histories building surface combatants for the US Navy, and executives from those companies have previously been vocal in their interest in vying to be the second frigate builder. For Austal, the award would add to an already growing and increasingly busy portfolio. The shipyard has picked up numerous contracts, including work on submarines, in recent years and is in the middle of both expanding its facilities as well as its workforce. RELATED: In expansion, Austal USA undergoes &#8216;unique evolution' beyond a two-trick shipbuilder 'We are aware of and tracking the Navy’s plan for a second builder for the frigate and will continue to assess the opportunity as it develops,' said Larry Ryder, vice president at Austal USA for business development and external affairs. Kari Wilkinson, the chief at HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, told Breaking Defense earlier this year her yard has plenty of space for new work, but ramping up the labor force to meet a larger workload will be the challenge, an issue facing many of the country's shipbuilders right now. 'Ingalls is committed to supporting our customer in ways that align to our shared objectives. We are interested in the discussions surrounding the frigate program and will continue to follow the Navy’s acquisition strategy development,' Kimberly Aguillard, spokeswoman for HII’s Ingalls Shipbuilding, told Breaking Defense. RELATED: At Ingalls, plenty of space for shipbuilding but ramping up workforce will be the challenge Like its competition in the south, Maine-based shipbuilder General Dynamics Bath Iron Works has a long history building surface combatants — primarily Arleigh Burke-class destroyers — for the Navy. That yard was also a known bidder in the original competition to design and build Constellation class. A company spokesperson declined to comment for this story, citing the open competition. Lockheed Martin participated in early frigate design refinement contracts alongside Bath Iron Works, Austal, HII and Fincantieri. Its bid would have hinged on a partnership with Fincantieri — where the frigate would be constructed — and using a design derived from the Freedom-class Littoral Combat Ship, a separate Navy program also stemming from a Lockheed-Fincantieri partnership. Prior to the Navy making its final award, Lockheed opted out of the competition, citing a desire to focus its efforts elsewhere. 'Lockheed Martin will not compete for future FFG-62 construction but will support any prime shipyard as the system integrator of current or future US Navy capabilities,' a company spokesman told Breaking Defense this week. Rounding off this list is the Louisiana-based Bollinger Shipyards. That company did not compete for the original frigate contract, but was mentioned by Rear Adm. Kevin Smith, a Navy officer overseeing the program, last week as a potential second yard alongside the other shipbuilders contacted for this story. Bollinger is known for its work building US Coast Guard cutters as well as several Navy auxiliary ships. In 2022, its acquisition of Mississippi-based Halter Marine resulted in Bollinger taking ownership of the Polar Security Cutter program, a top Coast Guard priority to produce new American heavy icebreakers for the first time in decades. A spokesman for that shipyard did not respond to questions from Breaking Defense by press time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/state-of-play-industry-readying-for-second-chance-at-us-navys-frigate-program/	2024-12-20T09:57:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/Building-34-e1681842275366.jpeg
Pentagon’s cybersecurity mandate CMMC 2.0 likely to survive under Trump	cyber security, digital crime concept, data protection from hacker (Getty images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has repeatedly promised to slash government regulations once he comes into office in January, but there’s at least one Defense Department provision that industry figures, and one key Pentagon official, say is likely safe from the deregulation campaign: CMMC 2.0. CMMC 2.0, or the second iteration of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification, is a framework that essentially mandates that companies who do business with the Pentagon must themselves achieve a base level of cybersecurity, subject to external audit. 'CMMC was initially started under the first Trump administration,' Stacy Bostjanick, the chief of defense industrial base cybersecurity in the DoD's office of the chief information officer, said in November. 'We have made such progress, and so many people recognize the need for it. It endured, and we went through and did the proper rule making steps to make it, to memorialize it. I don't see it going anywhere.' Similarly Eric Crusius, a partner and CMMC compliance specialist at Holland&amp;King LLP, said, 'You'll probably see regulations melting away in other areas, such as environmental rules or labor.' But 'with respect to cyber security, I think we'll see a continuation of the policies that the Trump administration originally started because I think a priority for them is to protect our information from our adversaries, at least that's their stated priority, and this is consistent with that,' he told Breaking Defense. CMMC 1.0 was established in January of 2020 during Trump’s first term. Plans for an updated version, CMMC 2.0 were announced in December of 2023 under President Joe Biden and set new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information (CUI). CMMC 1.0 had a five-level scale for compliance, while CMMC 2.0 has a three-level scale. Additionally, a third-party assessment is being introduced depending on the level of CUI a contractor handles. Contractors at Level 1, who handle 'basic' protection of CUI and some contractors at Level 2 who handle 'general' CUI protection can undergo self-assessments to ensure they are CMMC compliant. The remaining contractors who classify as Level 2 and all Level 3 contractors have to undergo a third-party assessment. Earlier this week a final 'rule' for CMMC 2.0 went into effect, called the 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This rule gives the Pentagon the authority to establish and enforce cybersecurity requirements through the CMMC framework, essentially defining the CMMC 2.0 program itself. The next outstanding rule, 48 CFR, outlines how the CMMC 2.0 compliance will be integrated into DoD contracts, basically making the program a mandatory requirement. This rule will likely be released in the spring or summer of 2025, Bostjanick said. In summary, 32 CFR sets the standards and 48 CFR enforces those standards within contracts. (Bostjanick said that companies should not wait for the 48 CFR to come out to get their assessments completed.) In order to avoid a scramble to meet the new regulations with little notice, those requirements won't become mandatory until after a three-year phase-in period. Though some companies have expressed concern over the burden the cybersecurity regulations will put on them, Crusius said CMMC under Biden actually loosened a bit, paving a smoother road for a Trump administration to keep much of it in its current form. 'It was actually made a little bit more business friendly, I'd say, under the Biden administration,' said Cruisius, whose firm assists DoD contractors with being CMMC compliant. 'My sense is that based on the platform that the Trump administration ran on, is that this will continue to stay in place.' Similarly, Corey Bieber, a partner at K&amp;L Gates, told Breaking Defense that given the current climate of cyber threats, he doesn’t see a reason why the Trump administration would backtrack CMMC. 'This is meant to combat cyber security threats, but specifically advanced persistent threats, as mentioned in CMMC. I think that those threats are more real than ever and I don't imagine that the new administration is going to be backing off on investment in the Department of Defense in general when it comes to weapons,' he said. 'So why would they back off when it comes to protecting their cyber assets?' CEO of CyberSheath Eric Noonan, told Breaking Defense that the types of cyber related adversarial threats the US sees particularly from China is one reason Trump won’t diminish CMMC 2.0. 'It was actually President Trump's administration that came up with CMMC and recognized the fact that we are under attack, largely by countries like China, as you saw with the recent telecom attack. What we've been doing isn't working.' 'The Trump administration has a very strong track record of doing things to strengthen the supply chain, to strengthen cybersecurity, particularly when defending against the threat of China,' he later added. Not everyone is so sure that CMMC 2.0 is sticking around. Quentin Hodgson, formerly the Pentagon’s director of Cyber Plans, told Breaking Defense that given the fact that Republican administrations tend to scale back on regulations, CMMC 2.0 requirements could be reduced. 'It's possible that the new administration could decide to relook at that and say this is too high a burden or not the right way to approach improving cybersecurity standards in the defense industrial base,' Hodgson said of CMMC 2.0. 'I could see where there would be a relook at some of those things that were seen as maybe from a Republican or conservative point of view ... more heavy handed than it needed to be with respect to the private sector,' he added. Somewhere in the middle of these opinions lies Emily Harding, vice president of the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Harding told Breaking Defense that she doesn’t think that the concept of CMMC is 'perfect,' but it wouldn’t be the right call to get rid of the program entirely. 'You need something along the lines of a certification mechanism or an auditing mechanism. The general thought in the cyber security community is that you don't want a compliance checklist, because then people just study for the test. You get to the point where you can check all the boxes off the checklist, and then not beyond that,' she said. 'Is CMMC perfect? No, however, you wouldn't want to get rid of any kind of requirements at all, because I think that would have the opposite effect that you're going for. This is one of those sort of technical questions that I would expect the Trump administration won't tackle until they have people in place who actually understand it.' Trump’s transition team did not respond to Breaking Defense’s questions with regard to plans for CMMC.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagons-cybersecurity-mandate-cmmc-2-0-likely-to-survive-under-trump/	2024-12-20T08:24:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_cybersecurity_locks_GettyImages-1279388417-scaled-e1671476062691.jpg
As Air Force lays out Force Design, top strategist warns service is ‘underfunded’ to face China	U.S. and Allied aircraft conduct an elephant walk on Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, July 19, 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Michael Cossaboom) WASHINGTON — After sketching out a rough map of the world, Lt. Gen. David Harris, the Air Force officer charged with crafting his service's future concepts and strategies, started to illustrate the 'threat intensity' around the globe as he sees it — in this case, depicted as a line graph above the map. The line stayed low as it passed over the Western Hemisphere, but rose steadily as it moved east to reflect the military prowess of America’s adversaries, beginning its climb near Eastern Europe and the Middle East and peaking above China’s east coast — where officials worry US troops might be called up to defend Taiwan and repel a Chinese invasion. 'And then all of a sudden you get into where China is and Taiwan, and we see a spike, and it goes up,' Harris said in a recent interview at the Pentagon. In the past, the Air Force would design forces to 'find whatever the highest threat was' in order to 'cover every contingency known to man,' he said. But the range of threats today — especially the growing military power of China — requires new thinking. Ultimately, however, to make plans viable requires one thing above all else. 'Candidly,' Harris said, 'the Air Force is underfunded to do the things that we need to do.' Harris is not alone in raising concerns about resources the service requires to do its job, but his comments underline a challenge facing Air Force leaders. After helping to craft a new 'Force Design,' Harris has handed officials a framework for thinking differently about the service’s operations in light of new threats — one that must eventually map onto physical realities, like what kinds of aircraft could be employed and in what number. And that’s where the money comes in. Luckily for Harris and his colleagues, they may find congressional support, particularly under a new GOP majority. Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican and incoming chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, for example, recently championed 'a full-scale rebuilding of the shrinking US Air Force' including by 'supercharg[ing] production' of the B-21 Raider. It all means that the Trump administration's first budget request could end up being the defining factor for how the Air Force’s new Force Design is employed, including what capabilities can be brought to bear within it. A largely conceptual framework — the document itself has not been publicly declassified, though some of its key attributes have been shared in an unclassified summary [PDF] — the new Force Design sets out three different 'mission areas,' whose attributes differ based on the threat environment. Filling out those mission areas then requires devising a force structure, building out specifics like the number of fighter jets needed for a scenario. The mission area construct was created, in part, to be a better steward of taxpayer dollars, Harris said, while emphasizing that the Force Design largely eschews specific platforms. 'This is a design. I'm not talking about force structure. I'm not talking about like, ‘B-21s are the only thing that can survive in here.’ It could be something completely different,' he said. 'You can have multiple force structures being able to meet [mission areas] at different price points in time. There's no one force structure.' The first mission area, called Mission Area 1, features capabilities that can 'live within and generate combat power from the dense threat area which will be under constant attack,' according to the Air Force’s summary. Here, pointing to a scenario like a battle in the Taiwan Strait, Harris said that extremely exquisite or highly attritable platforms — think stealth fighters and drones, respectively — will tend to play a leading role. 'The Mission Area 1 forces and what can go into there, it's highly dependent on the attributes of it. And I would say survivability is the biggest piece of that,' he explained. 'You can see how dense of a threat that is. Obviously, we put things in there that are survivable. Or the opposite end of the spectrum, attritable. Don't care if they're lost.' Deputy chief of Staff for Air Force Futures Lt. Gen. David Harris takes part in a panel discussion at the Air and Space Forces Association’s Air, Space &amp; Cyber Conference, National Harbor, Md., Sept 17, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Andy Morataya) Mission Area 2 features capabilities with sufficient ranges to 'operate from the defendable area of relative sanctuary beyond the umbrella of most adversary ballistic and cruise missiles or attack UAVs and project fires into highly contested environments,' according to the summary. In Harris’s rough map of the world, a Mission Area 2 tasking could be required somewhere like the Middle East, or out past Taiwan’s coast into the Pacific. The third mission area covers the relatively lower threat environment that defines much of the globe, 'with position resilient to limited adversary attack,' according to the Force Design overview. This mission area 'covers your homeland defense piece of it. It covers a little bit of strategic deterrence from all the bombers and tankers and things that come out of CONUS [Continental United States] to be able to power project,' Harris said. Mission areas can also be adjusted based on emerging threats, according to Harris, like a flare-up in the Middle East or Europe, which each may present different 'force packaging options.' They’re also interrelated: Mission Area 1 taskings won’t win a war outright, but they will help halt the spread of a threat and roll it back, especially by staying connected to the broader joint force. That approach can then open up battlespace opportunities in the process, like creating a more permissive environment conducive to something like a Mission Area 2 tasking. 'So it's a phasing, it's an approach, but it's also a way of thinking about the core missions of our Air Force, and how they connect together through this mission area 1, 2 and 3 construct,' he said. But when it comes to actually building a force structure to fill in a mission area, that may require risk or more money. Harris is not alone in raising concerns about resources the service needs to do its job. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, for example, has repeatedly warned about spending limitations, recently musing that a planned next-gen tanker may not be affordable. Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin too has been vocal on the issue, saying in November, 'The force is stressed, and we're still doing our very damn best.' Air Force officials have talked for years about growing the force to meet modern threats, noted Doug Birkey, the executive director of the Mitchell Institute. Highlighting raging conflicts like Ukraine and a potential clash with China in the Indo-Pacific, 'the fundamental challenge is that you need air power and space power for everything. And the Department of the Air Force has been severely underfunded since the Cold War,' he said. Service leaders’ hands are tied by competing prioritizing like simultaneously recapitalizing the air- and -land-based legs of the nuclear triad. Funding constraints combined with technological considerations also appear to be driving a pause for the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, a platform viewed by many as critical for an Indo-Pacific fight — raising questions about what a force structure could look like in that scenario. 'I think what it does is it challenges the way that we would actually execute in a Mission Area 1, or a Mission Area 2 or a Mission Area 3. I'm not just going to put it in one bin,' Harris said during a recent forum hosted by the Mitchell Institute, when asked about the impact if NGAD doesn’t come to fruition. 'There's probably multiple force structures, some of them may not include NGAD. But I'll tell you, it's less about the platform and more about the systems and how they're coming together, and how you actually replicate the effect of what that system would have.' The funding issue looms for the fiscal 2026 budget, now in the hands of the forthcoming Trump administration. Pentagon toplines the past two years have been held down by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, and some in Washington are weary that spending cuts could be in the cards if Elon Musk’s and Vivek Ramaswamy’s 'Department of Government Efficiency' gets its way. 'The DoD quiver is pretty thin, and it’s time to reset in core areas,' Birkey said. Programs like the Sentinel ICBM, Columbia-class submarines and B-21 Raider stealth bomber 'are the real answer, and they’re not cheap.' Speaking during a virtual event hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies Dec. 10, Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter made a blunt assessment of the current fiscal environment, warning of the consequences if it continues. '[I]f the Fiscal Responsibility Act shapes the resource posture of the nation, we will not be able to fulfill the National Defense Strategy,' he said. Asked about funding considerations, Harris emphasized the Air Force needs more resources specifically for a high-intensity scenario like a Taiwan Strait fight. Fielding new forces and maintaining existing ones also requires sustainment dollars, with Harris pointing to upkeep of Mission Area 3. The 'primary driver' of Air Force funding constraints, Harris said, is 'the new capabilities that we need to get. But there's also funding that's needed to sustain the current capabilities within Mission Area 3.' More broadly, Harris framed the funding needs as driven by modernization, as well as ensuring capabilities are properly supported. 'If I had to categorize it, modernization costs are something that we still need,' Harris said. 'And there's even some readiness pieces in here that allow me to have the right supply and support. All of that still needs to come together.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/as-air-force-lays-out-new-force-design-top-strategist-warns-service-is-underfunded-to-face-china/	2024-12-20T07:10:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/Mobility-Guardian-2023-scaled-e1691087628535.jpg
V-22s cleared to fly following operational pause, with restrictions on newest parts of the fleet	An MV-22B Osprey, assigned to the Blue Knights, of Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 365, takes of from the flight deck of the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 5). (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Alan L. Robertson) WASHINGTON — Naval Air Systems Command today is clearing the V-22 Osprey fleets to continue operations following a pause put in place earlier this month, albeit with some restrictions on how the newest parts of the fleet can operate. NAVAIR, the Navy's primary agency for procuring aircraft as well as determining their airworthiness, said in a statement that it has issued a fleet bulletin directing that V-22 Ospreys be inspected prior to their next flight to 'verify flight hours on each Proprotor Gearbox (PRGB).' 'Aircraft with PRGBs that currently meets or exceeds a predetermined flight-hour threshold will resume flights in accordance with controls instituted in the March 2024 interim flight clearance (IFC),' according to the statement. 'A new IFC, containing additional risk mitigation controls, has been issued to address aircraft with PRGBs below the flight-hour threshold. These controls will remain in place until the aircraft’s PRGBs are upgraded, or the predetermined threshold is exceeded,' the statement continued. NAVAIR oversees the V-22 Joint Program Office which delivers Osprey variants to the US Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps as well as international customers. The agency declined to publish details concerning the flight-hour threshold, number of aircraft affected or additional controls, citing operational security concerns. However, a source with knowledge of the program said that the issue stems from 'inclusions' in the metal of the gearbox, common small faults that inevitably occur during the metallurgy of producing the parts for both commercial and military vehicles. The NAVAIR analysis found that these inclusions led to cracks in previous V-22 incidents — but that if the cracks don't occur early in the part's lifespan, the inclusions won't present problems down the road. In other words, if the part is going to fail, it will fail early in the lifespan of the V-22. As a result, newer V-22s will be operating under safety guidance until they hit a certain number of hours, the source said, at which point they will be able to fly normal operations. Those restrictions are built around how much time it takes to get a V-22 onto the ground safely, the source said, noting it largely means crews need to plan out their flight path and be aware of their altitude during operations in case they need to make an emergency landing, the source said. Those requirements likely won't impact operations over land but are likely to have greater impacts during sea-based operations. 'NAVAIR remains committed to transparency and safety regarding all V-22 operations. The V-22 plays an integral role in supporting our nation’s defense. Returning these vital assets to flight is critical to supporting our nation’s interests,' the statement said. The Pentagon opted to pause certain V-22 operations earlier this month following what it called a 'precautionary landing' by an Air Force Osprey, which did not result in any injuries. That incident, and now this subsequent return to flight, is the latest in a string of incidents the Osprey fleet has faced in recent years as the Defense Department has grappled with a variety of technical issues. A fatal MV-22 Osprey crash that killed five Marines in June 2022 was blamed on the gearbox, with the department working with industry to design and field a new 'proprotor gearbox input quill assembly that mitigates the unintentional clutch disengagements and hard clutch engagement events,' according to a 2023 statement. All three services were then directed to replace the gearbox input quill assemblies after an undisclosed 'predetermined flight hour threshold,' which the service at the time said 'reduces the likelihood of a hard clutch engagement occurring by 99 percent, based on the data.' Since that June 2022 incident, the Osprey has been on a roller coaster of restrictions, shutdowns and returns to flight. In August 2022, Breaking Defense first reported that the Air Force was grounding its CV-22 fleet over safety concerns with the clutch of the aircraft. At the time, the Marine Corps did not follow suit, instead insisting their pilots could compensate for the issue and had been doing so for some time. While the Air Force returned to flight weeks later, the issue re-emerged and a Pentagon-wide grounding across a 'subset' of the Navy, Air Force and Marine V-22 models was instituted in February 2023. That was followed by a November 2023 crash off the coast of Japan that killed 8 airmen, with the Osprey only returning to operations months later, albeit with restrictions on how far it can fly from a safe landing spot.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/v-22s-cleared-to-fly-following-operational-pause-with-restrictions-on-newest-parts-of-the-the-fleet/	2024-12-20T05:44:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/5173378-scaled-e1723489932887.jpg
Hanwha closes $100M deal to take over Philly Shipyard	A petroleum tanker stands while being built at the Aker Philadelphia Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Tuesday, June 19, 2012. (Photographer: Bradley C. Bower/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — South Korean conglomerate Hanwha today announced it had closed its $100 million deal to take a controlling stake of Philly Shipyard, capping off one of the company’s most aggressive moves this year to solidify its foot in the American defense industrial base. 'Hanwha Philly Shipyard begins an exciting new chapter today,' said David Kim, the newly appointed CEO of what is now called Hanwha Philly Shipyard. 'We plan to grow and build on a long tradition of success, by expanding production using advanced technologies, and supporting the national revitalization of U.S. shipyards. 'Together, we begin working toward our vision for Hanwha Philly Shipyard: to be a trusted U.S. shipbuilder, challenging and redefining sustainable maritime solutions for commercial and government clients. We intend to do that by pushing the boundaries of shipbuilding by combining people with technology to build best-in-class vessels.' RELATED: Hanwha adds Coulter as global defense head Hanwha made its initial offer to purchase Philly Shipyard, which until now was owned by the Norwegian industrial investment group Aker, in June. The shipyard, based in the eponymous city was once the site of a US Navy facility and has focused on producing container vessels and tankers under Aker’s ownership. In addition to acquiring Philly Shipyard, Hanwha this year also named Mike Smith to lead its American business unit, announced its first win of a repair contract for a US Navy ship and pursued, but ultimately dropped, a takeover bid submitted to Australian shipbuilder Austal, whose American subsidiary is a key contractor for the Pentagon. In the background of it all has been outgoing Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro, who has made encouraging foreign investment into American shipyards a key element of his 'Maritime Statecraft' initiative, as reported in this deep dive Breaking Defense report. He visited Hanwha and other Asian defense industrial giants early in the year and has publicly lobbied them to bring their money, technology and talents to benefit the US Navy. Those efforts have not always been welcomed by American industry.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hanwha-closes-100m-deal-to-take-over-philly-shipyard/	2024-12-19T17:11:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/GettyImages-146565286-scaled-e1718904824503.jpg
Incoming SASC head lays out acquisition reform vision	Sen. Roger Wicker (R-MS) speaks to the press on January 11, 2024 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) WASHINGTON— Move over, DOGE. The incoming head of the Senate Armed Services Committee has his own thoughts about how to boost Pentagon efficiency and speed up the pace it takes to field new weapons. Sen. Roger Wicker, R_Miss., today released a report outlining key reforms the Defense Department and Congresscould make to improve the acquisition process, as well as corresponding legislation called the Fostering Reform and Government Efficiency in Defense (FORGED) Act that lays out language to implement those changes. The report and accompanying bill comes as Congress races to pass an extension of government funding before it adjourns for 2024. But while business on the Hill gets ready to wind down, Wicker’s report and legislation hints at the priorities the incoming SASC chairman could focus on in next year’s National Defense Authorization Act, as well as potentially helping to set the defense agenda before President Donald Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20. 'The Department of Defense has been doing business the same way for far too long, which has heavily damaged both taxpayer confidence and American national security. We are entering a moment where major reform is possible. My legislation offers an opportunity to maximize the use of public dollars to buy second-to-none weapons systems, adopt new technology faster, and boost competition within the defense industry. I have started a national conversation about making a generational investment. Now we need to discuss how we can spend smarter,' Wicker said in a news release. The report proposes a five-part plan for making acquisition more efficient: cutting red tape, unleashing innovation, increasing competition, enabling decisive action, and modernizing the budget process. Each of those areas contain several recommendations for policy and legislative changes needed to make the weapons buying process smoother and less bureaucratic. For instance, to decrease red tape, the report suggests paring back provisions from Title 10 that could be overly restrictive. One such example is Section 3070, which limits the amount of on-hand supplies inventory to no more than two years, a recommendation that the report states may no longer make sense given the longer lead times that have become more common. It also suggests implementing additional recommendations from the Section 809 Panel, with the report noting that only three out of 98 recommendations were actually put into action. Under increasing innovation, the report recommends providing additional authorities for Software Acquisition and Middle-Tier of Acquisition, which it says should become the default acquisition method for all programs. It also endorses getting rid of the paperwork-heavy 'Milestone A' designation and replacing it with a 'buy-before-build' process that allows for experimentation. To increase competition, the report suggests reducing barriers to having multiple sources and streamlining the parts qualification process. It also recommends turning the services’ 'program acquisition officers' into 'portfolio acquisition executives,' which oversee a group of capabilities and are able to make tradeoffs among schedule, funding, and requirements. Finally, the report recommends a wholesale restructure of the budget, consolidating induvial line items for programs into ones made for an entire portfolio, and making legislative changes that would allow the Pentagon to better mitigate continuing resolutions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/incoming-sasc-head-lays-out-acquisition-reform-vision/	2024-12-19T14:51:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240529_wicker_speech_GettyImages-1918185840-scaled-e1716998965360.jpg
‘Not a warfighter’: Air Force secretary hits back at Musk comments on canceling manned fighters	Airmen assigned to the Wisconsin Air National Guard's 115th Fighter Wing complete post-flight inspections on U.S. Air Force F-35A Lightning II aircraft Aug. 13, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Airman 1st Class Josh Kaeser) WASHINGTON — As his tenure overseeing the Air Force comes to an end, Secretary Frank Kendall today offered a word of advice for the incoming Trump administration: the F-35 is here to stay, and now is not the time to talk about replacing manned fighter jets with drones. The Air Force’s in-development uncrewed wingmen, dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, have made significant progress, Kendall emphasized during a virtual discussion hosted by the Mitchell Institute. But asked directly about criticism tech billionaire Elon Musk has levied at officials for continuing to buy manned fighter jets instead of drones, the outgoing secretary suggested the world’s richest man needs to stay in his lane. 'I have a lot of respect for Elon Musk as an engineer. He's not a warfighter, and he needs to learn a little bit more about the business, I think, before he makes such grand announcements as he did,' Kendall said. 'It's provocative, it's interesting. I can imagine at some point — I don't think it's centuries, by the way, I think it's more like decades — when something like he imagines can occur. But we're not there, and it's going to be a little while before we get there.' Musk, who is set to co-lead a 'Department of Government Efficiency' (DOGE) commission that could push for defense spending cuts, has taken aim at the F-35 in particular, calling officials 'idiots' for continuing to build it. Vivek Ramaswamy, the DOGE’s other leader, has echoed Musk’s fighter jet criticisms, arguing to shift funds into other initiatives like hypersonics. And the two businessmen have already demonstrated considerable influence over congressional Republicans even before the Trump administration has taken over, spearheading a successful charge this week to torpedo a bipartisan stopgap spending deal. In contrast, Kendall argued today that canceling the F-35 would be a fool’s errand. There’s no alternative in the near-term, the secretary emphasized, which would leave the West without an in-production stealth fighter. And even if the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter proceeds, it’ll be several years before the platform is operational, and will likely only be available in smaller quantities due to its cost. 'I don’t see F-35 being replaced,' Kendall said. 'We should continue to buy it, and we also should continue to upgrade it.' Plagued by issues from its inception, the F-35 certainly has plenty of fodder for the likes of Musk. Its problems continue: After a year-long halt of deliveries, prime contractor Lockheed Martin can now deliver upgraded versions of the jet, but those won’t be combat capable until next year at the earliest. Although largely a defender of the F-35, Kendall has also been a staunch critic of the jet’s problems after a long history with the program, particularly as the Pentagon’s former top acquisition official under the Obama administration. And according to Kendall, there’s still plenty of room for improvement. 'We need better performance out of Lockheed, quite honestly. They’re not delivering what they have been promising, and they're not doing it as fast as they could by a wide margin,' he said. 'We are committed to delivering the world’s most advanced aircraft — the F-35 — and its unrivaled capabilities with the government and our industry partners,' Lockheed said in a statement. 'As part of that, we are investing over $350 million in our company’s enterprise engineering developmental systems integration test capabilities, which will generate capacity and efficiency within the F-35 program as we continue to build the quarterback of the fighter force.' Still, Kendall said 'I don't think we're ready to do that yet,' and that F-35s should be added to the Air Force’s inventory at an 'affordable rate.' Many defense officials have made similar comments to Kendall, though others have been warm to Musk’s criticisms. Air Force Brig. Gen. Douglas Wickert, commander of the 412th Test Wing at Edwards Air Force Base, told reporters recently that fully roboticized warfare is likely 'centuries away,' stressing that important ethical considerations also need to be worked out when introducing lethal autonomy. 'I don't think it's like, believable to say you can cancel the F-35 and wait three years for the next capability,' Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf told Breaking Defense in an interview earlier this month. Remarking that there are several 'pretty questionable' capabilities the US spends money on, Schimpf said he 'probably wouldn’t' start with the F-35 but would encourage 'revisit[ing]' other programs to ensure that the 'right decisions' are being made. But Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat and ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, was more open to drones taking on a greater role. '[T]he Pentagon is stuck in saying, no, we want tanks, we want big ships, and we want, you know, jet fighters. Swarms of drones can be vastly more effective. And if Elon is willing to push that envelope and force that sort of change, I think that can make sense,' Smith said. 'Look at Ukraine,' he continued. 'If Russia could have achieved air dominance in Ukraine, they would have. They couldn't and they had a substantial advantage there. So I think thinking about that future from outside the box would be appropriate.' A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) After pausing the NGAD program earlier this year to conduct more analysis on the platform, Kendall appeared to confirm today that analysis is largely complete — though a decision about its fate still rests with the next administration. 'So we've taken a hard look at that,' he said of NGAD, adding 'we generally finished the analysis on that.' Kendall reasoned that with an election coming amidst the service’s analysis, 'I don't want to make a decision that's going to be disrupted and reversed, potentially by the new team,' which may take a different view of NGAD as well as how other factors like CCA could play a role. The secretary highlighted that although analysis is 'mostly done,' new Air Force leadership 'may want some additional analysis when they show up. But I want them to own this decision, and I don't want us to start industry down a specific course and then have to abruptly reverse that few months from now.' A decision on NGAD will be needed soon since it will be a prominent part of the service’s fiscal 2025 and 2026 budgets, Kendall said, though he noted that 'we're very close to being ready to proceed if that program continues its current form.'

New Space Force ‘International Partnership Strategy’ coming next year	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman hosts an office call to officially welcome UK Air Vice Marshal Paul Godfrey to the Space Force staff in the Pentagon, Arlington, Va., June 18, 2024. Godfrey, recently promoted to Air Marshall, is the former commander of UK Space Command and the first foreign officer to join the US Space Force command staff. (US Air Force photo by Andy Morataya) WASHINGTON — The Space Force is working on a new strategy for working with allied and partner nations to integrate their capabilities into US plans for future warfighting, starting from early concept development of needed capabilities and running through wargames and exercises, according to the project's leader. 'I am leading the charge for an International partnership strategy that hopefully will be out on the streets at some point in the next year,' Air Marshal Paul Godfrey, the British officer who serves as assistant to Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman and is responsible for future concepts and partnerships, said on Wednesday. Saltzman in July appointed Godfrey, the outgoing head of UK Space Command to the position, marking the first time a foreign officer has been assigned to such a high position within a US service. Further, Godfrey told the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) that his remit includes ensuring that there are clear 'touch points' for allies and partners to interact with the nascent Space Force Futures Command. Speaking with reporters on Dec. 11 at the Space Force Association's Spacepower Conference in Orlando, Godfrey explained that the goal is to allow allies and partners to have a hand in 'shaping' thinking at Futures Command from 'the beginning' about everything 'from the good ideas to all through the end' of the process, 'where hopefully you get an integrated-by-design architecture for operations, training, exercising and capability.' The goal is to ensure that by the 2035 timeframe, there will be budget alignment between the US and its close partners that works to fill gaps in their combined space capabilities, he said. Thus, Godfrey noted he is working closely with the service's task force for setting up the new command, being overseen by Lt. Gen. Shawn Bratton, Space Force deputy chief of space operations, strategy, plans, programs and requirements. Futures Command will expand upon the work previously done by the Space Warfighting Analysis Center (SWAC) by looking holistically at future requirements for 'the objective force' — the desired architecture of the Space Force including personnel, kit and operational concepts, Saltzman told CSIS in his fireside chat during the Wednesday event celebrating the service's fifth birthday. This includes taking into account things like 'the training infrastructure, the operators, the manpower requirements,' he said. 'So, what we're doing with futures is establishing all of those processes so that by the time you define the objective force, it's all the things the service needs to invest in in order to make sure we have capabilities on the other side,' Salzman elaborated. 'I really hope to establish a command element, a headquarters with a commander, early next year, and &#8230; I told them I was going to task them by the summer — so, [to do] whatever it takes to get up and running so you can start accepting taskings by next summer,' he added. 'Allied by design' has been one of the Space Force's mantras over the past year for its acquisition plans, with service leaders reviewing everything from classification protocols and data sharing processes to open up space system development collaboration with allied and partner governments, as well as industries. Those efforts, however, have been somewhat slow to bear fruit, with classification remaining a key obstacle.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/new-space-force-international-partnership-strategy-coming-next-year/	2024-12-19T11:34:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/Air-Marshall-Paul-Godfrey-and-CSO-Chance-Saltzman-July-12-2024-e1720800175212.jpeg
Germany flexes submarine muscle with additional 4 boat order	Concept art of the German-Norwegian 212CD submarine (TKMS) BELFAST — Germany has opted to substantially boost its subsurface capabilities by tripling an order for new ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) 212CD (Common Design) submarines as part of an existing joint procurement with Norway. A contract to acquire four of the conventionally powered, diesel electric boats on top of two units already on order was signed off by Germany's procurement office today. The wider effort could also see Norway committing to an additional two vessel order, according to the office. The two European nations first linked arms on the joint acquisition in 2021, amounting to six subs in all, and valued at approximately €5.5 billion ($5.7 billion). The German parliament approved the increased 212CD buy on Wednesday, alongside a raft of other new defense spending commitments amounting to €21 billion. These include kickstarting procurement of Class 127 frigates, reactive armor for Puma Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs) and additional Patriot missiles, as well as acquisition of Israel's Elbit Systems’ Precise and Universal Launching System (PULS) rocket artillery, according to an online statement from the Federal Ministry of Defence (BMvG). TKMS welcomed the decision by Berlin to order additional vessels, and noted it is 'receiving with this comprehensive order expansion in the current 212CD program one of the largest orders in the recent history of the company,' according to a company statement. It also said that the 'ongoing production of the existing 212CD submarines for Germany and Norway is on schedule.' TKMS is set to deliver the first German vessel in 2032 and the Norwegian Navy is expected to receive its first boat in 2029. To expand production capacity, TKMS has already invested more than €250 million in its Kiel facility. The company also said of the new order that it 'will involve advance payments that will have a positive impact on cash flow in the current financial year and will be used accordingly for the milestones of the order.' TKMS CEO Oliver Burkhard added, 'With the expansion of the 212CD order, other countries could join this project in the near future.' According to German Armed Forces literature, the new class of sub is 'designed to process an enormous amount of sensor data, which gives the crew new options for the compilation of situation pictures while enhancing the ability to network with allied units.' It also notes that the acoustic signature of the sub 'has been significantly reduced by comparison [to the 212A Class] and is designed to prevent discovery by potential adversaries in spite of the improvements in detection procedures.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/germany-flexes-submarine-muscle-with-additional-4-boat-order/	2024-12-19T10:29:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Type-212CD-Submarine-thyssenkrupp-Marine-Systems-scaled-e1734630736502.jpg
White House charges Pentagon to develop cislunar monitoring tech, including for ‘planetary defense’	Cislunar space is the region beyond Earth's orbit all the way out to the Moon. (Image: NASA) WASHINGTON — While a new White House action plan for forwarding cislunar science and technology leans largely on NASA to lead the charge, it also taps the Defense Department to spearhead development of capabilities to keep watch on activity in the vast area of space between the Earth and Moon. DoD, with the assistance of NASA and the Commerce Department, are tasked to 'identify and prioritize research and development needed to support extension of U.S. SSA [space situational awareness] capabilities into Cislunar space, to include aiding planetary defense, improved debris population modeling, and detection, tracking, and characterization of satellites in the Cislunar volume,' according to the National Cislunar Science and Technology Action Plan [PDF]. This includes taking the lead in the development of new, and/or improvement of current, ground- and space-based sensors for monitoring the cislunar region. In particular, the plan notes that the Pentagon should assess the value of putting new satellites in 'novel orbits' to monitor satellites and space debris near the Moon. Senior leaders of US Space Command and the Space Force have long said that while not an immediate priority, the service sees future military activity in cislunar space as inevitable as commercial opportunities for exploiting the Moon and its environs become more feasible due to the march of technology. Indeed, the Space Force already has committed small amounts of early research funds to exploring how to monitoring satellites at the semi-stable Lagrange points between the Earth and the Moon. DoD further is to spearhead efforts to 'evaluate the efforts and technology gaps of commercial and international contributors' to cislunar SSA, as well as 'identify and prioritize technology in support of the ground network and infrastructure, including processing, data management and exchange, and personnel needed to support and sustain' future cislunar SSA capabilities. The White House S&amp;T plan, along with a new policy on the establishment of 'lunar reference systems' [PDF] was announced by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy on Tuesday. Both are 'actions to advance the goals' outlined in the November 2022 National Cislunar Science and Technology Strategy. Lunar reference systems essentially are the models and tools needed to map the Moon's surface and other geological parameters and create a time standard since time runs differently on the Moon due to the laws of physics — baseline science that enables positioning, navigation and timing (PNT) just as on the Earth. The policy creates an interagency task force, let by NASA and including DoD, to undertake the job. Similarly, the Biden administration in April issued a policy and empowered a NASA-led task force 'to establish time standards at and around celestial bodies other than Earth.' Within the national defense community, it is the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency that is responsible for such activities. NGA on Tuesday announced the release of a new World Magnetic Model, 'which is critical for keeping GPS accurate due to shifts in the earth’s magnetic field.' The White House plan stresses that the goal of US cislunar policies and activities are aimed at developing the 'infrastructure that will be necessary to sustain a global presence' — in line with the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that prohibits any one nation from claiming territory in space or on the surface of celestial bodies. 'The United States is committed to the safe, transparent, and sustainable exploration and use of Cislunar space for peaceful purposes,' the plan states, noting that the plan itself 'should be updated periodically to incorporate changing priorities, the perspectives of our international partners, and to remain aligned with the expanding pace of Cislunar development undertaken by all space faring nations and entities.' However, the stability of that US commitment may be in question with the incoming Trump administration. For example, former Trump White House liaison to NASA Greg Autrey and former Republican congressman Robert Walker in August penned an op-ed in Space News that suggested abandonment of the Outer Space Treaty, considered the magna carta of space and signed by 137 of the 193 UN member states.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/white-house-charges-pentagon-to-develop-cislunar-monitoring-tech-including-for-planetary-defense/	2024-12-19T09:51:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/441_420_MoonRotationSVSthumb.png
Preparing the industrial base for when the Army’s FLRAA tiltrotor is built at scale	Bell's V-280 Valor is the US Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft. (Bell) With the Future Long Range Attack Aircraft (FLRAA), the Army is introducing a new developmental aircraft type for the first time in decades. That creates myriad challenges for not only the prime contractor but for individual supply chains associated with the aircraft, the powerplants, and the digital backbone. Breaking Defense discussed the role of the industrial base in Future Vertical Lift with FLRAA Project Manager Col. Jeffrey Poquette. Breaking Defense: Before we get into the industrial base discussion, where does the FLRAA program stand at this moment in time? Jeffrey Poquette: FLRAA had its Milestone B decision back in the summer, which kicked off a lengthy phase in the acquisition program called EMD, Engineering and Manufacturing Development. Over the next year we're focused on getting to the critical design of the aircraft – all the exact things that Bell will use to produce the aircraft prototypes that we’ll then use for tests. All of that will inform a Milestone C decision in 2028, which is to make a decision on production of actual fieldable aircraft. What are the supply chain and logistical challenges of introducing a new aircraft type like a VTOL? The last developmental rotorcraft [in the Army was] about 40 or so years ago. So, yes, there are challenges and at the forefront are the industrial base and supply chain risk. This was highlighted during COVID, how fragile the supply chains are – everything from cars to electronics. On the defense side, we've seen it with ammunition and now with aircraft, which is a very complex weapon system with a lot of components. I wouldn't say that there are unique challenges particular to a tiltrotor. A tiltrotor is a kind of rotorcraft, a helicopter is a kind of rotorcraft, and both of them have complex supply chains that we have to manage carefully. Ensuring a resilient supply chain has been at the forefront of this program for many years now. We've stood up a supply chain risk management team that looks at everything from the raw materials, to finished products and subcomponents [at] the lowest level in the supply chain. As we work with industry to ensure we have that resilient supply chain, one of the ways that we control that is through something called a ‘consent to subcontract’, which is relatively new. [For example,] when Bell wants to subcontract with a supplier, they have to prove out a number of things, and one is supply chain resilience and risk level. My team then assesses it and before I sign off on that consent, we take a look at supply chain risk management. All programs have supply chain risks, and we've learned from that over the years and leaned forward early in the program to ensure that we have the mechanisms in place to carefully and appropriately manage a supply chain together with our industry partners. Army Col Jeffrey Poquette is the Army's FLRAA program manager. What are some of the key capabilities that you're looking for in this consent-to-subcontract process? What does industry need to show you? Hypothetically, if there was a material that was a particularly rare resource or difficult to obtain, we would manage that carefully, ensuring that there's multiple sources of supply. We also do Manufacturing Readiness Assessments, or MRAs, which we've done since before our Preliminary Design Review. When we look to industry's role, they know their supply chain best. Typically, the Department of Defense has always been reliant on industry to provide that information. When I go out to industry engagements and meet with suppliers, one of the first things I ask them, besides the ability to protect the program, is how is their supply chain, how have they been weathering the supply chain challenges of COVID? Have they recovered from that? What have they done to multiple source their own suppliers, tiers 3 and 4 down into the supply chain? Do they have risky raw materials that they need to source from overseas, that maybe the United States doesn't have a large access to? We take a hard look at that, and then when appropriate, we suggest to Bell that if we see a particularly risky supply chain then perhaps we don't provide the consent to subcontract until they remedy or mitigate that risk. How are you working now to prepare the industrial base for the long-term production of FLRAA? What is its role over the next few years in the run up to LRIP? There's two kinds of groups of companies right now when it comes to FLRAA. [The first is] the group that's already part of Team FLRAA, the ones that Bell has selected and that the government has approved to be a part of FLRAA. The [others] are the ones who want to become part of the FLRAA ecosystem. How do they do that, what should they be getting after? Those are the questions they ask me. One of the ways that people will be able to become part of FLRAA relatively easily should they provide a great product that's competitive in price and brings great capability, is [through] our Modular Open Systems Approach. In the past, we relied heavily on OEMs to integrate new capabilities; we would have to always go back to the OEM or the aircraft provider. What our Modular Open Systems Approach does is foster innovation, competition, price competition, and it allows us to focus on what matters. As a PM, I do not want to be spending a lot of money to integrate a great capability. I want to spend money on the great capability itself. I want the juices flowing out there in industry, and for the industrial base to be competing on the things that will matter to us. I'll give you some broad categories of technologies that we look to [such as] things that reduce weight, or have lower power requirements. The lighter you can get the aircraft, the more performance you get out of it. Dual-purpose technology that might do two things rather than one unique thing is very important to us. Being able to collapse capability into a chassis and have card-based solutions, so rather than eight boxes each doing a different thing, we have one box with eight cards that can provide the capability. That speaks to SWaP. Aviation survivability is always something we're interested in. That's all enabled by our digital backbone, which are the physical components of the aircraft that allow other capabilities to integrate into. What we want to do is open the door for innovation. Industry should know that once they get on the platform they're not locked in, because that same competitive spirit and the MOSA aspect of the aircraft will allow us to move on from them, maybe three or four years later when something better comes along. How do you balance the use of new developmental technologies on FLRAA versus mature technologies with high TRL? One of the approaches with FLRAA was to focus on the aircraft itself. You may have heard me say, ‘twice as far, twice as fast’. That's new technology we're trying to mature, and then we want to mature MOSA. But everything else right now in this early iteration of FLRAA will be high-maturity mission systems that you see today on the Apache, the Black Hawk, and the Chinook. It's an iterative approach. In the past, new aircraft tried to be everything all at once to everyone, and had a lot of new technology on the aircraft. What that does is inject risk into the program, and the potential for delays and expense. By focusing on the aircraft and MOSA, we give ourselves an opportunity to succeed with less risk, and then look to the future to take advantage of MOSA and those technology categories I've mentioned. A model of the Rolls-Royce AE1107 engine on the Sea Air Space 2023 show floor. The engine is the powerplant for the MV-22, CV-22 and CMV-22 Osprey variants, as well as the engine for the Army's V-280 FLRAA tiltrotor that attained Milestone B earlier this year. (Aaron Mehta / Breaking Defense) There’s also going to be an engine supply chain to build the Rolls-Royce powerplant. What are the specific industrial base challenges associated with the engine? One of the benefits of FLRAA is that because it's a contractor-furnished powerplant, Bell has chosen an engine that exists already. There will be changes. The 1107F is the engine being developed for FLRAA, but there is a family of 1107 engines out there. The Charlie is on the V-22, and there's a version on C-130 and other aircraft. The good news is it's a mature supply chain, and although there will be changes it's not like we're developing a new engine for this aircraft. You might remember, the FARA program was developing a new engine. The Improved Turbine Engine was being developed in parallel with the aircraft. In this case, we have a mature supply chain when it comes to the powerplant. The FLRAA digital backbone is also a key element of the program. Tell us about that industrial base? The digital backbone is a combination of hardware and software, and forms a subsystem that's integrated into the aircraft that enables the networking across the aircraft. I call it the nervous system of the aircraft that allows the relay of information. A lot of the components of that are not specialized. They're switches and routers and things that move information across cables. It’s not a unique supply chain, or particularly specialized. It’s really in the software – the software that they developed to enable the relay of information so that the flight-critical data gets priority. In the past, everything was point-to-point. Things that were critical had a box and a wire that took up size, weight, and power. If you can do all that relay of information on a single network, in this case the digital backbone, you get after that SWaP issue and don't have all these computers on board. In my estimation, it's the software that's the special sauce, so to speak, in the digital backbone. The Army wants more control over the intellectual property to prevent vendor lock and to modernize capabilities over time. What systems on FLRAA do you expect to have greater IP control over? During the competition, we were very deliberate in the development of our IP strategy. Historically, one of two things happens. We never know exactly what we need and when we're going to need it. We would ask for too little, not have what we need 10 years down the road, [and] realize we don't have access to that IP. Then you’ve got to get it, which may be difficult, expensive, or even impossible. The other end of the spectrum is you don't know what you need, but you don't want to take the risk of not having it. So you ask for it all, but end up getting a lot of stuff you don't need that you pay for. How do you get that minimum amount to do exactly what you need to do? IP for the Army is focused around logistics functions like training, maintaining, sustaining. The Army is very focused on field-type maintenance, and even at the depot level we do a lot. We have the heritage of wanting to be able to do that without reliance on contractor support, especially where the Army operates deep in areas that are considered hazardous. Unlike Afghanistan and Iraq where we had relative sanctuary on bases throughout those countries and it was easy to bring contractors in there, it may not be easy to do in the future. We’ve got to be able to maintain it and sustain it. So how did we do that? Rather than ask for specific IP, we presented to the contractor what it is we wanted to do. We did that in hundreds of use cases. We need to be able to develop training materials and manuals, we need to be able to change them when it's time to change them. We need to be able to instruct and train on how to do maintenance. We know what we want to do, we just don't know what we need to do it. Who better to know what we need than the contractors themselves, whether it's Bell or the OEM of particular components? What we did was incentivize the contractors during competition to provide the most that they could in order to meet those use cases. Once we had a winner in the competition, we signed Bell up to provide all that intellectual property. You asked about controlling the IP. We're more interested in access to the IP that we need so that we can do the things we need to do. That's a key takeaway. Because of that, we've been designated [as a] Department of Defense IP Pathfinder. Broadly, industry agrees that they want the Army to have what we need in order to execute the use cases. But the specifics of that takes a lot of hard work, and we [recently] spent a week with our industrial base talking through that, getting to the right words and agreements where they can feel comfortable that what they provide us to do those things we need to do will not put them at a competitive disadvantage in the future. Our strategy does just that. We've gotten a lot of support from our higher headquarters at ASA (ALT) in the Pentagon. I, my deputy, and my logistics division chief spend a lot of time talking about this very subject, and trying to propagate the approach, which I think is novel and effective in getting access to the appropriate amount of IP while still protecting the creators of that IP.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/preparing-the-industrial-base-for-when-the-armys-flraa-tiltrotor-is-built-at-scale/	2024-12-19T09:01:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221205_bell_valor_FLARA.png
Spain’s Navantia reaches rescue deal for struggling UK shipyard Harland & Wolff	The UK Royal Navy's RFA Fort Victoria will be replaced by a fleet of three Future Solid Support (FFS) ships (UK MoD) BELFAST — The British arm of Spanish state-owned shipbuilder Navantia will acquire the UK shipyard Harland &amp; Wolff in a rescue deal that Navantia says will relieve the struggling yard from administration and protect the UK Royal Navy’s £1.6 billion ($2 billion) Fleet Solid Support (FFS) contract. The two shipbuilders have been in talks since October, but a breakthrough was made today, with a deal 'expected to be completed in January 2025,' according to Navantia UK. Under terms of the buyout the firm will acquire all four of Harland &amp; Wolff’s yards. Best known for building the Titanic, the ailing shipbuilder operates two yards in Scotland (Arnish and Methil), one in England (Appledore) and one in Northern Ireland (Belfast). 'The FSS ships are important for safeguarding the UK’s aircraft carriers’ military capability by delivering vital supplies to the Carrier Strike Group, and this deal will ensure the UK’s shipbuilding capability by retaining jobs and manufacturing in the UK,' the British Ministry of Defence said in a statement, noting an 'amendment' has been made to the FSS contract. In comments shared with media, UK business secretary Jonathan Reynolds said that the FSS contract change was 'relatively minor.' He defended approval of the amendment as a 'far better solution than what was on the table when we initially came to office, which would have been a loan guarantee, which I believe would have lost the taxpayer all of its money, and not deliver the ships and not secure the yards or the jobs.' Neither Navantia UK or the UK Ministry of Defence disclosed the sum paid for Harland &amp; Wolff, but a fee in the region of £70 million has been widely reportedly. Harland &amp; Wolff have not commented on the deal publicly, and after requesting comment today, Breaking Defense received an email mirroring a September statement, which at the time noted that its subsidiaries were 'not subject to the insolvency process' and directing further inquiry to administrators at corporate consulting firm Teneo. A spokesperson for Teneo declined to comment. Drawing on a number of key issues relating to the rescue deal, Nick Childs, senior fellow for naval forces and maritime security at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) told Breaking Defense that although the deal 'is potentially a significant lifeline' for Harland &amp; Wolff, several outstanding questions remain, including that of a 'price tag' and 'what will it mean for both the share and the type of work that will go to H&amp;W as part of the FSS contract?' As for wider implications of the buyout, he shared that the 'key in the long term for the UK shipbuilding industrial base is what level of commitment there will be from this government to future orders and the shipbuilding plan it inherited and the extent to which this deal will put H&amp;W in a position realistically to compete for future work as well.' Navantia had long lobbied for the UK to improve the terms of the FSS contract, arguing such a compromise was necessary to protect the build and delivery of the three-ship procurement. The future ships are set to boost British surface fleet store based capabilities which are currently held by a single UK vessel — RFA Fort Victoria — a hull over 30 years old. The new fleet will be operated by the Royal Fleet Auxillary, the Royal Navy's logistics and support arm. Production of the new ships is slated for 2025, and all three vessels are planned to be operational by 2032. The 216-metre-long vessels are set to be constructed in Belfast, Appledore and Navantia's Puerto Real facility in Cadiz, Spain. In October, plans for the ship passed the Preliminary Design Review, a milestone that Navantia UK said 'confirmed the robustness and maturity of the design.' London initially awarded a FSS production contract in 2023 to the Team Resolute consortium, made up of BMT, a British naval design and consulting group; Harland &amp; Wolff and Navantia UK. The award followed a long-delayed and often politically bruising effort by the MoD to select a contractor for the high-dollar program. The FFS effort is one of seven 'Royal Navy Fleet of the Future' programs included in the UK's 2022 National Shipbuilding Strategy Refresh [PDF].	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/spains-navantia-reaches-rescue-deal-for-struggling-uk-shipyard-harland-wolff/	2024-12-19T08:32:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/FLEET-20201004-001-01.jpg.iCewpNzrMWATAA.zbqWc07m8N-e1734617722719.jpg
Cutting losses? Assad, Syria, and Russia’s strategic flexibility	Russian troops accompany a convoy of Syrian civilians leaving the town of Tal Tamr in the northeastern Hasakeh province via the strategic M4 highway, on January 10, 2021. (Photo by DELIL SOULEIMAN/AFP via Getty Images) The collapse of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and Russia’s decision to stand-by and allow it to occur, has been held up by some in the West as indicative of Moscow’s imperial overstretch and declining regional influence. The Kremlin’s ongoing 'special military operation' in Ukraine is clearly straining Russia’s military, the thinking goes, so much so that it could not stem the rolling rebel tide and was unable and unwilling to prop up the regime any further. As attractive as this narrative is, Western analysts should be wary of putting too much emphasis on the idea that Russia was unable to help and not enough on the simple fact that it was unwilling. It’s more likely that Vladimir Putin saw Russia’s support for Assad for what it was: a relatively low-cost, high-impact arrangement that, as rebels advanced, outlived its usefulness. Strategy is fundamentally about trade-offs, and here it appears that Moscow made a clear decision: The benefit of continuing to support the Assad regime was not worth the cost. To read further weakness into it could mean underestimating the Russian bear. RELATED: Israel seeks to defang Syria, as 350-plus strikes destroy military sites and equipment To be clear, the fall of Bashar al-Assad is undoubtedly a setback for Moscow — one on which President Vladimir Putin was notably silent during a recent annual televised meeting with military leadership. Since the 2015 intervention, the Kremlin invested considerable financial resources and political capital on Assad’s behalf. But for this investment — comparatively small when assessed against, say, the resources America has poured into the region — it gained a foothold in the Middle East and eastern Mediterranean. Its naval bases in the country served as a refueling stop in the Med and a jumping off point for operations in Libya and further into Africa. Those are valuable resources to be sure, but not ones Moscow was unwilling to let go if the cost of maintaining them became too high (especially if it can negotiate with the new power brokers in Syria to keep the bases). Some were quick to point Ukraine’s impact on Russia’s operations in Syria, but this is to misunderstand Moscow’s footprint in the country. While important, it was rather limited to providing airpower and advisors, with some private military contractors, as opposed to a large ground component. Would Russia have been more willing to counter the advance of the rebels were it not engaged in the special military operation? Possibly. It may have committed additional forces to defend the Assad regime. It is, however, equally possible that the regime reached a point at which further assistance was a losing proposition. RELATED: Russian bases and Hezbollah weapons: Key questions follow fall of Syrian regime The speed with which the Assad regime collapsed reflected a decidedly weak operational and tactical situation. Any counteroffensive on behalf of the regime would have been prohibitively costly for Moscow. This would have run counter to a central organizing tenet of the operation in Syria — its comparative low cost and low casualty rate. Throughout the relationship the Assad regime also proved to be a fickle and difficult partner for the Kremlin, unwilling to engage with the opposition and attempting to balance between Russia and Iran (and one off the other). The long-term disposition of Russia’s forces in Syria remains unknown. Early reporting suggests that Russian forces are repositioning from forward operating bases to Khmeimim airbase and the port of Tartous, and potentially evacuating from the country entirely — though for how long is unknown. The immediate impact of this is apparent as US officials report that anti-Islamic State operations have become easier due to the withdrawal of Russian air defense systems. Much remains contingent on how the relationship between the Kremlin and Hayat Tahrir al-Sham evolves. The certain antipathy towards Russia for its brutality on behalf of the Assad regime, and for enabling its stay in power, will likely play some role in the evolving. Yet, there is no guarantee that Hayʼat Tahrir al-Sham will seek to permanently evict Russia’s forces from the country and may seek to turn Moscow from an opponent to merely a neutral actor. Much will depend on the actions of both the United States and Israel. What message did the Kremlin’s inaction send to autocratic regimes in Africa, those propped up by Moscow’s private military companies and Russian influence campaigns? Arguably, it demonstrated that Moscow is willing to continue to support a regime so long as it is winning and able to retain power — and willing to heed the Kremlin’s advice. The point at which a regime is no longer able to do so, the Kremlin will make a strategic decision and change course. It did not leave the Assad family to its fate, offering it a lifeline back to Moscow (and the family’s not inconsiderable properties) and ensuring it will escape international justice for the foreseeable future. What African autocrat wouldn’t wish for the same comparably graceful exit from power? The fall of Assad is a setback for Russia, but also a reflection of the Kremlin’s strategic flexibility. Focusing solely on the former and missing the latter is to engage solely in wishful thinking, which risks strategic surprise both in Syria and in the Kremlin’s activities further afield. Joshua C.

Cost, payload and EW defense: Israel’s Aeronautics CEO talks the future of tactical UAVs	An Orbiter 4 UAV from Israel's Aeronautics takes flight. (Aeronautics) JERUSALEM — As militaries the world over race to embrace drone warfare, the head of the Israeli defense firm Aeronautics told Breaking Defense the market is only growing for tactical unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that are bigger and more capable than most quadcopters, but smaller and much more affordable than large, long-range systems. 'We are living in interesting times. A lot of the systems we have are called to duty and are active in all aspects of the modern war theatre, locally and around the world,' Aeronautics CEO Dan Slasky said in an interview. 'We see this in the Middle East and Ukraine.' 'There are many types from quadcopters to small UAVs out there. However the ones that survive and are effective are the ones that are specially designed to survive and excel in the modern battlefield,' Slasky said. '[In] the dollar-to-mission ratio, [it] is more cost effective to have a system that is robust and can withstand jamming or counter measures.' As for payloads, Slasky said he's seen a high level of interest in drones that carry synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tech — enhancing surveillance missions by being able to 'see' through clouds and some foliage. 'We have integrated SAR radar on our systems, which brings enhanced ISR, all-weather, additional agility, real time comms and response,' he said. Once drones are packed with payloads and have gotten to a new level in terms of flight time and cost, Slasky said a third innovation is adding vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capabilities. The movement of drones into VTOL is something other companies have been focused on as well. For instance, in October Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) unveiled a new APUS line of VTOL quadcopters that it developed in partnership with Aerotor. 'There has been a big pull in army- and navy-related missions with the needs of precision landing. We’ve defined this as a strategic vector,' Slasky said. Aeronautics, a subsidiary of Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is the maker of the Orbiter family of tactical UAVs, from the 29-pound Orbiter 1K to the Orbiter 5, which has a max take-off weight of 165 pounds. It's this latest version, unveiled at a defense show in Paris in 2023, that Slasky says should be able to compete with much larger, more expensive airframes that are more vulnerable to air defenses. (The company equipped the Orbiter 3 and 4 with VTOL capabilities.) Slasky claimed Orbiter 5 could take on as much as '80 percent' as those more traditional medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) systems. The Aeronautics system is already active in operations and is 'successfully performing roles that also were traditionally handled by larger MALE systems and across multiple dimensions,' he said. Aeronautics is hardly alone in attempting to capture the tactical unmanned munition market, going up against products made by Rafael's competitors at major Israeli firms like IAI and a host of international and American companies. RELATED: Meet Anduril's new loitering munitions, the firm's first (but not last) weapons program Aeronautics doesn’t disclose the cost and recent customers, which is typical of Israeli defense companies. A previous report indicated that Croatia had acquired six of the Orbiter 3 drones for $5.7 million, and Finland had acquired up to 180 drones for $31 million. Cost breakdowns are complex because contracts include many other aspects than just the drone itself, including the payloads and launchers and other details. Slasky said Israeli firms have a leg up on some of their competition because many of their systems have been used in combat. 'There are a lot of UAV companies out there but not many have proven and positive feed-back from the battlefield,' he said. While the drone market may be ripe, Slasky acknowledged some recent challenges, including France's decision to ban Israeli firms from major defense shows — a loss of a major business opportunity. 'I don’t know how to gauge what the impact was on us with the cancellation. We had a whole line up of meetings set up and customers wanted to meet us,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/cost-payload-and-ew-defense-israels-aeronautics-ceo-talks-the-future-of-tactical-uavs/	2024-12-19T06:54:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_Aeronautics_orbiter4_HANDOUT-e1734382374836.jpg
Aussie annual defense report stripped of data: ‘Kind of useless now’	Hunter class missile frigate concept art (BAE Systems Australia) SYDNEY — The Australia Department of Defence has decided to withhold large chunks of basic data for the country's annual review of its major weapons programs, in a move government auditors say results in a 'reduced level of transparency and accountability to Parliament.' The Major Program Review (MPR) comes out of the Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), roughly akin to the US Government Accountability Office, workinig off data provided by the defense department. However, it is not legally required, but rather produced 'in the public interest, for the benefit of users of the report inside and outside the Parliament,' as the parliamentary committee on audits is quoted in the report. But this year the DoD 'advised the ANAO of its decision that certain information relating to forecast dates, capability delivery information, variance information and risks and issues was not for publication (NFP), and would not be included in the relevant PDSSs [data sheets] for 20 of the 21 projects.' The DoD told the auditors that 'Australia’s strategic circumstances have markedly changed since the MPR was first implemented. Defense has assessed that some details, both in respect of individual projects and in aggregate, would or could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the security, defense or international relations of the Commonwealth without sanitization of the data.' The move continues a recent trend of holding back information in these reports. In the 2021-2022 edition, only four projects had that information withheld. That jumped to 12 projects for the 2022-2023 edition, and now 20 projects in the 2023-2024 edition. The auditors themselves say that 'the 2023–24 report does not provide the same level of information compared to reporting prior to 2020–21 and provides a reduced level of transparency and accountability to Parliament and other stakeholders. So, in plain English, arguably the most important information for judging the effectiveness of acquisition management for all but one of the major programs reviewed has not been made public. 'I simply see this as the latest step in defense's endless quest to see it is not held accountable for its chronic poor performance,' Marcus Hellyer, a top Australian defense acquisition and budget expert, told Breaking Defense. 'The whole thing is kind of useless now, because you can't look at individual projects.' Because of the information withheld for publication, only averages were offered for program costs and schedule performance. The report estimates 442 months in delays on the 21 programs audited, with an average schedule slip of more than two years. The approved cost of Australia's top defense projects has soared 74 percent by $41 billion from $22.8 billion. Because of the decisions to withhold specific program information, Hellyer said it is largely impossible to get useful information about individual programs. Last year's report found that delays rose substantially from 405 months in 2020-21 to 453 months in 2022-23 for the country’s 20 biggest projects under the government of Anthony Albanese. The Labor Party government has sharply criticized its predecessor’s poor management of defense acquisition and promised to do better. Defense Minister Richard Marles 'did say he was going to fix things, but how does anyone know what's broken if you don't have good data?' Hellyer asked.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/aussie-annual-defense-report-stripped-of-data-kind-of-useless-now/	2024-12-19T05:52:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/Hunter-class-missile-frigate-concept-art-scaled.jpg
Setting national security priorities in a changed world	The outcome of the recent presidential election sets the stage for the United States to reassess its military and diplomatic goals. By crafting the appropriate national security strategy, the nation avoids costly policy errors and sets the stage for proper long-term investment in its defense capabilities. The upcoming budget review should be about defining the threat, understanding the needed force to defeat it and ensuring that the industrial base is properly incentivized and capable of equipping the armed services. In an unpredictable world a strong and innovative military is essential to protect the United States and its economic interests. At $850 billion, the planned budget for FY 2025 is probably below what would be ideal, but at this level it is modest insurance relative to the resources the military protects. Government outlays for defense are just under 3% of the $28.3 trillion U.S. GDP. If we go back 10 years, defense spending was about 3.3% of GDP. Three decades ago, in 1993 when the Cold War ended, military spending was under $280 billion, or 4.1% of GDP. So, the cost to defend our nation is declining as a percentage of economic output. Looking at it another way, the total active-duty force is down from 1.8 million at the end of FY1993 to just under 1.4 million today. The DoD’s civilian workforce is 10% smaller at around 800 thousand. The U.S. has a stronger defense with fewer soldiers. Could we find ways to be more efficient, probably. Is there non-essential work being performed by the civilian workforce; of course. So, here are some thoughts on change. For the annual budget, the Pentagon should spend more time on the outliers, with a lighter touch on the recurring items, reducing bureaucratic costs. Find the levers in procurement laws that can speed up reviews and enhance oversight. Select practices that cut paperwork on recurring buys. Operating and Maintenance is 40% of the DoD budget; invest to reduce recurring costs. Craft better proposals and raise the hurdle for bid protests. Deliver the budget on time. Delay costs money and harms readiness. It’s in the national interest for all parties to work together. The ability to deliver more for proportionally less has been driven by forward-thinking leaders who recognize that strategy drives outcomes, not folks with green eyeshades. The adversary gets a vote too, so the Department of Defense needs to have a competitive fighting force while it evolves and deploys new technologies to defeat new threats. For example, it needs to kill thousand-dollar drones with directed energy systems or small projectiles, not million dollar missiles. A compelling strategic framework is Defense Secretary Rumsfeld’s vision set out in the May/June 2002 issue of Foreign Affairs. He argued that our security challenges are not as predictable as those of the Cold War. Given the advances and spread of technology, his argument is as relevant today as when he wrote it. His prescience is notable. He cited the need for more unmanned weapons, long-range systems and improved information networks. Those ideas are a reality with the B-21 bomber, the unmanned MQ-25 drone, and significant funding for software-defined radios and cyberspace activities. In addition to restructuring their industrial footprint, the industry took other actions to deliver economic value to the Pentagon and shareholders. Multi-year contracting was employed with efficiencies shared with the Pentagon. Competitive development programs were crafted to balance risk and innovation. In recent years, the Army had Night Court, a process that scrapped lower priority programs to free up about $35 billion to fund its modernization. The Pentagon has pursued partners in Silicon Valley, and it created the Defense Innovation Unit in 2015 to help the U.S. military make faster use of commercial technologies. There are many lessons from the war in Ukraine; funding and industry response to battlefield needs were faster than a budget cycle. In a related example, contracting terms could be further revised to pay for war reserve capacity. Future contracts should have a war-related surge clause. Solely employing unit costs as the metric for value misses the need for long-term preparedness. Finally, Congress, with its control of the nation’s purse strings, needs to support a concrete plan that delivers recurring and verifiable value to the public and to the Pentagon’s suppliers.

Lawmakers introduce bipartisan SHIPS Act to boost commercial shipping	A container ship passes under the International Gateway Bridge at the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California, US, on Monday, June 17, 2024. (Tim Rue/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers today introduced legislation aimed at strengthening the American shipbuilding and commercial maritime industries following what they characterized as 'decades of neglect.' The bill in question, dubbed the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security for America Act, is being sponsored by Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Todd Young, R-Ind., as well as Reps. John Garamendi, D-Calif., and Trent Kelly, R-Miss. Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., who has been tapped by the new Trump administration to be national security advisor, has also previously expressed support for the bill. 'This historic bipartisan proposal would restore American leadership across the oceans by establishing national oversight and consistent funding for U.S. maritime policy, incentivizing domestic shipbuilding, enabling U.S.-flagged vessels to better compete in international commerce, rebuilding the U.S. shipyard industrial base, and expanding the mariner and shipyard workforce,' according to a written statement from the lawmakers. The bill would establish a maritime security advisor within the White House tasked with coordinating inter-agency decisions for how to implement a national maritime strategy. It would also create a 'Strategic Commercial Fleet Program' focused on expanding a US-flagged international fleet to 250 ships within 10 years. The four lawmakers said that fleet currently sits around 80 ships compared to China’s 5,500. The bill would also require that government-funded cargo be moved aboard US-flagged vessels as well as requiring a portion of imported goods from China to do the same, among other things. 'We’ve always been a maritime nation, but the truth is we’ve lost ground to China, who now dominates international shipping and can build merchant and military ships much more quickly than we can,' said Sen. Kelly. 'The SHIPS for America Act is the answer to this challenge.' Outgoing Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has made commercial shipping and shipbuilding a focus area of his this year. During an event last week hosted by the American Society of Naval Engineers, he urged the new administration to continue his efforts, theorizing that the neglect the commercial shipbuilding sector has faced in recent decades presents an opportunity for the White House to boost the economy with new jobs. 'If we want to expand our economy, you've got to expand the supply chain. You’ve got to expand the number of companies that are participating in the growth of the economy itself,' he said. 'And there aren’t a lot of places where you could effectively do that here in the United States, [but] because we have abandoned the commercial shipbuilding industry since about the 1980s, that creates a new opportunity for growth in a significant way.' Given the limited time the current Congress has left in session, the bill will almost certainly need to be refiled next year before it can be considered by the relevant committees or the larger chambers. Legislation related to national security often doesn’t receive standalone votes, but rather is included in the annual defense policy bill.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lawmakers-introduce-bipartisan-ships-act-to-boost-commercial-shipping/	2024-12-19T02:30:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241218_container_ship_GettyImages-2157596020-scaled-e1734546315731.jpg
Navy picks Northrop to deliver nuclear command TACAMO aircraft	The Northrop Grumman-led industry team will deliver the E-130J for the U.S. Navy’s TACAMO mission. (Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Navy today awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Northrop Grumman to be the mission systems integrator for Navy's next-generation plane for commanding nuclear-armed forces in an emergency, beating out competitor Collins Aerospace. TACAMO is the acronym the Navy uses for the mission known as 'take charge and move out.' The new plane, dubbed the E-130J, will eventually take over that mission for the legacy fleet, the E-6B Mercury. Its purpose is to provide the chain of command a secure and reliable platform to communicate with any one of the forces encompassing the nuclear triad. 'Our TACAMO mission is foundational to our nation’s nuclear triad,' said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in a written statement announcing the contract award. 'The E-130J will carry on the proud legacy of Navy TACAMO aircraft and keep our nation safe.' Under the new contract, Northrop Grumman will integrate the mission systems needed onboard the E-130J, including the Collins Aerospace-made Very Low Frequency communications system, a critical component that allows the plane to communicate with subs deep below the ocean’s surface. The airframe will be Lockheed Martin-made C-130J-30s, a stretched version of the C-130J transport aircraft. 'The contract is for three Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and options for up to three System Demonstration Test Articles (SDTAs) and up to six aircraft in the first lot of production. Collins Aerospace and Lockheed Martin are directed subcontractors to support the integration and airworthiness,' according to the Navy statement. Northrop’s team for the contract includes Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, Raytheon’s Crescent Systems, and Long Wave Inc. 'Our performance on Navy programs like the E-2D and E-6B prove we deliver on what we promise, and we will bring this expertise in helping the Navy deliver the E-130J on time and optimized for this strategically important mission,' said Jane Bishop, vice president and general manager of global surveillance division for Northrop Grumman. As Breaking Defense previously reported, Northrop Grumman’s primary competitor for the contract was RTX-subsidiary Collins Aerospace. Collins could not be immediately reached for comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/navy-picks-northrop-to-deliver-nuclear-command-tacamo-aircraft/	2024-12-18T17:18:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/northrop-tacamo-e1734569548549.png
Providing an asymmetric advantage with quadcopters and fixed-wing VTOLs	Red Cat's Edge 130 vertical takeoff and landing drone is a Blue UAS approved military-grade system for longer-range high-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. (Red Cat photo) Red Cat’s new family of systems includes a common ground control system for three aircraft: the American-made Teal 2 quadcopter and the Edge 130 Blue, a VTOL fixed-wing system – both of which are on the Defense Innovation Unit’s Blue List – and a new FANG line of first-person view (FPV) drones of different sizes and capabilities. We discuss the asymmetric advantage of these systems with Red Cat Founder and CTO George Matus. Breaking Defense: Tell us about Red Cat and its two main subsidiaries: Teal Drones and FlightWave. Red Cat Founder and CTO George Matus. George Matus: Red Cat is a drone technology company founded by our CEO Jeff Thompson in 2018. We develop robotic hardware and software primarily for U.S. government and NATO allies. Our mission is to provide critical situational awareness and enhance the effectiveness and safety of military and security operations around the world. Red Cat provides American-made technology products to the drone industry through its two wholly owned subsidiaries: Teal Drones and FlightWave. Red Cat acquired Teal in September 2021. Teal is a Salt Lake City-based drone company that I founded in 2015. Post acquisition, Teal started to evolve from our roots in consumer drones to address the needs of public safety and national security use cases. Our company built the first mass produced drone built entirely in the U.S., with Department of Defense compliant components, and today has a factory staffed with over 100 employees. In the summer of 2024, Red Cat acquired FlightWave Aerospace Systems. This was a strategic move to build out a family of small unmanned systems. FlightWave is an industry leader in Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) drone, sensor and software solutions. This acquisition brought the Edge 130, a Blue UAS approved military-grade system into Red Cat’s product line. The strategy was to expand Teal’s capabilities with extended range and endurance, additional payloads, and broader use in maritime environments. What’s the significance of being on the Blue List? Teal was one of the first Blue UAS-approved companies going as far back as 2020. The Blue UAS effort was started by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to establish a trusted supply of drones to the U.S. Government. This stamp of approval means being compliant in both supply chain and cyber security, and follows a regimented process to ensure a company and its products meet all of the associated requirements. Teal was the first U.S. company to ever mass produce this category of drone in America and was prepared to be part of Blue UAS as soon as the program was created. What’s driving the requirements for quadcopters? What are the missions and payloads they’re most suited for? Quadcopters are being used for many different use cases across enterprise, public safety, and defense. Teal’s products are dual-use such that they can be deployed across each of these verticals. Specific to defense, we’re now seeing that drones are currently the most impactful technology in war. When we consider what to design and build, we essentially combine three methods: first we listen carefully to end-users and their feedback, we design toward official requirements provided by our government customers, and third we use our experience to fill in any gaps we see to make the best product possible and delight our users. Our drones are fully modular, interoperable, and designed to be similar to smartphones, where they have powerful compute and sensors onboard that allow advanced software and applications to run on top of that. Our flagship product right now is the Teal 2 which is being deployed across the country and with allied countries around the world. For our new line of FPV drones, the most appropriate missions are short-range, any environment ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) with the option for delivery of kinetic effects. Now with Red Cat’s acquisition of FlightWave, we’re introducing a fixed-wing VTOL system into our product line. The Edge 130 is a longer-range high-endurance ISR aircraft and rounds out our family of systems. This is the world’s most affordable and first backpackable family of systems. Red Cat's Teal 2 quadcopter is an American made drone weighing under three pounds, and features a high-resolution dual EO/IR sensor, modular architecture, powerful onboard compute, and a variety of software integrations for autonomy and AI. (Red Cat photo) Describe this new family of systems that Red Cat announced at Eurosatory. In the context of defense, there is a paradigm shift underway on the architecture of battlefields. Increasingly, the U.S Department of Defense and ministries of defense globally are moving away from conventional platforms that are large and extremely expensive, and are beginning to adopt small, low-cost products that provide true asymmetric advantages. Red Cat is at the forefront of this sea change. Our goal is to give warfighters the tools they need to be successful on the modern battlefield. That was the genesis of the Red Cat Family of Systems. What we announced at Eurosatory includes three aircraft with complementary capabilities and a common Ground Control System (GCS). The core of the family is the Teal 2 quadcopter. It is an American made drone that’s designed to 'Dominate the Night'. Weighing under three pounds, it features a high-resolution dual EO/IR sensor, modular architecture, powerful onboard compute, and a wide variety of software integrations for autonomy and AI. It’s ruggedized to be used in any environment and harsh weather conditions, while also offering field repairability on all subsystems. The next entrant into the family of systems is the Edge 130 Blue, a VTOL fixed wing system that can be assembled and launched in just one minute by a single user to capture and stream high-resolution aerial imagery with long-range capability. Still weighing under four pounds and being backpackable, the Edge 130 can fly for over 2 hours, an industry-leading endurance among all Blue UAS approved drones today. Rounding out the Family of Systems is a new FANG line of first-person view (FPV) drones of different sizes and capabilities. The first in the line of FPV drones provides precision strike capabilities and gives warfighters the option to combine the ISR capabilities of the rest of the family. What is Red Cat’s ability to manufacture at scale? Our factory in Salt Lake City houses both our R&amp;D team and manufacturing team. We’ve designed our products and infrastructure to scale with demand into the thousands of drones per month. Our vetted supply chain vendors enable the company to source the components needed to build these drones at those large volumes. Having R&amp;D integrated very deeply enables for agile development and innovation. Our factory, with its state of the art tools and processes, combined with our world class team, is helping America to rebuild its drone industrial base which we believe is vital to our national security. Tell us about Partners and the consortium. We believe that no single company can protect this country alone. A few months ago we announced the Red Cat Futures Initiative to solve this problem. The RFI is a robotics and autonomous systems consortium designed to bridge critical UAS technology gaps for warfighters. It is an independent, industry-wide community of partners dedicated to putting the most advanced and interoperable uncrewed aircraft systems into the hands of warfighters. As a leader in the drone industry, we developed and launched this initiative to support the Pentagon’s desire to accelerate innovation for its Replicator Initiative and the need for low-cost, autonomous systems across air, land, sea, and subsea environments. The consortium will collaborate to ensure requirements based UAS production that meets the needs of specific missions, as well as reduce vendor lock-in and promote innovation and interoperability. The RFI will also engage in R&amp;D and government advocacy that accelerates technology maturation. The RFI brings together the most innovative UAS hardware and software companies focused on AIU/ML, swarming, FPV, command and control, charging/power, payloads and others based on the needs of warfighters. At launch in May 2024, the founding partners included Ocean Power Technologies, Sentien Robotics, Primordial Labs, Athena AI, Unusual Machines, Reach Power, and MMS Products. The shared goal of RFI is advocacy, integrations, and co-marketing that bridges considerable tech gaps in the UAS industry through modular open architecture. I am very excited to be partnering with so many amazing companies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/providing-an-asymmetric-advantage-with-quadcopters-and-fixed-wing-vtols/	2024-12-18T11:16:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Red-Cat-Edge-130-Blue-with-Overwatch-Gimbal-1.png
UK looks to protect funding for rapid Watchkeeper UAV replacement	British Army Watchkeeper Unmanned Aerial Systems are set to be axed from service next year as part of defense cuts. (UK MoD) BELFAST — The United Kingdom has learned from watching Ukraine that its Watchkeeper unmanned aerial vehicle is 'no longer fit for operational purpose,' but the ministry of defense is committed to protecting funding that will go towards its replacement, according to a senior official. 'We are working really hard with the army and ensuring they're funded to deliver the sorts of drone capability in 2025 to replace the drone [Watchkeeper] that's being retired,' Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Military Capability) Lt. Gen. Robert Magowan told lawmakers from the UK Defence Committee on Tuesday. In November, London said it had decided to scrap 46 of the British Army medium-altitude, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) drones as part of sweeping equipment cuts aimed at delivering savings of £500 million ($632 million) over the next five years. Magowan's comments on the lack of operational utility offered by Watchkeeper are in keeping with those of John Healey, UK Secretary of Defence, who justified the early retirement of the aircraft on grounds that 'technology has overtaken' it. Magowan did not elaborate further on the replacement effort but did note that the Watchkeeper retirement will allow the MoD to still save 'quite a lot of money' that would otherwise go toward support costs for the aircraft. Elsewhere in Tuesday's hearing, lawmaker questions prompted additional revelations from Magowan across a number of other key programs, including plans to replace 17 Royal Air Force-operated Puma medium lift helicopters, also axed under the latest round of military cuts. He said that a 'range of capabilities' are currently being explored that could 'plug gaps' when the rotorcraft, which are permanently based in Brunei and Cyprus, are retired in March 2025. The UK has already committed to the acquisition of six Airbus H145 Jupiter helicopters to replace the Puma's in 2026, so it appears that Magowan is suggesting an interim or stop-gap acquisition could be approved. He did not share additional details. The Puma's premature withdrawal from service from Brunei and Cyprus has previously drawn concern from Airbus. In November, the company noted in response to the move that, though it welcomes the H145 business, 'we regret the likely impact on the UK's defence industrial base, with the potential loss of skilled engineering roles and wider consequences for the aerospace supply chain.' Magowan also said that the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) New Medium Helicopter (NMH) program, designed to source a successor for a separate fleet of Puma aircraft, is 'playing out now,' adding 'there's one bidder left and that bidder has significant investment in the in the UK.' The single bidder is presumably a reference to Leonardo, the only manufacturer to put forward a bid after Airbus and Lockheed Martin both walked away from the competition in August because of requirement problems and fears linked to not receiving 'adequate long-term returns.' In a program update last week, Maria Eagle, UK minister for defence procurement, said that 'there are no plans to change the extant New Medium Helicopter procurement process.' She added, 'The New Medium Helicopter competition remains sensitive, and the evaluation and approval process must complete before further details, including aircraft numbers, can be confirmed.' The previous Conservative government had said the procurement could be 'up to' 44 airframes, but Breaking Defense has reported industry expects the real number to be around 30 platforms, and FlightGlobal recently reported it could be as few as 23. NMH contract award is set for next year, but the UK's Strategic Defense Review (SDR), due for release in mid-2025, could complicate matters because it has been designed to evaluate national defense priorities and equipment planning. Also in the hearing Magowan said that the BAE Systems Bofors Archer, an interim self-propelled howitzer, is set to enter service with the British Army in 'early 2025,' while the UK and Germany are in 'close negotiations' on the longer term solution, expected to be the KNDS Remote-Controlled Howitzer 155mm (RCH 155) 52 cal. Wheeled Artillery System.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/uk-looks-to-protect-funding-for-rapid-watchkeeper-uav-replacement/	2024-12-18T10:48:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/APOLOND-OFFICIAL-20221017-114-012.jpg.iCeJmdHrMWATAA.obsGvziWvx-e1734542025828.jpg
Senate passes defense bill despite Democrat concerns on transgender care ban	Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, left, and Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, arrive for a hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, May 2, 2024. (Photographer: Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate overwhelmingly passed the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act today, with Democrats coming out in droves to approve the $884 billion bill despite controversial transgender care provisions. The NDAA, which passed in a 85-14 vote, corresponds to a $895 billion topline for defense spending, adhering to the budgetary limits set in last year’s Fiscal Responsibility Act. That’s a departure from the Senate Armed Services Committee’s initial version of the bill, which would have broken the FRA and boosted the defense topline to $923.3 billion. The bill now moves to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has indicated he'll sign it into law. During a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, SASC’s top Republican Roger Wicker, who spearheaded the push for additional funds, said the topline increases 'should have been part of the bill today.' 'Regrettably we missed an opportunity to strengthen the president-elect’s hand as he takes office in a precarious world situation,' he said. SASC Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the concern from senators who wanted to see a higher defense topline 'is well reasoned' given current threats, but noted that the creation of the FRA was demanded by House Republicans. RELATED: House passes $884B NDAA despite transgender care ban controversy The bill was widely adopted by Senate Democrats despite the last-minute inclusion of language that would block gender-affirming care that could potentially cause sterilization for the transgender children of servicemembers, which was inserted at House Speaker Mike Johnson’s behest. Only about half of House Democrats voted for the typically-bipartisan measure due to the Tricare restrictions. In remarks ahead of the vote, Reed said he 'disagrees strongly' with the inclusion of the provision and will continue to advocate for servicemembers and their dependents. However, 'we have before us a very strong National Defense Authorization Act,' he added. During a phone call with reporters ahead of the vote, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Democrats successfully removed all of the anti-transgender provisions that were in earlier versions of the bill aside from the care ban for transgender minors and noted that he personally opposed that provision when it came before SASC for a vote. However, Kaine said the NDAA was ultimately 'very, very strong for every last member of the military and their families,' noting the 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers and other quality of life improvements. The bill authorizes $883.7 billion for fiscal year 2025, including $849.9 billion for Department of Defense programs. It also approves $33.3 billion for national security programs in the Department of Energy and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and $512.4 million for defense-related activities. The NDAA permits the transfer of National Guard space units to the Space Force, restricts F-35 deliveries, imposes new design requirements for certain Navy ships, and allows the Air Force to retire aging A-10s, F-16s and F-15s. The bill also authorizes additional funds for a third Arleigh Burke destroyer and six more F-15EXs, among other plus-ups and spending cuts, but congressional appropriators will have the final say on approving the budget.

In deal with Portugal, Turkish naval firm STM signs first export contract to NATO nation	Turkish defence company STM General Manager Ozgur Guleryuz (R) signs an agreement during the signing ceremony for the construction of the Multifunctional Naval Platform at the Marinha Central Facilities on December 17, 2024 in Lisbon, Portugal. (Photo by Zed Jameson/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish naval defense firm STM signed a contract with Portugal for two Auxiliary Oiler Replenisher and Logistics Ship (AOR+) — the first contract for naval ships between Turkey and a NATO nation — the firm said in a statement Tuesday. 'Türkiye, which is one of the 10 countries in the world that manufactures its own warships, has now started to produce these products as well as export them to our friendly and allied countries,' Turkish Secretary of Defence Industries Haluk Görgün said in the statement. 'Developing strong defence and defence industry cooperation with our NATO Allies is a top priority for Türkiye.' The ships will be able to transport and resupply naval vessels at sea with fuel, drinking water, cargo and ammunition, according to a statement by the Portuguese navy, and if necessary could aid in disaster support. Specifically, STM said the two AOR+ vessels will be able to operate for 90 days at sea and 'have the capacity to transport armored vehicles, enabling them to support joint and amphibious operations. With an aft vehicle ramp, each vessel will be capable of carrying up to 20 light tactical armored vehicles.' Görgün added that the agreement is a step towards broader cooperation with the Portuguese navy in other areas, such as unmanned maritime vehicles, electronic warfare systems, and further shipbuilding and naval modernization projects. The contract was signed Tuesday in Lisbon, and work on the ships is expected to begin in 2025, and the Portuguese navy said they expect delivery by 2028. Turkey has been beefing up its naval defense sector and production capabilities in recent years with shipyards, floating docks and multi-purpose ships. In 2023, another Turkish firm, Havelsan, unveiled its unmanned submarine Caka, designed to perform infrastructure and naval protection missions. Earlier this year, Turkish Aksaz Shipyard command was inaugurated and launched the first national submarine floating dock with a 3,000-ton lifting capacity. In November, Turkish firm Baykar's unmanned combat aerial vehicle performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/in-deal-with-portugal-turkish-naval-firm-stm-signs-first-export-contract-to-nato-nation/	2024-12-18T09:36:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/GettyImages-2189881493-scaled-e1734535702223.jpg
The ‘Last Supper’ era is over — it’s time for the ‘First Breakfast’	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) In less than two months, President-elect Trump will take office facing significant national security threats to US interests — particularly from China. Unfortunately, he will also have to grapple with a Department of Defense (DoD) and defense industrial base struggling to overcome decades of neglect to meet our nation’s increasingly complex defense needs. The administration has a chance to take action early on. Within one month of taking office, the incoming secretaries of defense and state should sit down with key industry leaders for the 'First Breakfast' — a frank and overdue conversation between the government and industry on these threats, what the government needs from industry, and industry’s take on how the government can help it meet these needs. While the term 'First Breakfast' has been offered in this context before, what we propose is something more comprehensive — a path to the relationship reset between government and industry in order to confront our hardest national security challenges. In the twilight of the Cold War, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and his deputy, Bill Perry, invited the CEOs of the nation’s largest defense companies to the Pentagon for a meeting in the Secretary’s dining room, now known as the 'Last Supper.' In that 1993 meeting, Perry presented the group with a tough message: Defense budgets would shrink and the industry would need to consolidate to survive. Industry took that warning to heart, with the number of prime defense contractors shrinking from 51 to 5 by 2003 as a result of rampant mergers and acquisitions. For much of the three decades since the Last Supper, the US enjoyed a period of uncontested military overmatch against our adversaries, unencumbered by the threat of a legitimate near-peer competitor. However, we now find ourselves in an era of historic uncertainty and international security challenges — a period in which Mara Karlin, a former senior DoD official, recently posited as a turn toward 'total war,' in which all elements of national power are leveraged against a broad array of targets to reshape the world order. After decades of industrial mismanagement by the government, we now find our national advantage eroded and in need of urgent reinvigoration. We are faced with the need to have a similarly urgent, but very different conversation to reverse the failures of the past — it is time for the 'First Breakfast’. But given the complexity and opportunity of the modern geopolitical and economic environments, this meal needs to look different. It should bring together not only the few remaining primes but also innovative new entrants, insurgent mid-sized companies, and national security-attuned private equity. Recognizing the modern focus on transforming conflict through automation and cutting-edge, rapidly evolving software, the First Breakfast should include our nation’s leading software companies. And given the inextricable synergy between diplomacy and defense in securing our national interests, the need to support partner and allied militaries, and the opportunity to leverage industrial capacity and capital abroad, the secretary of state should co-lead this discussion. (A disclaimer: Our employer, Beacon Global Strategies, represents a broad spectrum of clients, including defense and non-defense companies ranging from small startups to industry leaders.) The discussion should lead with a candid conversation about the myriad of strategic threats we face and the erosion of our industrial overmatch — in both technology and mass. The next administration should be transparent about the operational challenges our military faces and include industry as the essential ally required to overcome them. Foundational challenges such as workforce shortfalls, the reality of static defense spending, and the impact of increasingly expensive, but necessary, investments in modernization and personnel should be discussed frankly as realities that directly inform industrial investment. A successful First Breakfast would produce a path toward restoring trust, improving government-industry cooperation, increasing opportunities for new defense industry entrants and fostering competition, and reducing friction between industry and decisionmakers based on a shared understanding of each other's motivations and challenges. But crucially, this cannot kick off a two-year process towards the development of a new industrial strategy. Instead, within four weeks of meeting, the group should produce a list of guiding principles, detailing what government needs industry to do better, what the government can do to enable industry to meet government demand, and what issues the two need to continue working on side-by-side. The group should plan follow-on gatherings to develop and concrete actions and deliverables and track progress against the guiding principles for mutual accountability. Importantly, this must not be a partisan endeavor — congressional senior leaders must be allies in these efforts to invigorate defense industrial base innovation and production. For too long, Congress has abrogated their duties to pass timely and regular appropriations, instead relying on continuing resolutions that defer their constitutional responsibility to a later date all the while immobilizing the entire defense community, leading to additional costs to the taxpayer. Senior congressional leaders should understand the gravity of inaction and partisan brinksmanship, and resume their responsibility as partners, not parochialists. Of course, our military and industry have discussed many of these issues on the margins for years, particularly as our national security focus shifted away from counterterrorism and towards near peers. And efforts at all sorts of reform, from acquisition to foreign military sales to overcoming the 'valley of death' are vital. A clear, blunt and more strategic 'First Breakfast' conversation can push these difficult policy reforms forward. It's clear that our nation’s defense-industrial trajectory just isn’t sustainable.

China’s nuclear arsenal keeps growing amidst leadership purge: Pentagon report	The Chinese military's new DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles, that can reportedly reach the United States, are seen at a parade to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, at Tiananmen Square on October 1, 2019 in Beijing, China. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — At a time when the Chinese government is purging its officer rolls and dealing with a slowing economy, it has continued growing its nuclear arsenal and conventional arms ambitions, according to a new Pentagon report. That finding is part of the Pentagon’s congressionally mandated 2024 China Military Power Report, an annual document providing US insights into the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) strategy and weapons development. This year’s report, largely covering 2023 activities, does not offer up any new bombshells about PLA weapon development or strategy, but still serves as a valuable window into the US government’s perspective on Chinese military activities. When it comes to the ongoing military purge inside China, a senior US defense official said, 'The PLA [People’s Liberation Army] continues to struggle with deeply rooted problems of corruption.' In the second half of 2023 alone, at least 15 high ranking military officials and defense industry executives were removed from their posts for corruption, the official told reporters Monday ahead of the report’s release. Several of those officials were directly responsible for overseeing equipment projects related to modernizing China's ground based nuclear and conventional missiles. For now, the Pentagon anticipates that this anti-corruption push will continue, in part, because Beijing believes that keeping weak or corrupt leaders in key positions inside the PLA, it could potentially slow China down from achieving its 2027 weapon modernization goals and, eventually, trying to reunify with Taiwan, the US defense official added. The official threw cold water on the much-ballyhooed fear that an invasion of Taiwan is on the calendar, saying 'On 2027, I would reiterate that we don't think that conflict [with Taiwan] is imminent or inevitable: We think that we have deterrence today that's real and strong.' Still, 'We do judge that that is a capability development milestone that could give the PLA greater capacity to be a more credible military tool for the Chinese Communist Party's unification efforts,' the official later added. When it comes to China's arsenal of weapons, the report doesn’t disclose any massive departure from previous predictions. The PLA is still on track to hit its goal of having 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, and as of mid-2024, that stockpile had surpassed 600 — roughly 100 more than was listed in last year's report. 'We're showing a rate of growth that is pretty well consistent with what we've described in reports over the past… few years, about their nuclear expansion and modernization,' the US senior defense official added. Also similar to last year’s report, the US assesses that the PRC has completed construction of its three solid-propellant silo fields, which will cumulatively contain at least 300 new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) silos. And the PRC is also still interested in developing a new, conventionally armed, intercontinental range missile system that could strike targets in Hawaii, Alaska and inside the continental United States — an idea disclosed last year and not expanded on. The PRC’s space industry, meanwhile, is 'rapidly expanding' its intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, navigation, and communication satellite constellations, according to the report. 'Through 2030, the PRC will continue to leverage its nonmilitary and commercial space activities to expand its global influence,' it added. 'Beijing’s policies to encourage private investment in space activities have influenced a broad range of firms to enter the commercial space market.' The PLA Navy. meanwhile, has maintained a fleet of 'more than' 370 ships and submarines, while the PLA Air Force continued to modernize its aircraft and drones. 'The PLA transferred significant portions of PLA [Navy] shore-based, fixed-wing combat aviation units, facilities, air defense, and radar units to the PLA [Air Force],' the report said. 'Given time, this shift will probably enable better command and control over the PRC’s integrated air defense systems as well as the network of ground-based air domain awareness radars supporting the PRC’s national integrated air defense system network.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-keeps-growing-amidst-leadership-purge-pentagon-report/	2024-12-18T07:00:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/221129_china_icbm_parade_GettyImages-1172705774-scaled-e1669731562738.jpg
Autonomy changes everything about combat engineering	Combat engineering tasks are a significantly dangerous set of activities. Combat engineers, or 'sappers' as they're called, clear the battlefield ahead using explosives and machines with front-end equipment so maneuver forces can travel forward unhindered. For countermobility, their mission is to slow down opposing land forces with terrain-based effects like Dragon’s teeth. Deployment of robotic combat engineering assets will significantly reduce risk to exposed soldiers in the breach executing mobility/countermobility missions, while maintaining or increasing the tempo of movement for maneuver forces. In this editorial eBRIEF, Breaking Defense examines the challenges and opportunities associated with robotics and autonomy for combat engineering.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/autonomy-changes-everything-about-combat-engineering/	2024-12-18T05:23:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Breaking-defense-eBrief-Pearson-Engineering-Featured-Image.jpg
Raytheon, Ursa Major log successful solid rocket motor flight test	A solid rocket motor developed by Ursa Major is preparing to be tested at its Berthoud, Colorado campus. (Ursa Major) WASHINGTON — RTX weapons arm Raytheon and defense startup Ursa Major Technologies have completed two successful test flights of a missile propelled by a new solid rocket motor, the companies announced today. The recent tests mark a step forward in Ursa Major's path to become a third provider of solid rocket motors for the US weapons industry around 2026, when qualification of the technology is currently scheduled, the companies stated in a news release. 'There is a new player on the scene in the solid rocket motor industry,' Ursa Major CEO Dan Jablonsky told reporters during a roundtable. 'This is an Army program that we've been working on with Raytheon. In this particular program, we went from concept and design to firing and flight on the range in just under four months, which is lightning fast.' The two test flights, held at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California, involved a Raytheon-made missile propelled by an Ursa Major solid rocket motor measuring less than 10 inches in diameter, Jablonsky said. However, much about the capability Ursa Major is developing — and the weapon that will use it — is shrouded in mystery. Jablonsky declined to comment on whether a missile from an existing program of record or a newly-developed design was flown during the tests. Nor did he comment on the range of the weapon involved or the exact size of the rocket motor. RELATED: Ursa Major takes aim at DoD solid rocket motor market A Raytheon spokesperson referred questions about the missile to the Army, adding that the company 'is working with several rocket motor suppliers to rapidly develop and deliver affordable solutions to the US Army at the speed of relevance.' Over the next year, Ursa Major plans to do more test flights with Raytheon, including with an extended range version of the weapon. It will also expand its facilities to enable the company to ramp up production when the design is fully qualified, he said. 'Not only do we expect to pick up programs of record in the vicinity of what we've just flown … but we used and proved out our agile manufacturing techniques in doing so,' Jablonsky said, adding that Ursa Major could provide surge capacity for other programs of record with Raytheon or potentially other weapons companies. The US solid rocket motor industry is currently limited to only two vendors: L3Harris’s Aerojet Rocketdyne subsidiary and Northrop Grumman, which acquired manufacturer Orbital ATK in 2018. The already fragile SRM industrial base was hit hard by supply chain constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and has struggled to recover as demand for weapons skyrockets due to the war in Ukraine. Executives from defense primes like RTX and Lockheed Martin have expressed frustration with current providers' production capacity and schedule challenges, and are injecting money and technical know-how with other companies interested in broadening the industrial base. But while several defense tech startups such as Ursa Major Technologies, Anduril and X-Bow Systems have announced plans to enter the market, it will take years for their designs to be tested and qualified. RTX Ventures, Raytheon's venture capital arm, has been investing in Ursa Major since 2023. In the 14 months since Ursa Major first stood up its solid rocket motor manufacturing cell, it has grown that unit to about 40 employees, Jablonsky said Ursa Major has developed configurations of motors from two-inch diameter — about the size used for shoulder-launched weapon systems, to 22-inch diameter motors that could be used for vertical launch systems. The company is also producing its own energetics — a decision that Jablonsky said will keep Ursa Major from having to rely on the same suppliers already working to their limits to support existing solid rocket motor requirements. Other major weapons makers are also engaged in partnerships with potential new motor suppliers. In August, Lockheed announced it would partner with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems to develop the latter company as solid rocket motor manufacturer for Lockheed’s Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS). At the time, executives said the first motors would roll off GD’s production line in Camden, Ark., around 2025. If that effort is successful, GD-OTS could begin producing motors for additional systems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/raytheon-ursa-major-log-successful-solid-rocket-motor-flight-test/	2024-12-17T21:01:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/URSA_Solid_Rocket_Motor-scaled.jpg
Congress unveils stopgap funding bill with $5.7 billion for Virginia-class subs	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023.

(Photo by Tony McDonough / AFP) (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — After days of grueling negotiations, House leadership today released a stopgap funding proposal that would extend federal funding into mid-March and add $5.7 billion in emergency funds for Virginia-class submarine construction. Now Congress has until Friday night to pass the continuing resolution (CR) before federal spending runs out, giving lawmakers a tight timeframe to move through procedural hurdles and avert a government shutdown. Congressional leadership reached a deal on this evening after days of negotiations, which initially saw Republicans seeking extra funds for farmers and Democrats pushing for additional disaster relief to be included in the spending bill. Ultimately, the 1,574-page agreement expanded to include a laundry list of other issues, including public health and workforce programs as well as the future of Washington’s RFK Stadium. For defense, the most newsworthy item is the pot of additional submarine funding, which will allow the Navy to incrementally fund emerging needs on the Virginia-class submarine contract or 'other nuclear-powered vessel programs' until the end of fiscal 2029. Specifically, it would fund 'the improvement of workforce wages and non-executive level salaries,' the bill text states. The funds are classified as emergency spending — a critical designation that allows the Defense Department to sidestep current spending limits imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, as well as any future budget caps. The funds could provide additional funding flexibility for the Navy as it tries to strengthen the submarine industrial base, which is struggling to hire and retain skilled technicians and boost small suppliers. Other defense related increases include the addition of disaster relief funding for military installations that suffered damages caused by Typhoon Mawar as well as various hurricanes. It also directs the Air Force to transfer the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard to the 175th Wing of the Maryland Air National Guard. While inserting language on various domestic issues was seen as critical for House Speaker Mike Johnson to win Democrat support — a key consideration, given the GOP’s razor-thin majority in the House and potential need to amass a two-thirds majority for bill passage — the accumulation of provisions unrelated to the CR itself could rankle hardline and fiscal conservatives who had pushed for a bare-bones CR. During a news conference this morning, Johnson said he is hopeful he can get House Republicans on board and defended the last-minute additions to the bill. 'It’s not a Christmas tree, it’s not an [omnibus]. … This is a small CR that we had to add things that were out of our control,' Johnson said, noting the need for additional aid for farmers and disaster relief funding. The CR would extend until March 14, ahead of an April 30 deadline to pass a full-year appropriations bill before across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration kick in, under the terms of the FRA.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/congress-unveils-stopgap-funding-bill-with-5-7-billion-for-virginia-class-subs/	2024-12-17T17:00:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/virginia-australia-scaled-e1723223982442.jpg

HASC leaders turn up heat on Space Force leadership over acquisition plans	House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., left, and ranking member Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., attend the House and Senate committee markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, November 29, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The leaders of the House Armed Services Committee are hitting at Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman about whether the Space Force is adequately building its acquisition workforce, according to a new letter obtained by Breaking Defense. In the letter addressed to Saltzman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R.-Ala., and Rep. Adam Smith, D.-Wash., respectively the chairman and ranking member of the HASC, say they are concerned Saltzman and his team are too focused on boosting operators inside America's youngest military branch: 'We fear a divide that elevates operators at the detriment to other core functions of the Space Force will have negative impacts, potentially not immediately, but as we look to 2030 and beyond,' the duo wrote. The letter, which is dated today, calls out that acquisition issues were notably absent in Saltzman's presentations last week during the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference, something the members say is a disconnect from the CSO's earlier effort to bring together acquisition and operational experts via new organizational structures called Integrated Mission Deltas. 'As we received your remarks last week at the Spacepower conference, the omission of acquisition, training and testing has raised some questions as to the previous focus on maintaining alignment across these areas. We believe this is needed to not only be successful in developing the next generation space warfighter, but also to ensure that the Service will have the skillset and workforce to design, develop, and acquire systems that Guardians are going to need in the future,' Rogers and Smith wrote. The letter echoes remarks made by Rogers earlier today at a Space Force fifth birthday event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) — likely a sign that the HASC leadership is comfortable making their frustrations with Saltzman's emphasis on operators public. To that end, the HASC leaders in the letter demand that the service provide answers to a series of questions about how acquisition expertise is being integrated into Guardian development and training. This includes providing a breakdown of what specialties are held by the officer corps by rank, 'to include operations (13S, 14N, 17X), engineering (62E), and acquisition (63A).' Further, the Space Force is tasked to describe how the new integrated deltas 'will be staffed with the required acquisition personnel beginning in 2026;' what acquisition training and development programs are being provided to junior officers; and how the service is planning to recruit, train and retain acquisition officials.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hasc-leaders-turn-up-heat-on-space-force-leadership-over-acquisition-plans/	2024-12-17T11:37:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/roger-smith-scaled-e1734463410948.jpg
Hanwha adds Coulter as global defense head	UKRAINE &#8211; 2024/05/12: In this photo illustration, Hanwha Group logo is seen on a smartphone and on a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As it works to expand globally, South Korea’s Hanwha is bringing over Michael Coulter from Leonardo DRS to take a newly-created role of Global Defense CEO. Coulter, in this new role, will 'be responsible for overseeing the global defense businesses of Hanwha Aerospace and its subsidiaries such as Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Systems,' according to a Dec. 15 announcement. Hanwha 'aims to strengthen its strategic position by delivering integrated land, sea, and air solutions in key global markets, particularly the United States,' the announcement adds. Coulter recently was Leonardo DRS’s senior vice president of corporate business development. A Navy reserve officer, Coulter also held several Pentagon and State roles in the 2000s. 'Serving in the industry, I've been impressed by Hanwha’s continued growth as a leader in aerospace &amp; defense and the commitment to deliver for its customers,' Coulter said in a statement. 'As a combat veteran with a career devoted to security cooperation of allies and partners, I am committed to the mission of this great company to provide global security, industrial capacity, and solutions for the brave men and women who protect our freedoms.' Hanwha has been making global inroads in recent years, and has been eyeing expansion inside the United States as a priority. That includes buying Philly Shipyard earlier this year, with an eye on Naval contracts in the future.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hanwha-adds-coulter-as-global-defense-head/	2024-12-17T10:54:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240829_hanwha_sign_GettyImages-2152136253-scaled-e1724941769790.jpg
Hypersonic missile defense deserves predictable and sustainable funding	An early Glide Phase Interceptor design concept. (Missile Defense Agency) On Nov. 21, Russia’s Vladimir Putin gave the West a clear window into his strategic thinking and intent. By using the 'Oreshnik' missile against Ukraine — a weapon Putin claims is a 'hypersonic' threat, although analysts are mixed — he not only demonstrated his willingness to use the advanced parts of his arsenal, but also the unprecedented capability they represent. Afterwards, Putin bragged that the weapon is immune to missile defenses. Putting aside the question of whether this is a 'true' hypersonic weapon, his broader point is correct: As of this moment, the US has no real defenses against a hypersonic threat. Earlier this year, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) was forced to an unfortunate decision regarding its Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program, which is supposed to provide America’s first defense against hypersonic glide vehicles. The reasons for and the consequences of that decision should serve as a cautionary tale for both the next Congress and incoming administration, especially if our country is to take serious weapons currently in the hands of adversaries like Mr. Putin. In the past, MDA had touted its commitment to its own 'best acquisition practices,' which included 'fly before you buy' and extending corporate competition deeper into the acquisition process. However, GPI had an early 'downselect' decision, picking one corporate contractor as the winner for the program and ending the competition. The decision came five years earlier than planned, before even an evaluation of the competing teams’ Preliminary Design Reviews. This is highly unusual. Lt. Gen. Heath Collins, the MDA Director, described the decision as 'resource driven.' This is Pentagon code for when the Department of Defense is presented with an arbitrary top line budget number — devoid of study, analysis, or overarching strategy — and then forced to fit its entire spending under that ceiling. In a recent interview, Collins stated, 'As we came into [FY] 25, the Fiscal Responsibility Act … put pressure on the entire department to make really tough prioritization and resource-informed decisions.' For GPI, a highly probable consequence of this early downselect decision is an unpredictable funding stream for the program. This, compounded with its relative programmatic immaturity and the potential for developmental challenges, raises concern about when the warfighter can expect GPI’s capability in their hands. As Masao Dahlgren from the Center for Strategic and International Studies has stated, 'downselecting so early in the development process adds risk — if any delays come up, there won’t be a competing design to choose.' This effort is currently represented by the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) satellite capability, two of which were launched into orbit this past February. To ensure full and complete compatibility between the interceptor and the sensing and tracking system, these capabilities must be developed in parallel, so as to inform the design and final configuration of both. In the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress mandated an early, terminal phase initial operating capability against hypersonics be provided by 2029. This interim solution is prudent, but this initial rudimentary system — aptly termed a 'gap-filler' — must not be allowed to compete for budget with the fully operationally capable GPI vehicle required by 2032. Two distinct and adequate funding streams are essential. Back in April 2023, Rep. Doug Lamborn, Chairman of the House Strategic Forces Subcommittee, spoke to the importance of these programs when he said, 'Given the rapid pace with which our adversaries are pursuing and fielding hypersonic systems, I am eager to hear ideas from DoD on how to pull both HBTSS and GPI to the left.' While that may no longer be possible given the fiscal realities forced upon MDA, Lamborn’s sentiments certainly describe the absolute need not to allow either program to languish. The incoming Trump administration has already signaled its desire to re-prioritize missile defense in a way the current Biden administration has not. Congress should make common cause with the new administration and breathe new life into missile defense of the homeland and forward-deployed US assets by providing a stabilized and predictable funding stream for GPI. The budget should be adequate for development and testing, and be resilient enough to weather the inevitable challenges any new program will encounter. Sufficient funding is the key to securing an acquisition timeline to field a fully operationally capable GPI by 2032. The stakes are indeed very high, and if Mr. Putin has shown us anything, it is that there is no time to waste. Major General Howard 'Dallas' Thompson (US Air Force – ret.) is a former Chief of Staff at NORAD and NORTHCOM.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hypersonic-missile-defense-deserves-predictable-and-sustainable-funding/	2024-12-17T10:54:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-19-at-5.31.16-PM-e1734125879645.png
Rep. Pat Fallon introducing bill to block DoD IT contracts with Chinese entities (Exclusive)	Keyboard with China flag key (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon plans to introduce a bill today that will prohibit the Department of Defense from doing information technology-related business with Chinese entities, Fallon tells Breaking Defense. The bill, titled the 'Safeguard American Innovation Act,' would ban the Secretary of Defense from 'entering, renewing, or extending an IT contract' with companies that have specific ties with the People’s Republic of China, according to a preview of the bill sent to Breaking Defense before its release. 'The ‘Protecting American Innovation Act’ is vital to securing our nation’s technology and deterring foreign threats, particularly from China. Recent cyberattacks like SolarWinds and Salt Typhoon have shown how vulnerable our defense and IT systems are to foreign interference,' Fallon, a House Armed Services Committee member, told Breaking Defense in an email. 'This bill will take action to prevent this by blocking any Department of Defense (DOD) contracts with companies tied to China that could jeopardize our national security.' With the 118th Congress ending in just a few weeks, this iteration of the bill is effectively dead on arrival. But Fallon said he is introducing the bill now so it will be a priority in the next Congress, and a spokesperson said the plan is to reintroduce the language once the 119th Congress is up and running. 'Along with the return of President Trump’s leadership, Rep. Fallon’s intention going into the 119th Congress is to ensure US equities are protected from the PRC influence to prevent what we saw with Salt Typhoon and Solar Winds. Innovation is our main asymmetric advantage and Congress needs to protect that at all costs,' the spokesperson said in an email. According to the proposed language, the Secretary of Defense will be barred from doing business with IT companies that are characterized as the following: Fallon, who serves on the HASC's subcommittee for Cyber, Innovative Technologies and Information Systems, said that one major concern he has with the DoD doing IT business with Chinese entities is due to the fact that 'China’s laws force companies to share sensitive technology, including software source code,' adding that this 'poses a serious risk.' 'By banning contracts with companies that operate in China, are funded by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), or allow China access to critical code, this bill helps ensure our IT infrastructure remains secure and our technological advancements stay out of adversaries' hands. This legislation is essential to protecting American innovation, keeping our military safe, and maintaining US technological leadership,' he added. Related: Chinese sanctions on US drone firm were ‘signal’ about supply chain weaknesses: DIU official Fallon’s bill to address IT concerns comes after several years of rising anxiety from the Pentagon and lawmakers that the US supply chain is still interwoven with Chinese entities. There have been efforts to get at this problem. For example, in 2020 the Defense Innovation Unit launched its Blue UAS program, a 'holistic and continuous approach that rapidly vets and scales commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology for the Department of Defense (DoD)' in part to ensure parts don’t come from adversaries. And on the Congressional side, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act states that beginning on Oct. 1, 2027, no funds appropriated or made available for the DoD can be spent to procure a battery produced by the listed Chinese-owned and -operated companies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rep-pat-fallon-introducing-bill-to-block-dod-it-contracts-with-chinese-entities-exclusive/	2024-12-17T07:59:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_cybersecurity_china_keyboard_GettyImages-184947489-scaled-e1677516091595.jpg
Lithuania agrees to purchase 44 Leopard 2 tanks in country’s largest-ever defense deal	An Leopard Tank of the Bundeswehr Panzerlehrbrigade 9 (9th Armoured Demonstration Brigade) during a presentation of capabilities by the unit on May 20, 2019 in Munster, Germany. (Photo by Morris MacMatzen/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Lithuania has signed off on plans to procure 44 Leopard 2 tanks, in what the Lithuanian government is calling the single largest defense acquisition project in the country’s history. Minister of National Defence Dovilė Šakalienė signed the documents on Monday while visiting with German defense minister Boris Pistorius in Berlin. While costs and delivery dates were not made public in the statement, Šakalienė told the Baltic News Service that the goal is to have the tanks by 2030. 'The agreement on Leopard acquisition is the largest contract Lithuania has ever signed. It is a pivotal stage of modernizing our armed forces and strengthening the regional security,' Šakalienė said in a statement, according to an online translation. 'The new tanks will facilitate integration and interoperability of [the] Lithuanian and German militaries.' The Leopard, produced by Franco-German conglomerate KNDS, has seen a resurgence of interest since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company is pursuing new concepts for future Leopards, and won a large contract with Norway in 2023 — although that was scaled back months later. However, KMDS has seen strong competition in Europe from South Korean made vehicles. Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Dovilė Šakalienė and german defense minister Boris Pistorius signed an agreement on Leopard tanks on Dec 16 2024. (Lithuanian government) Lithuania, which shares borders with both Russian ally Belarus and the Russian territory of Kaliningrad, has increased its defense spending since the Ukraine conflict began. The previous government, which lost its election in October, promised to spend at least 3 percent GDP on defense starting in 2025, and Gitanas Nausėda, the long-standing Lithuanian president, was quoted by BNS as saying, 'I hope we can reach 3.5 percent, and in the near future, even 4 percent.' During her visit to Germany, Šakalienė also pledged that Lithuania remains committed to hosting a Germany brigade in Lithuania, near the Belarussian border. Lithuania is in the process of building out infrastructure for the 5,000 German soldiers and their families, something Šakalienė discussed with Pistorius, per the statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lithuania-agrees-to-purchase-44-leopard-2-tanks-in-countrys-largest-ever-defense-deal/	2024-12-17T07:25:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/germany_Leopard_2-scaled-e1694462454396.jpg
Rogers warns Space Force leadership not to overly prioritize operations	Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. (Credit: Andrew Harnik/AP Photo/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As the Space Force nears its fifth birthday on Dec. 20, one of its strongest proponents in Congress is warning the service has spent too much focus on training operators for a future fight at the expense of developing technology and acquisition experts within the Guardian cadre. 'The Space Force has to be led by more than just operator. A deep understanding and connection with technology is at the core of the Space Force,' said Rep. Mike Rogers, R.-Ala., in written remarks obtained by Breaking Defense ahead of his speech today at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'Operators, acquisition, intel, and cyber professionals must all be on equal footing,' While welcoming the push by Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman (and his predecessor, Gen. Jay Raymond) for 'building a warfighting culture and normalizing space as part of the joint fight,' Rogers stressed that at the same time 'the development of acquisition and other professionals is just as important. 'After all, what are those operators going to operate if acquirers aren’t acquiring?' asked Rogers, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee. 'The House Armed Services Committee is going to be keeping a close eye to ensure that the Space Force is paying adequate attention to imbuing Guardians with acquisition skills,' a congressional source told Breaking Defense. One of the primary reasons Rogers was an early proponent of the service's creation was the pressing need for space acquisition reform, the source noted. Indeed, Rogers and his former counterpart, now-retired Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., led a bipartisan effort to create the first civilian Space Acquisition Executive (SAE) at the Pentagon to help consolidate oversight of the myriad entities with space systems buying power. In his speech today, Rogers also advocated for growing the Space Force in order to meet the ever-increasing threats from China and Russia. However, doing so doesn't necessarily mean 'a wholesale increase in end strength,' he said. Instead, he suggested that both the Air Force and the Defense Department writ large 'transfer' some of their personnel billets over to the Space Force — a move that would surely cause push-back from the offices that would lose personnel. He also argued for more budgetary investment in the newest military service, citing both the growth in its mission areas and the highly technical nature of space operations that requires constant innovation. That said, Rogers cautioned that Congress does not want to be in the position of throwing good money after bad. 'We can no longer afford to wait 8-plus years to develop requirements, and conduct long drawn-out competition processes. Nor can we afford these endless cost-plus development contracts,' he said. Rogers praised the progress on this front made so far by Frank Calvelli in his role as the first SAE, but said it is not enough. 'The Department must be more agile and continue to use every lever that has been given to it by Congress to 1) increase competition on these programs; 2) minimize requirement changes; 3) buy commercial; and 4) find ways to partner and draw more non-traditional companies into the defense market,' Rogers said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rogers-warns-space-force-leadership-not-to-overly-prioritize-operations/	2024-12-17T06:17:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/rogers-scaled-e1692899918123.jpg
Portugal seals order for 12 A-29N Super Tucano aircraft	Concept art of a Portuguese Air Force A-29N Super Tucano (Embraer) BELFAST — Portugal has ordered 12 A-29N Super Tucano aircraft from Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, in a deal valued at €200 million ($210 million). The company announced in a Monday statement that it had signed an agreement with the Portuguese Ministry of National Defense for the acquisition and added Lisbon will become the launch customer of the NATO standard version of the light attack and training plane. 'This acquisition reflects Portugal’s commitment to modernizing its Air Force with a versatile and proven aircraft, ideally suited for Advanced Pilot Training, Light Attack, Close Air Support (CAS) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions,' said Embraer. The order for the aircraft sits under Portugal's Close Support Aircraft program, one of eight major equipment projects prioritized by the country's Military Programming Law, a multiyear defense spending plan. In line with operational requirements, Embraer stressed that the new Super Tucano's will be equipped with 'advanced avionics, NATO-specific communications systems and other non-disclosed new capabilities.' Embraer has been marketing a NATO-specific version of the A-29, a light- attack prop plane, for several years, but Portugal marks the first customer to sign on. The Portuguese Air Force has been left with an advanced trainer capability gap since retiring Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets in 2018. Portugal's Council of Ministers officially approved the order last week and shared that the acquisition, as a whole, will also include 'a flight simulator, logistics, support, goods and services,' according to an online translation of a government statement. 'The project will involve a strong participation of Portuguese industry in highly technological areas, with a view to reconfiguring the aircraft to NATO standards and specifications,' added Lisbon. Foi hoje assinado o contrato de aquisição de 12 aviões #SuperTucano que vão no futuro equipar a #ForçaAérea. Esta aeronave será empregue em missões de apoio aéreo próximo bem como formação avançada de pilotagem.

A select group of local Portuguese aerospace companies are set to be involved in development and systems integration of the aircraft, based on a prior Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). That agreement was signed in April by Centro de Engenharia e Desenvolvimento de Produto (CEiiA), Empordef Tecnologias de Informação, S.A. (ETI), GMVIS Skysoft, S.A. (GMV) and OGMA S.A. The latest Super Tucano order also strengthens Brazilian and Portuguese defense co-operation, building on Lisbon's 2019 order for five KC-390 Millennium tankers, the second of which was delivered in June. Embraer on Tuesday also announced the establishment of a new Portuguese subsidiary, Embraer Defense Europe, aimed at supporting 'strategic objectives in creating relevant and cutting-edge defense and security solutions for customers in Europe and NATO.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/portugal-seals-order-for-12-a-29n-super-tucano-aircraft/	2024-12-17T05:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/A-29N-SUPER-TUCANO-FAP-scaled-e1734441846914.jpg
For artificial intelligence to be mission-critical, it must hallucinate less	The Air Force CIO and Air Force Research Laboratory are accelerating initiatives to provide Guardians, Airmen, and contractors the ability to responsibly experiment with Generative AI, with adequate safeguards in place. (U.S. Air Force graphic). The Defense Department has doubled down on a data-driven military empowered by artificial intelligence. The use of AI for mission-critical applications for national defense, however, has been hindered by one reason in particular – hallucinations. Hallucinations happen when large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. It’s not uncommon for LLMs to hallucinate as often as 1 in every 10 responses, according to a study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. It’s that 10-percent error rate that’s slowed a fuller potential for AI in the DoD. Now, however, there’s a new software solution called Retrieval Augmented Generation Verification (RAG-V) that addresses hallucinations in LLMs by drastically reducing their occurrence. Introduced by Primer, which builds practical and trusted AI for complex enterprise environments, RAG-V nearly eliminates hallucinations by adding a novel verification stage. John Bohanon is vice president for data science at Primer. 'RAG-V makes it possible to take a Large Language Model and put it into a mission-critical setting so warfighters can rely on it; that's the heart of the matter,' said John Bohanon, vice president for data science at Primer. 'In some settings you want hallucinations; it's called creativity, such as when you want ideas for throwing a party. These models are very creative and come up with stuff out of thin air. 'The dark side is if you're using it in a setting where factuality matters in getting answers to questions, hallucinations can be bad – especially when they're subtle. When it's an obviously incorrect piece of information, it's easy for a human to catch it. The dangerous thing is when the model’s confident and it looks correct, but it’s a hallucination saying it in such a plausible, credible way that it can fool you.' Primer works by incorporating a verification step akin to fact checking that grounds the LLM's responses in substantiated data sources, reducing the above-mentioned error rate from around 5-10 percent – which is the state-of-the-art for leading LLMs – to just 0.1 percent. This dramatic improvement in reliability is critical for applications where factual accuracy is paramount, enabling warfighters and analysts to trust the AI-generated insights and make time-sensitive decisions with increased confidence. Beyond detecting hallucinations, RAG-V also provides detailed explanations of any errors, allowing the system to iteratively improve and further enhance trust. Primer's approach represents a significant advancement in responsible AI development, addressing key challenges around transparency and accountability that are essential for the adoption of these transformative technologies in the defense sector. RAG-V reduces hallucinations High-profile AI hallucinations have already made the news, especially in the legal profession where a lawyer submitted a court brief partially created with ChatGPT that invented case law. It’s not a mystery why hallucinations happen, though. They’re caused by the way LLMs are trained. Even though they seem to be a mysterious piece of new science, they're trained in a relatively simple manner that’s like a game of fill-in-the-blank. The LLM is fed text, for example, with some of the words hidden and the model fills in the blanks. Do that billions of times and the LLM becomes very good at putting words together – just not always the right words. What the model's trying to do is generate words that seem as high probability as possible, and read like they would’ve been written by a human. A partial solution for hallucinations came on the scene in 2021 called Retrieval Augmented Generation – without the verification part created by Primer – that mitigated hallucinations down to the level they’re at today. RAG works by retrieving relevant information from a trusted system of record and then including it in the prompt for the generative model. The prompt also instructs the model to answer the user’s question only on that retrieved data without filling in the blanks. Even with RAG, these models don’t always follow direction and still make errors and hallucinate. What Primer has done to bring down hallucinations to the point where trust can be restored on the part of the user is add a new, last step that fact checks the data against verifiable sources – hence the verification in RAG-V. With RAG-V, warfighters executing mission-critical applications can now add a trustworthy LLM capability to their toolkit in these times of great competitors also developing advanced AI capabilities where operations across multiple domains and at the edge are needed. Matthew Macnak is senior vice president of customer solutions engineering at Primer. 'In order for us to stay ahead of competitors like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea – all of whom are using LLMs – our AI at its core is about helping the end users do something more efficiently by doing it with less effort in a faster manner,' said Matthew Macnak, senior vice president of customer solutions engineering at Primer. 'Primer is a full platform; it’s not just powered by an LLM so we can actually take a version of that into the field and still have the ability to process massive amounts of unstructured information with fewer personnel and more reliability due to RAG-V. 'Imagine that we can put our AI systems into something the size of a suitcase and then place it on an aircraft that's doing ISR missions. Now you have a few operators able to ingest, let's say, thousands of voice or text collects and analyze that information in real time rather than just collecting the data, going back, and waiting for the data to be analyzed. Now they can have a result in situ rather than waiting on someone else to tell them what to do.' More trust, fewer hallucinations Even with RAG, Large Language Models have error rates so bad – typically 5-10 percent of the time – that they can’t be trusted for many defense applications, as highlighted. The rate depends on the data and what questions are being asked of the LLM, but that makes them unacceptable for intelligence operations, for example. 'If you have something that's going to fib one out of every 10 times you ask it a question, that means that you have to check its work every single time,' noted Bohanon. 'You have to be hypervigilant and therefore that's a deal breaker in a setting where you're using this to actually augment a human. When the stakes are high, you can't afford to have to use a tool that you can't trust.' When it comes to LLMs, Bohanon suggests being a skeptical buyer. When an analyst’s need to brainstorm can be addressed with ChatGPT, for example, they’re likely in safe territory regarding hallucinations. But if the need is mission critical with high stakes, users should be wary of LLMs without a final step for verification and fact checking. 'Even when they're used with best practices like RAG and other guardrails for Large Language Models, they still have an unacceptable error rate. Potential users should come in with the mindset that this technology is new and there's only a few shops out there like Primer that are taking that problem seriously.' Added Macnak: 'We’ve all heard ‘trust but verify.’ The valuable part of RAG-V is that it allows the user to see exactly why it made a decision and more importantly how that output was verified. Our focus remains on the end user, whether that's an analyst, operator, or warfighter. 'To that end, we're building products and technology around those individuals that actually work in order to serve them. The 0.1 percent error rate we’ve reached with RAG-V is a great example of why we're doing this for users making mission-critical decisions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/for-artificial-intelligence-to-be-mission-critical-it-must-hallucinate-less/	2024-12-17T05:25:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/THEAIR_1.jpg
Poland acquires General Atomics MQ-9B SkyGuardian in $310M deal	Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, announces a deal to buy American MQ-9 SkyGuardian drones. (Poland's MND) WARSAW — Poland has signed off on a $310 million purchase of MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones from General Atomics. Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, signed the documents on Dec. 12. While the agreement is the first purchase from Poland of the SkyGuardian — the name for General Atomics’ Reaper — Warsaw has been operating similar drones since February 2023, when the country entered into a $70.6 million lease with General Atomics for MQ-9A Reapers. Warsaw didn’t initially disclose the number of systems purchased, but a Monday press release from GA-ASI announced Poland purchased three MQ-9Bs and two Certifiable Ground Control Stations (CGCS), as well as three years of GA-ASI’s SkyGuardian Global Support Solutions. Poland will acquire three #MQ9B SkyGuardians to serve as its primary intelligence, surveillance and recon capability, joining a growing network of operators that includes the United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, India and the U.S. Read here: https://t.co/O6GXxUQYlv pic.twitter.com/ld4EXZ5iCD &mdash; GA-ASI (@GenAtomics_ASI) December 16, 2024 'This is a significant expense, but we are investing in the highest quality equipment,' said Kosiniak-Kamysz. He stated that the plan is for deliveries by first quarter 2027, 'However, we hope that this will happen sooner, which is what we are seeking from our proven partners.' A GA-ASI representative stressed after ceremony, 'It is possible that the delivery will be accelerated, because one of the first SkyGuardians intended for Poland has already been almost completed at the GA-ASI plant in San Diego.' 'This is an investment in Polish security and cooperation with a strategic partner — the United States. Poland is not only investing in the arms industry, but also strengthening economic relations with allies,' Kosiniak-Kamysz added.

The SkyGuardian comes with auto-takeoff and landing under SATCOM-only control, and can operate in unsegregated airspace. According to GA-ASI, the MQ-9B has seen contracts signed with 'Belgium, Canada, the Japan Coast Guard, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, Taiwan, India, and the U.S. Air Force in support of Special Operations Command.' The SkyGuardian purchase comes months after Kosiniak-Kamysz announced the creation of a so-called 'Drone Force,' following the model that Ukraine created earlier this year. (Earlier today, Russian defense minister Andrey Belousov also called for the creation of a drone-focused military branch.) 'A few months ago, I announced the creation of drone forces, which is becoming a fact,' Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'From January 1, 2025, drone forces will no longer be a plan, but a real part of the Polish Army. […] Building drone forces is an absolute priority for us. 'An effective deterrence and defense policy requires investment in this type of troops. On the one hand, we have simple drones that can be mass-produced, even using 3D printers, and on the other – the most advanced drones, such as the ones we are currently buying.' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/poland-acquires-general-atomics-mq-9b-skyguardian-in-310m-deal/	2024-12-16T12:47:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_poland_buys_mq9_BART-e1734381773849.jpg
Following delay, congressional panel on future US Navy can start work	Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group in the Atlantic Ocean, April 2019. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Maxwell Higgins) WASHINGTON — After more than a year of delays, a congressional commission focused on outlining the optimal size and composition of the future US Navy is set to begin work, according to sources familiar with the panel. The commission, originally empaneled in the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, was tasked by lawmakers to 'undertake a comprehensive study of the structure of the Navy and policy assumptions related to the size and force mixture of the Navy, in order— (I) to make recommendations on the size and force mixture of ships; and (II) to make recommendations on the size and force mixture of naval aviation.' The body’s final work was due earlier this year, but ultimately delayed as key lawmakers who were required to appoint individual members had not made their selections. A congressional aide told Breaking Defense the panel is now able to begin working. A second source also confirmed that 'work is underway now' and that 'all 8 members have been officially appointed.' Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was appointed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and selected earlier this month to co-chair the panel, according to the congressional record. Breaking Defense previously reported Mitchell Waldman, a defense and aerospace industry executive, and Bryan McGrath, a retired Navy officer, were both appointed to the commission. A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told Breaking Defense today the House Democrat tapped former Texas Congressman Filemon Vela as his pick. It was not immediately clear who else was appointed to the commission. Spokespeople for the relevant lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Breaking Defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/following-delay-congressional-panel-on-future-us-navy-can-start-work/	2024-12-16T11:49:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/BigFleet-e1648482411758.jpg
First delivery for Air Force One slides to 2029, source says	Airman First Class Emily Albright (center) prepares to set chocks around Air Force One's landing gear Thursday, Jan. 30, 2014. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by 1st Lt. Nathan T. Wallin/Released) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s troubled project to provide two new Air Force One jets is facing new delays, likely pushing the delivery of the first jet out to 2029 or even later, a source told Breaking Defense. The Air Force is still working to validate the schedule for when Boeing can deliver the militarized jumbo jets, meaning they might arrive even later than 2029, according to the source, who requested anonymity to share non-public information. 'It’s an honor to be entrusted with this responsibility and we take pride in this work,' Boeing said in a statement. 'Our focus is on delivering two exceptional Air Force One airplanes for the country.' Negotiated under the previous Trump administration, the Air Force One deal has proved painful for Boeing amid massive headwinds, including over $2 billion in losses and years of delays. The jet’s first flight was last scheduled for March 2026, Breaking Defense previously reported, a setback of an additional 16 months. The Wall Street Journal first reported the new delivery date. An Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that Boeing is expected to provide a new master schedule in the spring. Once that’s delivered, the Air Force will then 'conduct a schedule risk assessment to inform establishing revised' dates for key milestones, such as when the aircraft could be operational. Officials expected the program to be about two-to-three years late under the revised 2022 schedule, which set the delivery of the first jet for September 2026 but with a year of schedule margin. The second was set to be delivered in February 2027, also with a full year of wiggle room. It’s not clear specifically when the jets would arrive under a revised plan. Boeing has faced a slew of challenges refurbishing the two 747s under contract for the program, ranging from supply chain to workforce. The new lags mean President-elect Donald Trump — who personally intervened in negotiations for the two jets — likely won’t be able to fly on a new Air Force One before his second term concludes. The first jet was originally expected this year. Trump’s return to the White House could also change the aircraft’s design once again, from a white and light-blue hue to his original preference for white, red and dark blue, Politico previously reported. The Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the aircraft’s 'livery options' were finalized last year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/first-delivery-for-air-force-one-slides-to-2029-source-says/	2024-12-16T09:52:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Air-Force-One-e1734368967339.jpg

PC-C4 is a U.S. Army-hosted Joint and Multinational experiment integrating modernization capabilities and formations through persistent experimentation at multiple echelons for the future operating environment being held from February 24 &#8211; March 20, 2024. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Brahim Douglas) SAVANNAH, Ga. — The US Army has made upgrading its command and control capabilities a priority, but has shared relatively few details about how exactly they’re pursuing the sprawling project. But last week at the service’s biannual Technical Exchange Meeting, service officials dove deeper into plans for the next-generation C2 (NGC2) program, revealing among other details a tiered 'technology stack' the capability will be built on, and how industry can make it a reality. 'We're really, no kidding, trying to do this different[ly] than we've ever done it before without falling into some of the traps,' Mark Kitz, program executive officer of the Command, Control Communications-Network portfolio, told Breaking Defense. The plan can seem a bit complicated, as Army officials acknowledged, so they urged industry to keep an eye on the program’s ever-evolving characteristics of need (CON) document. 'It's not going to be one empirical document that drives us,' Gen. Patrick Ellis, director of the Army’s network cross-functional team, said on a TEM panel. 'There's going to be multiple in there. As we write those multiple documents, we're using that as our North Star to say, ‘Okay, this is what we're trying to design towards.’' (The document, first published in April, was last updated on Dec. 9.) The document won’t be the only thing that’s ever-evolving. Officials said they’re attempting to build as much flexibility into the acquisition process as possible, both to encourage creativity from vendors and to be able to drop those who aren’t cutting it. 'The government's actually not really good at building escape hatches into our contracts, and we need to be,' Alexander Miller, the senior advisor for science and technology and the chief technology officer to the Chief of Staff of the Army said during a panel. 'As much as we're talking about bringing on the right players, we're going to get rid of the wrong players. If we aren't being good teammates, and you aren't being good teammates, or somebody out there isn't being a good teammate, we don't want to team with them.' The technology stack, as described by Army officials and shown in a slide presentation at the TEM, was included in the CON document in order to 'drive home the importance that we have all of this in place,' Joe Welch, deputy to the commanding general at Army Futures Command, said during a panel. At the top of the stack is the application layer, which is responsible for user-facing applications like file transfer systems, web browsing, etc. — think anything that the user can see on the front end. Under the application layer is the operating systems layer, the software layer that underpins the user interface. Welch called this layer the 'integrated data layer' that’s responsible for 'the collection of services, data interfaces and data models that ultimately are supportive of those applications and allow applications to be built without having to rebuild services that other things may already be taking advantage of.' The third layer is the compute layer, which serves as the infrastructure layer that harnesses the processing power used to run the application and the operating systems layer. That may sound like fairly standard tech, but Welch said the compute layer 'is enormously more challenging when we start getting into the tactical operational environment.' Compute resources are not as readily available out in the field as they are at larger command posts or rearguard headquarters. 'It's a very hard optimization problem, and if it doesn't work, the applications and the services that I just mentioned, those top two layers, are not going to work either,' Welch said. The transport layer is at the bottom of the tech stack. This layer is responsible for managing the delivery of data between applications. It’s the way that data moves across the battle space, Welch said. As Breaking Defense has reported, battlefield bandwidth has emerged as an obstacle in data-rich and/or electronically contested environments. 'They could be WiFi. They could be radios, mesh networks. They could be pLeo [proliferated low-Earth orbit satellites]. They could be specially designed wave forms to minimize our electromagnetic signature. It could be all of the above, right? So that needs to work seamlessly as well,' he said. When finding the appropriate tools for the tech stack layers, Welch said the service needs to keep the standardization of application programming interfaces, or APIs, into account. 'A lot of the challenges we have with our systems today is that there is no standard way of communication between these layers. The layers are built in a disparate fashion, and there's also no communication between them. So that is a main focus area that we're going to have. The goal is open and standardized APIs, but the way that we achieve that is going to be very deliberate,' he said. The tech stack, as described last week, may not be the same one the Army wants next month or next year, however. Down the line, layers might be added as the service and its vendors establish what capabilities and requirements are needed through trial and error, Welch said. He emphasized that because of this, the service is going to write requirements that are less prescriptive, but still give industry enough of an idea of what the Army needs for NGC2. 'We're continuing to better describe the problem characteristics of the solution space, but still we are not getting prescriptive in a sense of, ‘This is the technology we need, this is the vendor we need to get it from,’ those types of things,' Welch said during an interview on the sidelines of the conference. 'It's still very much in the attributes of the solutions more so than the solutions themselves.' In another effort to create more flexibility in the program, the Army will not have one lead systems integrator for NGC2, but instead will have a few team leaders, Kitz said in an interview. 'Having competition and giving our users opportunities to prototype with more than one solution is potentially powerful, and it also stimulates industry investment, because there's more opportunities for industry. We certainly want to avoid this incumbency, right? We don't want an [integrator] who's going to lead us for the next 10 years, right? We want constant competition. We want constant new teaming.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-technology-stack-driving-the-armys-next-gen-c2-plans/	2024-12-16T09:43:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_DVIDS_george_c2_laptop_8298338-scaled-e1734368595302.jpg
Bring on the unstoppable rise of thinking war machines	GHWB Sailors perform a weapons trial on a Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) on the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77) during carrier qualifications. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Brandon Roberson) The war in Ukraine has demonstrated, once and for all, that drones are here to stay — but it has also underlined that battlefield communications are fragile and easily disrupted, leaving drones unable to receive their orders from their operators. The US military is developing ways to defeat pervasive signal jamming, but it should recognize there will be no silver bullet, and that there will be times when the jammers win. The solution: The military will eventually need more machines that can think like human soldiers, deciding autonomously what to destroy and who to kill in ambiguous battlefield conditions. And to secure future battlefields, the Pentagon, and the public, will need to get over its 'Terminator' fears and embrace reality. The Pentagon is working to mitigate the effectiveness of Russian signal jammers in Ukraine, trying to enhance the jam resistance of weapons systems provided to the Ukrainian military. As another method to defeat jamming, Ukrainian forces seem to be targeting electronic warfare systems themselves, using munitions that aim for equipment emitting jamming signals. The architecture of proliferated satellite constellations has offered some protection against jamming, but Russia is increasingly successful at degrading Starlink service and has consistently been able to disrupt many other signals — like GPS and drone command and control links. For navigation, military officials are also looking at GPS alternatives that do not use signals, like image-aided and laser scanner navigation technologies. This is a cat-and-mouse game between the jammers and the jammed, with both sides racing to develop technologies that defeat each other's latest and greatest capabilities. What works one week might be obsolete the next. And that means that human control — differentiating between enemy and friendly soldiers and civilians, enemy and friendly aircraft and civilian airplanes, among other battlefield variables in various weather conditions and during daytime and nighttime — can never be assured, even mission to mission. Hence, the need to limit direct operator control. Broadly speaking, automated decision-making for identifying and engaging targets is not a new concept. Existing weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, mines, torpedoes, as well as systems like the Phalanx radar-guided gun and Israel’s Harpy drone, make lethal decisions autonomously, albeit following a very tight script that probably falls short of being considered artificial intelligence. Though a magnetic underwater mine detonating is an automatic reaction to it coming near a metallic warship hull, the action — the 'decision' made — looks more like the instincts of a closing Venus flytrap than like human decision-making. For years, the United States has looked at ways to incorporate AI into weapon systems, but has shown hesitancy towards AI-enabled autonomous weapons making lethal decisions without a human in the loop. Improved electronic warfare techniques should create an added sense of urgency and a reason for US policymakers and military leaders to reassess that reluctance. Unlike the United States, neither Russia nor China appear to be circumspect about AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapons. Moreover, they are already collaborating on AI-powered weapon systems. Along with other weapons, Russia has been testing a tank-like robot which could conceivably one day operate autonomously, potentially making real-time decisions on the battlefield about what to shoot. China is developing a myriad of warfighting systems, like submarines and aircraft, that are designed to make decisions autonomously without a human in the loop. Other countries are taking a similar approach. For example, Ukraine is working to deploy swarms of automated drones that do not require communications with operators to identify and attack their targets. The Pentagon lags behind, despite the fact there are no laws [PDF] that prohibit the development or use of AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapon systems. Perhaps the best example is the Bullfrog counter-drone system, which would become the first publicly known AI-enabled autonomous lethal weapon used by the US military. This system is a leap beyond legacy ones like Phalanx, Harpy, or underwater mine because it's not just reacting to one input—like a radar signature, radio emission, or magnetic signature—but rather using sensors to comprehensively understand its environment, identify hostile drones, and make decisions based on its human-trained algorithms. But Bullfrog is the exception, unfortunately, and not the norm. The US military should focus more on AI-enabled autonomous lethal weapons, particularly ones focused on drones, developing the technology so that it meets military requirements and addresses ethical concerns. Like Bullfrog, such systems can be designed for two modes—one allowing a human in the loop and another with full autonomy—so that fully automated capabilities are only used when and where appropriate to battlefield conditions. It must be acknowledged that lethal autonomous weapons will make mistakes. But humans also make mistakes. And civilians, or simply the wrong targets, fall into the crosshairs of today’s weapons systems that are guided by humans. Whereas humans may be susceptible to emotions, such as revenge, in the heat of battle, a weapon system trained using machine learning would not. Arguably, this means that machines might even make more predictable and rational decisions than people on the battlefield. They will also have to operate 'alongside' human soldiers, so work will be needed to examine and optimize the human-robot battlefield relationship. And if the US develops these systems now, AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapon systems elsewhere are more likely to reflect American and allied respect and adherence to the law of war, not ceding first mover advantage to Russia and China. During a future war in which the US military may not be able to consistently access parts of the radio spectrum, it will still need to offensively use uncrewed drones and defend against them, probably in very complex and fluid environments. Possession of AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapons will probably make Russia and China more eager and willing to jam as much radio spectrum as possible, because they will not need it for the tactical fight on the battlefield. If human soldiers find themselves cut off from communications with commanders, they can survive and win. If remotely operated machines are cut off, they do not work. The United States should focus on developing AI-enabled machines, particularly aerial drones and counter-drone systems, that can think, fight, and destroy without human direction. There is no reason to delay efforts to design and build algorithms and autonomous lethal warfighting systems that meet military needs and adhere to US values and principles. Otherwise, the United States cedes a huge battlefield advantage to Russia and China.

China’s remote sensing buildup risks US national security: Congressional commission report	A Long March-4C carrier rocket carrying a new Earth observation satellite blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on Aug. 21, 2023.

(Photo by Wang Jiangbo/Xinhua via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A new report for Congress's US China Economic and Security Review Commission warns that China's rapidly expanding remote sensing capabilities already have raised risks to US national security, as well as created economic challenges. The report, shared with Breaking Defense ahead of its formal release, is authored by the OTH Intelligence Group and entitled 'China's Remote Sensing.' The bipartisan China Economic and Security Review Commission was created by Congress in 2000 to provide recommendations to Congress on the security implications of the US-China trade relationship, and has been influential in shaping member concerns about Beijing's economic policies. The OTH report was designed as a discussion paper both for members of the commission and Congress, a commission spokesperson told Breaking Defense. And while its publication does not represent endorsement by the commission, recommendations from similar reports in the past also have found their way into the commission's annual report to Congress, the spokesperson added. The key findings of the report states that 'China’s development of advanced remote sensing poses current and long-term risks to U.S. security,' including: 1) 'continued advancement of PLA military modernization by strengthening its abilities to observe, detect, track, and target U.S. and allied assets and personnel through both dedicated military sensing and dual-purpose civil government and commercial remote sensing capabilities; 2) the potential for China to gain an entrenched advantage in remote sensing platform and technology areas vital to the growth of emerging market areas, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, commercial satellite remote sensing and the space economy, and small UASs [uncrewed aerial vehicles].' In addition, the report finds that 'China is currently leading the world in research impact in several remote sensing technology areas, including applications of multispectral and hyperspectral imaging sensors, radar, and satellite positioning and navigation.' Beijing also is streaking ahead in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance its remote sensing chops, the report added. For example, 'reporting from April 2024 revealed that China’s Taijing-4 03 satellite, which is equipped with AI processors for rapid detection and identification of targets at sea, captured detailed images of three U.S. aircraft carriers, two Arleigh Burke-class warships, and four other vessels at U.S. Naval Station Norfolk. Taijing-4 03 is part of a five-satellite constellation operated by Chinese commercial remote sensing company MinoSpace, reflecting the connections between the PLA and China’s emerging commercial remote sensing industry.' The findings echo concerns expressed by a raft of top Space Force brass at last week's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., that the PLA will use the growing number of Chinese military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites and commercial remote sensing satellites to target US terrestrial forces. Among the report's 12 specific recommendations is a call for Congress to 'consider regulatory and financial measures to support the domestic remote sensing industry and incentivize investment in areas such as small drones and LiDAR [light detection and ranging] for autonomous systems and higher-risk next-generation remote sensing technologies such as quantum sensing.' This could be done, it elaborates, by 'expanding targeted funding for the National Science Foundation, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) as well as investment credits.' Another recommendation is that Congress 'encourage' the Defense Department to work more closely with allies to better understand how China might use its improve remote sensing capabilities in crises and conflicts, as well as how to reduce US and allied vulnerabilities. Further, the report suggests that Congress 'support DoD efforts to accelerate the procurement of commercial remote sensing from both the United States and allied nations,' and 'consider funding in future defense appropriation bills for measures that would mitigate the effects of improved Chinese remote sensing, such as counter-intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems, electronic attack and cyber capabilities, antiradiation ordnance, base hardening, close-in weapons systems, and air defense capabilities.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-remote-sensing-buildup-risks-us-national-security-congressional-commission-report/	2024-12-16T05:45:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/china-space-gaofan-scaled-e1734130323506.jpg
DoD authorizes first C2 gateway to modernize and update on its own for CJADC2	The ADSI C2 gateway from Ultra Intelligence &amp; Communications can communicate over dozens of tactical datalinks from Link 16 and NATO Link 1 to distributed systems datalinks. (Graphic courtesy of Ultra I&amp;C.) One of the holy grails of Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) is having a C2 system that can be interoperable between all services and partners. That means having a C2 gateway with the ability to communicate over dozens of tactical datalinks from Link 16 and NATO Link 1 to distributed systems datalinks. It means accepting a wide range of radar and sensor inputs to build a single integrated picture. And, of course, it must be cloud enabled with a containerized architecture that scales, and be software defined so it can be upgraded remotely for years to come without incumbent hardware costs. Far from unattainable, though, these capabilities are all present today in the C2 gateway called ADSI. At 2,500 sites in more than 35 countries, ADSI is well-known for connecting the global multi-domain battlefield, translating and sharing diverse communications protocols and coalition partner data sources. Newly modernized by Ultra Intelligence &amp; Communications (I&amp;C) for software-defined cloud-enabled C2 at the edge, and with the ability to constantly enhance mission effectiveness and interoperability through a continuous Authority to Operate (cATO), the ADSI of today is specifically engineered to support CJADC2 initiatives, enabling seamless coordination across concurrent, multi-theater support operations. 'As we look at what's happening in places like Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific, it's an incredibly complex threat environment that’s quickly evolving,' said Ultra I&amp;C Chief Technology Officer Randy Fields. 'Today we’re still using all of the sensors that have been fielded for the last 30 years, while constantly adding new sensors, software, air platforms, and drones. 'Managing that level of data for multi-domain operations is going to require a resilient gateway that enables interoperability between those fielded systems and the new systems that come online. That's the sweet spot for ADSI because we maintain connectivity with all the legacy and fielded systems, while being able to adapt our platform rapidly to onboard new data types very quickly.' Configuring tactical datalink interfaces on the fly Integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) along with its associated sensors and effectors is one area where complexity is growing exponentially, especially in the collection and processing of data necessary to counter threats from drones, ballistic missiles, and hypersonics. 'We are a core component within major missile defense systems and applications, and ADSI is one of the primary data routers to support interoperability with their sensors,' said Fields. 'It’s a broker to take in any type of data we can get access to through a new front-end open API that enables us to be very extensible rapidly. That lets us continuously expand our full library with new messages and data types to continue to be that trusted broker between new types and fielded systems.' The continued and expanding value of ADSI for C2 in multi-domain operations was recently demonstrated during the NATO-led Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exploration, Experimentation, Examination Exercise (CWIX) in Bydgoszcz, Poland, in mid-2024 – which brought together fielded, developmental, and experimental systems under a coalition umbrella. ADSI participated in the exercise as part of the Marine Corps Forces Europe and Africa team. It demonstrated forwarding and interoperability across coalition C2 systems by rapidly configuring tactical datalink interfaces to multiple nations on the fly. An operator views C2 data from Ultra I&amp;C's ADSI gateway on an Android Team Awareness Kit, ATAK. (Image courtesy of Ultra I&amp;C) Other accomplishments included facilitating data type conversions to enable integration of disparate systems by leveraging existing protocols, such as Cursor on Target (CoT) integration, CoT to Joint Range Extension Applications Protocol (JREAP-C) translation, JREAP-C forwarding and digital warfighting platform demonstration. This was all done with the latest, modernized version of ADSI, which unifies the best of breed for the 21 different instances of ADSI created for different customers into a single baseline product. Originally called the air defense system integrator, ADSI in its earlier incarnations was a processor that stood about chest-high that connected to radars and sensors with long cables. That’s all been modernized to be just purely software, deliverable as containers to rapidly field and reprovision in modern cloud-native environments. 'We are flying inside surveillance platforms, we are inside of ships, we're inside missile defense platforms, and we're across air operations centers in a number of enterprise locations,' said Fields. 'We're truly edge-to-enterprise. 'What's in our 2025 roadmap is for ADSI to continue to get smaller for use on mobile devices. Now that we're on containers, it's easier to get to the mobile device. We’re continuing to refine ADSI to make it easier to take that incredible capability and get it into some of these small platforms.' For legacy ADSI, Ultra I&amp;C provides the SyncNet8 serial-to-IP conversion appliance that enables fielded systems that are running analog to operate in a digital environment. That lets users keep their existing systems and stay interoperable, and also scale up in the future for any new systems and sensors that are brought online. The importance of a continuous ATO Earlier this year, ADSI became the first operational C2 gateway to earn a continuous Authority to Operate (cATO), enabling customers to quickly deploy into operational environments and maintain cybersecurity. Today it remains the only C2 gateway with an active cATO. 'Cybersecurity threats are evolving every single day,' said Fields. 'If I'm worried about my connectivity and the data that's on there, I would want to trust a platform that is earning its ability every day to be cyber secure versus another that is scanned periodically.' Continuous ATO lets Ultra I&amp;C push validated code into production on an ongoing basis, resulting in shorter development cycles, quicker feature deployment, and reduced cost while providing a more secure capability for mission operations. This modernization milestone also resolves existing interoperability challenges among a large volume of datalinks, setting a new standard for data utilization in support of mission success. The accreditation was achieved following rigorous evaluation through Second Front Systems’ Game Warden platform on the Operational Environment Data Integration Network (ODIN). Ultra I&amp;C is on systems that use DevSecOps pipelines and as new cybersecurity vulnerabilities are identified, the company has a fixed amount of time to respond. This is accomplished through secure cloud computing, and the ADSI cATO is also a historic first for a Cloud Based Command and Control (CBC2) gateway system. This enables operators to rapidly field ADSI and related system upgrades onto classified networks for immediate use. Enabling digital workflows in CJADC2 objectives Ultra I&amp;C’s ADSI is a software first, highly capable and flexible C2 system designed to meet the demands of modern warfare through enhanced interoperability, connectivity, and adaptability. It’s poised to be the backbone for data-centric operations and multi-domain operations, and is enabling digital workflows in CJADC2 objectives. Key capabilities of ADSI include: seamless data translation and transport across disparate systems and domains, including legacy and emerging platforms; advanced data brokering and AI-powered sense-making to amplify critical information for warfighters; and containerized and cloud-deployable architecture enabling scalability from tactical to enterprise levels. Finally, the continuous ATO and focus on cost-competitiveness through a software-centric approach sets ADSI apart in the world of command and control. 'To attack those CJADC2 objectives, you have to be open, scalable, and truly cost competitive in this environment,' said Fields. 'By focusing on a software-first solution, we’ve streamlined operations, reduced complexity, and improved quality through standardization. We’re positioned to better meet the need for the user across any cloud and any hardware environment with a highly competitive and modernized product.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/dod-authorizes-first-c2-gateway-to-modernize-and-update-on-its-own-for-cjadc2/	2024-12-16T05:29:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/The-ADSI-C2-gateway-from-Ultra-Intelligence-Communications-can-communicate-over-dozens-of-tactical-datalinks-from-Link-16-and-NATO-Link-1-to-distributed-systems-datalinks.jpg
Israel’s Ministry of Defense quintupled start-up funding in last year	It was full house at the Defense Tech Summit at Tel Aviv University on Dec. 11, 2024. (Seth J. Frantzman) TEL AVIV — The Israeli Ministry of Defense has significantly increased its investment in small companies and start-ups, pouring in approximately $168 million over an 11-month period — five times more than the year before. 'The deepening cooperation between DDR&amp;D [Directorate of Defense, Research &amp; Development] and Israeli startups increases local manufacturing independence and strengthens the Israeli economy,' the ministry said in a statement, adding that it has worked with 86 Israeli startups and small companies over the last year, in addition to another 200 firms with whom DDR&amp;D already worked. Such a focus on startups and small firms was evident here at the Defense Tech Summit, held at Tel Aviv University last week. Over two days the auditorium was often overflowing, where officials perused the latest innovations from the Israeli tech scene — including several that focused on topics of keen interest since the war with Hamas began last October, like counter-drone systems, medical tech and artificial intelligence. 'Israeli defense tech is at an unprecedented time of growth, due to a sharp rise in global demand and defense spending as well as battle-proven momentum. We see a need for technology in many areas related to global security, in order to drive digitalization, automation and efficiency,' Ilana Sherrington, Director of Global Partnerships for an organization called Startup Nation Central, told Breaking Defense. 'The number of new startups is on the rise, as well as more companies developing dual use applications — and investment is following this. With top talent and deep tech expertise, Israel is a natural hub for solutions in this area.' RELATED: Israel seeks to defang Syria, as 350-plus strikes destroy military sites and equipment The defense ministry’s focus on this subject was clear from the long list of officials who spoke, including presentations by Eyal Zamir, the Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense; Daniel Gold, the head of Israel’s DDR&amp;D; Avi Berger, the head of the space office at DDR&amp;D; and Moshe Patel, the head of Israel’s Missile Defense Organization. 'We are constantly examining how to intercept drones with other drones and take down enemy drones using nets. During the war, we worked with dozens of startups in the field. We created a methodology for integrating a startup in the field — something the world is still trying to figure out,' Gold said. On the second day of the summit, several smaller Israeli companies presented their technologies. The counter-drone firm Regulus, for example, discussed how recent conflicts around the world have illustrated the need for counter measures against various types of unmanned systems. RELATED: New tech, including drones carrying blood, help injured Israeli soldiers survive Spear, which makes cannister-launched loitering munitions, also discussed its vision for using multiple loitering munitions to observe and strike targets. The trend with unmanned systems and also the need to counter them has progressed to smaller munitions and also smaller systems that can be put on vehicles. Israel’s experience in places such as Gaza and Lebanon have illustrated the need not only for drones that can be easily deployed, but also the need to be able to defend against a wide variety of drones. Another trend in the presentations was an emphasis on medical technologies that can help in the field. For instance Xmetix showed off its 'smart tourniquet.' This was designed to be deployed easily enabling the tourniquet to be placed on an arm or leg by putting it on, then pulling a pin and pressing a button. The summit also included a discussion of a recent 'hackathon' where dozens of teams had competed to solve several challenges identified during the war. One of the issues was making a system that could help carry stretchers over complex terrain. Another system addressed the need to help constrict blood flow in a wound that is not on an extremity, meaning in the neck or some other critical area, so that wounded do not bleed out. Elsewhere, Sequoia Capital Global Partner Shaun Maguire said he sees sensors and AI as an area ripe for growth. 'Looking to the future, I expect we'll see enormous sensors for various uses, and Israel can lead this field. Israel is also powerful in the quantum field,' he said. 'I don't think Israel missed the AI train, and the race is still ongoing. On the contrary, Israel is among the leaders in the field, and Israeli companies are among the most successful companies in the sector.' Zamir, from the ministry, also highlighted AI’s increasing role. 'It is a revolution that brings new knowledge to every aspect of life, including defense capabilities. Whoever adapts first gets a massive advantage. If you are not all in technology, you will fall behind. This may sound visionary, but the future battlefield will allow swarms of mixed combat units – men and unmanned systems fighting together or fully autonomous units operating as one, capable of making their own decisions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israels-ministry-of-defense-pours-money-into-start-ups/	2024-12-16T04:05:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241213_israel_defense_tech_summit_FRANTZMAN-e1734100990768.png
Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon’s DOGE to wow	In this photo illustration, the Elon Musk's twitter account seen displayed on a mobile phone screen with a Dogecoin logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — At last week’s Reagan National Defense Forum, the Department of Government Efficiency was a hot topic. For some, the initiative — not, it should be noted, actually a department, but rather a backronym to get to DOGE, the favored meme of Elon Musk — is a curiosity, a group with unclear power or influence. For others, it represents a potential threat, either to their business or to their power centers — or a chance to make changes to a system that is designed to resist them. But with threats to make major cuts to the Defense Department, one thing is clear: There is an expectation that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, the two co-leads of DOGE, are going to try and shake things up. To get a sense of how the defense community views the effort, Breaking Defense has gathered a collection of notable quotes from last weekend’s event. The following have been edited lightly for clarity and brevity. Both Musk and Ramaswamy have indicated support for the idea that government can be run more like a business. But what do business leaders think about that? Industry figures were largely positive about the potential that the office could serve as a forcing function to make changes at the Pentagon. Chris Calio, RTX CEO: Efficiency is a good thing, I think. We're all looking for opportunities and I think that's got to be our general posture. I would balance it with capability — the capabilities that that we're all bringing to bear, you know, as well, given the threat environment that we're in. Dan Jablonsky, Ursa Major CEO: I was a lawyer at the Securities Exchange Commission, and they did a reform initiative, and one of those was to take out a layer and a half, almost two layers, of, sort of, bureaucracy in the middle layer. And it turned out we actually ended up bringing more cases faster. So I'm welcoming any targeted efforts to help make the US government more efficient. I know it's gonna be hard. Alex Karp, Palantir CEO: We have the world's most successful builder ever [Musk] looking at our institutions. Americans want to know institutions are efficient, safe, and correspond to their purpose. And you know there will be- I’m sure there'll be some rough patches, but I don't know how you do better than Elon looking at these things and, you know, I'm pretty supportive. RELATED: Elon and Vivek, we need to talk Defense Executive 1, speaking to Breaking Defense on background: I think generally, business-minded people driving outcomes is what we need in a lot of these organizations. So we'll see what Elon and Vivek do with DOGE. Whatever it is, it'll be fun to watch. Elon's generally pretty smart. He generally knows what he's talking about. Defense Executive 2, speaking to Breaking Defense on background: Nobody argues with the waste and the inefficiency of the Pentagon, right? You know, it's a long running joke. It's an organization that's got an $850 billion budget that has no money, right? You’re even seeing Democrats come out — Bernie Sanders was one who's like, I support DOGE for the DoD, right? There's just so much juice to squeeze for inefficiencies to open up, not just for [my company], but companies like this, that I am very excited about that. Because there’s just stupid shit that they do with no accountability to it. And specifically on like, the R&amp;D side of the services, it's really probably the worst. I think everybody wins. Including the service, because the service will be more streamlined and have faster outcomes. A number of lawmakers were asked about DOGE, either in interviews or during panels. What is interesting is that across party lines, the reaction was roughly the same: tentative hope that the office could help find real efficiencies or drive reforms, but also a clear concern that the two outsiders are going to be making decisions that fall more rightly into the hands of Congress, be they fiscal or policy. Sen Deb Fischer, R-Neb., Senate appropriator and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in an interview with Breaking Defense: It is always a good thing when an administration works with Congress. So I’m excited to be able to work with DOGE on the issues before us. But we have to be able to have, I think, a full understanding of what’s involved. So when I said ‘That’s our job to do that,’ it's because of all of, obviously, the classified briefings we participate in to be able to have the information, to understand the threats, to really understand what the needs are for this country to provide for our defense. So, once again, I look forward to working with the administration on that. I think there are ways we can find efficiencies. But I also will push really hard to make sure that we continue with programs we know work, that we know are necessary, that we know are necessary to defend this country. Sen. Angus King, I-Vt., member of the Senate Armed Services Committee: I think a program looking for efficiency is good. I think we should be doing that periodically, on a regular basis. My only concern is when you use the term 'efficiency' to talk about programmatic programs that may have a policy. In other words, efficiency is one thing, policy is something else. For example, what if they say, well, the Sentinel program is too expensive? There's a lot of thought and policy that goes into maintaining the three legs of the nuclear triad, and I'm not sure the cost should be necessarily the driving factor. Do you see what I mean? I don't mind Mr. Musk or others who are looking at efficiency and saying, Why do you have all those layers those kinds of things? That's fine, but I think there's a danger that they're implicitly, or maybe explicitly, going to be making policy decisions, [saying] 'we don't need to be doing this anymore.' I think that's a decision for Congress to make. Rep Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, on a panel: The problem with DOGE is it's two separate conversations that are being blurred into one. And the difference between those two conversations is profound. Conversation one is how can you make the government do whatever it does better and more efficiently. And gosh, that's important, and there's going to be a ton of bipartisan support for that. And I think that — I don't know anything about Ramaswamy per se — but Elon Musk, I know what he did at SpaceX. I think he's a well positioned person to have that conversation. How can you do think more efficiently and more effectively? The mistake is everyone's assuming that that is going to do anything to help us with our fiscal crisis. And that's the truly insane part of this conversation. You have to sort of forget basic budget math in order to believe that is true. … Maybe Elon Musk [has a magic wand], maybe he's going to save $2 trillion without hurting absolutely anything. No, he's not, sorry. I can stop that speculation. It's just not going to happen. I hope they make gov more efficient, the fiscal conversation is a hell of a lot more difficult. Smith, in a follow-up interview with Breaking Defense: The need for reform, and the fact that Elon Musk built SpaceX, and that was a company that really made a big difference in getting us to greater competition … He knows how to do it. But does the taking-vengeance-on-your-enemies and ego get in front of that? I don't know. I'm not optimistic. They seem to have pretty big egos about 'I spoke, therefore I'm right, and if you disagree with me, you will be purged.' I don't think that's an effective way to run something, certainly [it’s] not the way Elon ran SpaceX. So I hope that it's not the way that Trump and JD Vance and Elon and the others you know, choose to run the government at this point. But there's some bad early signs, and will they do it just to reward their friends and punish their enemies, as opposed to meeting the interests of the American people? American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Those least likely to dive into the DOGE debate? Unsurprisingly, it was Pentagon officials, who are preparing to navigate the next administration. Here, there seems to be tentative hope that change could be a good thing. Gen. Randy George, Army Chief of Staff: I'm all in favor of it. We've been on, we don't have a nickname for it or anything, but we've talking about process innovation in the Army for the last year. If it doesn't make us more lethal or our teams more cohesive, we have to be looking at, you know, should we be doing it? So I think we have to review everything that we're doing in that light. And again, I think that the tough thing is going to be, we also need to be flexible with our government workforce, and that has been, you know, that's going to be a challenge. We're going to have to make some adjustments on acquisition and how big those teams are, and as we give things to industry. And some of these changes are going to be hard, but I think we have to make them. Doug Beck, DIU head: You’ve been hearing from the guys who work at defense firms up here for the opportunity for rapid reform. And there are a few of those things that have to do with the intersection with Congress, between the administration and congress, where I think we could get to a lot more symbiotic relationship, for example with these portfolios of record, I’d love to go after something like that. And there are a whole set of places where there are silly, stupid, bureaucratic don’t-have-to-be there things that slow down a lot of what we’re talking about getting after that I think are ripe for someone going through and trying to clean that out.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/such-efficiency-very-defense-congress-industry-waiting-for-elons-doge-to-wow/	2024-12-13T12:01:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/doge-scaled-e1734035750743.jpg
Decentralizing battle data: CDAO, Anduril open tactical ‘mesh’ to third-party developers	Artificial intelligence AI research of robot and cyborg development for future of people living. Digital data mining and machine learning technology design for computer brain communication. (Getty images) WASHINGTON — As the US military embraces artificial intelligence and big data, the Pentagon is trying to wean itself from reliance on centralized mega-systems and instead empower frontline leaders at the 'tactical edge.' That’s why, last week, the Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Office (CDAO) awarded startup defense firm Anduril a $100 million, three-year contract to expand its Lattice Mesh. Lattice is a system that lets frontline forces rapidly access data from over a hundred different types of sensors — for example, to track incoming hostile drones — over existing tactical networks, without having to first relay that data through central processing hubs. Then, this week, Anduril released a Lattice Software Development Kit (SDK) that will allow other companies to build their own applications to run on Lattice Mesh, without having to get permission from Anduril. The company announced an initial list of 10 partners, ranging from startups like Apex (space systems) and Saronic (unmanned boats) to giants like Oracle and Textron. But in the future, an Anduril executive told Breaking Defense, any company can access the kit and write software for Lattice. 'We want to remove Anduril as any form of bottleneck … and allow anyone to be publishing [apps and data] to the Lattice Mesh,' said senior VP Thomas Keane. 'What the SDK allows is now for third parties to do it without relying on Anduril.' RELATED: Anduril could receive up to $100M for Space Surveillance Network upgrade It's a decentralized business model for a decentralized military system. It’s also a departure from traditional practice for both the defense industry and the Defense Department, which historically favor centralized mega-projects where a single lead contractor can achieve 'vendor lock' and keep competitors out for decades. But the recent Lattice Mesh announcements suggest the rise of a more open, flexible and adaptable approach. 'If we know anything about the future, it’s that we don't know that much about the future,' said CDAO Principal Deputy Margaret Palmieri. 'Technology is changing really fast, the mission space is changing really fast, and the combinations of capabilities that we need to bring together … require the Department to be much more agile than in the past.' In such an unpredictable world, Palmieri said, military programs must be able to bring on new capabilities quickly from whoever can provide the best tech in the least time. (CDAO’s acquisition model for this approach is formally called Open DAGIR). Releasing the SDK makes that adaptability possible for Lattice. 'We can use the data mesh back end that Anduril has, but we don't only have to rely on Anduril apps,' she told Breaking Defense. 'We can now invite other third-party app developers in from anywhere in the ecosystem that is our incredible advantage as a as a nation.' What’s in it for Anduril? While Keane didn’t say so outright, the firm is clearly betting that an open door on Lattice Mesh is good for business, much as Apple benefits from letting third parties develop applications for their iPhones: More third-party options make the underlying product more useful, so it sells better. Specifically, what makes Lattice useful to the military is that it lets frontline units access (or 'subscribe to') data feeds from a host of different sensors, Keane and Palmieri explained. Those sensors are operated by many different organizations, communicate over different networks, and use different, incompatible formats; so, historically, the intelligence they gather has to be sent back to a central hub for processing before it can be widely shared. But that process takes precious time that forces in combat may not have. It relies on long-range transmissions, communications satellites and other relays that a sophisticated adversary could jam or destroy. By contrast, Lattice Mesh gives a frontline unit its own digital 'translator' to talk to different sensors directly. It’s a bit like the golden droid C-3PO in Star Wars, 'fluent in over six million forms of communication.' That allows data sharing 'on the edge,' with many units talking to many sensors, without the delays and vulnerabilities of a centralized hub-and-spoke system. Today, after several years of closed-door experimentation with CDAO and limited deployments at operational Combatant Commands, Lattice Mesh now has translator algorithms for more than a hundred different types of sensors, Keane said, 'and we are adding new ‘languages’ every week.' But by releasing the Lattice SDK to third parties, he went on, Anduril lets other companies — drone makers, satellite operators, sensor manufacturers and more — build their own translators for their own products. The more companies do that, the more types of sensors the military can use Lattice for. This open-door, decentralized approach is not unique to Lattice Mesh. Indeed, Lattice is just one of several pieces of the military’s evolving capability to share intelligence and transmit orders across US and allied forces on land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — known as Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (CJADC2). Over time, the military has backed off from one-size-fits-all approaches to CJADC2. Instead of imposing a single universal data standard and a single mega-network, it’s moving towards a 'federated' approach that allows different systems for different niches but tries to make them all compatible. That wasn’t obvious from the start, Palmieri emphasized. 'When we started off in January of 2023, we thought … we could find one capability that would do all those things,' she told Breaking Defense. But through a series of quarterly Global Information Dominance Experiments, 'what we realized was that there wasn't a single data integration layer that you could select as best of breed across all those organizations and missions &#8230; What you needed at the strategic and operational level for data integration was different than what we needed at a tactical level.' When CDAO released the initial operational toolkit for CJADC2 — officially called the 'Minimum Viable Capability' and publicly announced in February — it focused on strategic coordination at the four-star Combatant Commands. But data-sharing tools for headquarters staff aren’t suitable for combat units, Palmieri said. Headquarters need huge amounts of information to produce detailed plans in hours or days; frontline commanders need much smaller volumes of data, but they need it right now. That second niche is where Lattice Mesh came in. 'The data mesh capability is not the answer for everything,' Palmieri said. 'What we found with the data mesh that Anduril provided was it was really good at that low-latency data exchange.' 'What CDAO asked us for is the ability to use this data in near real-time decisions at the edge,' Keane said. 'We measure time in seconds, not in hours or days.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/decentralizing-battle-data-cdao-anduril-open-tactical-mesh-to-third-party-developers/	2024-12-13T10:45:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_AI_robot_hand_laptop_GettyImages-1202870693-scaled-e1666716055157.jpg
Elon and Vivek, we need to talk about how to make DOGE successful	American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Dear Elon and Vivek, I know that many people want your ear right now. Your new commission, DOGE (very clever logo, BTW), has essentially carte blanche to propose reforms. Your teasers about major changes in the making are receiving a lot of attention. Here’s the challenge: History is littered with the wreckage of such commissions. Failure and irrelevance are the norm. If you want to avoid having your opportunity to reform the federal government become a punchline in the late-night talk shows, you need to be disciplined and systematic. So, here’s some advice from a long-time federal bureaucrat that might help you succeed. Schedule a briefing from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget … NOW. They would be delighted to share their expertise, because we are in a fiscal crisis. The deficit in fiscal 2024 was $1.6 trillion and is projected to rise steadily. Unfortunately, the recent political campaigns focused on how to spend more, not on fiscal sustainability. As a nation, we have decided to spend now and send the bill to our children and grandchildren. So, part of your job will be to create a sense of immediacy and convince Americans that it's worth making sacrifices today to safeguard their children’s fiscal future. You are throwing around huge numbers ($2 trillion in savings), which creates a lot of buzz but is red meat for fact-checkers. The brutal fact is that saving a lot of money in the federal budget requires going after entitlements. These, along with interest payments, comprise about 70 percent of the federal budget. If you want big savings, you need to follow the money, but entitlements are REALLY hard to change. Which means you need to remember that … It's all about trade-offs. In government, there are rarely pure wins. Someone or some group loses while another gains. Reforms are possible, but the constituencies will fight hard for their benefits. As we say in Washington, one person’s waste is another person’s vital national program. So be ready for bitter opposition. Fortunately, there are examples of successful reform efforts. For example, Congress agreed to five rounds of DoD base closures and realignments that reshaped the Pentagon’s base structure for the post-Cold War era and now save about $12 billion annually. This hurt the local communities in the short run. Most eventually recovered, but some never did. Not everyone benefits. In 1996, Congress passed welfare reform, which succeeded in reducing welfare rolls by encouraging work, supporting those transitioning to the workforce, and discouraging dependency. Your team should study these bipartisan successes. Don't expect much savings from cutting 'woke' programs. The president-elect and the Republicans in general campaigned against those programs. However, there's not much money there. Costs in DoD (which has about half the federal workforce) run about $100 million per year, with similar numbers in other agencies. That may sound like a lot, but it is a rounding error in a $6 trillion budget. Such cuts may be emotionally satisfying for conservatives, but they are not significant as a budget issue. 'Woke' is a policy issue. Focus on a few big things. You won't have time to dig into every corner of the federal operation. So, after your initial research, focus on a few big things that you want to change and go after them with specifics and in depth. Three to five is a good number for audiences to grasp without getting lost. Too many more than that and the effort loses focus. If you list 'the top 30 actions the government should take,' people’s eyes will glaze over by the time you get to seven or eight. Build a consensus and develop allies. I recognize that down at Mar-A-Lago, the talk is all about mandates and landslides. President-elect Trump's victory was impressive and much greater than had been expected; He won all the battleground states, and Republicans will have control of Congress. But the popular vote was only 51 percent to 49 percent. The Republicans did extraordinarily well in Congress but hold very thin margins in both houses, three in the Senate and about three in the House (depending on appointments). To put that in perspective, Obama had an eight-seat margin in the Senate and a 69-seat margin in the House when he rammed through his health and stimulus packages. You will not be able to make reforms with brute political force.

(Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue) Get tight with Congress. You need allies in Congress because Congress will need to authorize many of your proposals and can stymie most of the rest if it chooses. Make them an ally because you don't want them as an enemy. A strong congressional relations group in your organization will be critical, but members will want to talk to you directly. They like being consulted, so take time to build some relationships. You have already started that process — excellent. Getting tight with them is not just about establishing a close relationship. Hoisting a few drinks in a relaxed environment (juice for Vivek) will help discussions about difficult issues. Reach out to the broader community. Everyone in Washington LOVES to be consulted. It feeds our sense of self-importance. There’s also a lot of experience out there that you could harness. So have a series of lunches and dinners with former officials, academics, journalists, and think tank scholars. You will get a lot of good ideas and maybe avoid some pitfalls that hurt previous efforts. At the least, you will have a chance to lay out your vision and maybe co-opt some potential criticism. Remember — these people will be writing the op-eds on your efforts and shaping public opinion. Stay close to the president and the White House. Right now, you have his enthusiastic support, and that is critical for success. However, the tides of politics can shift. If you appear to be proposing ideas that the president opposes or that are causing too much political blowback, that support will fade. You have already had a peak at what presidential anger looks like. Reduce the federal workforce by eliminating the work. Making arbitrary across-the-board cuts is tempting because specifics get complex and controversial. However, arbitrary cuts will just shift the work to contractors. Government won't get smaller or cheaper, just less visible. If you want to shift work to the private sector, reestablish the A-76 process, which sets up a formal mechanism for moving work from government to private industry. It was widely and successfully used in the Clinton and Bush administrations until shut down by the Obama administration. Reducing regulations and eliminating functions will also eliminate work and, hence, workers, but you must be specific. There’s no budget line for 'waste.' Trying to make reductions through the 'Schedule F' proposed in the first Trump administration won't produce a smaller or better workforce. Instead, the workforce will be more cautious and less innovative as they hesitate to take action lest they displease the political establishment — the opposite of what you are trying to accomplish. Vivek Ramaswamy, chairman and co-founder of Strive Asset Management, arrives to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Elon Musk claims he can cut $2 trillion from the $6.75 trillion annual federal budget, but in order to do that, he'd need to cut mandatory programs like Social Security or Medicare, something Trump has said he won't do. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images Disrupt the federal workforce? The federal government has formal rules for reducing the number of employees. Usually, that's done by attrition — not replacing workers when they leave, so headcount drops gradually. If the reduction happens too quickly for attrition, then it's done mainly by seniority. That’s what will happen if you succeed in making deep cuts. If you really want to shake up the civil service, have a one-time 5 percent reduction based on merit alone. Maybe make everyone reapply for their job. It would be traumatic since it breaks long-established expectations, but there's 5 percent of the federal workforce who should be doing something else. Beware the lethal embrace. Without specifics, the bureaucracy will respond by reshaping and then embracing any sufficiently vague reform. Many years ago, as a junior staff member, I was sent as an organizational representative to a meeting on how DoD would respond to an efficiency commission. A crusty old bureaucrat led the meeting. He said, 'The department's position is that these are all great ideas, and, in fact, we are already doing them or planning to do them. Now go back to your organizations and write up those responses for your section of the report.' Hire some people who know government thoroughly. You have started online hiring, and that's good. It will jump-start the commission. Your inclination will be to hire enthusiastic outsiders who want to apply their ideas from the civilian economy to government. That's fine for generating ideas. However, you need a cadre of inside experts who know how to implement those ideas. That’s how you escape the lethal embrace. An enthusiastic but inexperienced staff might produce a passable report using AI tools, but it will be totally useless. Don't create a permanent organization for reform. You won't be able to cover everything in the federal government the way you might like. That's an inevitable trade-off. Maybe recommend having a similar commission periodically to 'mow the lawn.' Maybe provide guidance for future commissions. However, the idea of creating a permanent bureaucracy in order to reduce bureaucracy is absurd. Disband DOGE when its work is done. Get moving. You may think you have four years to get initiatives done, but you may only have two years to get approval for proposals that need congressional authorization. There will be congressional elections in 2026, and historically, the president’s party has lost ground—on average, 26 seats in the House and four in the Senate. If that holds in 2026, the Democrats will take control of Congress. Hedging against that possibility is not pessimism or disloyalty, but realism. So get moving.

Rolls-Royce says future B-52 engine, the F130, passed critical design review	A KC-135 Stratotanker from the 465th Air Refueling Squadron assigned to Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, refuels a B-52 Stratofortress from the 96th Bomb Squadron assigned to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, during a cross country mission Sept 13, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by 2nd Lt. Mary Begy) WASHINGTON — The Rolls-Royce F130 engine is one step closer to powering the US Air Force’s B-52 Stratofortress fleet following a successful critical design review (CDR), the company told Breaking Defense. Held in October but not publicly revealed until now, the F130 CDR marks a key milestone in the engineering process that validates the maturity of a design. The company will still have to address some extra steps to fully close out the CDR — those should be taken within the next few months, a spokesperson said — but it can now turn its attention to additional testing and prepare for production efforts. Eventually, Rolls-Royce is expected to install the F130 across the Stratofortress fleet and replace the current Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33, in line with the $2.6 billion contract Rolls-Royce won in 2021 and as the central piece in the wider B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP). The CDR had been expected as far back as January, but the spokesperson said the October review was still within the Air Force's schedule. 'A combination of integration improvements and the desire to fully analyze results' from twin pod tests Rolls-Royce ran at NASA’s Stennis Space Center 'drove the timing,' the spokesperson said. B-52-maker Boeing leads the overall CERP effort as the prime integrator, which involves other changes to the decades-old bomber like upgraded avionics. The CERP aims to offer greater fuel efficiency and maintainability improvements, recasting the B-52H as the B-52J after the overall project is completed. It’s a big revamp for the Air Force’s fleet of 76 Eisenhower-era bombers, which each carry four twin pods for a total of eight engines each and will be expected to fly with the new F130s until the end of their service lives well into the 2050s, if not longer. A parallel effort, the B-52 Radar Modernization Program, will integrate a new RTX-made radar. Boeing will lead a separate CDR for the overall CERP effort, which the Government Accountability Office found earlier this year is planned for August 2025 [PDF], roughly two years behind schedule. The same report found that the program’s initial operational capability (IOC) may be delayed by as long as roughly three years, out to 2033. Air Force officials earlier this year told reporters they were working through ways to hold down costs and claw back lost time for the two B-52 upgrade programs, including by bringing on Shay Assad, the Pentagon’s former longtime director of defense pricing notorious for tough negotiations with industry. 'We are working very closely with our partners at Boeing and the Air Force to support the program, address any issues, and assist in any way we can,' the Rolls-Royce spokesperson said. Boeing referred comment for this report to the Air Force. A spokesperson for the service confirmed that the CERP's system-level CDR is planned for 'late summer 2025,' and that IOC is planned for fiscal year 2033. A formal cost baseline for CERP will be established at the program's Milestone B decision, set for 'summer 2025,' the spokesperson added. Rolls-Royce officials are now underway with new engine trials at the company’s Indianapolis, Ind., facilities after wrapping up crosswind testing, as a production decision inches closer. 'The F130 First Engine to Test (FETT) started sea-level testing in Indianapolis this fall, which included running the engine’s initial software release,' the spokesperson said. 'The FETT sets the performance baseline for the F130, supported by the over 30 million engine flying hours' from the company’s commercial family of engines the F130 is based on. Looking ahead, the engine will also undergo altitude testing at the Air Force’s Arnold Engineering Development Complex in Tullahoma, Tenn. The company will also conduct 'durability testing' in Indianapolis ahead of initial flight release, the spokesperson said. The CERP contract awarded to Rolls-Royce calls for 608 engines, as well as spares. By the early 2030s, the company 'expect[s] to increase production of our combat portfolio to over 100 engines per year,' according to the spokesperson. 'To date, our testing program confirmed our predictions and is allowing us to stay on track to deliver this fixed price contract for the Air Force,' the spokesperson said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rolls-royce-says-future-b-52-engine-the-f130-passed-critical-design-review/	2024-12-13T08:00:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/6834841-e1661267382116.jpg
Pentagon marks 2 long-range tests with Army’s PrSM and Army-Navy hypersonic missile	The PrSM is the next-generation, long-range precision-strike missile delivering critical capabilities to attack, neutralize, suppress, and destroy targets, supporting successful mission execution via combined Joint All-Domain Operations. (U.S. Army/Darrell Ames) WASHINGTON — The US Army has taken two new steps forward in its quest for long-range strike capabilities that will be able to hold threats in the Pacific at range. On Thursday evening, the Army put out two announcements: The service tested a conventional hypersonic missile, built in partnership with the Navy, and that it also successfully launched a pair of Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) Increment 1 weapons from a HIMARS launcher. Both systems fit into the Army's focus on increasing long-range fires, which is seen as vital for any conflict with China, given the much-ballyhooed 'tyranny of distance' any Pacific conflict would entail. The hypersonic test occurred at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Fla. Per an announcement from the Pentagon, this 'is the second successful end-to-end flight test of the All Up Round (AUR) this year and was the first live-fire event for the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon system using a Battery Operations Center and a Transporter Erector Launcher.' The Army and Navy are collaborating on the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon, which is designed to be launched from land or sea. Militaries around the world are in a race to develop hypersonic weapons, which, at least on paper, combine high speeds with maneuverability that should allow weapons to avoid air defenses. Meanwhile, the PrSM launch, which took place on Wednesday at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, was deemed a success, with the Army saying the munition engaged 'four simulated rotary wing targets within a helicopter staging area.' PrSM Increment 1, produced by Lockheed Martin, is slated to replace the Army’s legacy ATACMS tactical ballistic missile, increasing range out to 500 kilometers. As part of the service's efforts to increase its weapon portfolio range, it plans to use that first PrSM increment to strike targets closer in, and the hypersonic weapon for ones further out. Then the new Typhon Mid-Range Capability, deployed to the Philippines this year, will be used for targets at distances in the middle of the two. But the Army is also hoping to develop multiple versions of PrSM going forward. Increment 2 is under development with a multimode seeker, known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and a PrSM Increment 3 seeks to add in enhanced lethality payloads. The Army has also tapped a Lockheed Martin team and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team to work on competing PrSM Increment 4 designs that can fly more than 1,000 kilometers, possibly double the range of the current version. A few weeks ago the service said it was looking at an Increment 5 for an autonomous launcher to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers.

GCAP partners form joint venture to deliver next-gen fighter for UK, Japan and Italy	The British, Italian and Japanese led Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) future fighter jet is slated to enter service in 2035 (BAE Systems) The UK's BAE Systems said in a company statement today that it had struck the agreement with Italy's Leonardo and Japan Aircraft Industrial Enhancement (JAIEC), which will act as the 'design authority for GCAP for the life of the product.' The manufacturer noted that the era of the future aircraft is 'expected' to last 'beyond 2070.' The JV, which does not publicly have a formal name, will serve as the prime contractor for the program, while subcontracting out manufacturing and final assembly of the next generation plane to the British firm, Leonardo, and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, alongside other suppliers. GCAP aims to replace UK Royal Air Force and Italian Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons, as well as Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-2 combat jets. It is slated for entry to service in 2035. All three partners will retain an equal 33.3 percent shareholding in the JV and it will be headquartered in the UK, in order to 'ensure maximum alignment and collaboration with the GCAP International Government Organisation (GIGO),' which is also due to be based in the region. Joint teams from the JV will also work in each of the three GCAP partner nations. 'The [JV] agreement builds on the strong trilateral government, defence, and industrial cooperation between the UK, Japan, and Italy on GCAP since it was established in December 2022,' added BAE. Charles Woodburn, BAE Systems CEO said of the JV agreement, 'The new business will bring together the significant strengths and expertise of the companies involved to create an innovative organisation that will lead the way in developing a next generation combat air system, creating long-term, high value and skilled jobs across the partner nations for decades to come.' Roberto Cingolani, Leonardo CEO, echoed such sentiment, stating, 'Today, we are paving the way for the development of a new era in Aircraft Systems and Multi-domain scenarios, fostering long-term sustainable growth for the economies of the involved countries.' Kimito Nakae, JAIEC President, added, 'As we now embark upon the exciting and important journey towards the success of GCAP, I acknowledge that the way might not always be simple and straightforward. However, I believe that through continuing the strong spirit of trilateral cooperation and collaboration that we have fostered up to this point, we will not only deliver the GCAP on time but also at a level that exceeds all of our expectations.' The JV progress comes five months after the GCAP partners unveiled a new concept of the future crewed fighter jet, based around a conventional delta wing shape and featuring increased wingspan compared to previous iterations. The development phase of the aircraft, which is expected to operate alongside autonomous collaborative platforms or adjunct aircraft, similar to US Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft, is also slated to begin next year. Earlier this week, Breaking Defense reported that the UK's Excalibur flight test aircraft (a modified Boeing 757) had successfully completed its first phase of modification and flight testing, including integration of side and belly pods to accommodate Integrated Sensors, Non-Kinetic Effects (ISANKE) and Integrated Communications Systems (ICS) as part of Tempest — Britain's name for the GCAP jet. With a heavy focus on assessing Electronic Warfare capabilities, Excalibur essentially serves as a testbed for new technology that could eventually be fitted on the future fighter. Though GCAP partners have been briefed about its progress, they are not, strictly speaking, part of the effort. Even so, the 'expectation is that if they choose to work with us in the next phase, as the Team Tempest activity concludes, it would logically transition to GCAP,' said Andrew Howard, Leonardo UK’s director for GCAP.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/gcap-partners-form-joint-venture-to-deliver-next-gen-fighter-for-uk-japan-and-italy/	2024-12-13T05:49:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/RS179755_PMCS2620-FCAS-JPN-5A1x1-e1734095138256.png
MILSATCOM for the most critical no-fail missions	Leveraging proven technology was key to the recently launched Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission, a historic Northrop Grumman-primed international space mission that included both commercial and U.S. military payloads on the same satellite for the first time. (Northrop Grumman illustration). Satellite communication is so reliable and commonplace it’s easy for everyday users to take it for granted, whether watching live sports or checking email mid-flight. Since the 1980s, militaries have also migrated to space-based communications systems. Ensuring the U.S. military and its allies have continuous communication capability, however, is more complicated than providing cable television and internet service to consumers. Military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) systems need to fight through adversary jamming, operate despite ground station disruptions, withstand challenging environmental conditions, and mitigate an ever-growing set of attack approaches. David Doami is senior director of MILSATCOM and Sustainment at Northrop Grumman. In short, protected MILSATCOM systems need to be no-fail — and no company has more experience in delivering on these stringent requirements than Northrop Grumman, said David Doami, senior director of MILSATCOM and Sustainment at Northrop Grumman. 'MILSATCOM systems are used to communicate the highest priority messages that we have in our country including the president, as commander in chief, commanding the combatant commanders and our strategic forces,' said Doami, pointing to Northrop Grumman’s decades of designing and delivering strategic SATCOM for the U.S. military. 'During the Cold War, we had a single nuclear threat, and space supported the air, ground and sea domains. Today, we have multiple nuclear-capable threats and space itself is a contested domain. In this environment, survivable and assured MILSATCOM are more critical than ever before as a vital communications link for the warfighter.' Decades in the Making Protected MILSATCOM has evolved from the earliest Milstar satellites, through the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites of the last decade, and now to new MILSATCOM systems in development, such as Northrop Grumman’s Evolved Strategic SATCOM and Protected Tactical SATCOM rapid prototypes, noted Terry Smigla, chief MILSATCOM engineer at Northrop Grumman. Terry Smigla is chief MILSATCOM engineer at Northrop Grumman. 'Northrop Grumman and our heritage companies laid the foundation for many of today’s critical MILSATCOM capabilities, including mission payloads for Milstar and AEHF, as well as the Enhanced Polar System and Enhanced Polar System-Recapitalization (EPS-R),' said Smigla. 'We know what it takes to keep protected MILSATCOM systems relevant, and we have taken advantage of technology advances to continuously improve capabilities. That’s what we’re doing with the current generation of protected MILSATCOM, as well, only we’re taking that capability to the next level. It’s a generational leap.' With each generation of MILSATCOM, capabilities have catapulted forward to address expanding coverage and capacity needs, as well as an evolving threat environment. For example, in the 1990s, Northrop Grumman introduced the world’s first onboard digital processing on the Milstar II system. These processors can be reconfigured and updated from the ground, enabling constant improvement even once the satellite is in orbit. The company has delivered this capability on every MILSATCOM payload since. The software that runs MILSATCOM systems such as the Milstar and AEHF payloads is just as, if not more, important than the hardware that goes on orbit. As demands have expanded, Northrop Grumman has continued to evolve the technology from the ground via software updates. Today’s protected MILSATCOM systems are more software-defined than ever, meaning they become more capable with each upgrade, Smigla said. 'The proliferation of warfighting platforms with advanced sensors and weapons systems and the need to disseminate information across the digital battlefield drives an ever-increasing demand for data bandwidth,' said Smigla. Protected MILSATCOM has evolved from the earliest Milstar satellites to new systems in development such as Northrop Grumman’s Evolved Strategic SATCOM and Protected Tactical SATCOM rapid prototypes. (Northrop Grumman illustration) Assured, Affordable Comms No-fail missions, like missile defense and protected MILSATCOM, require diverse architectures with powerful satellites, said Blake Bullock, vice president of Military Space Systems at Northrop Grumman. But those satellites must exist in sufficient numbers and incorporate resiliency features to ensure the architecture can take a punch and keep operating. That means keeping those systems affordable is a high priority. 'In many instances, we can upgrade or repurpose existing technology for the next generation of systems at minimal additional cost, saving our investment dollars for technologies — like cutting-edge, software-defined processing — that keep the U.S. and our allies ahead of the threat,' said Bullock. 'That’s the benefit of having performed this mission for so long; we understand what legacy technology continues to be relevant and where we need to invest for the future.' Leveraging existing technology was key to the recently launched Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission, a historic Northrop Grumman-primed international space mission that included both commercial and U.S. military payloads on the same satellite for the first time. This collaboration between the U.S. Space Force, Space Norway and Northrop Grumman resulted in the EPS-R program. The partnership delivered expanded protected MILSATCOM capability to the Arctic that, according to a public Space Force estimate, saved taxpayers around $900 million. As the company continues to advance MILSATCOM and find innovative ways of incorporating existing technologies — such as commercial spacecraft bus platforms and standards-based networking capabilities — Northrop Grumman’s decades of on-orbit experience are the key to rapidly and affordably providing our warfighters this vital mission capability, said Doami. 'It comes down to mission mastery. There is no substitute for the experience we’ve garnered performing the mission on orbit for more than 30 years.'

Saudi Arabia inks deal for 3 Avante 2200 Corvettes from Spain’s Navantia	The fourth Saudi Avante-class corvette goes into the water during production in late 2021. (Navantia) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has contracted three more Avante 2200 corvettes from Spanish firm Navantia to serve with the royal navy, according to the Kingdom's Ministry of Defense. The three new corvettes will join the existing fleet of five Avante 2200 corvettes already in service as part of the Sarawat project signed between KSA and Navantia in 2018. Navantia said in a statement Wednesday that work on the first new corvette will start later this year, and the delivery is scheduled to conclude in 2028. 'This second batch series of corvettes for Saudi Arabia will be similar to the first batch, with a design based on Navantia’s Avante 2200 model, which is a multipurpose vessel specially designed for patrolling and monitoring of the Exclusive Economic Zone, maritime traffic surveillance and control missions, search and rescue missions and assistance to other vessels, among others,' Navantia said. 'In addition, the vessels will have an important capacity for the defense of strategic assets, intelligence, and anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, anti-surface and electronic warfare capabilities.' Navantia said SAMINavantia, a joint venture between the Spanish firm and the Kingdom's Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI), will install the Hazem Combat System for the ships. Hazem is the first-ever combat management system developed and produced inside KSA by SAMI. The installation, integration and trials of the second and third corvettes in KSA comes in line with Saudi Vision 2030, that target localizing 50 percent of defense production in the Kingdom. RELATED: Saudi Arabia reveals strides in local defense production as it races towards ambitious 2030 goal The new contact includes logistical support package, training of 100 Saudi engineers and the manufacturing of blocks for the third corvettes in KSA, according to Navantia’s statement. 'Navantia will transfer the Intellectual Property Rights of the Avante 2200 design to GAMI [General Authority of Military Industries], enabling the design's utilization for the manufacturing of future corvettes for the Kingdom, as well as for potential export markets,' the statement said. Avante 2200 corvettes are 104 meters in length and capable of transporting around 100 people, designed for surveillance and control operations with the capacity to host a helicopter on the deck.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/saudi-arabia-inks-deal-for-3-avante-2200-corvettes-from-spains-navantia/	2024-12-13T05:10:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/saudi_corvette_1.jpg
SPACECOM and Space Force working to define ‘triggers’ for commercial reserve call up	US SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting addresses Space Symposium 2024. (Space Foundation via Flickr) SPACEPOWER 2024 — US Space Command is helping the Space Force figure out the circumstances under which firms participating in the service's fledgling commercial space reserve program would be called to serve, according to SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting. 'We're excited about the Space Force's work on the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve, or CASR. I think that's going to come online starting next year and into '26, and we're working with the Space Force to define the triggers for when we would want to activate the CASR to bring us additional capacity,' he told the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters later in the day, Whiting explained that the idea is to follow the model of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), managed by US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), for leveraging commercial airlines to support military logistics operations when needed. 'There's various trigger points based on threat scenarios that might be happening, or world events where TRANSCOM can activate various stages of the CRAF to get aircraft to help with the US Air Force mobility, aircraft to move more equipment [and] people,' he said. 'So, as the Space Force contracts out CASR and we get the ability, let's say, to get more satellite communications in a crisis, or get more space domain awareness, or some other space-related capability like ISR [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance], at various points, when there's a global crisis or something's going on, I expect that these contracts that the Space Force will write to enable CASR will allow us to go the Space Force [and say], &#8216;Something's going on in the world. We need that additional capacity, and we want to implement a the starting phase of CASR,'' Whiting said. That would allow for additional capacity 'that we then can leverage for operations. And then, depending on that's how that situation evolves, there might be additional phases of CASR where we would continue to get more and more capacity,' he added. Col. Richard Kniseley, director of the Space Force's Commercial Space Office, said in October that the service expects to award its first CASR contracts by early next year — although he stressed that those first agreements would be baseline models that don't address thorny issues such as compensation for participants whose satellites become casualties of war. Whiting noted in his presentation that SPACECOM just last month updated its own 'commercial integration strategy.' The first version was published in 2022 and said 'it was very aspirational' in that it was a broad look at what the national security space community 'at large' needed to do to engage commercial vendors. By contrast, he said, the new version is focused on 'the real, core US Space Command tasks.' Whiting explained that there are three key action items in the new strategy. First is for SPACECOM to 'identify and advocate' for commercial capability. This means working to understand what industry is 'bringing to the table' and then going to the military services to advocate 'what capabilities should be brought online.' 'Secondly, we want to incorporate and operationalize' commercial capabilities, Whiting said. 'So, as the Space Force develops CASR, and that becomes real, we've got to figure out what the triggers are and the mechanisms where we can now take that added capacity that CASR could bring to us in various mission areas, and how do we operationalize that into our plan so that the joint force can take advantage of that.' Finally, Whiting explained that the 'third line of effort' in the strategy is to 'inform and protect' commercial partners — which is the raison d'etre of the Commercial Integration Cell at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., where space operators and industry operators share threat information with each other.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/preparing-for-crisis-spacecom-and-space-force-working-to-define-triggers-for-commercial-reserve-call-up/	2024-12-12T13:35:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240410_whiting_keynote_space_symposium_space_foundation-e1712757057987.jpg
DOE, Navy project for upgrading nuclear spent fuel facility is $2 billion over budget: GAO	The Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine USS Alaska (SSBN 732)(Gold) returns to its homeport at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Ga. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Ashley Berumen) WASHINGTON — A project to upgrade government facilities designed to manage the spent fuel from nuclear-powered US Navy warships is more than $2 billion over budget and three years behind schedule, according to a new report from independent government auditors. The project, known as the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project (SFHP), will be upgrading facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory. Naval Reactors, a joint Navy and Department of Energy office led by a four-star Navy admiral who oversees and advances the fleet’s nuclear propulsion technologies, has long used the site to prepare for the disposal of spent fuel — hazardous leftover materials generated by nuclear-power warships. At the direction of lawmakers, the Government Accountability Office assessed Naval Reactors’ ongoing plans for the recapitalization and found the project has significantly overrun its original cost estimate of $1.69 billion and scheduled completion in the third quarter of 2025. 'Since [September 2018], Naval Reactors has experienced challenges in executing the project, including rising costs for construction services and some construction work not meeting Naval Reactors nuclear facility quality assurance requirements. As a result, Naval Reactors has revised the cost and schedule baseline estimates for the facility several times,' according to the report. The latest figures — totaling $3 billion and a completion date in 2028 — were produced in 2022, according to GAO, and Naval Reactors was working through developing an updated baseline as of August 2024. A Navy spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. In a written response to GAO’s audit, Jill Hruby, the undersecretary of energy for nuclear security, acknowledged the project’s cost overruns and schedule delays. 'While factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, volatile market conditions, and poor construction subcontractor performance have contributed significantly to these challenges, improvements in management of SFHP are required to meet the high standards of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program,' she wrote. GAO recommended Naval Reactors follows best practices for credible cost estimates; obtains an 'independent and objective analysis' of the root causes for the problems to date; and updates its implementation such that any future cost breaches will automatically trigger root cause analyses. Naval Reactors agreed with all of GAO’s recommendations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/doe-navy-project-for-upgrading-spent-fuel-facility-is-2-billion-over-budget-gao/	2024-12-12T12:45:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/uss-alaska-e1699388634104.jpg
New C2 software for mobile satellites will support future orbital warfare ops	Orion Space Solutions is building the Tetra-5 constellation for Space Force experiments to demonstrate autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations and docking for on-orbit refueling. (Credit: Orion Space Solutions) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The new command and control (C2) software developed by the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Space RCO) for maneuvering satellites in the future will be used by Space Force spacecraft performing 'orbital warfare' missions, according to Space RCO Director Kelly Hammett. The Rapid Resilient Command and Control (R2C2) program is managed by the Combined Program Office (CPO), which was stood up in 2023 to combine legacy projects from Space RCO, headquartered at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico, and the Space Force’s primary acquisition unit Space Systems Command (SSC) headquartered in Los Angeles. The program is aimed at rapidly fielding C2 capabilities for use by systems performing what the service calls dynamic space operations, using a commercial cloud architecture. 'This fall, we have already established live contacts with flying satellites down in Kirtland through the experimental systems' operated by Space Systems Command's prototyping center there headed by Col. Joseph Roth, Hammett told reporters at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday. The 'intent,' he said, is to use R2C2 'to fly some of the further experimental satellites,' such as the Tetra constellation of small satellites being built for the Space Force by Orion Space Solutions, a unit of Arcfield, to demonstrate autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations and docking for on-orbit refueling. 'Eventually all the flying systems for Delta 9, the Orbital Warfare Delta, will use R2C2,' Hammett added, noting that Space Operations Command 'just signed out a minimum to that effect.' Delta 9 is responsible for 'protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter and, when necessary, defeat orbital threats. Additionally, Delta 9 supports Space Domain Awareness by conducting space-based battlespace characterization operations and also conducts on-orbit experimentation and technology demonstrations,' according to a Space Operations Command fact sheet. In particular, it operates the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites that keep eyes on adversary activities on orbit. &#8216;I think there [are] things that we will need to be able to, I guess I'll say, &#8216;dogfight' in space,' Lt. Gen. Doug Schiess, commander of Space Forces &#8211; Space, the Space Force unit that undertakes operations for US Space Command, told reporters on Wednesday. 'Kelly's point, I think, is he's looking to the future. He's looking to where we're going to go and, being a guy that's eventually going to get those systems, I'm hoping that we are continuing to do those kind of things so that we have the best space to learn. Because when we get to a conflict, we may need to, use systems to negate somebody else's ability to attack us. We're going to need that,' he added. In particular, Schiess cited the growing threat from China, which is increasingly deploying highly mobile satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit where many high-value US military satellites are stationed. 'China is building a kill web, kill chain, whatever you want to call it, with 400 different ISR [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] satellites &#8230; to the point where they can effectively track target our forces almost all the way from Hawaii, maybe even all the way from the coast of California. And so then that puts those forces at risk. And so we need to have effectors that allow us to negate their ability to use them,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/new-c2-software-for-mobile-satellites-will-support-future-orbital-warfare-ops/	2024-12-12T12:09:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-6.18.39 PM-e1734014654326.png
‘Sanctuary’ no longer: New Air Force plan seeks to rejuvenate installations	A US Air Force F-22 Raptor assigned to the 27th Fighter Squadron arrives at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam in support of Valiant Shield 24, June 7, 2024. (US Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Brian Long) WASHINGTON — Half of the Department of the Air Force’s (DAF) installation infrastructure — composed of key features like airfields, munitions storage facilities and more across the Air Force and Space Force — is currently 'in a moderate or high-risk condition,' according to a new report. The DAF’s Installation Infrastructure Action Plan (I2AP), published Wednesday, sets out a 15-year roadmap to arrest the trend of declining facilities, which is only projected to get worse in the coming years without decisive action. The plan also seeks to ensure the service’s installations are prepared to withstand a range of threats, from natural to man-made, warning that they 'can no longer be considered a sanctuary' as the Pentagon strives to keep pace with China’s growing military prowess. 'We know that over the past decade, we have not paid attention to our installations the way we should,' Ravi Chaudhary, assistant secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations and Environment, said during a Wednesday discussion hosted by the Air &amp; Space Forces Association. The I2AP 'is designed to be the most comprehensive and focused initiative to get our installations ready for great power competition.' RELATED: &#8216;Everybody's going to have to figure this out': Army, Air Force debate base defense amid new threats Divided into four categories that each represent different elements of installation infrastructure, the I2AP sheds light on grim realities. The first category, primary and secondary airfields, fares better than others, though over 25 percent of the airfields are rated either degraded or failing. The outlook is worse for the 'mission critical facilities' category, made up of elements like fuel storage and fire and rescue stations, where over half of infrastructure is deemed degraded or failing. 'Mission generation facilities,' described as assets like munitions storage and aircraft maintenance shops, scored similarly to their mission critical counterparts. The DAF’s 640 munitions storage facilities, with an average age of 47 years, get a particular call-out in the report, as a '[a] growing number of storage facilities are unable to support advanced munitions and, in some cases, cannot be modified to meet the emerging requirements.' The worst-performing category, according to the report, is utilities, where nearly 75 percent are either degraded or failing. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) utilities — which would be at the centerpiece of a conflict with China — were found to be 'severely degraded.' According to the report, 70 percent of PACAF utilities are at 'serious risk,' a problem magnified by challenging conditions like a 'highly corrosive' environment and 'limited availability of skilled labor.' The condition of DAF infrastructure. (Source: Air Force I2AP report) The I2AP sets out three 'objectives' to get after these challenges. The first broadly aims to ensure infrastructure is aligned to modern missions, setting out tasks from upgrading communications systems to improving dormitories and child development centers. Arguing that infrastructure hasn’t appropriately downsized since the Gulf War, the second objective aims to 'right-size' infrastructure — either by shrinking it or finding cost savings, including through new public-private partnerships or other arrangements. For spaceports in particular, the second objective also seeks to ensure adequate infrastructure is in place to support 'enhanced space launch and test operations.' And rounding out the list of objectives is to make installations more resilient, reducing vulnerabilities stemming from adversary attack or other events like energy shortages and natural disasters. For example, the objective calls for embracing microgrids across DAF installations 'to provide localized energy generation,' as well as shoring up systems against cyber attacks. Air Force Materiel Command will lead guidance for implementing the I2AP, according to the report, which adds that the overall plan will be governed under an 'Infrastructure Council.' 'I’m transitioning in January, and it’s been a heck of a run,' Chaudhary said, referring to the forthcoming Trump administration. 'But to me, I think marching down this pathway to ensure that our installation[s are] ready has nothing to do with politics. It has everything to do with warfighting and making sure we deliver resources and capabilities to our airmen and guardians that are befitting' of their roles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/sanctuary-no-longer-new-air-force-plan-seeks-to-rejuvenate-installations/	2024-12-12T11:22:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/F-22-Guam-scaled-e1734020063973.jpg

(Credit Dave Turnbull/QinetiQ via Leonardo UK) WITTSHITE, United Kingdom — The development of the UK’s sixth-generation Tempest jet took a significant step forward this week with the MoD and industry partners unveiling the latest version of the Excalibur flight test aircraft (FTA), complete with integrated sensor pods. At a media event inside the FTA’s dedicated 'Hangar 499' at a secretive airfield in Wiltshire on Dec. 9, Leonardo UK, 2Excel and the MoD confirmed Excalibur (a modified Boeing 757) had successfully completed its first phase of modification and flight testing, including the integration of side and belly pods to accommodate Integrated Sensors, Non-Kinetic Effects (ISANKE) and Integrated Communications Systems (ICS) as part of Tempest. Officials present revealed that Excalibur took its first flight with the sizeable sensor pods to confirm airworthiness on Nov. 26. According to an official statement published on Dec. 9, the sensor pods have been designed to host the ISANKE and ICS sub-systems which Leonardo UK and its international partners are 'developing as part of their work on GCAP.' However, the aircraft is not expected to begin flying with ISANKE/ICS payloads until 2026. 'Further modification to the Excalibur FTA aircraft will include a fighter jet-style nose cone to host advanced radar-based sensor demonstrators,' the statement added. According to the MoD, Excalibur is a 'flying laboratory for combat air technology' which falls within the UK’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program and includes Tempest as well as additional capabilities including uncrewed aircraft, information systems and weapon systems. In simplest terms, the UK is using it to test out the tech it might want on its next-gen aircraft. But for now, it’s just able to fly with UK-developed technologies, confirmed Andrew Howard, Leonardo UK’s director for GCAP, despite the presence of Japan and Italy as part of the GCAP team. 'Everything you've seen [so far] is UK Team Tempest work that was kicked off in 2018. We've obviously been briefing our [GCAP] partners about this now for probably the last 18 months, to a varying degree of detail. And the expectation is that if they choose to work with us in the next phase, as the Team Tempest activity concludes, it would logically transition to GCAP. So the first set of TDPs are UK TDPs, and we're progressively looking at international partnerships from 2027/28 — that type of timeline,' he explained. Japan is currently using a C2 aircraft to support its own ISANKE/ICS requirements for GCAP, which Howard said is 'very similar to our own.' 'Their ambitions are different to ours and the type of sensors are going to be different to what we're proposing. But that is a Japanese industrial decision linked to their work share that they are pursuing independently of us, which we're very happy with. And similarly, our Italian colleagues, who get test access as well.' Howard also confirmed there are no existing plans to modify an additional 757 to support Tempest or GCAP, despite what he called the 'massive risk' of something happening to Excalibur that sets the GCAP program back. In 2025, Leonardo UK and 2Excel will integrate the nose and chin section which will feature the new Multi Function Radar System (MRFS), wing pods, and additional centerline pod at the back of the aircraft as well as a 'load' of antennas around the aircraft, a 2Excel official added. The official also confirmed Excalibur must conduct a 'three-point landing' to ensure the integrity of a heavy nose and chin section and stated its next flight would take place in March 2025. In his concluding remarks, Leonardo’s Howard suggested he had not anticipated the size of the pods integrated on board the Excalibur. 'It really does bring it to life. We've all talked about this in the program over the last couple of years and spent a lot of time in meetings, and coming here today, seeing these things makes it very real. The ambition of what we're going to try and do behind those pods with these very complex sensors is really exciting, and obviously it's just another step on the journey. 'The aircraft isn't finished yet by any means. The sensors aren't there by any means, but to see the good work that 2Excel and the team have done, the progress that we've made, is really exciting, and I think it's building trust with our partners.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/inside-the-test-aircraft-for-uks-next-gen-fighter/	2024-12-12T10:14:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Leonardo-2Excel-Excalibur-Flight-Test-Aircraft-with-new-side-and-belly-pods.-Credit-Dave-Turnbull-–-QinetiQ-2-scaled-e1734015905294.jpg
Russian bases and Hezbollah weapons: Key questions follow fall of Syrian regime	A Russian navy officer salutes aboard corvette Velikiy Ustyug is picture at the Russian naval base in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartus on September 26, 2019. (Photo by MAXIME POPOV/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The dust is yet to settle in Damascus after the sudden collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, leaving anxious officials and observers to watch closely for signs of what’s to come. There are a myriad of questions to be answered; among the most pressing occupying the minds of American and Middle Eastern officials is whether extremism will take root in the power vacuum. But several experts told Breaking Defense their eyes were on other key flashpoints that could affect the balance of power in the region for years to come, from the fate of Russian military bases in Syria to the potential collapse of an Iranian weapons pipeline to the Lebanese group Hezbollah. 'The fall of the Assad regime will have dire consequences for [Russia and Iran’s] regional influence,' Ali Bakir, professor at Qatar University and non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told Breaking Defense. 'The pressing question for the ordinary citizens in Tehran and Moscow is: What have we gained from propping up this regime for nearly 14 years? How can our leadership explain the huge political, financial, and military investment in this regime?' Before this week, Moscow in part projected power in Syria and beyond through two military installations: Hemeimeem air base near Latakia and Tartus naval base on the Mediterranean. But now, with the Kremlin’s benefactor reportedly having fled to Russia, the fate of the bases appears up in the air. 'Our top priority remains the safety of all Russian citizens within Syrian territory and the protection of Russian facilities and missions, including diplomatic and military installations, as well as those connected to Russian companies and organizations,' Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday. Open source intelligence photos indicate that Russian military ships have departed from Tartus naval base, while only few aircraft were detected via satellite imagery at Hmeimim airbase. 'We’re seeing Russia consolidate assets and … some naval vessels are leaving that area,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday. 'Again, it remains to be seen what the path forward is in Syria; that is up for the Syrian people to decide.' Likewise Bakir said it makes sense for Russia to remove its vessels while there may be an 'imminent threat to its troops or military assets,' but it’s an open question if Russian ships will return. 'The military bases in question are owned by the Syrians. Whether Moscow will utilize them in the future depends on the internal situation in Syria and any agreements with the current or the future governing power or government,' he said. He said he believed that it seems improbable that 'whoever controls Syria would permit Russia to station its troops or military assets within the country. Regarding the mid-term and long-term, the situation will rely on numerous variables that cannot be fully accounted for at this time.' Kristian Alexander, a senior fellow at the United Arab Emirate-based Rabdan Security and Defence Institute, said there are essentially three options: Russia negotiates with the new Syrian government to keep use of the bases, the insurgents reject Russian presence altogether for its past support of Assad, or Moscow determines the situation is too 'volatile' to risk maintaining a military presence anyway and doesn’t attempt to return. 'It could abandon these bases altogether,' Alexander told Breaking Defense. 'This would mark a significant geopolitical shift, potentially ceding influence [to] Western or regional powers like Turkey.' Assad’s fall may be troubling for close ally Iran for a number of reasons, including a practical one: logistics. Officials and experts have long said that Syria, along with Iraq, acted as an overland route through which Tehran could supply and arm the Lebanese group Hezbollah. But with Assad’s fall has come rebel control of much of that route, including Al-Boukamal, a key border crossing between Syria and Iraq, in essence 'cutting off supply lines from Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon, according to retired Lebanese Armed Forces Gen. Wehbe Katicha. In a recent analysis, the Council on Foreign Relations said Israel had also reportedly struck Iranian missile facilities in Damascus 'that had nourished Hezbollah’s previously formidable array of long-, medium-, and short-range missiles and rockets.' 'The rebel victory in Syria … thus poses an existential threat to Hezbollah,' the analysis said. As Bakir told Breaking Defense, 'it’s only a matter of time before Hezbollah’s influence diminishes, even internally in Lebanon.' He added that Tehran may have to adapt to the new reality and become more pragmatic, 'or they might try to sabotage where they can, or they might opt to buy time, rebuild their regional position, and maneuver until [President-elect Donald] Trump’s term ends, at which point they could return with a new regional strategy. Whether this will happen remains to be seen.' Having lost its ally in Syria, Alexander said Iran may turn more of its attention to neighboring Iraq, where US officials say it already props up Shi’a militias. 'With the fall of Damascus Iran will likely reinforce its position in Iraq, maintain a base of operations and exert indirect influence over Syria through shared borders and cross-border militias,' he said. 'These groups are likely to intensify their activities along the Iraq-Syria border to ensure the continuity of supply lines and maintain a connection to remnants of pro-Iran factions in Syria.' But Bakir suggested Syria’s fall could, on the contrary, push those militias closer to the Iraqi government. '[Assad’s collapse] will shift the attention to them [Iraqi militias], and they will increasingly fall under internal, regional, and international pressure to join the Iraqi official institutions and bodies rather than to serve the Iranian agenda within the framework of Iraq or neighboring Syria,' he said. So, like the other questions on this list, the answers remain to be seen and may not be known for weeks or months. The only thing that’s certain is that power dynamic in the Middle East has already shifted for years or decades to come.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/russian-bases-and-hezbollah-weapons-key-questions-follow-fall-of-syrian-regime/	2024-12-12T09:33:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241212_russia_base_syria_GettyImages-1171379332-scaled-e1734024948180.jpg
Space Force operators get hands on ATLAS space monitoring software	US Space Force Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, Space Systems Command commander (left). (Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The Space Force's software-centric program, known as ATLAS, to modernize how it manages, processes and disseminates space monitoring data has been given over to the service's new(ish) space domain awareness delta that integrates operators and acquisition experts to wrap up testing and begin a trial period, according to the head of Space Systems Command. 'The integration testing continues to go well,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant told reporters at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla. — expressing optimism that the program will meet his expectations for achieving operational capability by the end of next year. The Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System (ATLAS) program is the Pentagon's latest effort to replace the 1980s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system for managing data from the military’s network of radar and telescopes that detect and track objects on orbit. The Space Force originally planned for ATLAS to become operational in 2022, but the program has been troubled by technical issues and schedule delays — to the point where Air Force Space Acquisition Executive Frank Calvelli has dubbed it one of the Space Force's three most troubled programs. 'Mr. Calvelli is really being aggressive in holding the program offices accountable and driving the tighter integration with the operators, which will also help us turn those capabilities on faster because it's not the traditional transition,' Garrant said. The Space Force in October announced the creation of Mission Delta 2 &#8211; Space Domain Awareness as one of its integrated deltas that bring together under one commander operators-in-training at Space Operations Command (SpOC) and acquisition specialists for maintenance and sustainment for each mission formerly under Space Systems Command. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman initiated the revamped structure for the deltas, which are the equivalent of Air Force wings, last September under two prototypes, called Integrated Mission Deltas — one for positioning, navigation and timing, and the other for electronic warfare. The service has accepted that most of SpOCs nine deltas will transition to what are now dubbed simply Mission Deltas, with four already stood up. ATLAS has now been moved from Space Systems Command, which is the service's primary acquisition unit, to Mission Delta 2 in large part because the Space Force has seen how well the new integrated structure is working. Garrant said the service has learned that the integrated deltas can actually get new capabilities and kit up and running faster because of the inclusion of operators. 'If we take something not quite traditionally ready for transition, but it's close, and we put it in tight concert with the operators, the operators can start training sooner. They understand the sustainment needs better, and we start to move on that,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-operators-get-hands-on-atlas-space-monitoring-software/	2024-12-12T07:56:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Garrant-left-e1734013079326.jpeg

(U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Maeson Elleman) SYDNEY — The US, its allies and partners must change their air forces to cope with China's enormous missile force that could cripple air bases throughout the Indo-Pacific for up to 12 days in event of war, according to a new report by the Stimson Center. 'By denying the United States the use of runways and taxiways in the region, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could gain air superiority without ever defeating America’s arsenal of advanced fighters and bombers,' says the think tank report, released today. 'No combination of U.S. countermeasures — including the greater dispersal of aircraft in the region, improved runway repair capabilities, and more robust missile defenses — is likely to solve the problem. There is a real and growing danger that Beijing might conclude that it could keep American airpower at bay long enough to accomplish a quick fait accompli.' Central to the analysis is US vulnerability to attacks on runways in Japan, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau. And it modeled how well missile defense, faster runway repair times and the dispersion of U.S. aircraft across the theater would perform against the Chinese threat. RELATED: Guam missile defenses conduct first-ever ballistic interception in test The three authors say initial strikes by China that close air bases could cripple US and allied forces for 12 days, especially at the Japanese bases. But it would be the loss of runways for airborne tankers; that would affect operations 'for over a month.' Without refueling, US fighters with relatively short ranges 'will not be able to put most of their weapons within range — much less fly a combat air patrol over Taiwan or the South China Sea.' With the stark challenge laid out, coming up with solutions is 'arguably the most critical and daunting task facing the U.S. Air Force today,' claims the report. 'The Air Force finds itself in danger of operating much less effectively than previously assessed, if at all, at the start of a military conflict when the Joint Force would expect it to quickly set up a combat air patrol or sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait. Worse, Chinese military planners might calculate that they have a window of over 30 days — when American airpower would be largely sidelined — to accomplish a fait accompli.' That could make it very hard to deter Beijing should push come to shove. Buying more missile defense systems or more fighters or bombers is not the answer for the US and its allies, the authors write. It should instead build 'large numbers of long-range drones and missiles of all types to ensure that they can keep the skies contested and blunt Chinese attacks early in a war without massive support from American fighters and bombers.' To illustrate just how spare the US missile defense enterprise is for all its impressive results in limited conflicts, they note that in October this year, two US Navy ships fired roughly one dozen SM-3 interceptors at Iranian ballistic missiles headed for Israel — using a year’s worth of production in one day. The Stimson study predicts that the US 'would likely run out of Patriot and THAAD interceptors within the first 24 hours of a military conflict.' The inventory of 1,200 Patriot missiles would run dry within a few days. So positioning THAAD and Patriot batteries around US and allied bases won't be of enough help for long enough. They also recommend allies and partners should pick up 'the bulk of the burden for contesting control of the air early in a war.' For example, instead of allies buying what the report calls 'prestige weapons systems' such as Japan's upgraded F-16s and Tokyo’s plans to co-develop a sixth-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy, which they argue 'will be of limited utility early in a war,' they should spend more on defense and, specifically, expanding training in drone warfare. In the end, the authors offer a grim reminder of the stakes. The United States, they write, 'should be under no illusions: there will be no refuge or rest from the long reach of Chinese missiles for U.S. air bases in a war. U.S. decision-makers should ask themselves the hard questions: whether — and when — paying that high price in materiel and human lives will be in the United States’ national interest.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/us-allies-must-rebuild-air-forces-invest-in-drones-to-counter-chinas-missile-threat-to-runways-stimson/	2024-12-12T06:28:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/211208_japan_patriot_kadena_478843-scaled-e1638991696715.jpg
Capability exists to simulate the future of kill chains at theater scale	The U.S. Army Futures Command is using Raytheon's RCADE simulation tool to conduct theater-level concept experimentation and mission analysis to support agile learning of the future battlefield. (Raytheon image) It’s one thing to describe in words a new defense system, and another to visualize it. Even better to demonstrate it in an advanced modeling and simulation environment so leaders can better understand risks, design trades and, most importantly, how it integrates with other systems across kill chains and domains. Such a theater-level modeling and simulation tool exists today in the form of the Rapid Campaign Analysis and Demonstration Environment (RCADE). Developed by Raytheon Advanced Technology, an incubator within RTX that is developing capabilities like the U.S. Air Force’s Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, RCADE is designed to help defense leaders determine the most important kill-chain attributes that will be needed in potential conflicts of the near future and in years to come. In mid-2024, the U.S. Army Futures Command-Futures and Concepts Center (FCC) awarded Raytheon Advanced Technology a contract to conduct theater-level concept experimentation and mission analysis to support agile learning of the future battlefield. Under the contract, Raytheon Advanced Technology uses RCADE to develop theater-level scenarios to help the Army assess concepts for joint multi-domain operations. The goal is to change outcomes for the positive through quantitative data and findings from demonstration scenarios that point to potential technical achievements and capabilities needed to succeed in future conflicts. A theater-level perspective of the kill chain As the complexity of battlefield scenarios increases, future defense challenges have to be approached from both a theater- and mission-level perspective. Having that vantage point has never been more important — or more difficult to come by. 'After several conversations with Army Leadership, it became clear that modeling and simulation, and more specifically the ability to do rapid, iterative turns, could expedite the process to identify where capability gaps may exist, and how to address them,' said Tom Goolsby, senior principal engineer, Raytheon Advanced Technology. 'We introduced RCADE as a way to augment, buttress and enhance their existing capability. With RCADE we’re able to help the Army see what an integrated solution might look like in terms of the full warfighting capability.' For senior leaders, in particular, RCADE analyses help them understand decision trade space and associated risk. When they're making hard decisions, and have to justify and defend those decisions, RCADE provides them with quantitative analysis they can rely upon. 'We're not trying to predict the exact future,' said Goolsby. 'With RCADE, we create a baseline for a certain combination of systems in a particular theater, and then try to understand trade-offs or deltas when we insert new technologies, capabilities, and alternate employment support structures. All those become new reference points that show us where the results from the model improved, or vice versa.' 'RCADE gives you a rapid ability to test concepts; is this a good or bad idea for this theater and use case,' said Goolsby. 'Our goal is to maximize the number of iterations as quickly as we can.' Understanding trade-offs in theater campaigns Computational theater-level analysis stretches back many decades, pioneered both within the government and private sector institutions such as the RAND Corporation. Today’s DoD has excellent tools and program offices for that purpose, and also modeling and simulation capabilities targeted at detailed system development and program execution. Sometimes, though, a theater-level situation arises where they can't cover a broad trade space in the time that a decision needs to be made. While Defense Department capabilities remain critical, RCADE’s role comes to the forefront when answers to questions are needed sooner than later or when more information is needed to know what to study in detail. This is where the 'R' for rapid in RCADE comes in. 'RCADE studies are not typically focused on integrating existing products for near term outcomes, but instead consider more ‘green space’ problems,' said George Blaha, a Raytheon principal engineering fellow. 'Our work with the Army Futures Command is looking out 10-15+ years. When we’re trying to figure out the big trade-offs in large-scale theaters like INDOPACOM or EUCOM for example, that complexity is what drives the need for a tool like RCADE.' RCADE’s versatility helps defense leaders see what an integrated solution might look like in terms of the full warfighting capability and visualize and quantify the impacts of different capability mixes and employment concepts. It provides insight into the key pillars of their acquisition process – cost, schedule, and performance – so they can shape their long-term investment strategies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/capability-exists-to-simulate-the-future-of-kill-chains-at-theater-scale/	2024-12-12T05:25:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Raytheon-Insights-image-article-3-scaled.jpg
House passes $884B NDAA despite transgender care ban controversy	U.S Army Spc. Breyana Semans, a military police officer with the 46th Military Police Company, Michigan National Guard, secures an area near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, March 1, 2021. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class R.J. Lannom Jr.) WASHINGTON — The House passed the $884 billion National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2025 today, despite a sizable Democrat contingent opposing the typically bipartisan measure due to the last minute-inclusion of a transgender care ban. The bill was voted through 281-140, with 124 Democrats and 16 Republicans voting against the measure. The compromise NDAA keeps to the budgetary spending caps imposed by last year’s debt ceiling deal, which set a $895 billion limit for all national defense related spending for FY25. Some of that spending is not covered in the jurisdiction of the NDAA. The focal point of this year’s bill is a 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers and 4.5 percent raise for all servicemembers, as well as a laundry list of provisions intended to improve troop’s quality of life — a political slam dunk for both sides. However, Democrats were infuriated by a last minute addition of language by House Speaker Mike Johnson that would ban Tricare from covering gender dysphoria treatments 'that could result in sterilization' for transgender children of servicemembers. The House Armed Services Committee’s top Democrat, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, announced on Tuesday that he would vote against the bill despite having helped helm it, due to the anti-transgender provisions. During a Saturday interview with Breaking Defense, Smith said he would have been in favor of adding language to study the effects of medical treatment for transgender minors, but that 'it is not debatable that there are some minors with gender dysphoria who benefit from the treatments that this bill would ban.' 'You are denying health care to the children of service members that they need to serve a partisan agenda. And I think that's extraordinarily problematic,' he said. For a larger rundown of the bill’s funding recommendations and policy mandates, read this: What to know about what's in the compromise NDAA During a press conference earlier today, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he had not taken an official position on the NDAA and would leave it for each member to make their own decision on a case-by-case basis. In floor speeches ahead of the bill’s passage, most senior HASC Democrats expressed support for the bill. HASC Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., told The Hill on Tuesday that Johnson did not consult him about including the care ban. Although Rogers said he agreed with the substance of the language, he sees the addition of the provisions as unnecessary due to the election of President Donald Trump. 'My preference would have been that we just let the president, on Jan. 20, deal with these [culture issues],' Rogers said, 'which he’s already indicated he’s going to do.' But in remarks ahead of the vote, Rogers said that the bill represents a 'bicameral compromise' and that 'each corner has some wins and some losses.' The Republican-controlled Rules Committee, which set the terms of the bill’s passage on Monday, voted against bringing an amendment to the floor that would have allowed members to reverse the transgender care ban, as well as another amendment that would have given governors greater control over the transition of National Guard units to the Space Force. The bill authorizes $883.7 billion for fiscal year 2025, including $849.9 billion for Department of Defense programs. It also approves $33.3 billion for national security programs in the Department of Energy and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board and $512.4 million for defense-related activities. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is expected to pass despite some Democrats’ concerns about the transgender care provisions, as well as disappointment from some top GOP defense hawks who had hoped the Senate’s version of the bill — which lifted the NDAA topline to $911.8 billion, pushing overall national defense spending to $923.3 billion — would ultimately prevail. 'The failure to include a topline increase is a tremendous loss for our national defense,' said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee who is in line to take the gavel in January. 'Many senior flag officers, defense strategists, and other experts continue to note that this is the most dangerous moment since World War II,' he said in a statement Monday. 'Not only does this NDAA thwart the bipartisan will of the Senate, but it signifies a profound missed opportunity to strengthen President-elect Trump’s hand when he takes office.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/house-passes-844b-ndaa-despite-transgender-care-ban-controversy/	2024-12-11T13:47:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/221116_DVIDS_capitol_soldier_6538166-scaled-e1668635639247.jpg
Space Force sees mutual benefit from new Japan component	The sixth and seventh satellites in Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System constellation will carry US Space Force space surveillance payloads. (Credit: JAXA) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The head of US Space Forces Indo-Pacific sees his brand new field component in Japan as an two way opportunity — with the US side helping Japan flesh out its still nascent military space organization and the Japanese side using its planned investments to grow allied operational capabilities to face ever-increasing threats from China in the region. Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir told reporters at the Space Force Association's Spacepower conference in Orlando, Fla., that the new United States Space Forces – Japan at Yokota Air Base, stood up Dec. 4, 'is going to be really key as United States transforms US Forces Japan into an operational headquarters.' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced in July plans to elevate US Forces Japan, also headquartered at Yokota, to a joint force headquarters which will report to the commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo. Mastalir said the newest Space Force component will be 'working very closely' with the commander of US Forces Japan, Lt. Gen. Stephen Jost, and Japanese forces at the Japan Joint Operations Center 'to fully integrate the space component. 'As we evolve that relationship back in Oahu, we continue integrating across all the other service components throughout the INDOPACOM headquarters and with allies and partners,' he said. 'And this is manifested in terms of better integration of space and space equities into our internal processes, &#8230; identifying exercise objectives as part of the joint exercise life cycle, and providing some joint training, because the joint force, in many cases, depends on the Guardians assigned to those organizations to help them understand the equities of space and how it impacts their war fighting capabilities.' Mastalir said that from the time Space Forces Indo-Pacific was activated, his intent was to 'have some organization in country' largely to focus on integrating with the Japan Self Defense Force as it builds up its Space Operations Squadron, which was launched in 2020. He noted that the Japanese military intends to first elevate the squadron to a wing, and 'eventually' to its own command. 'Additionally, Japan has in their defense spending plan allocated billions [of dollars] US to increase space capabilities, and to the extent that we're able to help shape and inform those investments in a way that makes the alliance [better], it makes working and fighting alongside allies more interoperable and more effective. And I wanted to have an organization there that could contribute to that solution,' he added. Mastalir noted that the US and Japan already are working closely on a number of space programs, including Tokyo's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) constellation. The sixth and seventh QZSS satellites will carry Space Force space surveillance payloads, with the QZSS 6 launching early in fiscal year 2026 and QZSS 7 early in fiscal 2027. Further, the US last year agreed to use data from Japan's evolving deep space radar to improve its space domain awareness, and Mastalir expressed interest in the country's plans to also launch a 'free flying' space domain awareness satellite. Space domain awareness is one of US Space Command's top priorities, with a keen eye to the on-orbit activities of China that US military leaders see as a growing threat. 'We must protect and defend our blue space assets to ensure that the Joint Force can close the long-range kill chains that they intend to execute. Second, we must be prepared to challenge red space in order to break the PLA's long-range kill chains and protect the Joint Force from space-enabled attack,' Mastalir said. 'Those are themes that you heard earlier today from the [Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman], and they are absolutely 100 percent imperative when you look at the threats that we're facing in the Indo-Pacific,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-sees-mutual-benefit-from-new-japan-component/	2024-12-11T13:42:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-1.11.17 PM.png
Australia must increase joint training, build more together with US, Japan: Reports	Japan's Special Operations Group, JGSDF, conducted a field training exercise with the Special Operations Command Australia in September 2023. This photo was posted on social media by the Japanese Self Defense Forces. (SDF) SYDNEY — America, Japan and Australia know their national security establishments must work more closely together, as reflected by a number of signed agreements and commitments. But, a pair of independent studies have both concluded, the countries still have significant work to do on training and practicing how to fight together. The two reports focus on different bilateral angles. The first, from the University of Western Australia [PDF], is focused on Japan and Australia's relationship. The second, from the Carnegie Foundation, if focused on Australia and Washington. But taken together, they have clear overlaps and paint a picture of where trilateral cooperation may be going between the three Pacific partners. As mentioned, the UWA study is about Tokyo and Canberra. Author Tom Corben, of the US Studies Center at the University of Sydney, points to the close strategic relationship between the two countries, stressing that this must grow from its current focus on sharing intelligence assessments and declaring new policies to improving operational cooperation, giving Japan more access to Australia's vast training and testing facilities. He also calls for the recent agreement to regularly rotate Japanese marines in and out of northern Australia to be acted upon. Corben also notes that the two US allies are more closely bound to each other than to any other military except that of the United States. But much of this relationship is relatively new, and required casting aside more than 50 years of suspicion and anger borne of Japan's conduct during World War II. The long-term success of Australia-Japan defense cooperation 'could hinge greatly' on their ability to harmonize their modernization agendas, according to the report. While the AUKUS ITAR reforms, designed to smooth the sharing of information between the US, Britain and Australia, have eased Australia's ability to buy and sell weapons with the US, Corben raises the issue of whether the AUKUS reforms will pose 'legal disincentives for Japanese companies to work with the Australian government.' Corben recommends that Australia and Japan boost their submarine surveillance, including deployment of aircraft to each other's bases and increasing operational intelligence sharing. When it comes to the Japanese forces that will begin rotations to Darwin and its environs, Corben says the two countries should focus on their forces first, 'rather than simply focusing on trilateral activities with the United States.' The US Marines regularly come to northern Australia each year for training and exercises. Finally, Corben says Canberra should consider working with Tokyo to produce and develop long-range strike weapons, including producing Japanese-designed missiles in Australia to avoid possible US arms export restrictions that would affect Japan. Australia's Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordinance could be a good focus for this. The second report, edited by Evan Feigenbaum of the Carnegie Foundation, argues that Canberra and Washington 'have an unparalleled opportunity to fashion broader, stronger, and multilayered partnerships. 'But this, in turn, will require self-reflection,' he writes,' not just cheerleading. And that means undertaking an intellectually honest appraisal of the promises and challenges inherent to the alliance.' That means 'both countries need to undertake difficult reforms, forge new modes of cooperation, harmonize outdated regulations, better align national strategies, address acute Australian sovereignty concerns and associated questions around risk thresholds, and develop accelerated solutions to enduring alliance management challenges.' Time is short, with the loss of strategic warning time, so 'reforming the alliance is now an urgent priority.' Australian and American defense planners, he opines, have not fully confronted 'some thorny operational questions.' The two countries, he says, 'have very little history divvying up roles and missions in the manner that will be required for deterrence, defense, and ultimately warfighting in the context of high-intensity conflict in the Indo-Pacific.' They also need to better integrate and align their industrial bases. One of the chapters recommends that a 'cadre of contracting officers should meet annually to discuss contracting strategies for nontraditional commercial technology providers' and share acquisition lessons. This is all driven by China's 'growing military capabilities and hostile intent.' It also proffers the interesting idea of a 'Future Warfare Strategy Team' that would include strategists, uniformed personnel, researchers and investors to meet biennially. They would explore operational responses to different Indo-Pacific contingencies such as a Taiwan blockade or invasion, a Korean peninsula crisis, or an escalation in China's coercion of the Philippines. They also propose several ventures to improve the two countries' ability to tap entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to best identify and develop advanced commercial technologies, similar to the Defense Innovation Unit of the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/australia-must-increase-joint-training-build-more-together-with-us-japan-two-reports/	2024-12-11T13:01:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/japan-sof-e1715971028155.jpg
‘Never been done’: Army to test out new integrated data layer on classified networks at Convergence	Soldiers from U.S. Army Special Operations Command train with devices connected via the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) system in preparation for their employment during Project Convergence 22. PC22 is an All-Service and Multinational campaign of learning featuring experiments on hundreds of different technologies and capabilities. (U.S. Army photo by CPT Alex Werden) SAVANNAH, Ga. — For the first time the Army plans to stress test its Next Generation Command and Control's integrated data layer on classified networks at the service's sprawling Project Convergence Capstone 5 event, according to two officers involved in the program. The Army demonstrated the integrated data layer’s abilities during the NetModX exercise in New Jersey back in September, but Convergence will be a bigger test. 'Our last demonstration ... was in New Jersey but that was more to push the data across tactical transport modalities. But this is going to be the first time we'll run on secure classified networks. We're pulling live data and then integrating it in all the different warfighting functions. So it's a pretty big, pretty big push,' Col. Matt Skaggs, director of tactical applications and architecture at Army Futures Command, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Army's Technical Exchange Meeting Tuesday. 'That's candidly never been done before,' he added. eBook: Project Convergence, the Army's tech showcase for the future 'The initial focus for our strategy is building an integrated data layer for our ecosystem, and that allows all the different applications that normally would be on a different data model to be on the same foundation. So everybody can have the same view of the operational environment,' Skaggs said. RELATED: Pentagon's CJADC2 dreams &#8216;very aspirational' right now, Marine Corps general says As a former intelligence officer, Skaggs said the process of making sense of data without an interface like the integrated data layer was much more complex. 'So as an intel guy, we would pull data off of all the airborne sensors and all the ground-based sensors, and it would give us a view of what the enemy is doing,' he said. 'But as you have separate data ingress and each of those data fields are getting processed differently, they're not compatible. So we would have five or six different views of the battlefield, and so what we're trying to do now by combining all that data and curating it all in the same place, that allows us to overlay all of those aforementioned fields at the same time.' Col. Mike Kaloostian, director of transportation and network security for Army Futures Command, said the integrated data layer is 'absolutely the focal point' of the Army’s Next Generation Command and Control initiative — the service’s plan to create an integrated C2 structure focusing on data centricity at all echelons. He said that with the integrated data layer approach, the service will be able to focus more on the interpretation of data instead of collecting it. 'If we're going to handle that type and process that type of data and push it all the way down to the edge, a tactical formation in the field ... we have to think about it differently, right?' Kaloostian asked. The new data layer will help the service to focus on three areas: edge computing, the diverse transportation of data and software defined networking, he added. 'Those are the three areas that we're really focused on,' Kaloostian said. 'Moving there, orchestrating all of that to ensure that we're getting data to the edge, and that data is flowing appropriately amongst the echelons before horizontally and vertically. That's the focal point.' But the colonels said the data transport layer won’t stop there. It will also have artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities baked in that will perform data correlation and normalization, Skaggs said. 'If we have an example of correlations, we have three different sensors up, and they're coming back with three slightly different views, or where an entity would be on a battlefield, the AI can infer where the correlation of that collection sigma is, and then put where that dot is.' He added that this can also help differentiate between enemy systems and the Army’s own systems. 'Machines have a hard time parsing that, unless you manually correlate it. So the AI will pull out different data fields and see where the overlap is and then render that into an object that's usable by the rest of the applications,' Skaggs said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/never-been-done-army-to-test-out-new-integrated-data-layer-on-classified-networks-at-convergence/	2024-12-11T12:06:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241211_DVIDS_army_convergence_tablet_7479423-scaled-e1733928484426.jpg
Pentagon launches new generative AI ‘cell’ with $100M for pilots, experiments	Staff Sgt. Tullis Moore a cyber operator with 175th Cyber Operations, Maryland Air National Guard monitors cyber attacks during Exercise Southern Strike at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, April 21, 2023.(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon today announced it's setting up a new AI Rapid Capabilities Cell meant to accelerate the military’s adoption of Large Language Models and other forms of generative artificial intelligence. The new AIRCC (pronounced 'Arc') will implement the recommendations [PDF] of Task Force Lima, which was created in 2023 to get a handle on the unexpected explosion of 'GenAI' and is now officially disbanded — although some as-yet unnamed members of the Task Force will move over to the accelerator cell, said outgoing Chief Digital &amp; AI Officer (CDAO) Radha Plumb. 'Over the course of 12 months, Task Force Lima analyzed hundreds of AI workflows and tasks, [from] warfighting functions like command and control decision support [to] enterprise management functions like financial management and healthcare information management,' Plumb said. 'AI adoption by adversaries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea is accelerating and poses significant national security risks,' she warned. 'We are taking an all hands on deck approach to ensuring the US continues to lead the way and accelerate DoD adoption of these tools.' AIRCC will be run by CDAO but work closely with the Defense Innovation Unit, the Pentagon’s outreach arm to Silicon Valley and other centers of private-sector innovation nationwide, Plumb told reporters today. It’ll have $100 million in funding to launch efforts on four fronts: (Technically and confusingly, this funding comes from the budgets for federal fiscal years 2024 and 2025. However, Plumb said, all $100 million come from Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation funds, aka RDTE, which can be used up to three years after the end of the year for which it was appropriated). GenAI applications that prove successful in testing and get positive feedback from would-be users — whether military officers or civilian officials — will get further funding to scale up to widespread deployment. When will that happen? 'I can't give you a specific timeline, because it really depends on the performance of the technology,' Plumb told reporters. That said, she noted proudly, when Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks challenged CDAO and its partners to come up with a global data-sharing system for the Combatant Commands, known as Combined Joint Global Command &amp; Control (CJADC2), they got a 'Minimum Viable Capability' operational within a year. 'That was about a nine to 12-month cycle to get all the way to the MVC for a pretty complex technology,' Plumb said. The new GenAI effort will take the same accelerated approach, she said. Radha Iyengar Plumb, seen in a 2022 photo, has been tapped as the next Chief Data and Artificial Intelligence Officer. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) Indeed, she argued, the Pentagon is already moving quickly on generative AI, at least by its own standards. Today’s creation of the new accelerator cell comes two years after OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT and 16 months after the Pentagon stood up its Task Force Lima to figure out how to harness the explosion in 'GenAI.' 'Today the Department is officially sunsetting Task Force Lima and, to concretely implement their recommendations, we’re establishing the AI Rapid Capability Cell,' Plumb said. That’s ahead of schedule, she emphasized. 'Task Force Lima did an incredible job,' she said. 'We had slated it for 18 months, and within 12 months, they had made so much progress and had such concrete recommendations that we moved to stand up the cell for actual execution.' (That implies the Task Force submitted its recommendations in August and it’s taken the last four months to get the AI accelerator cell organized and ready for today’s official launch). Those recommendations go beyond the GenAI accelerator cell officially launched today. According to a four-page summary of Task Force Lima’s report [PDF], CDAO and other Pentagon agencies must work to safeguard the new technology. That includes researching potential security issues unique to GenAI, adapting government classification protocols and security standards, and potentially using GenAI itself to accelerate the notoriously cumbersome Authority To Operate (ATO) procedures. The Task Force also calls for DoD to 'develop and resource a comprehensive acquisition strategy for GenAI' — which would be difficult to figure out at any time, but especially on the cusp of a presidential transition. It’s worth noting TF Lima’s original 18-month deadline would have had it delivering its recommendations in early 2025 — after the Biden Administration and Biden appointees like Plumb had all left office. Once-and-future President Donald Trump and his advisors have publicly blasted the Pentagon for being too slow and bureaucratic to adopt new tech, while his inner circle includes tech enthusiasts and AI entrepreneurs who have called for a 'Manhattan Project'-style push on AI. So while specific Biden-era AI efforts may go under the axe, AI as a whole is expected to keep accelerating. 'I will transition at the end of this administration, but the rest of CDAO will still be here, and of course the mission continues,' Plumb said this morning. 'We've seen broad, widespread support in this administration [and] from the incoming team. We see it … across the aisle, bipartisan, in Congress; we see it bicamerally in the House and Senate.

The Pentagon must build weapons differently to mobilize for the information age	M3 tanks under construction during World War II. (Detroit Public Library) The Pentagon’s depleted weapons magazines don’t look like those of a military preparing to fight China in two years. Facing shortages for training and future contingencies, Washington has constrained weapons shipments to Ukraine. At home, industry is unable to keep up with demand and the changes needed to counter GPS jamming. But the uncomfortable truth is this—today’s scarcity is self-imposed. With their custom components and bespoke integration, the DoD’s preferred munitions are more like the artisan products featured on Etsy than the mass-produced weapons that came off assembly lines during World War II. The Arsenal of Democracy turned auto plants into aircraft and bomb factories by designing—or redesigning—military hardware for producibility. To prepare for protracted conflict, the DoD needs to think like a manufacturer and pursue weapons that leverage existing parts and elastic production facilities. America has plenty of capacity for the Pentagon to tap. US manufacturing output rose during the last decade, and the $100 billion US electronics contract manufacturing industry already builds complex and competitive products from MRI machines to chip-making equipment. US production of semiconductors—the heart of any new weapon—is growing faster than any other country. But harnessing US manufacturing capacity demands a different acquisition philosophy. Program officials will need to avoid custom components that create artificial scarcity. Like Dell or General Electric, who maintain quality and control while designing around available commercial parts, the Pentagon needs to build weapons that can evolve with dynamic supply chains. This means moving away from rigidly specified configurations toward continuous testing and qualification processes that enable ongoing evolution. Three programs illuminate this new way forward: The Air Force/Defense Innovation Unit Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program shows how modern industrial approaches can enable adaptability at scale. The program designs cruise missiles using modular components and open architectures that decouple software-heavy guidance and sensing systems from physical structures. As a result, ETV can use faster modular production techniques and continuously evolve through software and component updates. Two other programs are focused on speed and price by taking advantage of existing components. The Navy's air-launched Multi-mission Affordable Capacity Effector (MACE) is designed to cost under $300,000 per unit at annual production rates of 500-plus while delivering ranges comparable to missiles costing ten times as much. The Navy hopes to achieve these characteristics by taking advantage of existing guidance and control systems, additive manufacturing for rocket motors, and modular designs. Like MACE, the Air Force's Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) program is planning to use available components and modular manufacturing to achieve high production rates. Intended for the tough electromagnetic environment in Ukraine, the Air Force wants ERAM to be adaptable and able to navigate without GPS. The normal Pentagon response to munition shortfalls—as urged by many defense analysts—is to try to build more of today’s weapons. But this approach is fundamentally flawed. Even adding a whole new production line at best doubles output, while depleting inventories of custom components and creating artificial scarcity. And as we saw in Ukraine, battlefield innovation can make stockpiles of exquisite weapons irrelevant in an instant. So, instead of continuing to stockpile obsolescence, the DoD should design a complementary family of weapons from the bottom up that could be built at multiple facilities in wartime. Requirements officials will need to prioritize adaptability and production scale over raw performance. Program managers will need to use open architectures that enable continuous evolution as technology and supply chains evolve. Most important, industry will need to create surge-able, mass-producible designs that align with existing manufacturing capacity. This bottom-up approach takes advantage of America's industrial strengths. The US contract manufacturing base that already produces precision electronics at volumes that dwarf military demands. These companies maintain sophisticated quality control and security protocols and offer elastic capacity that can surge when needed. The foundation they provide for weapons assembly could be complemented by component technologies for software, rocket motors, warhead chemicals, and automated manufacturing and 3D printing for structural elements being pursued by a new generation of US defense startups. Critics will argue that tapping into commercial capacity compromises performance or security. But that misses the point. A weapon in hand that can evolve with the fight is infinitely more useful to US troops than an empty missile magazine and an impressive PowerPoint deck. DoD acquisition officials should take four key actions to implement this new family of weapons. First, they need to remove policy barriers that hinder using commercial components such as outdated or inflexible technical standards. Second, they should accelerate ongoing efforts to digitize and make testing and qualification a streamlined and continuous process instead of a laborious one-time validation. Third, they will need to organize weapons programs to allow building and evolving mission systems from seekers to thrusters independently from physical structures. Finally, they should write contracts to reward a vendor’s ability to produce on time and at scale over its ability to meet arbitrary performance targets. None of these changes need new legislation or reorganization. They simply require program executives to direct a bottom-up approach driven by available industrial capabilities rather than arbitrary top-down performance specifications. The ERAM, MACE, and ETV programs prove this model can work. What's needed now is the will to fund and scale it. Like Freedom’s Forge during World War II, US mobilization in the 21st century should rely on fundamental American economic strengths like technological innovation, product adaptability, and market-driven solutions. The Pentagon can field a new generation of weapons that leverage these attributes. The question is whether requirements officials and program managers can start behaving like titans of industry rather than art connoisseurs before it is too late.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-pentagon-must-build-weapons-differently-to-mobilize-for-the-information-age/	2024-12-11T09:34:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/Tanks1Final.jpg.CROP_.original-original-e1637611292874.jpg
Coast Guard commandant praises ICE Pact’s potential, still needs icebreakers ‘now’	US Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw breaks ice in Whitefish Bay, Mich., in support of Operation Spring Breakout, March 16, 2009. (US Coast Guard/Petty Officer 3rd Class George Degener) 'My view on what ICE Pact will do for us is it creates broader synergies beyond just what US ship building capacity can do … [and] will allow us to leverage lessons and insights and capacity and expertise that the Finnish and the Canadians have alongside us,' Adm. Linda Fagan told Breaking Defense over the weekend on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'What that actually translates to in the future? It's so new. I don't know,' she later added. In July the three nations announced the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact, meant to speed the production of new vessels using Canadian and Finnish expertise along with America's larger industrial base. In November the countries inked a joint memorandum of understanding with key four elements: enhanced information exchange, workforce development collaboration, engagement with allies and partners, and research and development. But the US shipbuilding industrial base is already under strain, and ICE Pact is just taking its first steps. 'The challenge now is leveraging all the goodness that's in ICE Pact to actually begin to accelerate some of the icebreaker building and conversation in the country,' Fagan said. 'There's a defense industrial base reality to this, certainly as it pertains to shipbuilding and shipyard capacity.' RELATED: ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers The four-star admiral said that the nations have stood up working groups to look for collaborative opportunities and nail down just how each nation can contribute for 'actual effectiveness.' 'The ICE Pact doesn't impact any of the federal acquisition rules, the Buy American requirements, all of that is in place,' Fagan said. 'We're &#8230; sort of negotiating through this part of what the working groups are going to need.' 'Ideally, it does speed up delivery, lower cost, increase the pace of delivery but this … really is just starting,' she added. Part of that challenge stems from the Bollinger acquisition of the Halter Marine shipyard that held the previous heavy icebreaker deal. 'The contract that was negotiated with the previous yard is a firm-fixed price contract bid at a price… [and] the current reality is the ship can't be built at the original bid price,' Fagen said. 'What the additional cost is, is what we're working to definitize right now.' Complicating the matter further, Fagan said, is the fact that this deal is only for the first of three vessels, the most expensive, and there is a 'huge uncertainty' ensuring there will be a steady stream of dollars for the other two due the budgeting process and Congressional approval. While Fagan declined to disclose just what price tag that first vessel may now come in at, she said she hopes to get the deal inked in the coming weeks. 'The aim point,' she added, 'is I need the ship now, and we need it at a fair cost that reflects what it's going to take the yard to build it.' Once that full-rate production deal is in place, it will likely take the yard four-plus years to get it ready for water.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/coast-guard-commandant-praises-ice-pacts-potential-still-needs-icebreakers-now/	2024-12-11T08:10:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240711_DVIDS_icebreaker_1090563-e1720702863965.jpg
What Army officers hope C2 Fix will actually fix in the field	US Army soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division use SMETs during a recent training exercise. (Ashely Roque/Breaking Defense) But that's a good thing, one of the officers said, because that means the service is prioritizing the soldiers who will actually use the tech when it matters most. 'A big portion of the huge benefits of the program is the focus on the end user,' Lt. Col. Jon Nielsen, commander of the 2nd Battalion in the 101st Airborne Division, told the audience at the Army's 13th Technical Exchange Meeting today in Savannah, Ga. 'Something I've never experienced within the Army is that the actual process, the actual capabilities driven by the end user, the squad leader, the platoon leader, platoon sergeant, first sergeant, company level leaders that are utilizing the equipment or having feedback prior to each one of those major training exercises. Then [they] also follow up afterwards to adjust the things that we saw that didn't work, and then integrate them as part of that effort.' Soldiers from the 101st as well as the 10th Mountain Division have been called to participate in the service’s C2 Fix initiative — the Army’s strategy to make its current network operations more efficient so they can 'fight tonight.' C2 Fix is also part of the service’s larger transformation in contact project that the same divisions have participated in over the past year. According to Nielsen and two of his colleagues, end users are asking for: When it comes to edge computing, the Army has long acknowledged the modern battlefield is saturated with data from sources like high-definition drone video feeds, which has created a bandwidth bottleneck. One solution is to do more computing and analysis of that data 'at the edge,' or in the field, so it doesn't have to be sent off anywhere in the first place, or at least so that only key data must be transmitted. RELATED: Empowered edge vs. the centralization trap: Who will weild AI better, the US or China? Right now, Nielsen suggested current edge computing options aren't enough. 'We still have a reliance on the server stack, and I know that we're moving towards working towards finding an edge compute solution, but it certainly slows down the data transmission,' he said. 'We found that to be something that's hindered us in each one of our collective training exercises. So we need to find an edge compute solution that allows us to transmit data quickly.' Similarly, Nielsen bemoaned limited options for communication over embattled or disconnected networks. For that, he said, the Army needs more pLEO satellite communication solutions — especially useful in the face of electronic warfare. 'Our ability to have some pLEO solution on the move is something we need. There's a requirement to have mobile C2 [command and control] or mobile CP [command post] platforms at every edge, at every echelon. So whether that be company up to division, we're a lot lighter than we were when we went to JRTC [Joint Readiness Training Center] in January. Then when we went back again in August, some of our headquarters elements went from tents all the way down to vehicles,' Nielsen said. 'It certainly increases our lethality.' Related: Army using ‘transformation in contact’ to make case for new weapons, formation decisions Fellow panelist Col. David Lamborn, 2nd Brigade Commander, 25th Infantry Division, said that the biggest improvement he wants to see with C2 Fix is also radio-related: the need for more condensed radio equipment that doesn’t rely on connections through 'fragile' cables. 'What I am concerned about with our current C2 architecture is some of the complexity that exists,' Lamborn said. 'If you're moving into the environment, moving tactically, quite often, if you've got a radio and it's hooked up to a wedge and it's hooked up to a battery, those are connected with some kind of expensive and somewhat fragile cables. When those things are hooked up in series, all it takes is one of those components to break and the complexity of the the whole system stops working.' Lamborn added that it would be helpful for industry to develop such systems in a way that 'streamlines' and 'integrates' all of those components into one. 'As you design and deploy capabilities out to us, having them integrated so that they're not exposed and we don't have exposed cables that are inevitably going to get broken as soldiers move through the field,' he said. RELATED: Enough &#8216;one trick ponies': Marine special ops specialists want industry help to fuse tech Also on the topic of hardware, Lt. Col. Joe Kaminski, the G6 at the 3rd Infantry Division, said that one issue that he wants to see solved with C2 Fix is the incompatibility with older weapons systems with new technology systems. 'We all can agree that technology probably changes about every 18 months,' Kaminski said. 'One of the constraints we have with that transformative change is the weapons platforms for the armored elements usually doesn't change for about 30 years, and so we have integrated a lot of those capabilities within the systems, within these track vehicle platforms. 'The problem that we're running into now is the safety certification for any upgrades or changes that need to happen, and that can take a very, very long process and a very expensive process. So one of the things we're pushing back up and identifying is, how do we decouple actually, technology that would transform every three to five years on a platform that doesn't change for 30 to 40 years?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/what-army-officers-hope-c2-fix-will-actually-fix-in-the-field/	2024-12-11T07:15:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_6862-scaled-e1725888049132.jpg
Slovakia closing in on order for 3 C-390 transporters, says Embraer	Embraer showed off its C-390 Millennium carrier during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow. (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — Brazilian manufacturer Embraer said Tuesday that in the next month, Slovakia plans on making 'steps toward' the acquisition of three C-390 Millennium tactical transport aircraft. 'The Slovak Ministry of Defense will start formal steps toward the purchase of three C-390s in January 2025,' Embraer said in a statement. The company added that Slovakian defense minister Robert Kaliňák has stated that the aircraft is the 'best option' to fulfil the European country’s future military transport needs. It also noted that the Slovak Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the Brazilian Ministry of Defense (MoD) signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) agreement focused on renewed industrial cooperation between the two countries. The Slovak MoD website had not shared any information about the purported procurement, and the MoD did not respond to a request for comment by publication. But it would be extremely unusual for a company to make such a definitive statement without approval of its customer. The aircraft has been on a run of wins in Europe, with Sweden most recently selecting it. Additionally, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands have all placed orders, while Hungary and Portugal currently operate the platform. Given that Slovakia shares borders with Hungary, Austria and the Czech Republic, Embraer noted that 'neighbouring countries' could find 'synergies in terms of training, logistics and cooperation in the future capabilities and growth of their fleets.'

'The change of the security situation after 2020 and the ongoing armed conflicts also have a major impact on the performance of the tasks of the air transport aviation of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, including the requirements for their new capabilities,' reads an online translation of the documents. They were shared with lawmakers as part of a motion, since approved, to make the transport aviation effort a 'strategic investment' and shield it from scrutiny. Local media reported that the new status of the project protects it from assessment by Slovakia's Value for Money department. The documents also draw on concerns surrounding the operational utility of the C-27J, which looks set to be prematurely withdrawn from service after first starting operations in 2017. They state that C-27Js operated at 'the limit of their operational range' when conducting missions in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. Additionally, 'due to their maximum operational range and on-board equipment' the two aircraft, 'could not be deployed in support of the operations of the Armed Forces in Central Africa, where Slovak soldiers were deployed in the Central African Republic and Mali.' As a third example, it was shared that 'capacity limitations' of the tactical airlifters were identified and 'current equipment' deemed 'insufficient' during Afghanistan evacuation flights that took place in the aftermath of the humanitarian crisis following the Taliban’s 2021 return to power. 'These capability shortfalls have been repeatedly identified as critical in the conduct of evacuation flights from the area of military operations in Lebanon in 2024, where repeated transports have been conducted from Beirut airport with available aircraft that do not have self-protection systems and have a low transport capacity for that purpose,' add the documents. Outside of the transport aviation recapitalization effort, Slovakia is one of nine NATO allies involved in the alliance’s Strategic Airlift International Solution (SALIS) program that entitles members to access fixed wing, excess cargo capabilities at short notice, by calling upon Antonov AN-124-100 aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/slovakia-closing-in-on-order-for-3-c-390-transporters-says-embraer/	2024-12-11T06:31:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
Emirate’s EDGE Group marks 5th birthday, from small disruptor to Middle East heavyweight	EDGE Group shows off some unmanned aerial vehicles at the IDEX defense expo in Abu Dhabi in 2023. (Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Five years after its establishment, UAE defense conglomerate EDGE Group is celebrating its growth with what it says is an order backlog worth $12.8 billion. 'Since its inception in 2019, EDGE has expanded its product portfolio from 30 to 201 cutting-edge solutions across air, land, sea, and cyber domains — a rapid growth of more than 550% in just five years,' the company said in an announcement Monday. EDGE said that its annual revenue amounted to $4.9 billion in 2024, and it now has products in 91 countries. 'In a constantly evolving and highly competitive international defence landscape, it was almost inconceivable that a new disruptor from the UAE could, in just five years, rise so rapidly to become a global industry player punching way above its weight across multiple domains,' EDGE Chairman Faisal Al Bannai said in the statement. EDGE is a state-owned defense conglomerate with more than 25 entities dedicated to developing and producing defense solutions in all domains. The conglomerate has consolidated a number of national defense firms and struck joint ventures (JV) with international firms to boost local production and decrease reliance on — and to better compete with — Western products. 'EDGE’s footprint is reinforced by a total of 13 international acquisitions and strategic investments, including stakes in key companies such as Estonia's MILREM Robotics, Swiss unmanned helicopter manufacturer ANAVIA, Brazil's non-lethal tech leader Condor, and Brazil’s smart weapons specialist SIATT,' the statement says. 'These acquisitions, along with nine others, have enhanced EDGE’s capabilities across land, sea, air, and cyber domains, unlocking opportunities in cutting-edge sectors and strengthening its competitive edge globally.' Additionally, EDGE has entered in 23 joint ventures to expand its production and development. The lates, dubbed MAESTRAL was inked with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri in February to produce vessels in Abu Dhabi. EDGE has also expanded its presence in emerging markets in Latin America where it launched its first international office in Brazil in 2023 and bought half of the shares of Brazilian SIATT smart weapons firm that same year. Following the normalization of the relationship between the UAE and Israel, EDGE had signed an agreement with Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI) to codevelop counter unmanned aerial systems. It then invested in Israeli firm High Lander, the provider of an unmanned air traffic management in 2023. 'The setting up of joint ventures with top international original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and the acquisitions of majority shareholdings in small- and middle-sized companies in the defense and tech sectors are at the cornerstone of EDGE’s model of business growth and expansion,' Gulf State Analytics analyst Leonardo Jacopo Maria Mazzucco told Breaking Defense. He added that through the years 'EDGE has captured larger shares of the UAE’s procurement contracts awarded at [Abu Dhabi defense conference] IDEX and generated more significant revenues from export sales.' But Mazzucco said the sprawling firm still has work to do. 'While EDGE has proved capable of bringing to bear its entrepreneurial ambitions, it needs to ensure the long-term sustainability of its investments in R&amp;D, industrial partnerships, and localization efforts in order to fully affirm itself as a truly competitive global industrial player,' he concluded.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/emirates-edge-group-marks-5th-birthday-from-small-disruptor-to-middle-east-heavyweight/	2024-12-11T04:30:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/230223_IDEX_edge_drones_Ferran.png

Mastalir, Commander of USSPACEFORINDOPAC, officiating his assumption of command during the USSPACEFORINDOPAC activation ceremony hosted by USINDOPACOM. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Anthony J. Rivera) SPACEPOWER 2024 — Not only has China's space fleet ballooned over the past decade, but Beijing is increasingly using maneuvering satellites to crisscross geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) in order to keep eyes on, and potentially do harm to, their US counterparts, according to Space Force and industry officials. Chinese satellites are 'zigzagging' from altitudes above GEO, through the belt and then to slightly lower altitudes, often coming uncomfortably close to US satellites, Clint Clark of sky-watching firm Exoanalytics said today. 'China doesn't sit still. They're all over the sky. Why are they doing this? It's because they're coming for you. In their strategy documents, they will tell you, whoever controls space controls the Earth,' he told an audience made up largely of Guardians at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando. 'They go up and down the belt. They hold everybody at risk. Periodically, they do crazy stuff. They'll get on top of a satellite,' Clark said. 'And sometimes they'll pick it up and move it away. They're practicing those tactics.' US Space Force Chief Master Sgt. Ronald Lerch said that Chinese authors have openly written about imaging the Space Force's own eyes in the heavens, the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites, and the brand new SILENTBARKER inspection satellites the service is operating jointly with the National Reconnaissance Office. China's on-orbit fleet has gone from 36 satellites in 2010 to more than 1,000 this year, he stressed. Beijing's current space fleet includes 292 electro-optical and 43 radar satellites for imaging targets on Earth, and 74 signals intelligence gathering satellites, according to a slide he presented — along with a slide showing a Chinese rendering of a GSSAP bird and a synthetic aperture radar image of the US naval base at Norfolk, Va. Also included in the fleet are the 60 satellites making up the Beidou positioning, navigation and timing constellation, Lerch said. 'So, they went from no or barely any capability in 2010 to now they have their own [reliable] GPS. 60 of them — 24 in MEO [medium Earth orbit], three in GEO, and then another three in IXO or inclined GEO, and then one backup for each individual spacecraft,' he elaborated. Beijing's growing space capabilities have meant an increase in the PLA's ability to threaten US forces both in space and on Earth, according to Space Force and industry officials here. 'Norm-shattering behaviors have been enabled because of their ability to have space and what that's able to offer,' Lerch said, noting that Chinese behavior has been 'increasingly assertive' as their space power has grown. 'Their specific goals are to be able to track and target us high value assets at the time and place of their choosing,' Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of US Space Force Indo-Pacific, told reporters. 'We're seeing all signs pointing to being able to target US aircraft carriers, as well as high value assets in the air like tankers and AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft]. This is a strategy to keep the US from intervening, and that's what their space architecture is designed for.' Clark said China for the past 10 years also has 'been practicing' space-based methods for US space capabilities, with systems for rendezvous and proximity operations; docking and capture; characterization and inspection; and counter inspection; as well as developing co-orbital and direct ascent anti-satellite weapons. 'And it's not just that they've been practicing them. They've been doing them in very specific ways, with huge delta-v's relative to what we're able to produce, and they're doing them in ways that challenge our kill chains,' he said. Mastalir said that in order for the US Space Force to counter China's increasing threat, it is important for the service to 'scale our capabilities to meet and exceed what's required in the future, because the PRC is moving. &#8230; As they continue to evolve, we must be prepared to take on those challenges.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-space-moves-highly-mobile-satellites-stalking-geo-spook-space-force/	2024-12-10T13:40:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/7526919-scaled-e1733867404835.jpg
Israel seeks to defang Syria, as 350-plus strikes destroy military sites and equipment	Air defense radar burns at Mezzeh Air Base on December 8, 2024 in Damascus, Syria. (Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images) JERUSALEM — The Israel Defense Forces have carried out more than 350 strikes in Syria since Dec. 7, as Israel seeks to dismantle the Assad regime’s arsenal before it can be taken over by the rebel forces that shockingly took control of the country over the weekend. Dubbed Operation Arrow of Bashan, the Israeli strikes included attacks from the land, sea and air. According to an IDF statement, the strikes have destroyed 'Scud missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters, radars, tanks, hangars, and more.' 'I approved the Air Force bombing of strategic military capabilities left by the Syrian military so that they will not fall into the hands of the jihadists,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Dec 10. 'We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we do intend to do what is necessary for our security.' Netanyahu compared the large-scale precision airstrikes to the British raid on French naval ships in the wake of France’s fall to the Nazis in 1940s. England wanted to prevent the Nazis using French naval ships at the time to expand the relatively small German navy. The IDF said the Israeli Navy carried out a raid on two Syrian naval facilities at the Al-Bayda and Latakia ports, targeting fifteen naval vessels. In addition 'dozens of sea-to-sea missiles with ranges of 80–190 kilometers were destroyed. Each missile carried significant explosive payloads, posing threats to civilian and military maritime vessels in the area,' the IDF said. אריאל כהנא: שרידי ספינות טילים של חיל הים הסורי בנמל טרטוס. תמונות שמהדהדות את השמדת חילות האוויר של מדינות ערב במלחמת ששת הימים pic.twitter.com/J1O0ATz3Le &mdash; זירת החדשות (@ZiratNews) December 10, 2024 The Alma Research and Education Center, which focuses on threats to northern Israel noted that in the wake of the collapse of the Assad regime 'anything from basic military equipment to advanced conventional weapons, strategic capabilities, and even unconventional weapons, such as chemical weapons,' could be taken by various groups, something the group calls 'a clear and immediate danger.' Ksenia Svetlova, a former member of Knesset and Executive Director of the NGO Ropes, also noted this sense of concern in Israel in a conversation with Breaking Defense. 'When Israel pounds Syrian military objectives, this is because of the fear it might fall into the wrong hands — and there are many wrong hands in Syria as we know,' said Svetlova. 'There are no guarantees that the new rulers of Syria will be able to maintain control or be able to prevent from military factions that with them of doing something that can jeopardize Israel’s interests.' Yaakov Katz, who wrote a book called Shadow Strike on the Israeli strike on Syria’s nuclear program in 2007 and is a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense that 'Syria has amassed significant strategic weapons over the last few decades &#8211; ballistic missiles, chemical weapons and aircraft.' He agreed with Svetlova and the Alma center that there should be real concern that these weapons might fall into the wrong hands. The IDF 'is doing it to keep Israel safe, but this is a benefit for the entire world,' Katz said. The Syrian regime historically possessed a large arsenal of both conventional and, although its chemical arsenal was officially destroyed year ago, unconventional weapons. Many of the conventional weapons are of Russian origin, including Mig-23 jets and attack helicopter, plus air defenses systems. Syria’s main military arm was its ground forces, although these were badly damaged in more than a decade of intense fighting during the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. Photos and footage posted online showed a number of the sites allegedly struck, including military airfields. Because the strikes were carried out at night, it was not always possible to confirm which strikes were Israeli strikes and which may have been other incidents. Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan who led the international terrorism team at Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee, described the strikes in a post online as a 'strategic masterstroke by Israel. In perhaps the most intensive bombing campaign in its history, Israel has destroyed the Syrian air force, air defences, navy and army assets plus defence industries and C2I.' Svetlova noted that in the wake of the strikes it was interesting to see a lack of statement from the new rulers in Damascus about the attacks. The strongest faction in Damascus today is Hayat Tahrir al Sham and its leader Mohammed el Jolani. Mohammed al-Bashir, an HTS loyalist, was appointed the new Prime Minister of Syria on Dec. 10. Ksenia said she had seen criticism online among Syrian activists about the silence in Damascus. 'Some label it and frame it as support for Israel, or even cooperation or collaboration with Israel, which is of course not true. Israel was surprised by this development just like everybody else.' She noted the strongest reactions were condemnation by Iran and Hezbollah. Turkey, Qatar and other countries have also condemned the Israeli strikes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israel-seeks-to-defang-syria-as-350-plus-strikes-destroy-military-sites-and-equipment/	2024-12-10T13:05:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/syria-air-defese-scaled-e1733864604640.jpg
In NDAA, Congress aims to move ball forward on solving drone incursion problem	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019.(Photo by Staff Sgt. Mylinda DuRousseau) EDWARDS AFB, Calif.— Congress wants more information from the Pentagon on what authorities and technologies it needs to protect military installations from the threat of drone incursions, as a spate of high-profile incidents spark concerns that adversaries could use drones to exploit weaknesses in US base security. The compromise version of the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, released on Saturday, includes several provisions aimed at improving the US military’s response to potential drone threats to its installations, including the creation of a counter-drone strategy. In addition to the mandate for the strategy — which was originally included in the Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the bill — it requires that the department conduct an assessment of the existing counter-UAS enterprise. The bill also calls for the department to provide recommendations for how to change existing policy to reduce the requirements that the Pentagon coordinate certain responses to drone incursions with other federal organizations. Other language would compel the Pentagon to create and maintain a c-UAS threat library, which would include information on counter-drone solutions and catalogue all drone incursions that occur at US military installations. 'We agree that U.S. troops have the inherent right of self defense, including from UAS attacks, wherever they may be,' the explanatory statement accompanying the bill said. At the same time, the conference version of the bill did not include a Senate provision that would require the Pentagon to provide a plan to speed up the testing, demonstration and validation of technologies needed to support the strategy. The release of the new NDAA comes just days after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed off on a classified strategy on countering unmanned systems on Dec. 2, leaving it unclear whether the Pentagon has already done enough to satisfy Congress’s mandate. The classified strategy document lays out a roadmap for near-term and future solutions for mitigating drone threats, the department said in a news release. 'A critical portion of our efforts, particularly in the near-term, comes from improving our defenses, with an emphasis on detection as well as active and passive defenses,' said an unclassified fact sheet for the strategy. 'The Department will ensure our forces and priority installations have protection.' The Pentagon has documented hundreds of drone incursions over US military installations over the past few years, US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) leaders said in October. RELATED: NORTHCOM head wants new integration role in counter-UAS ops Those include multiple incursions at Joint Base Langley Eustis in Virginia in December 2023, which involved varying numbers of drones in different sizes and configurations, the Air Force said in a statement earlier this year. As a result, F-22 stealth fighters located at the base were forced to temporarily relocate and suspend nighttime training missions, the Wall Street Journal reported in October. Another acknowledged incident involved incursions at Plant 42 in Palmdale, Calif., — an Air Force installation where tenant contractors like Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works and Northrop Grumman develop and produce experimental, classified aircraft. The location is technically a component of Edwards Air Force Base, which is located about 20 miles northeast and provides base security. An Air Force spokeswoman told the War Zone that the service had 'observed multiple UAS [uncrewed aerial systems] activities over Plant 42 during the last few months,' and worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to impose temporary flight restrictions around Plant 42. So far, the drone incursions have been limited to Plant 42 and have not projected into Edwards AFB, Brig. Gen. Doug Wickert, commander of its 412th Test Wing, told reporters during a visit to the base last week. Wickert said he 'felt very supported' in the wake of the incidents by NORTHCOM, which is taking a leading role in synchronizing counter-drone activities across the department. Edwards is currently in the process of testing and deploying several additional c-UAS systems, he said, adding that the open desert skies of the base provides an easier detection environment than more urban, congested locations like Langley AFB. While he said he has the authorities to direct security forces to take action to protect the base against drones, he acknowledged that some situations require coordination with outside organizations like the FAA. The Defense Department is making an effort to tackle the incursion problem, but it’s difficult to solve, and particularly challenging to differentiate when a drone is flying near a US installation for nefarious purposes like spying, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'Some of it is hobbyists who lose control of their drone or decide to do something stupid and fly it over a military base to just take a look and see what's over there. I mean my mother-in-law gave me one, and what do you do with it? Fly it, take off, It's got a camera on it … [so] you’re going to go look at something, going to find interesting stuff to look at,' said Kelly, who leads the Senate Armed Services airland committee. 'But some of it, I'm pretty sure, is our adversaries. Why wouldn't they?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/in-ndaa-congress-aims-to-move-ball-forward-on-solving-drone-incursion-problem/	2024-12-10T12:33:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240322_cuas_army_5816892-scaled-e1711130176663.jpg
Army Material Command head relieved of duty following investigation	Then US Army Brig. Gen. Charles Hamilton poses for a command portrait in the Army portrait studio at the Pentagon in Arlington, VA, Sept. 05, 2017. (US Army/Monica King) WASHINGTON — Army Secretary Christine Wormuth has officially relieved Army Material Command head Gen. Charles Hamilton of command following an investigation into intervening with the selecting of senior commanders, the service confirmed. 'Based on the findings of a Department of the Army Inspector General investigation, the Secretary of the Army has relieved General Charles Hamilton of command,' service spokesperson Cynthia Smith wrote in a brief statement today. Military.com first reported on the decision, and wrote up the initial investigation into the allegations that Hamilton helped secure a leadership role for a subordinate officer that has previously been deemed unfit for command. After those allegations surfaced in March, the four-star general was suspended from his post overseeing the service's global supply chain, logistics, and sustainment. The command’s deputy, Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan, then stepped in to perform the duties of his boss and is still currently at the AMC helm. Meanwhile, the Army IG office got to work conducting an investigation into just what transpired and penned its finding. While Breaking Defense has not obtained that report, Smith said it found that the Command Assessment Program (CAP) 'withstood an attempt to interfere with its process' but changes need to be made. 'Secretary Wormuth will be issuing a directive that formally establishes CAP as an enduring Army program in order to reinforce the integrity of CAP and increase transparency,' Smith wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-material-command-head-relieved-of-duty-following-investigation/	2024-12-10T12:16:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Hamilton-scaled-e1733861396459.jpg
Ships for America Act coming ‘really soon,’ says cosponsor Sen. Mark Kelly	The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and Cavour Carrier Strike Group sail in formation on Aug. 9, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Daniel Kimmelman) RNDF 2024 — Rep. Mike Waltz is set to head the White House next year as President-elect Donald Trump’s national security advisor, but the pro-shipbuilding legislation he helped helm is still very much alive and will be introduced in Congress soon, the bill’s Democratic cosponsor told Breaking Defense. 'We’re really close,' Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of Reagan National Defense Forum. 'We've made, you know, just some recent little tweaks that my potential Republican Senate co-sponsor wanted, and we're about to announce something really soon, and we'll get the legislation introduced and then start working building support for it.' Kelly and Waltz, R-Fla., had planned to introduce their 'Ships For America Act' following the November election. While Kelly will have to find another House Republican co-sponsor to replace Waltz, the latter's advocacy for shipbuilding issues could be a positive for forthcoming legislation, Kelly said in an interview Saturday. The Arizona Democrat added that there’s a 'reasonable path' to passage if the Trump administration gets behind the bill. 'I know he [Waltz] really cares about it, and having him in the White House as the National Security Advisor, in my view is a very positive thing,' Kelly said. 'I look forward to continuing to work with him when he's in the administration on this issue.' During a September event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies where Waltz and Kelly laid out their vision for the bill, the duo said that they supported the creation of a maritime czar inside the executive branch who could oversee shipbuilding issues that touch both the Defense Department and the Department of Transportation. 'We need to make it more cost effective to operate US-flagged vessels with some cargo preference,' Kelly said then. 'We need regulatory reform and some financial support to the industry, like tax credits, and then building up our shipbuilding capacity to make sure that we’re going to be able to have more US-flagged ships here at home, and then the workforce [shortage] issue. 'This legislation addresses all [of] those areas extensively,' he continued. The Ships Act codifies much of what the Navy is trying to do with its Maritime Statecraft initiative, which focuses on expanding shipbuilding capacity by strengthening the government’s relationships with industry and boosting commercial shipbuilders, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said during a speech Monday at the American Society of Naval Engineers conference. Del Toro added that the Ships Act could he introduced as early as 'the next couple of days or the next week or so.' 'But another part of the equation that … probably isn't going to be addressed directly in the Ships Act, that I think our nation needs to address is the issue of blue collar workforce in this country,' Del Toro said. 'If you care about economic security across the entire threshold, if you care about having more workers in shipyards or more workers in all our industries, you've got to pay attention to immigration, and we have a requirement in, my humble opinion, to increase legal immigration to this country. … Unemployment is really low right now, and that's part of the problem that we all face, and it's why our shipyards, both commercial and private shipyards, have been struggling the way they have.'

What ‘really’ worries the head of the Space Development Agency	Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear (R) addresses the audience at the Space Foundation's 2024 Space Symposium. (Space Foundation) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The head of the US Space Development Agency isn't really scared of a potential anti-satellite attack by an adversary, given the large number of low Earth orbit satellites being planned for the agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. Instead, Derek Tournear said he's worried about two potential problems that could undercut SDA's primary goal to enable fast as possible sensor-to-shooter connections: weak cybersecurity across the constellation and shaky supply chains. 'There are two threats out there that I am really worried about. They're common mode failure threats,' Tournear said during a panel discussion during the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. 'Number one is cyber. If we have a cyber vulnerability. It doesn't matter whether I have two satellites or 2,000 satellites, we could be vulnerable to that. So it is a big deal. We take a lot of protections against that,' he said. 'The second one is, is supply chain — the ability to actually produce these satellites at scale — and then supply chain interdiction.' He explained that becuse of SDA's networked architecture, the agency needs to have 'assurance for the providence' of all the 'parts and pieces' that go into each one of the satellites being developed by different providers. The question of the provenance isn't only applicable to hardware, he stressed, but is also a critical question for software. '[We] also need a robust industrial base that can create software, test software, get the software ready to go and build that capability up right now,' Tournear elaborated. 'Our industrial base relies a lot on on foreign entities to write our software. It's one of the things that we've kind of said we were worried about that at the Space Development Agency. We want our flight software and our satellites to be written in the US, because that's one of the supply chain interdiction things that I'm worried about. So that's been a bottleneck.' Another key issue is the current fragility of the defense supply chain that Tournear said 'is always going to be a problem' and 'always going to cause delays.' SDA experienced delays in launching its initial prototype satellites due to supply chain woes during the COVID-19 pandemic, with resistors being a key problem, he noted. Further, the planned launch of its first operational set of data relay and missile tracking satellites, called Tranche 1, has been set back by about seven months to the spring of 2025 due to another supply chain problem — this time involving optical communications terminals needed to create satellite-to-satellite links. Gen. Michael Guetlein, Space Force vice chief, told the Reagan Forum panel that while SDA is 'the canary in the coal mine' with regard to supply chain woes, the problem is more widespread. James Taiclet, Lockheed Martin's CEO, chimed in that solid rocket motors are yet another commodity where there are only a couple of suppliers — to the point where the Defense Department weighed in with investment last year to bolster production. Guetlein explained that the defense supply chain issue is systemic, due to general industry push in recent decades for 'efficiency.' 'We have spent decades optimizing our industrial base for efficiency and consolidating, and we are single suppliers deep across multiple different fronts,' he said. 'We're going to have to start getting comfortable with lack of efficiency in the industrial base to start getting excess capacity so that we have something to go to in times of crisis or conflict. 'These challenges are significant, and we need to figure out how to get after them,' Guetlein said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/what-really-worries-the-head-of-the-space-development-agency/	2024-12-10T09:27:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240411_space_symposium_tournear_space_foundation-e1712859283861.jpg
What to know about what’s in the compromise NDAA	The early morning sun strikes the U.S. Capitol November 6, 2006 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Congress’s compromise fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act language, released Saturday, kept within the budget cap topline, which means there were few major movements compared to what had been requested from the Pentagon earlier this year. According to numbers compiled by Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners, the compromise language increases overall procurement and R&amp;E funding by roughly $2 billion over the Pentagon’s FY25 request. Army procurement is roughly equal, Navy procurement is down about $500 million, and the Air Force is up around $800 million. The House plans to vote on the bill on Thursday. But the NDAA Is primarily a policy bill, not, as any Congressional appropriator would be quick to tell you, the final funding bill for the military. As a result, a few highlights did stick out to the Breaking Defense team. Below is our roundup: The NDAA language moves to slow or block a series of retirements requested by the Air Force. While many divestments would largely be approved, the bill would reject F-15E and F-22 retirements while extending limitations on offloading the RQ-4 and C-130, according to an explanatory statement accompanying the bill. The legislation would also permit continued A-10 retirements alongside older models of the F-15 and F-16 and ensure the service maintains 16 E-3s until the radar plane can be replaced either by the forthcoming E-7 or other capabilities. Keeping with that theme, the bill would add in six F-15EXs, three C-130s — including an ski-equipped LC-130J — two C-40Bs and inject an additional $400 million for E-7 'acceleration,' which in the past has typically meant money funneled to long-lead procurement. The language also prevents the Pentagon from accepting more than 30 F-35As, nine F-35Bs and nine F-35Cs until the Secretary of Defense takes several steps to improve the program, like formulating a plan to address deficiencies identified in a recent testing report. It further calls on subcontractors to follow prime manufacturer Lockheed Martin’s lead and invest their own dollars to improve the jet, and slashes $345M from Air Force procurement for 'excess cost growth.' While cutting $102 million earmarked for the service’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) effort and $159 million from the KC-46 program, the language adds in a requirement that the Secretary of the Air Force develop a plan to establish 'air base air defense sites' at Air Force installations, as service officials fret whether their air bases can be properly defended against attacks from a peer adversary like China. The NDAA authors seem to enjoy tasking the Army with a series of reporting requirements. Among the must-dos: a requirement for the Secretary of the Army to develop and implement a 'plan for the procurement and fielding of additional kinetic effectors for low, slow, small-unmanned aircraft integrated defeat system.' Another provision requires a report on the procurement of energetic material — key components in bombs and missiles — from sources outside the US. It keeps going: There’s a mandate that the Army Secretary deliver a Black Hawk modernization report, as well as a report on the 'testing, procurement, integration, and fielding of vehicle protection systems on Army ground combat vehicles.' And finally, a reporting requirement means the Army provides an update on the service’s long-term Stryker investment plan. Lawmakers in the bill’s explanatory statement admonished Navy leadership for, what they called, a 'lack of transparency' and communication with both Capitol Hill and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. The controversy is centered on an allegation from lawmakers that service leadership negotiated a significant plan with industry to bolster the Virginia-class submarine program without informing Capitol Hill or OMB. Now, according to the statement, lawmakers are left with an expensive new supplemental funding request from the service and, they say, 'few options' that will truly resolve the problems at hand and its root causes. At the time of publication, a Navy spokesman had not yet responded to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. Related: Lawmakers admonish Navy for ‘lack of transparency’ on sub funding requests Elsewhere in the bill, Congress is poised to impose new technical and design requirements on the Constellation-class frigate and Medium Landing Ship programs before either can proceed. While the prohibitions are unlikely to halt either program, the detailed requirements reflect increased congressional interest in both endeavors. The Medium Landing Ship is a relatively new program that the Marine Corps says will be crucial to any island hopping campaign in the Indo Pacific. Constellation class is a more advanced program that has gotten the personal attention of the Navy Secretary — and numerous lawmakers — following significant delays that are already putting it years behind schedule. Lawmakers also appear to agree with the Navy’s move to delay spending for its next-gen fighter, as the bill would not alter the service’s funding request of $454 million — roughly a billion dollars less than previous projections. Asked last month about the status of FA/AX, a spokesperson said 'All we can comment on regarding this is that we have received proposals and they are being evaluated.' The biggest takeaway from Space is that the NDAA approves the Air Force’s plan to transfer Air National Guard members to full time Space Force, without seeking the approval of governors. The National Governors Association already is out protesting the move, which they describe as 'deeply concerning and breaks with more than a century of important precedent surrounding state’s rights – as well as a violation of federal law.' The NDAA also approves the creation of the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR), and gives the Air Force Secretary — and notably, not the National Reconnaissance Office — milestone authority for space-based ground moving target systems. It also elevates authority for the Contractor Watch List to Frank Calvelli, in his role as Space Acquisition Executive, and requires the Defense Secretary to designate a senior official 'to be responsible for a national integrated air and missile defense architecture for the United States.' Congress's plans to study a potential independent cyber force have been scaled back in the final NDAA language. Prior drafts of the bill called specifically for an evaluation of a separate cyber force conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine — shortened to the 'National Academies' in the bill language. However, Saturday’s compromise language was vaguer, calling only for the assessment of 'cyber organizations' instead of a separate cyber service — an important change, as advocates of a future cyber force had been hoping to hang their argument off of a report from the academies. The idea of an independent cyber force has long been a point of contention within the DoD, as the Pentagon formally requested that lawmakers shut down a legislative proposal that would mandate an independent assessment of the establishment of a separate cyber service back in September, three sources familiar with the matter told Breaking Defense at the time. The final draft language comes after Texas Republicans Rep. Pat Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell authored the amendment in a draft version of the 2025 NDAA that called for the independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. Fallon told Breaking Defense last month that the study could be cause for the upcoming administration to stand up a cyber force. 'Incumbent on the results of the commission, which I think will affirm the need for a cyber service, I believe there’s a good chance we will see [a cyber service] come to fruition in soon. The Trump administration has shown that they will not put up with the status quo, and will opt for bold action, if necessary, especially when US national security is at risk,' Fallon said.

Guam missile defenses conduct first-ever ballistic intercept	A Standard Missile-3 Block IA (SM-3 Blk IA) interceptor is launched from the USS CARL M. LEVIN (DDG 120) off the coast of Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii, as part of Vigilant Wyvern/Flight Test Aegis Weapon System-48, a joint test of the U.S. Navy Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems and the Missile Defense Agency conducted October 25, 2023. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — The US military announced today the first-ever test intercept of a ballistic missile from its Guam-based missile defense system, in what a military official called a 'critical milestone' for what's seen as America's first line of defense in the case of war with China. The test just off shore from the US territory 'confirmed our ability to detect, track, and engage a target missile in flight, increasing our readiness to defend against evolving adversary threats,' Joint Task Force-Micronesia Commander Rear Adm. Greg Huffman said in a Missile Defense Agency (MDA) release. The release said that during the 'experiment,' the Aegis air defense system used a new AN/TPY-6 radar to track the target and a Vertical Launching System to fire a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA at an incoming, air-launched medium-range ballistic missile flying over the ocean near Andersen Air Force Base. 'The AN/TPY-6 radar tracked the target shortly after launch to intercept in the first end-to-end tracking use of the radar during a live ballistic missile flight test,' the Pentagon said. RELATED: Tying it together: Army eyes evolving test plan new capabilities bound for Guam The MDA described the event as a 'pivotal step' towards a larger, more holistic Guam Defense System designed to take on multiple threats at once — a 'persistent layered integrated air and missile defense capability.' According to CSIS missile defense expert Tom Karako, that will be where the rubber meets the road for an island that lies 9,000 miles from the California coast but a relatively scant 3,000 miles from mainland China. 'The defense of Guam is one of the most important and hardest missile defense development challenges underway. While these engagements are eye watering in many respects, today’s test was comparatively routine in terms of a single ballistic missile target,' he told Breaking Defense. 'The Guam Defense System will ultimately integrate multiple independent fire control systems into something that can cope with complex and integrated attacks with salvos across the air and missile threat spectrum.' RELATED: Army awards Raytheon $12 billion to begin LTAMDS production Such a robust defense would be necessary if war breaks out with China. Karako said Beijing can be expected to launch missile salvos that are 'an order of magnitude greater than what we saw in [Iran's] April 14 attack on Israel.' For several years, US military leaders from the Indo-Pacific region have emphasized the need to build up Guam as both a military staging point and an air-defense hub. However, the process hasn't been easy, and in October, the MDA proposed scaling back the number of missile defense sites on the island from 22 to 16 due to environmental impact concerns. In today's announcement MDA chief Lt. Gen. Heath Collins praised the 'tremendous group effort' and coordination between different Pentagon organizations, but the US military is still sorting out exactly who will be responsible for what when it comes to standing up the different elements of the broader, complex missile defense system on Guam. 'Not only do I have to get those individual programs across the goal line, they all have to work together,' Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army’s Program Executive Officer for Missiles and Space, said at a CSIS event in August.

3 immediate tasks for the secretary of the Navy nominee	Graduating Sailors stand in ranks during U.S. Navy Recruit Training Command's Pass in Review in Great Lakes, Illinois, Jul. 25, 2024. More than 40,000 recruits train annually at the Navy's only boot camp (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Christopher M. O'Grady) President-elect Donald Trump has recently announced his intent to nominate John Phelan to be secretary of the Navy. Phelan, a businessman with no military experience, is going to have his hands full trying to right-size a service that has been on the wrong track for almost thirty years. His lack of military experience should not be an inherent handicap in this job, because the role of the service secretary is to organize, train, and equip their respective services. But what will immediately trip him up is if he does not work right away to establish a good relationship with the legislative leaders who can make or break his plans going forward. While Phelan will be focused on the Senate Armed Services Committee because they will guide his nomination through the Senate, he should use this time to meet and engage with key members of the Senate Appropriation Committees, as well as the key committee members in the House — and come armed with near-term fixes that he needs Congress to make in order to enable him to hit the ground running. If he cannot convince Congress to act now, he will essentially spend the next year sailing in circles. Here are three areas he should ask Congress to help him out: recruiting, acquisition, and resources. Recruitment: One of the most important issues he will need to tackle are the shortfalls in manpower across the Navy. These shortfalls are so critical that failing to fix them may send the Navy into a near-term operational death-spiral, which would leave Phelan unable to meet the needs of the president should a crisis erupt. The multi-service recruiting crisis has been years in the making and therefore will likely take several years to fix. However, the incoming secretary can take a huge leap forward in fixing the problem by endorsing the House proposal to increase the pay of junior enlisted service members by 19 percent. Inflation, along with higher minimum wages and a looming demographic cliff that will result in fewer potential recruits, all point to the need for this very large pay raise. If not enacted in the 2025 NDAA, the incoming secretary will have to wait another year. Therefore, this is something Phelan should address with the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation prep. Acquisition: Phelan will need to move fast to change the acquisition paradigm of the Navy. The recent PPBE reform commission outlined key reforms that can only be implemented by the Appropriators; however, the current FY25 Appropriation bill reports contain language that essentially state that the committees will not provide additional funding flexibility. With the probable delay into March of the appropriation process, Phelan can work with the leaders of the Appropriation Committees in the Senate and House to create flexible funding lines to enable him to rapidly alter procurement within the Navy. For example, he can ask them to consolidate into one funding line the research, development, and procurement for all unmanned sea and air systems within the service. Failure to gain this flexibility will result in the secretary spending the next year fighting to align resources rather than improving the warfighting capabilities of the Navy. Resources: Perhaps the most important change he needs to ask the Congress for is to support additional time and resources for the National Commission on the Future of the Navy. As my colleague Mackenzie Eaglen has noted, Congress waited 439 days to seat the eight commissioners. Having the NDAA extend the commissions timeline and funding will be critically important as this Commission will need to work closely with the incoming secretary to align on the strategic shift for the Navy and more importantly, the decade-long resources needed to accomplish fix the Navy. If Phelan attempts to implement his strategic pivot alone, he will be forever inviting alternative plans from the Joint Staff, OSD, OMB, Defense Industry, and Congress. If, however, his plan for reforming the Navy aligns with the Commission, a strong case can be made that the plan will outlive Phelan’s tenure. During normal times, it is sage advice that the nominee should speak sparsely and get confirmed. These however, are not normal times. The Navy is broken, the President wants to disrupt the status quo, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are leading a government reform effort, and China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are actively fighting proxy wars with the United States. Phelan needs help from Congress, help that cannot wait until next year. He ought to walk in and ask for the pay raise for junior enlisted, acquisition flexibility from the appropriators, and an extension to the timeline for the National Commission on the Future of the Navy.

With first test fire, Aussies joins tiny Tomahawk club with US, UK	HMAS Brisbane fires a Tomahawk cruise from Hobart-class HMS Brisband off of the coast of San Diego. (ADF POIS Craig Walton) SYDNEY — Australia has joined the US and UK as one of the tiny club of countries that can launch the Tomahawk cruise missile, with its legendary accuracy and range of more than 2,500 kilometers. The Royal Australian Navy test fired the weapon for the first time from HMAS Brisbane, the second of three Hobart-class destroyers, during a test and evaluation event 'off the west coast of the United States,' according to a statement issued today. Defense Minister Richard Marles said the first Tomahawk firing 'demonstrates the strength of our alliance and defense cooperation with the United States, in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous region.' Canberra is investing $1.3 billion AUD ($830 million USD) to buy 'more than' 200 cruise missiles, which the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said is being 'introduced into service several years faster than originally planned.' They will be fired from Hobart-class destroyers, Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines and, possibly, the Hunter-class frigates. 'This Tomahawk firing follows the firings of the Naval Strike Missile and Standard Missile 6 earlier this year and is a practical demonstration of the speed at which the Albanese Government is delivering on its commitment to enhance the lethality of Navy’s surface combatant fleet,' added the MoD. 'The Tomahawk is the jewel in the crown and a step change in our firepower, deterrence and ability to strike land-based targets at ranges never before available to the Royal Australian Navy,' Pat Conroy, minister for defense procurement said in the MoD statement. 'This is about keeping Australians safe. But in conjunction with our other investments in long-range strike, as well as the decision to manufacture NSM in Australia, it’s also about delivering more jobs and a safer future made in Australia.' The US State Department notified Congress of the potential sale of Tomahawks to Australia in March 2023, at the time saying Canberra was interested in 200 Block V All Up Rounds, as well as 'up to' 20 Block IV versions. The sale includes the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) and the Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC). In keeping with most FMS sale, it will also include extensive support, including unscheduled missile maintenance; spare parts; training; communication equipment and operational flight test. The estimated total cost then was $895 million. Marles made clear that the cruise missile is being bought to deter countries that may pose a threat to Australia. 'By enhancing our own defense capabilities, and by working with partners, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor so that no state will ever conclude the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks,' he said. Following Australia, Japan plans to buy twice as many Tomahawks — 400 missiles, including 200 Block IV and 200 Block V — as well as 14 control systems, plus software, hardware, training and other add-ons. The cost for that program is estimated to be $2.4 billion.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/with-first-test-fire-aussies-joins-tiny-tomahawk-club-with-us-uk/	2024-12-10T06:10:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/20241203ran8611998_0235-scaled.jpeg
‘Eroding readiness’: US Coast Guard Commandant warns of looming crisis	The icebreaker USCGC Healy (WAGB 20) keeps station while conducting crane operations alongside a multi-year ice floe for a science evolution in the Beaufort Sea, Aug. 9, 2023. (US Coast Guard/ Petty Officer 3rd Class Briana Carter) RNDF 2024 — A multi-billion shortfall in operation and maintenance coffers is hampering US Coast Guard operations with a steep cliff looming on the horizon, according to Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan. 'I can feel it out there, but I don't know what that tipping point is where there's been some really profound sort of budget shortfall risk that we need to work to address,' Fagan told Breaking Defense Saturday on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. The four-star admiral estimated that her service funding really needs to grow from $13 billion up towards the $20 billion range, and that right now it could 'ingest' $3 billion for operation and maintenance accounts to keep helicopters in the air and vessels mission ready. That additional $3 billion, Fagan added, could be used to shore up infrastructure, buy additional parts, maintenance, and for command, control, communication, computer, cyber and intelligence (C5I) initiatives. As the service under the Department of Homeland Security umbrella moves to purchase and field new vessels, she said it's becoming increasingly challenging to keep the assets it has up and running. Part of that problem revolves around a part shortage requiring the USCG to regularly pilfer parts from three or four ships just to fix one. 'On the large ships, we've normalized taking good parts,' Fagan added. 'When a ship comes in from patrol, you take the good part off, you put it on the ship across the pier, so that that ship can get underway. We call it controlled parts exchanges. That's not okay that we don't have enough parts &#8230; and we're deferring on dry docks. That will all begin to compound for more costs, not less, and it is eroding readiness.' For example, in 2023 alone the service experienced a 200 percent increase in cannibalizing navigation and mission sensors, and there isn’t an end in sight. In fiscal 2025, a projected funding shortfall will mean the service is only able to do about half of its planned maintenance and inventory requirements. That burgeoning crisis, she explained, has already prevented the USCG from meeting its commitments — including to the Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) South — because too many ships are undergoing unplanned maintenance, and there are not enough helicopters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/eroding-readiness-uscg-commandant-warns-of-looming-readiness-crisis/	2024-12-09T13:22:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240711_DVIDS_icebreaker_7966479-scaled-e1720703191686.jpg
