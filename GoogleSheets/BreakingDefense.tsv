Swedish Gripen jets don’t ‘make sense’ for Ukraine yet, Dutch defense chief says	Three Swedish Armed Forces Gripens participated in a long range, long duration Bomber Task Force mission over Sweden, May 20, 2020. (Courtesy photo by the Swedish Armed Forces) ATLANTA — While Sweden stands ready to send its Gripen fighters to Ukraine, the head of a key ally's military said that move 'doesn't make sense for me,' at least not yet. 'In the long term, yes, [but] I think we have to avoid [giving] too many systems to Ukraine, because they have a shortage of pilots,' Chief of Defence of the Netherlands Gen. Onno Eichelsheim told Breaking Defense. 'So you have to avoid that you have more systems than pilots. Somewhere in the balance, you have to look at what capabilities are needed at this moment.' In July the Netherlands, Denmark and the US announced they were in the process of donating F-16s from Dutch and Danish stocks to Ukraine. The US has flatly rejected calls to give current American systems, but agreed to allow other nations to provide their US-made jets. Eichelsheim said it's better to 'focus' on the capabilities the Ukrainians currently have. 'So get them ready on these aircrafts, and provide them with the weapons, the money, the logistics, the parts that are available around the world to get these aircraft up and running continuously.' The Dutch official's comments clarify remarks from Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson, who said last week that Stockholm was ready and willing to donate Gripens to Ukraine but had been advised not to. 'The donation of the Gripens is not in the hands of ourselves,' Jonson said, suggesting at the time that other actors in the international coalition dedicated to Ukraine's air force, predominantly Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States, wanted to make sure Ukraine is settled with the F-16 before introducing other complex technologies into the ecosystem. 'They have advised us to wait to donate the Gripen until it goes further with the F-16 as well,' Jonson said. Deliveries of the fourth-generation aircraft, dating back to July, represent a major potential uplift in capability for Ukraine, which has been largely relying on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion, though officials and experts have said it won’t be a silver bullet. Eichelsheim said Kyiv's armed forces have been 'successful in using the aircraft, and they are actually quite successful in maintaining them at this moment.' 'But we also see that they use a lot of spare parts, so we have to work on the spare parts element together with the nations to provide them with the right amount to keep the aircrafts up and running,' he said. Earlier this month Reuters reported the White House had lifted a de facto ban on American contractors working in Ukraine in a move that could give a boost to the complex maintenance of the F-16. In the meantime, Eichelsheim said Ukrainian pilots 'do quite well' with the F-16, 'perhaps even better than we anticipated. 'They learn very fast how to operate the aircraft and how to operate the new weapon systems that they are getting on the aircraft,' he added. 'So, and that's all I can say, actually, about it.'

US drone maker Shield AI moves into Indian defense market, joint venture with JSW Group	A civilian contractor embarked with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, lands a V-BAT drone aboard the USS Green Bay in the Philippine Sea, Feb. 2, 2023. (U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Andrew King) SYDNEY — The Indian defense market, not known for its historic openness to foreign investment, has gotten an injection of very fresh US defense technology from the AI and drone company, Shield AI. The pan-industrial Indian company, JSW Group, has formed a joint venture with the US firm and JSW plans to invest roughly $90 million in the next two years to build a plant, secure the intellectual property and train workers. The goal is to build V-BAT, Shield's vertical takeoff and landing drone, in India, as well as provide its support and maintenance. A press release from Shield AI notes that JSW's 'investment will enable JSW to establish a local supply chain and create an advanced facility in India for manufacturing, assembling and testing V-BAT aircraft.' The US Marines own and operate V-BAT. This deal appears to be in keeping with a larger Indian effort known as Atmanirbharta designed to encourage foreign companies to work in India, instead of the foreign companies designing, building and assembling weapons to be exported to India. That effort includes an investment fund to attract disrupters and smaller companies, the webpage of which has a link to the drone deal. 'Once reliant on foreign suppliers, India now places a high priority on self-reliant manufacturing to meet its security needs, reinforcing its vision to strengthen national resilience and reduce dependency on external sources,' an Oct. 24 press release by the Indian Ministry of Defense about Atmanirbharta notes. It says that India used to rely on foreign countries for much of its weapons, with '65-70% of defense equipment being imported. However, this landscape has dramatically shifted, with around 65% of defense equipment now manufactured within India.' It points out that '21% of this production comes from the private sector, bolstering India's journey toward self-reliance.' Shield's release claims that this deal will 'allow India to function as a global production hub for the San Diego-based firm 'to handle both domestic and international sales and maintenance. It also will, the companies say, 'reduce reliance on external sources and ensure consistent delivery to India’s Armed Forces.' This 'marks a significant step in boosting India’s defense capabilities by bringing in world-class UAS technology to the country,' the release claims. 'JSW recognizes the same thing Shield AI does: that Group 3 UAS drones like the V-BAT can accomplish the same missions as many helicopters and larger Group 5 UAS drones for a fraction of the price,' Brandon Tseng, Shield AI’s co-founder and a former Navy SEAL, said in the release. 'As the market shifts from expensive, exquisite aircraft to swarms of lower-cost, AI-piloted UAS drones, this collaboration builds upon Shield AI’s significant U.S. investments, enhances global distribution, and supports continued expansion of U.S. operations.' Shield AI's managing director for India, Sarjan Shah, said the deal with JSW Group 'has been crafted over a multi-year period to transform the depth, scale and scope of India’s indigenous capabilities in the field of military unmanned systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-drone-maker-shield-ai-moves-into-indian-defense-market-joint-venture-with-jsw-group/	2024-11-27T10:31:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/V-bat-scaled-e1697122824715.jpg
New tech, including drones carrying blood, help injured Israeli soldiers survive	A Thor drone used to drop a small box that contains blood packets that can be used in the field by the IDF. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) JERUSALEM — The Israel Defense Forces estimate they have saved 380 lives of soldiers in the last 14 months of war due to new technology and procedures used to evacuate casualties to hospitals and to treat them on the field, including using drones to ferry blood for infusion into combat zones. At a tour of the IDF's Medical Corps and Technological and Logistics Directorate on Monday, an IDF official showed data that reveals the military has managed to reduce by half the number of soldiers who die from their injuries. In the 2006 Lebanon war, the IDF found that this rate was 14.1 percent. That number dropped to 9.2 percent during the 2014 war, and now is 6.9 percent for the Gaza front and 7.1 percent for the Lebanon fronts. 'The average time for a soldier to receive medical treatment in the field is between zero to four minutes, over 90 percent of soldiers injured from close-quarters combat received treatment in the field, approximately 1,600 injured soldiers were evacuated via helicopters,' the IDF said in a written statement. The short time to receive treatment is due to the presence of what the IDF calls Advanced Life Support providers, meaning medics deployed at the company level, and having more combat soldiers trained as medics. If the wounds are serious enough, the injured are placed in armored personnel carriers or Humvees and evacuated, either to a helicopter landing zone where Israel’s unit 669 takes them to civilian hospitals, or they continue in vehicles. The evacuation process can take slightly more than an hour when moving wounded from Gaza, to up to 111 minutes from Lebanon, due to the topography. The IDF also has increased the number of patients who receive whole blood and plasma that is constituted from freeze-dried plasma. Both of these have replaced the use of crystalloids, which had been used to treat blood loss in the field. Freeze-dried plasma does not require cooling, whereas whole blood does; the IDF has found a way to bring both to the front via small coolers for blood packets. The IDF has also recently used Thor drones, large quadcopters, to drop blood encased in a cooled box. The payload can be dropped from around 450 feet to troops in the field. The payload, around the size of a shoe box, lands via a small parachute rather than a cushion because blood should not be disturbed too much when being transported, an IDF official explained. A Humvee outfitted by the IDF as an example of how wounded can be transported from the field in specially-outfitted vehicles with stretchers and medics on board, for faster evacuation. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) The use of coolers deployed to the front with combat soldiers to carry blood has not only helped treat patients but also solved the problem of supplying the soldiers with these necessities during long periods in the field. During some of the fighting, IDF units have been in combat for days or weeks, and the coolers can provide several days of cooling for the blood. The blood is warmed via a small device, and the freeze-dried plasma can be reconstituted using water, a process that takes several minutes. The deployment of new tourniquets and homostatic bandages, used to control bleeding in an area like the groin where one can’t tie off an arm or leg, have been found to be effective. All of this helps treat soldiers in what is usually called the 'golden hour' in trauma care as patients are moved toward a hospital. However, the deployment of more medics at the front and movement of paramedics and physicians into the field has also resulted in more harm to these trained personnel. The IDF said 58 of their medical personnel have been killed. That's about 7 percent of the 804 IDF service members killed in the fighting since Hamas launched its devastating Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza is reported to exceed 44,000 and more than 3,000 in Lebanon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/new-tech-including-drones-carrying-blood-help-injured-israeli-soldiers-survive/	2024-11-27T07:39:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_IDF_medical_drone_handout-e1732644659771.png
John Phelan, financier and GOP donor, tapped to be next Navy secretary	DETROIT, MICHIGAN &#8211; AUGUST 26, 2024: Former U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the 146th National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS) General Conference and Exhibition hosted at The Huntington Place in Detroit, MI on August 26, 2024. (Photo by Adam J. Dewey/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump announced late Tuesday night that he has selected John Phelan, a prominent financier and campaign donor, to become Secretary of the Navy. 'John will be a tremendous force for our Naval Servicemembers, and a steadfast leader in advancing my America First vision. He will put the business of the U.S. Navy above all else,' Trump wrote in a post on TruthSocial, the social media platform he started. Phelan is the co-founder and chairman of Rugger Management, a private investment firm based in Palm Beach, Fla. The Hill reported he is also a donor to the Trump campaign and GOP-aligned efforts. It was not immediately clear if Phelan has any background or experience in national security. Phelan is Trump's second major pick for a spot as top brass at the Pentagon. Earlier this month, he selected Pete Hegseth, a co-host of Fox News's 'Fox &amp; Friend Weekend' and a former infantry captain in the Army National Guard to serve as secretary of the defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/john-phelan-financier-and-gop-donor-tapped-to-be-next-navy-secretary/	2024-11-27T04:17:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/trump-ngaus-e1724704355499.jpg
Aussie navigation firm, MBDA team and test AUKUS’ new tech-sharing muscles	Demonstration of MBDA's NILEQ sensors and how they read terrain like a fingerprint scanner. (MBDA) SYDNEY — A collaborative effort between a small Australian navigation firm and European defense giant MBDA is among the first to test the new tripartite arms export control system from the start of a program, and initial reports are positive, according to the CEO of the Australian firm. Before the changes to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) policies and the arms export regimes of Britain and Australia, 'it would take six months to get a license approved to just share information,' Sydney-based Advanced Navigation CEO Chris Shaw said in an interview today with Breaking Defense. But since a revamping of the rules in August, at least the timeline for information sharing has been trimmed down to days or weeks, he said. 'Yeah, there's still controls that have to be taken to account, which is fine, but it's a lot more simple now for something like this,' Shaw said. The memorandum of understanding between the two companies limits the work to between the United Kingdom and Australia, the release says, so has yet to test US rules. The Australian defense minister, Richard Marles, has hailed the arms export reforms as a 'generational' change, and Australian officials have generally been eager to comply with American requirements as they amend Australia’s arms export system. The ITAR system, of course, is infamous for its often slow and complex processes, overseen by the US State Department’s Political-Military Bureau. Pillar II of the US-UK-Australia venture known as AUKUS — whose primary focus in Pillar I is helping Australia buy and build nuclear-powered attack submarines — is a more diffuse effort which covers the rapid development, testing and deployment of new technologies in the realms of autonomy, hypersonics, cyber, artificial intelligence, electronic warfare and underwater systems. Shaw said his company and MBDA have been in talks with Pillar II contact points in each government since the beginning of this effort, and the press release mentions Pillar II without offering specifics. The collaboration, announced Nov. 20, is meant to produce and test a system that can work on a medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone that uses a newly developed sensor set to provide jam-proof navigation, as well as autonomy. MBDA developed the NILEQ sensors, which function in ways similar to fingerprint scanners, reading the terrain over which they fly. The system includes a detailed database of the Earth's surface. The sensors note changes between the database and what it senses, allowing rapid change detection and providing information that could be used for targeting. 'MBDA are convinced it has lots of different applications, so then they've decided to partner with us to explore taking that core tech and us integrating it with our navigation technology, and then trying to build an end solution for use on drones,' Shaw said in the interview. 'That's not something they do, because typically they build end products, right?' RELATED: When facing electronic warfare in Ukraine, small drones' quantity is quality The Australian general manager for MBDA, Tom Tizard, said in the press release that their new technology 'seeks to address the enormous demand for resilient absolute positioning information that will complement the existing navigation systems of airborne platforms.' Russia has made the risks of GPS all too clear, causing advanced weapons that depend entirely on GPS to lose much of their potency when jammed. Tizard praised Advanced Navigation as 'an ideal Australian partner to help accelerate the technology towards market entry. Navigation technologies that are not simply accurate and precise, but also provide the ‘resilience’ against interference, is what propels this partnership.' If it all works as designed, Advanced Navigation said in a press release that it believes the system 'will enable airborne systems to navigate unlimited distances over land without relying on GPS, and is passive and resistant to interference.' The venture is moving along at a clip, with the new systems' first test flight possibly happening before the end of the year, Advanced Navigation's CEO said. The MBDA agreement comes after the company signed in early September what could be a landmark agreement with South Korea's Hanwha to supply an already-developed precision guidance systems to Hanwha worldwide. It could, Shaw said the day of the signing, lead to as much as a 400 percent increase in business for the Australian firm.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aussie-navigation-firm-mbda-team-and-test-aukus-new-tech-sharing-muscles/	2024-11-27T02:07:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-2-e1732632837127.jpeg
Commerce announces more semiconductor funding for military aircraft, commercial satellites	US President Joe Biden holds a semiconductor during his remarks before signing an Executive Order on the economy in the State Dining Room of the White House on February 24, 2021 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Doug Mills/Pool/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In an effort to bolster domestic manufacturing of chips for national security and the space industry, the Department of Commerce announced it is awarding BAE Systems Inc. and Rocket Lab a CHIPS Incentive Award worth up to a combined $59.4 million. The funding comes from the Biden administration’s CHIPS and Science Act. BAE Systems Inc., the US subsidiary of British company BAE Systems, will receive $35.5 million in direct funding to build chips used for military jets and commercial satellites, according to a press release from the Department of Commerce. Rocket Lab, the parent company of space power provider SolAero Technologies Corp., will receive up to $23.9 million for space-grade solar cells — space devices used to convert light to electricity which help operate missile awareness systems and 'world-leading science missions,' per the Monday release. The award announcements come after BAE Systems Inc. received a preliminary agreement for the funding in December 2023 and Rocket Lab received a preliminary agreement this past June. 'From satellites in space to defense systems on the ground, our most advanced defense and commercial technology rely on mature-node and compound semiconductors to operate,' Laurie Locascio, under secretary of Commerce for Standards and Technology and the director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, said in the release. 'By finalizing these awards, we are strengthening America’s domestic semiconductor supply chain resilience and broadening our manufacturing capabilities.' The money awarded to BAE Systems Inc. is specifically going to BAE Systems Electronics, a unit within the company responsible for producing commercial and defense electronics for flight and engine control, electronic warfare, surveillance, geospatial intelligence and power and energy management. It will support the company’s microelectronics center in New Hampshire, which was founded by the Department of Defense last year. With this funding, the company will increase its production capacity fourfold for Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit chips which are used to operate military aircraft and commercial satellite systems, per the Department of Commerce. 'The investment will also cut the company’s modernization timeline in half, bolstering the facility’s ability to serve mission-critical defense programs,' the release added. Rocket Lab will use its funding to 'create a more robust and resilient supply' of space-grade solar cells. It is one of two companies in the US that specializes in producing these types of semiconductors. 'The Department’s investment will support the modernization and expansion of Rocket Lab’s facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which will increase the company's compound semiconductor production by 50% within the next three years — helping to meet the growing national security and commercial demand for these solar cells in the United States,' the release said. Intel Corporation, another chip building company, was also awarded $7.87 billion from the Department of Commerce on Tuesday. This is less than the $8.5 billion outlined in the preliminary agreement, which was announced in March. 'The award will directly support Intel’s expected U.S. investment of nearly $90 billion by the end of the decade, which is part of the company’s overall $100+ billion expansion plan,' Tuesday’s release said. These recent awards from the Department of Commerce appear to be a last-ditch effort to finalize investments under the Biden administration's CHIPS Act before president-elect Donald Trump takes office in January. Trump has recently criticized the program over the last several weeks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/commerce-announces-more-semiconductor-funding-for-military-aircraft-commercial-satellites/	2024-11-26T13:21:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/211029_biden_semiconductor_GettyImages-1303925325-scaled-e1635522770760.jpg
Netanyahu announces move toward ceasefire in Lebanon, along with stark warning	Smoke billows above Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike on November 26, 2024, amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. (Photo by FADEL ITANI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Just hours after Israel launched a barrage of strikes on the southern suburbs of Beirut, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he will bring a 'ceasefire outline' for approval by his cabinet, paving the way for a major, if tenuous development after two months of heavy fighting. A Lebanese official reportedly said that Hezbollah, Israel's Iran-backed enemy in Lebanon, has agreed to such a proposal. 'The duration of the ceasefire depends on what happens in Lebanon. We have an understanding with the United States,' Netanyahu said, according to a live Sky News translation of his address. 'We are maintaining our full liberty to take military operations if Hezbollah tries to attack us, it arms itself, rebuild infrastructure next to the borders — we will attack them. If they launch missiles, if they dig tunnels, we will attack.' The prime minister did not offer details about the ceasefire proposal, but previous reporting said discussions included a 60-day cessation of hostilities. Israeli troops would withdraw from South Lebanon, and Hezbollah troops would withdraw north of the Litani River, according to the Times of Israel. Additionally, the deal reportedly calls for implementation of 1701 United Nations Security Council Resolution, the deployment of Lebanese Armed Forces on the southern border alongside United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon, UNIFIL. A US-led international committee is purportedly would monitor the execution of the ceasefire. At the Pentagon today, spokesperson Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder also did not reveal the specifics of the deal, but said that as 'far as the ceasefire goes, we're, of course, strongly supportive of a ceasefire. 'We're consulting closely with our interagency partners in terms of what potential contributions the DOD can make,' he said. 'I don't have anything to announce from here, but we'll certainly keep you updated.' The announcement comes 57 days after the Israeli ground invasion of southern Lebanon and 415 days after Hezbollah joined what it called the 'Gaza support' front on Oct. 8, 2023, dragging Lebanon into the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The ceasefire does not apply to Gaza. Lebanese retired armed forces Gen. Wehbe Katicha said the monitoring by the US-led group would likely include land, sea and air borders in part to prevent arms transfers to Hezbollah. Maroun Hitti, also a retired brigadier general from the Lebanese Armed Forces, told Breaking Defense ahead of the announcement that he viewed the acceptance of a ceasefire as a defeat for Hezbollah. 'Hezbollah would have given up linking Lebanese front to Gaza support and the strategy of &#8216;unity of the fronts' would have disintegrated and been crushed forever,' he said. More broadly Ali Bakir, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, said a ceasefire could prompt existential questions about Hezbollah, especially after its leadership has been systematically devastated by Israeli operations. 'The key question is: What is the purpose of Hezbollah's arsenal if it can neither fight Israel nor protect Hezbollah, its leaders, the Shiite community, and Lebanon, as the party has claimed for over a decade?' Bakir asked.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/netanyahu-announces-move-toward-ceasefire-in-lebanon-along-with-stark-warning/	2024-11-26T11:00:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_israel_strike_beirut_GettyImages-2186324612-scaled-e1732647429461.jpg
Commerce taps Slingshot to create space tracking user website	Slingshot Aerospace operates a network of telescopes for keeping tabs on objects in low Earth orbit. (Slingshot) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department has awarded Slingshot Aerospace a $13.3 million contract to build a web portal to access to its nascent space tracking database — slotting into place the last piece of the puzzle that will allow the Pentagon to wean commercial and foreign satellite operators from the military's increasingly threat-oriented system for monitoring the heavens. The Colorado-based startup will develop the so-called 'presentation layer' user interface for Commerce's Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS), based on its 'Slingshot Beacon' space traffic management software, according to a company press release today. Slingshot's work, which includes a year-long development phase and four one-year options, will be supported by COMSPOC and T and T Consulting Services, the release added. 'Deploying the TraCSS user interface is the next major step in operationalizing U.S. civil space traffic coordination,' said Audrey Schaffer, Slingshot vice president of strategy and policy. TraCSS is being developed by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of Space Commerce (OSC), which was directed to take over traffic coordination responsibilities from the Defense Department following the issuance of Space Policy Directive 3 (SPD-3) in 2018. The TraCSS.gov website is expected to be online and begin the transition of all commercial users from the US Space Command's Space-track.org in late 2025. Slingshot has been working with OSC almost from the get-go, as the office sought to build up expertise in using open-source data from commercial and non-military telescopes and radars for space situational awareness, including the ability to calculate the likelihood of potential on-orbit collisions and warn operators in advance. For example, the company was among several chosen for OSC's Consolidated Pathfinder project to gather data about objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) launched in January via contracts managed via NASA’s Global Data Marketplace. Likewise it was involved in an earlier data-gathering effort back in December 2022 was conducted jointly by OSC and the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/commerce-taps-slingshot-to-create-space-tracking-user-website/	2024-11-26T10:15:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Slingshot-Global-Sensor-Network-–-Varda-Sensor-Day.png
France takes aim at unmanned systems, taking lessons from Paris Olympics	French soldiers from the Operation Sentinelle present a high frequency jammer NEROD RF rifle during a press visit in Paris on July 17, 2024. (Photo by ALAIN JOCARD/AFP via Getty Images) PARIS — 'Attacks using swarms of armed, unmanned air systems is no longer just science fiction.' That was the warning from Emmanuel Chiva, director of France’s defense procurement agency, at one of the nation’s largest defense expositions, Euronaval, hosted in Paris in October. Since Chiva’s remarks Ukraine says it has suffered a wave of drone attacks from Russia, and Israel is bracing for a potential third barrage of drones and missiles fired by Iran. Meanwhile sea-based unmanned surface vessels (USVs) have struck both commercial and naval ships in the Red Sea, and Kyiv has managed to strike significant blows against Russia’s Black Sea fleet using the same kind of nascent technology. As such, defense against unmanned aerial and maritime systems was a key focus of this year’s Euronaval, where officials discussed what Paris was doing about the threat and industry players offered up their defensive systems as potential solutions. 'So, we need to stay in the race and find an answer to these threats, and use the lessons learned in the Red and Black seas,' Chiva’s deputy, General Thierry Carlier, said during the show. RELATED: Nets, jamming and &#8216;cyber scalpels': Pentagon weighs homeland counter-drone tech in mountain exercises In France’s 2024-30 Military Program Law, €5 billion ($5.3 billion) has been earmarked for ground-to-air defense, which includes counter-UAS equipment. In 2024, because of the Paris Olympics and Paralympics, the anti-drone mission just during the competition weeks was expected to 'amount to 20,000 hours of surveillance, 10 times more than for the 2023 Rugby World Cup,' General Stéphane Mille, commander of the Air and Space Force, said in an interview prior to the event. According to a National Assembly report, 355 unauthorized drones were detected during the Games — largely flown by amateurs unaware of legislation — and 81 arrests were made. As the threat has grown, so has the investment of firms worldwide, including in France, to counter them. That requires the complex process of spotting the threat, classifying it and then passing that information along — in near-real time — to other systems that can do something about it. Erik Van Kimmenaede, Thales marketing director for surface radar, told journalists during a pre-Euronaval briefing that 'all this needs to be automated to act fast.' There’s also the question of cost-per-kill. There’s little point in using a million-dollar missile to take out a drone that cost just a few hundred dollars. Thales has developed the E-Trap to neutralize these Class 1 (micro, mini or small) drones, which had its first public outing at the Euronaval show although it was discreetly deployed during the Olympic Games, according to the company. Developed with the support of France’s procurement arm, DGA, Thales says E-Trap is a 360° high-power microwave antenna that emits a very brief but very powerful electromagnetic pulse meant to destroy the electronic components necessary to make a drone function. It is effective against a single UAV/USV or a swarm of them, the company says. Elsewhere, Safran Electronics &amp; Defense has teamed with the French company Hologarde to develop its Skyjacker counter-drone solution. That one was also used to protect the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The system, which the companies say is effective at ranges up to six miles spoofs the drone, altering its trajectory by replacing the satellite navigation signals it uses to guide it towards its target with different ones. According to Thales, 'Skyjacker can efficiently defeat isolated drones and drone swarms in land and naval environments.' Chiva told a National Assembly defense committee on Oct. 23 that 'at least three' of France’s FREMM frigates will be equipped with the Skyjacker system. He also mentioned that 'at sea (…) we can project a great quantity of metal into the air to neutralize these threats, notably when confronted by swarms. An anti-drone task force was set up in the light of events in the Red Sea. It studied, for example, the use of the 76mm munitions from the (Oto-Melara) 76mm gun to neutralize drone threats.' At Euronaval, MC2 technologies, a smaller business that specializes in micro and nanotechnologies, was also showing some of its counter-UAS systems, including the Nerod, a jammer gun designed to disrupt and neutralize communications between micro and/or mini—drones and their controllers. The company says 80 of these guns have already been delivered to French armed forces and police, and some 500 others have gone 'numerous clients abroad in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Middle East,' including Luxembourg, Côte d’Ivoire and Japan.

Embraer targets prime status in US defense market	Embraer showed off its C-390 Millennium carrier during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow. Embraer signed a contract with the Netherlands and Austria for a combined order of the C-390 during the show. (Tim Martin/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Brazilian aerospace firm Embraer has been present in the American defense market for over a decade, with its commercial arm operating in the states even longer. But the company is now seeking to expand its US reach by chasing the coveted status of being a major prime contractor for the Pentagon — and to do so, 'all avenues' are at the firm’s disposal, including merger and acquisitions activity, executives recently told Breaking Defense. The core of Embraer's plans for penetrating the US market, according to Embraer Defense CEO Bosco da Costa Jr, are its two flagship products: the A-29 Super Tucano prop plane, and especially the firm's C-390 tactical airlifter. 'The main interest of Embraer Defense &amp; Security is to expand its presence here in the US using this platform,' da Costa said of the C-390, known as the 'Millennium,' in an October interview. The C-390 has enjoyed a string of recent successes on the international circuit, sometimes besting competitors like Lockheed Martin’s C-130, as da Costa noted that Embraer recently 'defined a strategy to turn Embraer Defense &amp; Security into an international player.' On the US side, da Costa emphasized that the Millennium is already compliant with Buy American Act requirements, pointing to customers like the Air Force or Marine Corps that the company would pitch the aircraft to. Embraer could even put forward the C-390 for any Pentagon buyers as a prime supplier. And it may have to, now that a partnership with L3Harris has fallen through for an 'agile tanker' aimed at the US Air Force, whose own air refueling plans are somewhat in flux. According to Embraer Defense &amp; Security Chief Commercial Officer Frederico Lemos, the company believes there could be 'space' for the C-390 in the Air Force’s tentative plans for a limited tranche of procurement, known as the KC-135 Tanker Recapitalization program. Additionally, Lemos said Embraer is looking ahead to a future tanker known as the Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS) and is responding to requests for information put out by the Air Force on the topic. The Millennium 'can play a very important role to address the requirements and the speed that we understand is needed to address the challenges in the Pacific,' Lemos said. And to potentially sweeten the deal, Embraer is evaluating whether to open a final assembly line in the US for the C-390 like it operates for the A-29, da Costa said. (In partnership with Sierra Nevada Corporation, Embraer manufactures its A-29 Super Tucano in Jacksonville, Fla., for Foreign Military Sales cases, but a dearth of sales have forced the company to stare down a potential production gap.) The C-390 is also by no means the only way the company hopes to grow its US footprint, with da Costa raising the prospect of new partnerships and mergers and acquisitions that could benefit the Millennium, as well as the entire company. 'We are evaluating all the avenues in order to allow us to be here as a strategic player for the US government,' he said. 'I think what we are looking [at are] possibilities that will add value to our business, that will add new capabilities, new systems, new technologies.' Making moves in the US market isn’t limited to Embraer’s defense business either. Instead, da Costa framed it as an all-hands-on deck strategy. 'This strategy to become a supplier of the US government is not a project that I have created inside of my business unit only. It is a &#8216;One Embraer' approach,' he said. 'This is not a simple project inside of the defense business unit. It is a very high-level project inside of Embraer and is a strategic project for us in the coming years.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/embraer-targets-prime-status-in-us-defense-market/	2024-11-26T06:53:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
Israel to buy new Corvettes, ‘hundreds’ of JLTVs	Driving through off-road obstacles showcases the Joint Light Tactical Vehicles’ capabilities to maneuver over uneven surfaces at Fort McCoy, Wisconsin, Aug. 17, 2022. (Spc. Brittney Joy/US Army) JERSUALEM — The Israeli Ministry of Defense has approved a major new procurement deal to acquire five new corvettes for the Israeli navy and 'hundreds' of new Joint Light Tactical Vehicles for the ground forces. Israel has not specified how much each deal is worth, but in a statement described the two packages as a 'multi-billion Shekel' expenditure. The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023 has led to the fast-tracking of a number of procurement deals, but this most recent announcement is the first to come from the Nagel Committee, a commission stood up in August. Chaired by Prof. Jacob Nagel, the commission was established by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with the goal of 'formulating recommendations on the force building needs and the security budget in the coming decade.' The Israel Military Procurement Ministerial Committee approved the two acquisitions. They will now be submitted to the Knesset’s Joint Committee for the Defense Budget; however, the government did not give a timeline for when the Knesset submission and subsequent vote will happen The new 'next generation' advanced missile ships will be built by Israel Shipyards, and dubbed the Reshef-class, named after one of the older Sa’ar 4 class ships that have since been retired. The new Reshef-class frigates will replace the Sa’ar 4.5-class missile boats which Israel has used since the 1980s. These eight ships, which were launched between 1981 to 2003, are set to be decommissioned. Plans for the new Reshef class ships go back several years. Naval News reported in July 2023 that the ships will include a main gun at the bow, as well as the new C-Dome air defense system, which is the naval version of Iron Dome. The Israeli navy has undergone a major expansion in the last decade, with four new Sa’ar 6 naval ships that began to be commissioned in 2022, as well as new submarines. The Israeli navy currently has four active Sa’ar 6 ships, which first saw action in the recent war against Hamas in Gaza. It also has three Sa’ar 5 corvettes as well as eight of the Sa’ar 4.5. Meanwhile, the IDF held a naming ceremony for its sixth submarine in Germany on Nov. 12. The Israeli navy was also bolstered by two new landing craft that began arriving in 2023. The overall cost of the five ships was not revealed. However, the Sa’ar 6 cost more than $400 million each. Israel Shipyards built the original Reshef class Sa’ar 4 back in the 1960s. The company describes itself as the 'first in the Western world to design and build a fast-attack missile boat. … At that time, it was a new concept to use relatively small, fast missile-equipped craft to meet threats in the naval arena.' The Shipyards currently offer a 72 meter and 80 meter version of the Sa’ar series of ships, which they call Sa’ar -72 and Sa’ar-80 respectively. A report in 2022 said the Sa’ar 80 would be the export version of the new Reshef class; the firm that year said that 'The S80 will be the flagship of the Israel Shipyards for the next decades and she will serve the Israeli Navy and many other navies around the world.' In addition to the ships, Israel is procuring hundreds of new JLTVs. Oshkosh is the current procurer on the JLTV, but AM General in 2023 won the right to produce the US Army's next-generation of vehicles. Which company's version Israeli would receive could depend on when an order is officially placed. 'These armored combat mobility vehicles will be supplied to the IDF's maneuvering forces in the coming years,' the Defense Ministry noted in a post on social media. The vehicles, which first entered service in the US in 2019, will bolster Israel’s ground forces by giving new options in place of aging Humvees, which have been used widely in the 2024 war. In December 2023 Oshkosh Defense said it would fulfill two Israeli orders for a total of seventy-five of the 4X4 JLTVs. In 2020 Rafael Advanced Defense Systems showcased its Spike LR on a JLTV in Slovenia and Elbit has equipped weapon stations on JLTVs for Montenegro. The CH-53K which Israel is also acquiring can lift JLTVs, a point Lockheed Martin highlighted in a 2018 Hebrew statement about the heavy lifter.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-to-buy-new-corvettes-hundreds-of-jltvs/	2024-11-25T13:30:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/7376919-scaled-e1663702547702.jpg
Navy asking Congress for $5.7B in emergency submarine funding	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (US Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — The Office of Management and Budget today delivered a request to Congress for approximately $5.7 billion in emergency funding to account for unexpected 'shortfalls' in the Navy's Virginia-class fast attack submarine program, according to a senior Navy official. The emergency funding request was accompanied by a separate 'anomaly' that would permit the service to continue funding the Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine program in the event lawmakers pass a continuing resolution prior to when government funding is set to expire on Dec. 20. (Anomaly is the term the Defense Department uses when it seeks permission from Congress to spend money outside the traditional constraints of a continuing resolution.) 'Our Virginia-class fast attack submarine program is not where it needs to be right now. The program and the shipyards are not producing submarines at the rate that our national security strategy and the national defense strategy require,' the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters. The Navy's stated goal for its submarine programs is the so-called '2+1' cadence, which refers to two Virginia-class subs and one Columbia-class submarine built per year. The service's historical record for Virginia-class submarines is closer to 1.2 to 1.3 boats per year. The official said roughly $2 billion would go towards addressing funding 'shortfalls' for the two fiscal 2024 Virginia-class submarines and $1.5 billion would go towards a similar anticipated shortfall for the one Virginia-class boat in the FY-25 budget. The rest of the funding would be split between submarine prime contractors General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII's Newport News Shipbuilding for increased wages and 'other productivity enhancements,' the official said. Both General Dynamics and HII in their most recent earnings calls have expressed concerns about the state of the post-COVID supply chain as well as the financial pain it has put on them. While speaking to reporters, the senior Navy official said the service has had numerous conversations with those companies and sees the emergency funding as a way to address the issues raised during those talks. RELATED: GD chief says Navy's 1 sub buy won't impact company short term, but out years less certain 'The phasing of these investments is focused on improving shipbuilder capability, capacity and efficiency and thereby reducing submarine construction delays and hope and ultimately controlling costs of future submarines,' the official said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-asking-congress-for-5-7b-in-emergency-submarine-funding/	2024-11-25T12:00:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8630521-e1732050099734.jpg
‘Everybody’s going to have to figure this out’: Army, Air Force debate base defense amid new threats	A U.S. Army MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system is fired for a coastal air defense event during Balikatan 23 at the Naval Education, Training and Doctrine Command, Philippines (Photo: US Marine Corps) WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump’s new defense secretary takes the reins of the Pentagon next year, they may quickly be faced with an internal debate to settle: whether the Army should continue with its traditional role of providing defenses for air bases, or whether the Air Force steps up to the task on its own. At the core of the issue is not only the capabilities brought to the fight by each service, but how they will be funded. The Army has traditionally been charged with defending air bases, which is part of the reason why systems like Patriot and THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) reside under the service's control. But tepid investment during the Global War on Terror years, alongside the proliferation of missile threats from China and Russia, has led Air Force officials to begin openly grumbling that they feel the Army can't, or won't, make air base defense a priority — and that a change may be due. Recent comments from Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall seemed to bring the issue to a head, after he reportedly suggested his service could take over the air base defense mission from the Army in its entirety. Of course, if that happens, Air Force advocates would likely want to see more dollars distributed to the service, whether they come out of the Army's coffers or elsewhere. Asked about the ongoing discussion on Nov. 20, Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said he recently met with his Air Force counterpart, Gen. David Allvin, to help chart a way forward. But George made it clear that in his mind, protection responsibilities have to fall on the entire joint force going forward. 'I do believe that every formation that’s out there — Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines — you're going to have to protect yourself against long-range fires. You're going to have to protect yourself against drones. Everybody's going to have to figure this out,' he said at the National Security Innovation Forum event in Washington. George's comments seem to fall in line with a growing consensus that having one service responsible for base defense writ large isn't going to work in a modern era filled with a variety of threats. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says George's point that every service will need to have some internal base defense capability is 'reflecting reality' that 'all services are gonna have to get into air defense at some kind for the new threat environment,' not just for missiles but for drones as well. 'People keep saying, &#8216;Why isn’t the Army defending our air bases?' And the answer is, there is nowhere near enough missile defense capacity for everything we need to defend. That is true of air bases, and true of lots of other kinds of bases, it's true in Ukraine, in Israel — it's not just the Air Force assets that need tons more help, it's everything,' Karako said. He pointed out that the Marines are going out and trying to buy their own Iron Dome-like system to counter rockets and small drones, and that while there is a benefit in having a specialist branch of the Army that just does air defense, there will never be enough people in that unit to cover all the needs. 'Does the Air Force have a point that there is utility in specialization? Sure. But we are where we are, we got where we are today as a joint force and we’re gonna have to deal with it as a joint force,' Karako said. Services are also trying to shift tactics as the threat from adversaries like China grows, with the Air Force adopting a new, dispersed method of operations known as agile combat employment (ACE). The ACE concept is a necessary, but not sufficient, approach for protecting troops and assets; even with the concept, Air Force officials have become worried that air bases in the Indo-Pacific are still vulnerable against Beijing’s burgeoning missile arsenal and other budding weapons. Higher-end systems like Patriot or Aegis cruisers are placed where joint task force commanders think critical defensive capabilities are needed, and air bases have generally been protected as a result, Lt. Gen. David Harris, deputy chief of staff of Air Force futures, said in an interview with Breaking Defense at the Pentagon. 'But there could be a point in time in the future where the critical asset list or the defended asset list, there's other things in the region that might be more important than our air bases,' Harris continued. 'So this is where things are split.' Harris noted it's critical for disparate systems fielded by the services to connect into a common architecture, using an example where data can be passed from an Army theater defense system to a local air base. Echoing comments from other officials, Harris also said installations might need to operate their own systems to defend themselves from threats like small to mid-size drones, or 'maybe' even cruise missiles. Depending on the environment — with Harris using the example of struggles to combat small drones flying over bases on US soil — that could range from more limited defenses to a 'full package' that could take out threats spanning drones to ballistic missiles. 'So there's an aspect of this base defense that I think as an Air Force that we need to be thinking about next. Because if we're starting to march our way forward, part of our survivability as we go into a higher threat intensity, that's going to start to matter more,' Harris said. George, for his part, said he’d like to see more dollars put toward the base defense mission and for development efforts to move more quickly. 'I think we need to spend more [and move] faster on these problems and have the flexibility to get out there and innovate,' he said. 'So I think everybody's going to have to figure this out, and we're going to figure this out with the Air Force.'

Saudi Arabia reveals strides in local defense production as it races towards ambitious 2030 goal	A Royal Saudi Air Force pilot poses in front of an aircraft during the Athens Flying Show in Tanagra, Greece, on September 14, 2024. (Photo by Giorgos Arapekos/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia recently revealed significant strides in its quest to localize defense production, reaching nearly 20 percent localization by the end of 2023. That's up from just 4 percent in 2018 as the Kingdom pursues its ambitious goal of 50 percent by 2030. Saudia Arabia's General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI) 'issued many policies and legislation that regulate and stimulate the sector and enhance the competitiveness of the local product, which raised the localization rate from 4 percent in 2018 to 19.35 percent at the end of last year of military spending,' GAMI head Ahmad Abdulaziz Al-Ohali said Thursday during a dialogue session at the Local Content Forum. Al-Ohali added that the number of authorized and licensed facilities in the military industries sector has increased from five facilities in 2019 to 296 facilities by the third quarter of 2024. 'The Authority [GAMI] worked to sign more than 53 industrial cooperation programs worth approximately 35 billion riyals [$9.32 billion] with local and international companies, including approximately 13 billion riyals [$3.46 billion] purchase orders for local companies,' he said. Saudi Arabia, historically one of the largest defense importers worldwide, is concentrating heavily on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030 to localize 50 percent of defense production. And though the year-to-year rise doesn't appear to be steep enough for Saudi Arabia to reach that high mark in time, another key figure in Saudi Arabia's defense industry previously told Breaking Defense that the policies, investments, joint ventures and production lines the Kingdom has established should cause an exponential growth curve in the years ahead. 'We are extremely confident that by 2030 we will achieve the target of 50 percent localization in defense spending,' the then-CEO of Saudi Arabian Military Industries Walid Abdukhaled said in June 2023. A few months later, in February 2024, Al-Ohali echoed the sentiment, telling Breaking Defense he was 'really confident' Riyadh would hit its goal or go beyond it. In October of last year, GAMI launched an 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' section on its official website, with the goal of pointing international firms to areas of opportunity. The authority identified 'more than 70 opportunities in the supply chain,' Al-Ohali said then, worth up to $64 billion over the next decade. 'We contributed to supporting local manufacturers through several initiatives, such as: applying the zero added tax on locally manufactured military goods, and most importantly, framework agreements,' Al-Ohali said. The governor highlighted that GAMI has launched a unified platform for military industries, 'which represents a unified structure for all services provided to beneficiaries, and we were keen to automate all services and use the latest means of technology, data science and artificial intelligence.' On Wednesday, a joint venture between Saudi and Spanish defense firms, SAMINavantia, launched a Saudi-designed combat management system, the first such product developed by the company in the Kingdom and which the company said was 'part of SAMINavantia's contribution to localizing over 50 [percent] of military spending by 2030[.]'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/saudi-arabia-reveals-strides-in-local-defense-production-as-it-races-towards-ambitious-2030-goal/	2024-11-25T06:40:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241122_saudi_fighter_GettyImages-2171209221-scaled-e1732298993557.jpg
Norway asks US about maritime drone options as it ponders new, long-range capability	The HNoMS Roald Amundsen (F 311) sails in a fjord as part of Cold Response 16, March 1, 2016 at Namsos, Norway. (Official Marine Corps Photo by Gunnery Sgt. Bryson K. Jones/Released) BELFAST — Norway has embarked on studies to examine how it would introduce a new, long-range, aerial maritime surveillance drone into its forces in the high north and has asked the US for information about suitable American options, the Ministry of Defence said in a new statement. 'Norway is considering several types of drones, and it is too early to comment further on the type, number, or specific requirements for the acquisition beyond what is outlined in the adopted long-term plan,' Anne Marie Aanerud, state secretary at the Norwegian Ministry of Defence, told Breaking Defense Thursday. 'As part of the ongoing studies we have requested additional information on relevant drones from the U.S. authorities,' she said. 'The response will be incorporated into the ongoing work on the drone acquisition.' Aanerud noted that a timeline for contract signing has has still to be decided, as military officials continue to work up a strategy to implement recommendations for the long-term defense plan. That defense plan, published in April, revealed Oslo's intention to procure the maritime surveillance drones, and Aanerud told Breaking Defense the ministry envisions platforms that are able to 'monitor large areas for extended periods of time, complementing the tools we already have.' The future drones are set to be based out of Andøya Air Station, northern Norway, 300 kilometers north of the Arctic Circle and previously home to Royal Norwegian Air Force P-3 Orion Maritime Patrol Aircraft (MPA). Olso decided to reverse a decision to close the base in the aftermath of the Ukraine war and amid a renewed focus on bolstering defense capabilities to counter Russian aggression. Though Aanerud declined to say if any specific platforms are under consideration, and several international firms make drones that could fit the bill, the fact that US authorities had been contacted suggests that American systems are in the running. Northrop Grumman delivers the fourth MQ-4C Triton for long-range, persistent, maritime surveillance to the U.S. Navy for Initial Operational Capability. Image courtesy of Northrop Grumman. An executive at Northrop Grumman, for one, said the company's MQ-4C Triton, a pricey high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) system, was among them. The US Navy operates the Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) mainly to support intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions and as a complement to Boeing P-8A MPA operations. Norway operates five of the P-8 crewed platforms. Doug Shaffer, vice president of autonomous intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, and targeting programs at Northrop Grumman, told Breaking Defense his firm has had 'extensive' written exchanges as well as face-to-face meetings with Norwegian officials about the aerospace giant's offerings. 'We've had all our engineers there, answering hundreds of questions,' he said, adding that an aircraft selection decision could come in the 'next few months.' Northrop says the Triton, which can fly above 50,000 feet, can cover some 4 million nautical miles with its sensor array in a 24-hour sortie — roughly equivalent to the size of China. But it is expensive. In July, Inside Defense reported that each newest version of Triton has an estimated price tag of $618 million though that figure was a result of a per-unit price jump in the US Navy program after the total acquisition was slashed. Shaffer argued the capabilities of a single airframe are worth the price tag over the drone's entire lifecycle. 'The largest cost is the operational sustainment over decades, and to do the same mission as a HALE platform, it takes three to five times more MALES,' he claimed, referring to medium-altitude, long-endurance drones. 'That calculus is what Norway is evaluating.' If that is a calculus Norway is doing, on the other end of the equation could be the much less expensive American-made MQ-9B SeaGuardian, a MALE variant of the MQ-9 Reaper produced by General Atomics Aeronautical Systems (GA-ASI) that can fly at 40,000 feet. The flyaway unit cost of a MQ-9B sits at approximately $38 million, excluding through life and sustainment costs, according to figures from Shephard Media, a British trade publication. GA-ASI has positioned the drone for sale up north, saying in company literature that 'with MQ-9B, the Nordic and Northern European allies now have a surveillance platform to choose that can perform all their key missions with low acquisition and operating costs.' A GA-ASI MQ-9B SeaGuardian demonstrates its maritime capabilities during European Maritime Demos (GA-ASI) C. Mark Brinkley, a spokesperson for GA-ASI, declined to comment on whether the SeaGuardian is in the race for Norway's next UAV, but did suggest it would be an effective high north asset. 'MQ-9B’s advanced sensors, data processing power, worldwide proliferated low-Earth orbit (pLEO) satellite communications link, and impressive endurance make Arctic awareness possible from anywhere in the world,' he said. 'Over the Arctic, MQ-9B can detect air, ground, surface, and subsurface targets of interest, including surveillance balloons, maritime vessels, and submarines, and then feed real-time intelligence to military and civil authorities around the world.' Brinkley also said that future upgrades of the aircraft, including detect and avoid technology integrated with Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) capability, Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) and air-to-air radar, 'will add to the ease of operating in the Arctic.' Specific to maritime missions the MQ-9B can also be equipped with a 360-degree maritime radar, fitted with an Automated Identification System (AIS), an Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) capability, featuring a sonobuoy monitoring and control system capable of dispensing up to 40 sonobuoys, noted Brinkley. A spokesperson for the US State Department, which plays a key role in negotiating foreign military sales, told Breaking Defense that the US has a 'close defense trade partnership with Norway that includes co-production of advanced systems like the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS. However, we have no comment on our specific cooperation in the long-range maritime UAV space and would refer you to the Government of Norway.' Generally speaking, Oslo has consistently stressed that multinational collaboration with allies will be a core element of the maritime surveillance drone acquisition, particularly in areas such as development, operations and training. In June, it committed to closer bilateral defense cooperation with Scandinavian counterpart Denmark, through a letter of intent, covering drones and air defense, among other items. Similarly, Copenhagen has committed to the acquisition of long-range drones to monitor the Arctic and North Atlantic. Additional funding for the effort was secured in January, as part of an initial cross party agreement, that falls under a new, national defense settlement, according to a Danish Ministry of Defence statement. But at a local level, the Norwegian drone effort has been hotly debated in recent months with critics, including senior defense officials, publicly warning against the procurement of large, long-range surveillance types at all. Writing in a Norwegian Armed Forces magazine, Rolf Folland, former Chief of the Royal Norwegian Air Force and currently the Norwegian military representative to NATO, questioned the survivability of the US platforms, specifically citing shootdown incidents of both aircraft. Large drones 'with their low speed and large radar cross-section &#8230; can become relatively easy targets for an adversary that has modern anti-aircraft systems, and they are vulnerable to electronic countermeasures that can disrupt their communication and navigation systems,' stated Folland. Instead of Norway opting for such large, expensive platforms, he recommended looking into alternative ideas, specifically procurement of a stealth-designed drone or ordering additional satellites. 'Monitoring and situation overview from space can potentially be significantly better than from a drone,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/norway-asks-us-about-maritime-drone-options-as-it-ponders-new-long-range-capability/	2024-11-25T04:30:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_norway_fjords_2435876-scaled-e1732225784515.jpg
Russia ‘likely’ to transfer submarine tech to China, N. Korea: INDOPACOM Chief	This pool photograph distributed by Russian state-owned agency Sputnik shows Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping shaking hands during a meeting in Beijing on October 18, 2023. (Sergei Guneyev/AFP via Getty Images) HALIFAX, CANADA — The growing ties between China, Russia, Iran and North Korea have been the source of Western leaders' ire for several years, but seem to be reaching a new, critical level, where transfer of the highest level of military technologies between the countries, including key Russian submarine tech, may become routine. The head of US Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo, told an audience today that in exchange for North Korean troops and artillery, Moscow 'will likely' provide Pyongyang with missile and submarine technology. And in exchange for China helping to rebuild 'Russia’s war machine,' Paparo anticipates that Moscow will also be sharing submarine technology with Beijing, a move that has the 'potential of closing American undersea dominance to the PRC.' 'Where one is resource poor, the others fulfill those resources. Where one has operational needs, the others are fulfilling those needs,' Paparo told the audience at this weekend’s annual Halifax International Security Forum. That concerning relationship between those four governments was a major theme throughout the Canadian event, with widespread agreement that the Ukraine war has now breached the geopolitical walls between the European and Indo-Pacific theaters for good. 'Those who might believe that you can just isolate the [Russian-Ukraine] conflict or accommodate somehow with Russia, I believe that's wrong,' Germany's Minister of State Tobias Lindner told reporters today. 'If you're interested in security in the Indo-Pacific and all those issues you need to have a tough stance on Russia too.' RELATED: INDOPACOM’s Paparo acknowledges stockpile shortages may impact his readiness North Korea’s decision to send upwards of 10,000 military personnel and additional weapons to fight alongside Russia forces in Ukraine makes the case stronger, with Dutch Adm. Rob Bauer — chair of the NATO Military Committee — arguing here that it gives the DPRK a potential seat at the negotiation table in ceasefire negotiations, a new complicating factor in the 1,000 day war. 'Not only [do you] have to talk to Russia now, but you also have to deal with North Korea,' Bauer told an audience on Friday. 'The North Koreans get technology and weapons systems and ammunition from the Russians as well… This is connecting the world in a way that we didn't think was possible and it is connected to China.' While China is not directly sending Russia weapons, Bauer argued that its transfer of key components, like semiconductors and machine tools, is keeping Russia in the fight. 'Without China, Russia would not be able to continue the war,' Bauer added. (Iran has been sending Russia weapons too, including missiles and attack drones.) While Officials in Canada this weekend didn’t have a clear answer on just what to do about the growing ties between the four countries that they view as an existential threat, some advice and words of caution were offered up. 'The idea of driving wedges between these two,' Shearer said, 'is fanciful.' In order to help disrupt the growing strategic partnerships, Shearer said the Western-aligned nations must 'adjust our mindsets, shift our policies and boost our defense spending and become, frankly, more assertive.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/russia-likely-to-transfer-submarine-tech-to-china-n-korea-indopacom-chief/	2024-11-23T14:58:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/GettyImages-1730511257-scaled-e1714416144291.jpg
How the DoD and partners are sharing information without compromising security	The annual Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) conference, which took place late October in Omaha, Nebraska, called out a specific theme for this year’s event: 'Integrated Deterrence through IT Superiority.' What that means in practice was a lot of discussion about how the DoD, Intelligence Agencies, Five Eyes partners and industry all need to figure out a way to break down stovepipes and share information, without compromising security. It’s a tricky line to walk, something reflected in the stories Breaking Defense reporter Carley Welch brought back from the conference. Inside this eBook collection, you’ll read stories about the need for an integrated cloud system and how the Air Force is trying to secure its own network, questions about AI in nuclear weapon systems, as well as interviews with key industry players.

Canada, Australia jointly pledge $474M to research hypersonic missile defense tech	Bill Blair, Minister of Defense of Canada, speaks to the press after his arrival at NATO headquarters on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Omar Havana/Getty Images) HALIFAX, CANADA — Australia and Canada have inked a new agreement to jointly work on technology to counter the ever-growing threat of missiles, especially hypersonic weapons, Canada’s Minister of National Defence Bill Blair announced today. 'I'm very pleased to announce that Canada and Australia have today signed an agreement to work together on researching emerging missile threats,' Blair told an audience during the kickoff of the Halifax International Security Forum. 'We're going to focus on countering hypersonic weapon systems and under this new agreement… [we will be] very closely tied in all of our efforts collectively together.' In total, the duo plan to spend up to $474 million over the next five years developing a 'range of solutions,' he added. While Blair didn’t drill down into the specific capabilities on the development table, a subsequent press release noted that the Defence Research and Development Canada and the Australian Defence Science and Technology Group will work together researching the emerging missile threats, to develop detection, monitoring, targeting and counter-measure technologies. Defense and political leaders from around the globe are gathered in Nova Scotia this weekend for the annual Halifax International Security Forum, Canada's premiere defense event. Among the main themes: Discussing the wars in Ukraine and in the Middle East, along with potential changes to NATO as president-elect Donald Trump prepares for his return to the White House. During Trump’s first turn in office, he publicly bashed NATO countries not meeting the 2 percent GDP defense spending goal — a mark Canada does not currently hit. RELATED: America needs to keep pushing Canada on defense spending Blair used his opening speech today to praise Canada’s close relationship with its neighbor to the south and vowed to eventually meet that threshold. 'We have always depended upon that relationship [with the US] with an unparalleled alliance, especially illustrated through NORAD [North American Aerospace Defense Command], which is our binational military command that keeps a vigilant eye on North American airspace,' Blair said. 'NORAD defends our countries against threats in the air domain, that's why we are working in partnership with the United States to invest quite significantly in order modernization, we're making a generational investment,' he later added. Taking the stage just after Blair, two US Senators — James Risch, R-Idaho and Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire — called on Canada to get to that 2 percent spending target as quickly as possible.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/canada-australia-jointly-pledge-474m-to-research-hypersonic-missile-defense-tech/	2024-11-22T13:01:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/GettyImages-2157414961-scaled-e1719856571160.jpg
‘Plug and Play’: Army’s Project Linchpin prepares to unveil open-source architecture for AI	Army Reserve Soldiers with the 75th U.S. Army Reserve Innovation Command’s Army Applications Group and Support Group Artificial Intelligence and Data Team participate in Code-A-Thon 24, Aug. 1, 2024, at Fort Liberty, North Carolina. (Photo by Sgt. 1st Class Matthew Chlosta / 75th US Army Reserve Innovation Command) WASHINGTON — The Army’s artificial intelligence accelerator, Project Linchpin, is working with open source software firm Red Hat to unveil an initial version of its AI development architecture as early as next week, product lead Bharat Patel said. The architecture, in essence, is a set of common technical standards — Application Programming Interfaces (API), data labeling protocols, and so on — to ensure that AIs built for the Army by different vendors are all compatible. 'We are defining some of these APIs and some of these architectures with Red Hat now, [with] an open source project being dropped end of November,' Patel told the Red Hat Government Symposium here on Tuesday. 'This is going to be one of our first attempts at a public-private partnership.' By creating a level playing field for competition among innovative companies of different sizes, this 'open architecture' should allow the Army to use whichever algorithms it likes best into its suite of AI software, fully confident the different products will work together, Patel and other officials explained in public comments and interviews with Breaking Defense. 'This space moves so fast that we can't build a strategy that relies on one company or two,' Patel told the conference. 'We actually need to work on the standards that allow us to create more of a competitive architecture that people just kind of plug and play. &#8230; We want to really get after some of the non-traditional small businesses.' The problem with tapping into this rapidly expanding and evolving ecosystem of innovators is that, frankly, it’s kind of chaotic. 'It’s like the Wild, Wild West when it comes to AI right now,' Patel told Breaking Defense. 'Project Linchpin’s main focus is to be able to standardize a lot of how we deliver AI.' That chaos isn’t just in the private sector: There are plenty of ad hoc, incompatible AI efforts within the military itself. 'One of the trends we’ve seen across the Army is data is in pretty tough shape,' said Col. Chris Anderson, the Army’s product manager for Intelligence Systems &amp; Analytics, who works closely with Patel. 'It’s spread out all over the place, [and] it’s not labeled.' Such disorganized data (the polite term is 'unstructured') is difficult to do even basic analysis on, let alone train an AI algorithm. RELATED: ‘Fight tonight’ vs ‘Getting it right’: CDAO’s Martell wants to build AI to last Even when data is labeled, Anderson told Breaking Defense, the labeling may be inconsistent, idiosyncratic, or otherwise unintelligence to any human or machine beside the original users. For example, early on in Project Linchpin, 'one of the pilots that we did was in response to a real-world need in CENTCOM,' he recounted. 'A unit approached us and said, &#8216;We really need to find this specific target.' And they had a tranche of data that they had labeled, [but] that the labeled data was not very good.' Project Linchpin and a contractor spent a lot of time and effort relabeling the unit’s data so they could train an AI model to analyze it. But when they provided the trained-up model to the unit, it didn’t work properly on their computers, Anderson said, because model had been trained on machines using one type of chip (GPUs, common in the AI world) but the unit's devices used a different kind (CPUs). To bring order to this chaos of incompatible systems, 'we want to partner with industry to help define these standards,' Patel emphasized. 'We don’t want to be the government and be like, ‘Here’re our standards, you must comply.’' So step one was figuring out a common ground that different companies and the Army procurement system could all live with. 'We’ve been working really closely with ASA(ALT) [the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology] on what are the standards we are going to implement within the pipeline and how does that feed into Army-level policy,' Anderson said. 'The [Linchpin] team, they’ve done 500 one-on-one sessions with industry partners — multiple hours [apiece] — and evaluated, I think, 300 responses from industry, and the majority of those were either small businesses or non-traditionals.' 'Really early on we learned, there’s no turnkey solution, there’s no one size fits all,' Anderson said. 'It’s changing every day. &#8230; We’ve got to be able to bring in third-party applications and services quickly, we’ve got to be able to offboard them quickly when something better comes along.' At Linchpin, 'they don’t want a closed ecosystem, they don’t want black box closed-source contributors,' said Michael Zizza, who handle the Army account at Red Hat. 'They need &#8230; interoperability.' Red Hat was well suited to help develop such an architecture, Zizza told Breaking Defense, because as a vendor of open-source software, 'the code is free,' and what you’re paying Red Hat for is tech support. It’s an experienced intermediary between the chaotic creativity of the software development world and the order required by large corporations and government agencies. Project Linchpin originally contracted with both Red Hat and consulting firm Booz Allen to 'flesh out' the guiding principles behind the architecture, Patel told Breaking Defense. (In software development jargon, the final version of those principles is Traceability, Observability, Orchestration, Replaceability and automated Consumption, TOORC). From there, Patel said, Linchpin worked through the Army Research laboratory to set up a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with Red Hat, which the firm announced last month. 'We’re kind of in the early stages now,' Zizza said, 'but we’re looking at specific things like architecture diagrams [and] an open API specification.'

Sweden to fund Ukrainian domestic production of long-range missiles, drones	Rustem Umerov, (C-L) Minister of Defense of Ukraine, greets Pål Jonson (C-R), Minister of Defense of Sweden before the start of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting at the NATO Headquarters on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Omar Havana/Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — The Swedish government today announced it will provide 'substantial funding' for the mass production of long-range missiles and drones inside Ukraine, a major step as Stockholm seeks to bolster Kyiv’s defensive efforts. Dollars and timelines were not revealed during the announcement, made today by Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson as he hosted his Ukrainian counterpart, Rustem Umerov. But the move shows that Stockholm is dedicated to supporting Ukraine for the long-haul. 'This will be produced in Ukraine by the Ukrainian defense industry. It will be financed by Sweden. President [Vladimir] Zelenskyy has stated that there is an especially high demand for funding long-range weapons and long-range drones,' Jonson said at a press briefing Friday at Karlsberg Palace in Solna. 'Ukraine is Sweden's number one security priority,' Jonson stated. He later underlined that Ukraine has 'the full right' in accordance with international law to defend itself 'inside and outside' of its territory. As of Oct. 4, Sweden has donated military assistance worth approximately 48.4 billion Swedish krona ($4.37 billion), per a government fact sheet. Stockholm has previously pledged a commitment of 25 billion Swedish krona ($2.28 billion USD) for 2025 and the same amount for 2026, numbers the government here has said could go up if needed. 'We're glad that we can further develop both your capability to produce long-range missiles and also long-range strike approach,' Jonson said, addressing Umerov. RELATED: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing &#8216;window' to prepare for Russia According to Jonson, the two ministers on Thursday met representatives from the Swedish Defense Research Agency (FOI) and Sweden's procurement agency (FMV). And 'later today [Friday] we're going to be having discussions with several representatives of the Swedish Defense Industry.' A government spokesperson declined to give details on what kind of long-range missiles will be considered for this effort. Decisions will be made in consultation with Ukraine, as they have several different projects they are working on. The spokesperson also declined to further comment on which companies the ministers were meeting with. Saab, Sweden’s defense champion, gave no further clue. 'At this point it is too soon to speculate and we refer further questions about how Sweden might support Ukraine’s long range missile capability to the Swedish Government. Generally speaking, we are always ready for discussions with Sweden and our other customers on how we can support their needs with our knowledge and expertise,' Saab spokesperson Mattias Rådström wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. Sweden has previously donated an Erieye platform, Saab’s Airborne Early Warning and Control System to Ukraine. Ukrainian pilots also have been trained on Saab’s Gripen fighters, and while the government says it is ready to begin giving Ukraine those jets, Jonson indicated that they have not done so at the behest of other allies. 'The donation of the Gripens is not in the hands of ourselves,' Jonson said, with other actors in the Air Force Coalition, predominantly Denmark, Netherlands and the United States, wanting to make sure Ukraine is settled with the F-16 before introducing other complex technologies into the ecosystem. 'They have advised us to wait to donate the Gripen until it goes further with the F-16 as well,' Jonson said. 'So now our focus has been on delivering the Erieye platform, which is the command and control platform that [works with] the F-16.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/sweden-to-fund-ukrainian-domestic-production-of-long-range-missiles-drones/	2024-11-22T11:13:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/pal-jonson-umerov-scaled-e1732302009113.jpg
For air superiority, USAF must pursue effective, rather than ‘affordable,’ mass	An F-22 Raptor takes off for a training mission at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, Hawaii.

Alexander Martinez/Released) Constrained for funds and facing rapidly improving potential adversaries, the US Air Force (USAF) is grappling with how to ensure control of the air in the 2030s. One proposal — leaning heavily on standoff forces to provide 'affordable' mass without traditional air superiority — has a problem: even with long-range kill chains, exquisite smart weapons, and low-cost swarms, no one has specifically described how such novel ideas would lead to victory. As the USAF considers difficult standoff versus stand-in decisions and what future control of the air might entail, the debate must return to a critical focus: how to produce effective mass. Arguments over whether air superiority is necessary overlook a critical point: In a hypothetical defense against an invading adversary, the USAF might win with standoff-centric theories of victory, if they solve the effective mass calculus. However, with air superiority, the odds of victory increase drastically. The terms 'stand-in' and 'standoff' forces are popular among USAF planners but do not exist in USAF or Department of Defense doctrine. Generally speaking — although there is some important nuance for stealth capabilities — stand-in forces achieve effective mass and strike within contested areas via organic firing methods; for example, F-15E Strike Eagles employing weapons on self-generated coordinates. Standoff forces employ long-range weapons from aircraft outside notional enemy engagement zones; for instance, a bomber launching a Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile reliant on more complicated kill chains. 'Effective mass' embraces Col. John Boyd’s dictum to operate 'at a faster tempo or rhythm' than its adversaries. Traditionally, effective mass in the USAF translates to air superiority, which theorists generally define as the air control necessary for freedom of maneuver in support of striking varying target sets. In the modern era, fighting for air superiority is fundamental to historical examples of victory: success is most likely when leaders prepare their forces for complex challenges in the name of soundly defeating an adversary. The connection between stand-in forces and effective mass is meaningful because, traditionally, the former enables the latter. Stand-in forces with air superiority provide control of the air, support to ground elements, and short kill chains against mobile and deceptive adversaries. If the USAF is to succeed in a major conflict, it must not mistake affordable mass for effective mass. Of course, affordable mass is good to have. But, a standoff-centric approach has five significant issues. First, a standoff-centric approach might play into adversary capabilities and potential plans, as an opponent must only dodge or defeat a finite number of cruise missiles and drones. A 'hellscape' might be an adversary-specific hedge, but how long could such efforts delay a dedicated air, ground, and sea invasion supported by a rolling barrage? It is easy to imagine that standoff weapons provide mass, but the bar for delivering effective mass against mobile targets within protected airspace is quite high. Without a viable stand-in partner, standoff tactics comply with adversary strategies to push US forces farther from the battlefield, forcing the Air Force to reconsider its approach to air superiority and the fundamentals of basing. We do not discount the difficulties of penetrating modern anti-access, area-denial systems or claim that standoff, drone, or denial-based efforts might not be effective in specific contexts. However, given the inherent difficulties of interwar decisions, have planners explored how many options an aggressing adversary would have against pulsed operations employing standoff-centric tactics? Second, if the USAF depends on standoff-centric tactics and abandons air superiority, it is taking an ambitious leap away from historical lessons learned. Drones and other novel capabilities add to the complexity of modern warfare, but they are not a replacement for the capabilities enjoyed by a stand-in force ensuring even limited control of the air over a battlefield. Artificial intelligence (AI) driven unmanned platforms are an intriguing option, but they have no history of battlefield success and are likely unavailable near-term. The USAF has attempted to start the transition to more unmanned platforms before, but seeking to define affordable mass in terms of lower risk is an inherent admission that stand-in benefits are still necessary. If the technology is not immediately available, the USAF cannot afford to gamble its entire future on it. Third, creating an effective deterrent, always a tenuous concept at best, is much more difficult when you’re relying primarily on stand-off systems. The uneven effects of standoff munitions in Israel and Ukraine underscore the reality that such tactics are enabling and not decisive. Additionally, the United States rarely, if ever, fights the war it expects under predictable circumstances. It is certainly possible that, for example, a war with China might break out under the assumptions inherent in making it the 'pacing threat,' but it is equally likely that a situation requiring immediate stand-in forces — whether it be a deeply buried strategic target or something akin to the defense of Israel — will arise. Fourth, a standoff-centered force reduces the political means available to leaders attempting to manage escalation. Designing a force capable of winning with the least risk is laudable, but significant wars rarely finish within the realm of their original ends, if those means were ever straightforward in the first place. The longer a conflict endures, the more likely the Air Force will run short of standoff weapons or face demands for results only stand-in forces can provide. Compromising on funding the latter in the short-term might have devastating consequences and reduce national leader decision space should they demand higher risks in exchange for better results, i.e., striking at the heart of the enemy. Finally, a force designed primarily to prevent losses will be brittle and unthreatening to anti-access and area-denial defenses, as stand-in effects are a critical part of attrition when fighting adversaries capable of producing overwhelming mass on their home turf. The key to countering such advantages is not outproducing adversaries — the US industrial base will not allow it in an interwar period — but lies in procuring survivable and lethal stand-in assets capable of effectively fighting attritional conflicts from vigorously defended positions. Such investments would make a traditional theory of victory viable: effective mass with increasing levels of control of the air via a combination of risk-acceptable stand-in and standoff forces prevents an adversary’s fait accompli and attrits enemy advantages in mass over time. This is how the USAF could realistically attack adversary advantages and prove via Lanchester-type calculations a viable theory of victory. The obvious counter to an appeal for stand-in capabilities and air superiority is that pursuing traditional theories of victory is impossible, given modern peer capabilities. We are not arguing that success will be easy, even with advanced stealth capabilities and the most exquisite space and cyber programs. However, cultural shifts and a nuanced acquisition plan would allow the Air Force to embrace tactical creativity and determine what would be necessary to transition from pulsed operations to persistent efforts in a long campaign or press towards preventing a fait accompli at all reasonable costs, should political circumstances demand so. A balanced force that prioritizes effective mass over affordable mass and always pursues some version of control of the air via stand-in capabilities is key. Lt. Col.

Boeing inks contracts worth more than $4B for KC-46s, P-8s	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon this week awarded Boeing a pair of separate contracts for 15 KC-46A Pegasus tankers and seven P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, deals that are collectively worth more than $4 billion. Although both contracts had been expected under existing plans, getting the deals signed is good news for Boeing, whose defense arm logged $2 billion in losses for its last fiscal quarter and which is facing company-wide layoffs. The P-8A deal is valued at $1.67 billion and includes non-recurring engineering work for foreign military sales made to Canada and Germany. It will bring the number of P-8As on contract up to 207, 135 of which are for the US Navy. Australia, India, the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Germany and Canada all fly the maritime surveillance aircraft, which has played an integral part in experimentation done at the behest of the AUKUS trilateral security pact. 'This $1.67 billion undefinitized contract for seven additional P-8A Poseidons not only reinforces the U.S. Navy’s commitment to maintaining a robust maritime presence but also highlights Boeing's dedication to delivering safe, reliable platforms that enhance the Navy’s operational capabilities, readiness and effectiveness,' Tory Peterson, vice president and P-8 program manager at Boeing. 'We look forward to delivering these additional P-8A maritime patrol aircraft to ensure the continued safety and security of our nation and allies.' The KC-46A deal is valued at $2.38 billion and includes 15 additional planes for the US Air Force. The new deal brings the number of planes on contract up to 168, according to a Boeing statement. The company to date has delivered 89 KC-46As to the US Air Force as well as four to Japan. RELATED: Boeing Machinists Vote To End Strike, Putting KC-46, P-8 Programs Back On Track The State Department previously cleared Japan to purchase up to nine KC-46 tankers for its air force in a deal valued at a $4.1 billion. If the Japanese proceed with that deal, it would more than double its current fleet, which is currently set to eventually reach six planes. Israel is also under contract on the tanker, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns over the last decade.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/boeing-inks-contracts-worth-more-than-4b-for-kc-46s-p-8s/	2024-11-22T09:09:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
After watching Ukraine, Central Asian nations ‘turning away’ from Russia for arms: US officials	The Kazakhstan National Defense University welcomed then-Lt. Gen. Michael Garrett, the commander of US Army Central, as its guest speaker Dec. 13, 2016, in the capital city of Astana. (US Army photo by Sgt. Brandon Hubbard) WASHINGTON — The war in Ukraine has prompted 'introspection' among Central Asian nations about buying military equipment mostly from Russia, and pushed them to look farther from home for arms — from Beijing all the way to Washington, according to State Department officials. 'I would argue that's not countries turning towards China; it's countries turning away from Russia,' Ambassador Donald Lu, assistant secretary at the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, said on a panel at the Center for New American Security last week. 'And they're not just looking at China, they're looking at Iran, they're looking at Europe, they're looking at the United States. They're having to go further afield because military equipment is just not available in the way that it was before the Ukraine war.' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense this week that before the Kremlin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Central Asian nations — Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — already had been 'diversifying away from Russia.' But the process has been hurried along not only by the strain the war has put on the pipeline for Russian equipment and parts, but by the view of Russia's experience on the battlefield. 'The second factor that has caused sort of a reexamination is all the five Central Asian nations have observed the performance of Russian equipment in Ukraine and have raised questions about how that equipment would perform in a regional conflict, should they have that requirement,' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official declined to comment on the broader political implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the region, but an analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute in May said Central Asian nations, as fellow former members of the Soviet Union, were spooked by Russia's move. 'For Russia, the invasion deeply damaged its reputation and self-appointed role as the sole security manager for the region,' reads the analysis, written by Robert Hamilton, head of research at the FPRI's Eurasia Program. 'Given what the Central Asian governments, especially Kazakhstan, have seen in Ukraine regional states, they view Moscow’s motives with deep suspicion and have lost considerable faith in its military capabilities.' Central Asia is not a large defense market. The combined military expenditure for Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan in 2023 was approximately $1.84 billion, according to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, by far the lowest expenditure by region that SIPRI tracked. (Figures for Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were not available.) For comparison, the next closet regional expenditure, from Central America and the Caribbean, was approximately $14.7 billion. But the nations sit at a key geostrategic crossroads, with Russia immediately to the north, China to the east and Iran and Afghanistan to the south. Since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the region has become an even more important player in the realm of counterterrorism, according to the State Department official. 'So it is one part of the world where you do get a lot of these strategic competitors kind of working in a similar place,' the official said. The FPRI analysis notes that China has been a prime beneficiary of Central Asia's slow pull away from Russia, and Beijing has offered attractive economic packages as well as arms deals to draw them closer. But it also notes that Turkey has a presence in defense sales as well, especially when it comes to drone sales, according to SIPRI data. As Breaking Defense has reported, Ankara has been aggressively expanding its military export portfolio in recent years. Turkey 'frankly, [has] a share that is sizeable and growing,' the official added. The State Department official didn't expound on Lu's reference to Iran, and the SIPRI database makes scant mention of public Iranian exports to the region. But Breaking Defense has reported that global interest in Tehran's indigenous, relatively cheap unmanned aerial vehicles, used in mass in Ukraine by Russia, has only grown since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict. In 2022, Iran publicly inaugurated a drone manufacturing facility in Tajikistan. As for the US, the State Department official said Washington has seen a 'very high level' of interest in American-made defense products, platforms and services, but 'there's a couple of limiting factors there.' 'As you can imagine, expense is one of those,' the official said. 'Our defense articles and services are fairly advanced, right?' And, therefore, tend to be expensive. Relatedly, there are 'tech release' issues, as the US is cautious when it comes to handing over high-tech equipment, presumably especially to nations that have such historically close ties to Russia and China. Coming information-sharing agreements, the official said, could help with that particular obstacle. 'So we do see that we need to balance sometimes US protection of our tech against where we're going to be able to release those things. The Central Asians, though, are again very interested in our particular products; it's really just a matter of making a good match,' the official said. As such, the official said it's unlikely that big ticket items, like fighter jets, will be part of any deals any time soon. (One of the only announcements about major US Foreign Military Sales to the region on the website for the Defense Cooperation Security Agency, for instance, was a 2020 notice that the US had approved a potential $128 million deal with Kazakhstan for airborne ISR systems.) The official said what the US has seen, instead, are very precise requests, 'the sort of smaller capabilities that tend to fill niches they have.' 'So it will be things like, &#8216;I need a UAV with a 20-kilometer range, with some amount of loiter time that can do X, Y and Z,' the official said. 'Or I need an over-the-horizon radar, which will pick up the following kind of targets. 'I say that as an example that they're fairly sophisticated, or at least clear-eyed, about what they're looking for from us,' the official said. Another 'great place to start,' the official said, is small arms and ammunition — a lower-profile but ubiquitous military need that Central Asian nations have expressed interest in having the US fill. 'And we find that pretty significant because &#8230; these countries have been firing Russian caliber ammunition forever and ever,' the official said. 'But they look at the US small arms inventory and think, &#8216;I want to get to that; I want to get over to that capability.'' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense that Central Asian nations have also expressed interest in boutique equipment used by American special operations forces — sometimes after witnessing the equipment in action during joint training exercises. 'But yea we certainly see working ourselves up the ladder to bigger systems, to more capable systems,' the first official said.

Integrating commercial off-the-shelf computing on military platforms and how to make it work	The NCS Technologies division responsible for additive manufacturing is subject to the same quality controls as third parties. NCS Technologies photo. The threats to maneuver-force ground vehicles and their crews today are in many ways akin to what platforms faced in Iraq and Afghanistan faced years ago. The need for mechanical systems to drive sensors and computers for command and control and situational awareness, for example, remains relevant today. Back then, maneuver forces needed 360-degree cameras to help identify subtle changes in a given area, like a truck that wasn’t there the day before. The cameras required sophisticated data handling and storage systems that were stressed even under good conditions, as vehicles traversed rough terrain in all kinds of weather, with limited cooling and power, and perhaps with bombs exploding nearby. In that environment, the systems also required filters to keep sand out of the ventilation, uninterruptible power supplies to prevent sudden shutdowns resulting in lost data – not uncommon on military vehicles – and removable data storage so the data collected by the vehicle can be shared with a command post. Steve Stuck is vice president of the Appliance and Server Engineering Group at NCS Technologies. 'We designed several different iterations of that for a customer,' said Steve Stuck, Vice President of the Appliance and Server Engineering Group at NCS Technologies, which designs and builds custom computing solutions for mobile military platforms. 'They used them in the field in Afghanistan and came back to us with lessons learned. We completely re-architected the design based on their feedback.' Subsequent versions proved resilient against just about anything short of physical destruction of the vehicle, Stuck says. The camera system is but one example of the type of requests NCS Technologies routinely fields today from its military customers trying to address threat scenarios across European, Indo-Pacific, and Middle East battlespace. Oftentimes, these customers know what capabilities they’re looking for and turn to NCS Technologies to bring them to fruition.' NCS does this in a variety of inventive ways. Custom computing with a COTS twist Modern military platforms rely on advanced computing systems that must be protected against natural elements, extreme temperatures, and salt water, as well as decidedly human threats ranging from kinetics to supply chain sabotage. Ground vehicles are becoming smaller, more autonomous and mobile, amplifying the challenge. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions. Different platforms have varied missions, not to mention their own size, weight, power and cost (SWAP-C) requirements. In addition, data processing and storage systems must be compatible with other onboard electronics with which they connect – whether by design or not. The company is often contracted to do technology insertion into legacy platforms, with the onboard electronics to which it must interface sometimes many years behind mainstream – necessitating some creativity in designing leading edge computer systems that can communicate with legacy systems. Checking all necessary boxes in an affordable way is complicated, but that’s what NCS Technologies regularly accomplishes with its builds. Ronald Keene is vice president of military business development for NCS Technologies. 'We're dedicated to providing solutions that deliver performance, security, and reliability for every scenario that our customers put in front of us; that’s all,' said Ronald Keene, the company’s vice president of military business development. NCS packages commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computing and storage components to fit within the space and power constraints of a given platform, be it a ship or combat vehicle, and ruggedizes them against all operational scenarios. The company relies on model-based systems engineering, additive manufacturing, and inventiveness to do this. 'Almost everything we develop requires some degree of engineering, even if it's a COTS offering; nobody wants something exactly the way they see it on the website,' Stuck noted. 'Sometimes that's easy, sometimes that's harder.' Take, for example, the often-complex network of fans, ducts, and vents needed to prevent compute systems from overheating. Typically, fans draw and expel air from opposite sides of a system, but sometimes a customer needs customization for a specific vehicle integration. 'A requirement came to us recently where airflow had to come from adjoining sides so we're having to design the system in a very unconventional way,' Stuck said. 'We're using off-the-shelf technology, but you don't find systems where airflow comes in the side and goes out the back. It doesn't exist in a normal environment.' That said, NCS is careful not to over-customize. 'We don't want to add cost by driving a customization that's not necessary for the use case,' Keene said. The role of additive manufacturing Not everything can be bought off the shelf, and this is especially true of the brackets and other hardware necessary to house, support, and protect sensitive computing systems customized for mobile military platforms and vessels. This is where NCS’s in-house additive manufacturing capability, colloquially known as 3D printing, comes into play. During the digital design and engineering process, NCS uses additive manufacturing to quickly build prototype component parts to see what works and what doesn’t. Having the additive manufacturing in house means that engineers can design several notional designs, print all three of them and see which one works best and move on. Even though these parts are manufactured in-house, the NCS division responsible for additive manufacturing is subject to the same quality controls as third parties. Additive manufacturing is also a valuable tool in making modifications relatively late in the design and production process. Stuck cited an example of this where a single semiconductor chip was overheating and the ability to cool it by increasing fan speed was found to increase Airborne Noise (ABN) and Structure-borne Noise (SBN) beyond allowable Environmental Qualification Testing (EQT) tolerances, resulting in a bit of a 'Catch-22'. A tight schedule precluded a system redesign, so NCS engineers designed and additively manufactured an unusually shaped plenum – a chamber where a substance is collected for distribution – that drew air from a specific spot and directed it toward the chip. Problem solved. Structured for success In an era where many companies are embracing vertical integration, NCS’s design and development organization has a horizontal structure that strings together disciplines including design, systems engineering, and manufacturing to tackle the complex challenges of SWAP-C. The company’s customer interfacing team, meanwhile, has deep expertise in specific mission areas. 'We help drive the requirements working with our product management and engineering experts to devise an offering that specifically meets the business use case that the customer's looking for,' Stuck says. The NCS engineering-design team in one area interfaces directly to the manufacturing engineering team to ensure that a specially designed product can be manufactured at scale. For example, when the engineering team designs a system to optimize airflow while minimizing costs, the manufacturing engineering team weighs in to ensure it can be built quickly and affordably, a process that can involve some compromises. This horizontal back-and-forth manufacturing approach differs from siloed structures where engineering teams handoff designs to a production team that only then figures out how to build it. Instead of subcontracting for hardware fabrication and waiting for parts to be built, delivered, then tested for shock and vibration, and properly integrated, NCS keeps the entire process in-house, speeding design iteration, manufacturing, and quality control. This approach also improves sustainment. NCS’ field products have an expected lifecycle as long as 8-10 years, so the company designs products with LRUs (line replaceable units) in mind to speed up field service should it become necessary, and to also enhance its customer’s support experience with a comprehensive sustainment offering. NCS Technologies packages COTS computing and storage components to fit within the space and power constraints of a given platform, be it a ship or combat vehicle, and ruggedizes them against all operational scenarios. NCS Technologies photo. Resilience testing and supply chain security Like any contractor, NCS wants to ship its products with a high confidence level that they will pass muster with the customer. The Navy, for example, requires that machinery, electronics, and structures to be deployed on ships pass MIL-DTL-901E Floating Shock Testing, also known as barge testing. This entails placing items on a covered barge in a deep-water pond that then is exposed to explosions at various depths and distances to ensure they can withstand the rigors of combat. NCS has in-house shock and vibration test equipment that can emulate the effects of barge testing. 'Going to the barge, which is a required step in qualifying products or solutions for the Navy, is expensive and takes time to schedule,' Stuck says. 'The last thing you want to do is go to the barge and fail.' Confidence in systems also applies to the supply chain and security of the industrial base. Combat-bound computer systems face threats before they reach the field in the form of counterfeit parts or chips deliberately infected with spyware or malware. To address this, NCS has partnered with another innovative Northern Virginia company to identify and counter supply chain threats by isolating and monitoring a device’s electromagnetic emissions. The resulting signatures are measured against an established baseline, using patented machine learning capabilities to identify differences that might be indicative of counterfeiting or malware. 'It's powerful,' Stuck says. 'We've used this in our supply chain environment to make sure that a board that we're using is what it's supposed to be.' It’s one more layer of resiliency that NCS Technologies brings to its military customers and OEMs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/integrating-commercial-off-the-shelf-computing-on-military-platforms-and-how-to-make-it-work/	2024-11-22T08:08:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/The-NCS-Technologies-division-responsible-for-additive-manufacturing-is-subject-to-the-same-quality-controls-as-third-parties.-NCS-Technologies-photo.jpg
Lockheed, Pentagon reach handshake deal for next 2 F-35 production lots	An F-35B lands aboard Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) for the first time on Oct. 20, 2024. (Photo by Cmdr. Darin Russell.) WASHINGTON — After protracted negotiations, the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have reached an informal agreement, known as a 'handshake deal,' for the next two production lots of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the parties confirmed to Breaking Defense. 'We have reached an initial agreement as part of ongoing negotiations for the Lot 18/19 Air Vehicle Production Contract,' the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) and Lockheed said in a joint statement. The statement did not share final quantities or prices, saying only that those figures will be disclosed 'when a final agreement is signed.' The news was first reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, which stated the agreement covers roughly 300 aircraft. Progress on F-35 negotiations is likely welcome news to Lockheed, which has recently been funding the tri-variant stealth fighter’s production out of pocket as talks dragged on. A Lockheed executive told Breaking Defense last year that the aerospace giant aimed to finalize the lot 18/19 deal by the end of 2023, marking a significant delay for the negotiations. The program has recently battled inflation woes, supply chain challenges and technical problems that halted deliveries of upgraded jets for a full year. It’s not clear what the price might be for the forthcoming jets, though Lockheed has telegraphed that inflation may hike costs. Jets in lots 15 through 17 came in at an average price of $82.5 million for the conventional takeoff and landing F-35A, $109 million for the short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B and $102.1 million for the carrier-launched F-35C, Breaking Defense previously reported. Unlike the previous contract structure that included three production lots, the upcoming F-35 deal only covers two. Officials have discussed lot 20 serving as the first multi-year production agreement. Lockheed maintains that its Fort Worth, Texas, plant can build 156 jets annually. If the past is any guide, it could be several months before an agreement is inked. When the two parties reached a similar handshake agreement for lots 15-17 in July 2022, the contract was not finalized until December of that year. Asked when Lockheed planned for the 18/19 deal to become official, a company spokesperson referred Breaking Defense to comments from Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave during the firm’s third quarter earnings call in October. Malave said then that company officials anticipated the lot 18/19 contract will be awarded this year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/lockheed-pentagon-reach-handshake-deal-for-next-2-f-35-production-lots/	2024-11-22T07:06:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8708105-scaled-e1729541848808.jpg
Lawmakers backing separate cyber force see opening with Trump’s return	U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly seen on a laptop computer in Hastings on the Hudson, New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 22. 2020. (Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has long pushed back against the establishment of a new military service dedicated to cyberspace, but with President-elect Donald Trump on his way back to the White House, a separate cyber force has a real shot at becoming a reality, according to experts and to lawmakers who support the move. 'This change in administration potentially could give more impetus to the creation of a separate cyber service,' Quentin Hodgson, formerly the Pentagon’s director of Cyber Plans, told Breaking Defense. '[Trump] did that with the Space Force. It was something that the Department of Defense didn't want, but he decided he wanted it, and it's possible that that could also happen with cyberspace.' Hodgson was hardly alone in connecting Trump’s then-controversial move to stand up the Space Force in 2019 to visions of what his second term could bring to the cyber realm. Among those who made the comparison to Breaking Defense was Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican and vocal supporter of the cyber force idea. 'As the past half century has shown us, there will be naysayers and contrarians within the Pentagon who will do everything to slow-roll major changes. However, only six years ago, we had the same issue in the space domain,' Fallon said in an email. 'We need concrete progress and limited stagnation in cyber, something I know the Trump Administration will emphasize throughout the next four years.' Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell, another Texas Republican, authored an amendment in the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that called for an independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. The study is being conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. 'Incumbent on the results of the commission, which I think will affirm the need for a cyber service, I believe there’s a good chance we will see [a cyber service] come to fruition in soon. The Trump administration has shown that they will not put up with the status quo, and will opt for bold action, if necessary, especially when US national security is at risk,' Fallon said. Luttrell, like Fallon, said in an interview that he thought that if the third-party study came back recommending an independent cyber force, Trump would likely be on board, but ultimately, it is 'most certainly the president’s call.' 'As a congressional member, if I want to know the advancements in AI, technology, name any given space, where do I get to go to that? Do I have to go talk to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or go talk to [Cyber Command]?' Luttrell told Breaking Defense. 'Or could I go to cyber force, talk to the leadership, like, ‘Hey, where are we?’ And then they could say, ‘This is where we stand. This is what we implemented.’' Outside experts agreed that a Trump administration would, as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Mark Montgomery put it, 'look more favorably' on a separate cyber service. Montgomery, the senior director for FDD’s Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, said such a service could 'address our poor cyber force generation efforts over the past decade.' Emily Harding, vice president of the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Breaking Defense that the possibility of a cyber force under Trump’s second term is a 'big shrug' and that she has 'zero evidence' it’s in the works. But, she said, 'I also know these guys like to build things, and you know they were the ones responsible for Space Force, so why not?' She added that Trump’s seemingly close relationship with SpaceX founder and technology innovator Elon Musk — who was recently tapped by Trump to co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency — is another factor that could lead to a cyber force. 'You could see somebody like Elon Musk understanding this in a way that you know other people might not. So I don't know. I think there's a decent chance that they pursue it. I think they should pursue it,' she said. Harding said she primarily supports a cyber force because she believes an independent service will allow the military to find the most cyber-capable fighters. 'The kinds of skills that you're recruiting for in a cyber service or in a cyber role are very different from the kinds of skills you're recruiting for in what you consider the other branches of the military,' she said. 'I think you would want a different setup for recruiting and for training. In the other services, each one of them has a cyber skill set. They have a cyber specialty, but there's not necessarily the same path to advancement. So I think it's worth it to create the separate service, to create the talent pipeline and the specific structures that you would need for reserve,' she added. The Pentagon disagrees, arguing that the creation of a separate cyber force could create new challenges for the DoD in terms of understanding warfighting needs within each service. 'A cyber service might have some benefits in ease of administrative management, but we have a variety of …military services in the Department of Defense who perform a variety of missions,' Mieke Eoyang, deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy, said last year. 'Having a cyber service that is divorced from those particular mission sets may pose some challenges in understanding the warfighting needs of the services to provide cyber to enable that fight.' 'I think the question is that for people who think the cyber service is the answer to our … current challenges in cyber personnel management: be careful what you wish for,' she said. Related: ‘Be careful what you wish for:’ DoD official warns separate cyber force could pose new challenges Furthermore, at the end of September, the department formally requested that lawmakers shut down Fallon and Luttrell’s proposal for the independent assessment. DoD leaders contended that Congress had already called for an assessment of the current cyber landscape within the Pentagon, which included the potential for creating a cyber service in the 2023 NDAA. Jacquelyn Schneider, a fellow at the Hoover Institution where she serves as the director of the Hoover Wargaming and Crisis Simulation Initiative, is also against the creation of a new cyber service. She argued that rather than consolidating cyber expertise and infrastructure, it would lead to information silos that would make the military less effective in the cyber domain. 'In a world in which warfare is inherently joint, every time you create these different organizations, you create information stove pipes,' said Schneider, who also previously served as a senior policy advisor to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. Right now it’s unclear where exactly Trump stands, and his transition team did not respond to a request for comment. 'Trump likes to make services,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/lawmakers-backing-separate-cyber-force-see-opening-with-trumps-return/	2024-11-22T05:20:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_trump_laptop_GettyImages-1228653864-scaled-e1732226397800.jpg
Navy to sideline support ships, re-assign mariner crews amid worsening workforce shortages	The Military Sealift Command fleet replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn (T-AO 198) conducts a fueling-at-sea with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), July 10, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Rashan Jefferson) WASHINGTON — The Navy late last month approved a plan to put a number of Military Sealift Command logistics ships into extended maintenance periods as well as re-assign certain crews to higher priority vessels, the service announced today. 'Our civil service mariners play invaluable roles providing continuous logistics support to our deployed naval forces, and they are working overtime to sustain that mission globally,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in a written statement. 'This initiative will not only address operational logistics challenges we face now, it will ensure that Military Sealift Command has policies, programs and incentives it needs to recruit and retain future generations of civil service mariners.' Military Sealift Command is responsible for managing civilian crews that operate the various support and auxiliary ships that resupply US Navy warships around the world. It employs roughly 5,500 civil service mariners, 1,500 contracted mariners, and operates 140 logistics supply ships, such as fleet replenishment oilers and dry cargo/ammunition ships. Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck, MSC's chief, told reporters ahead of the announcement that up to 17 ships would either be put into extended maintenance periods or undergo planned inactivation periods by the end of 2026, but declined to name specific vessels. USNI News first reported earlier this year the Navy was considering such a move. There is 'a critical shortage across the US, across the civilian mariner landscape, which certainly affects our ability to grow our Combat Logistics fleet and the other [government-owned, government-operated] ships, and our ability to fully generate ready forces,' Sobeck said. 'This shortage is an industry-wide problem, and we find ourselves direct in direct competition [with commercial industry.]' 'In fact, we're just not competitive,' he added, citing numerous obstacles MSC's mariners face, including delayed relief, extended deployment times and pay caps. By reassigning crews to higher priority vessels, the Navy is hoping to provide more predictable schedules for current crews and minimize 'overdue reliefs.' The shortage of qualified merchant mariners has been a long-festering problem. Ann Phillips, head of the Transportation Department's Maritime Administration, told lawmakers last year that a 2017 study found, 'concurrent operations of the commercially operated U.S.-flagged fleet and sustained military sealift operations' would require roughly 13,600 mariners with 'unlimited credentials.' At that time, there were roughly 11,760 mariners who were both qualified and actively sailing, a deficit of more than 1,800. Sobeck declined to provide updated numbers on the mariner shortage writ large across the country, but said within his purview, MSC is currently coping with roughly 800- to 1,000-person shortages daily. 'The goal is to fully execute MSC's workforce initiative by the end of fiscal year 2026,' he said. 'This brings us directly in line with [the chief of naval operations'] Project 33 goal, ready to sustain high-end, joint and combined combat by 2027.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-to-sideline-support-ships-re-assign-mariner-crews-amid-worsening-workforce-shortages/	2024-11-21T13:00:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8524368-scaled-e1727186104760.jpg
ULA’s Vulcan may forfeit planned Space Force launches this year	ULA’s first Vulcan rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex-41 at 2:18 a.m. EST on January 8, 2024. (United Launch Alliance photo) WASHINGTON — The United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan has two national security missions on its launch manifest this year, but given that the Space Force has yet to certify the heavy-lift rocket, it will likely be difficult to pull off either mission before 2025, a Space Force official said today. ULA launched its second certification flight in October, roughly a month behind schedule, following a first flight in January that was nearly four years behind schedule. The Space Force is still assessing data from the October launch in partnership with ULA to support the certification that will pave the way for the rocket to carry national security payloads. But even if that blessing comes swiftly, the calendar is unforgiving. With only six weeks left in the year, and other steps required like mounting payloads on the rocket, 'we are getting challenged to be able to launch this year,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, head of the Space Force’s Space Systems Command, told reporters this morning during a breakfast hosted by the Defense Writers Group. And how much schedule margin is left for 2024? 'Probably not much,' he replied, though he deferred to ULA for specifics. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amid dominance by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the Pentagon has been eager to field more launch providers to help foster competition, drive down costs and provide redundant launch options. ULA has since been racing to certify Vulcan, particularly after retiring the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy rockets from military service. Two well-executed launches are requisite to achieve certification for carrying national security payloads, meaning ULA could soon be given the go-ahead for Defense Department missions following the October launch. The January launch was deemed a success, but there was an anomaly during the October flight with one of Vulcan's solid rocket boosters that currently is under investigation. Nonetheless, Garrant noted, Vulcan was still able to achieve the criteria for certification by successfully continuing on its planned flight path. 'If they are not launching by the end of the year, we would delay those launches,' Garrant said of the two national security missions on Vulcan’s manifest. 'We are working with [ULA] to evaluate the data from their second flight, and they are making significant progress.' Garrant separately noted that the Space Force’s contract vehicle for launches, known as the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program, is currently in limbo due to the ongoing continuing resolution (CR), which appears likely to stretch into 2025. The service in June awarded the first contracts under the latest NSSL iteration, called Phase 3, to ULA, SpaceX and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, for non-critical and/or lower altitude launches under the program's first 'lane.' Due to the CR, the next tranche of awards under NSSL Phase 3 — for must-succeed missions under the program's Lane 2 — will not move forward until the full fiscal year 2025 budget is passed, Garrant said. While ULA’s Vulcan has not been certified, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has yet to even make its maiden flight — though that could occur this month. Still, Garrant indicated the Space Force expects the two companies will be able to compete against SpaceX for NSSL Phase 3, Lane 2 contracts. (SpaceX is currently the only certified launch provider for those missions.) 'We anticipate that they will be certified,' Garrant said of ULA and Blue Origin, though he added it’s 'probably too early to say how' the Space Force would divvy up contract awards between the three potential providers once the FY25 budget is passed.

Pentagon plans secure cloud pilot to defend small businesses from hackers	Two engineers working on laptop in a factory. (Getty stock image) WASHINGTON — Next year, the Pentagon’s Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) will launch a pilot project to create creating a secure, cloud-based enclave for small contractors, who often struggle to meet DoD’s extensive cybersecurity requirements. 'We're building [a] secure cloud that we’ll offer as a platform and environment for all small business' that work with the Department of Defense, said Derrick Davis, director of industrial cybersecurity for SBP. While still very much a work-in-progress, the plan is to include a virtual desktop, secure communications and other tools for use by smaller firms, Davis told the GovExec Cybersecurity Futures Forum on Wednesday afternoon. The as-yet unnamed pilot will be run out of OSBP’s Project Spectrum. Created in the defense policy bill for 2019 [PDF], Spectrum provides online resources to educate contractors and a marketplace for government-vetted cybersecurity tools, but it hasn’t built such a comprehensive suite of services before. The plan is start small, initially recruiting firms that have prior experience working with DoD — 'all you in this room know that you need a doctorate degree just to navigate the defense contractor process,' Davis said wryly — but still need cybersecurity help. One model that SBP is looking at is the Army’s two-year, $26 million pilot project, NCODE, which is also creating a secure cloud to host small businesses. 'That's a great program that they have, we’ve reviewed it within our office, we're going to partner with those guys,' Davis told the GovExec conference. 'I’m headed to the Pentagon after this to actually speak with the Army CIO, Mr. [Leo] Garciga, about NCODE.' Driving both initiatives is the realization that while big prime contractors can build extensive in-house cybersecurity teams, small businesses generally lack the resources to hire cyber experts or even buy the latest security software. 'Especially just starting out, your laptop that you use to run your small business, it's also your [personal] laptop that you use to manage your family's finances,' Davis said. 'You may even help have your kid do their homework on your laptop.' But even tiny mom-and-pop shops working with the Defense Department can end up handling sensitive information or technology, or providing some obscure but critical component for a high-priority weapons system. So, besides the inevitable spammers and scammers that go after everyday internet users, small firms contracting with the Pentagon might be targeted by so-called 'Advanced Persistent Threats,' Davis warned: Nation-states using sophisticated techniques and technologies to suck up vast amounts of defense-related data and look for unlocked backdoors into sensitive networks. 'If we're going to force companies to get compliant with CMMC [Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification], we should also, on the flip side, offer assistance, and that's what we're trying to do,' Davis said. 'But … when we do something, everybody wants it to be perfect. The problem is, as you know, it takes time.' 'Have patience and grace with us,' he told the GovExec audience. 'We’re just trying to help.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-plans-secure-cloud-pilot-to-defend-small-businesses-from-hackers/	2024-11-21T11:20:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_stock_factory_computer_GettyImages-648822919-scaled-e1732202717985.jpg
Romania signs LOA to secure entry to F-35 club	Romania has ordered 32 F-35A fifth generation fighter jets, joining a host of other European nations (US Embassy in Romania) BELFAST — Romania has formally committed to the acquisition of 32 Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fifth-generation fighter jets after signing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) today. The procurement is valued at approximately $6.4 billion. Romania joins a wide base of European customers for the platform including Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. Reacting to the inking of the LOA, Lockheed Martin said in a company statement, 'This decision marks a significant milestone in Romania's defense strategy and its commitment to maintaining a robust and advanced military force.' Lt. Gen Mike Schmidt, director and program executive officer of the F-35 Joint Program Office said in the statement, 'The integration of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft into the Romanian Air Force will significantly strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities by providing unmatched strategic, operational, and tactical advantages.' He added, 'The F-35 Joint Program Office is dedicated to continuing a strong relationship with Romania, ensuring a successful transition and providing comprehensive support for their pilots and maintainers as we move forward together on this great effort.' US Ambassador to Romania Kathleen Kavalec told reporters at the LOA signing ceremony in Bucharest, 'We expect by 2030 these planes will be flying above Romania,' and that in the interim, the southeastern European country will continue to 'benefit' from its fleet of Lockheed Martin F-16 fourth-generation planes, while transition to the F-35 will be supported by a F-16 training center. The F-35 order 'will take Romania even a step forward, [beyond the F-16 protecting national borders] both on behalf of Romanian security, but also on behalf of the NATO Alliance,' she said. 'Because these planes will also be part of air policing, Romania participates in NATO wide air policing, air policing occurs here in Romania, it occurs in other parts of NATO territory, so this will allow Romania to keep up with the rest of the alliance and to have an even stronger security footprint.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/romania-signs-loa-to-secure-entry-to-f-35-club/	2024-11-21T10:25:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/53991823469_169e0d4a7c_k-e1732211600494.jpg
As adversaries attack, Pentagon’s zero trust office shifts focus to protecting ‘operational technology’	Chief of the Department of Defense Zero Trust Portfolio Management Office Randy Resnick (right), and DoD Senior Information Security Officer, David McKeown (left), hold an off-camera, on-the-record virtual press briefing on the release of the DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Nov. 22, 2022. DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders. 'For OT and weapon systems, we are coming out with initial zero trust guidance. Why? Because the adversary is attacking,' Randy Resnick, the director of the Zero Trust Office within the department’s Chief Information Office, told Breaking Defense Tuesday. 'The adversary wants to get into weapon systems to prevent their launch, or mess with the GPS coordinates, so the DoD is looking to initially secure these things beyond what they are today.' 'OT also has vulnerabilities that we are concerned about,' he said. Unlike IT that primarily deals with software and data, OT generally refers to systems and devices that control physical processes, like thermostats, water tanks and machinery on a factory floor. They're key components in critical infrastructure for civilians, but also in the sprawling defense ecosystem of facilities and systems. Defense critical infrastructure, meanwhile, is more related to weapons systems, Resnik said. Resnick said that language in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the Pentagon focus on zero trust for IT, OT and DCI. As a result, Resnick’s office stood up the plan to transition to a zero-trust cybersecurity framework by the end of fiscal year 2027, which plans to have zero trust fully implemented into IT by that time. Given adversarial threats and the department’s progress in implementing zero trust into IT, Resnick said the next step is to create guidance for implementing zero trust in OT and then eventually DCI. 'At the end of [2027] we're going to have a number of successes that achieve [our 2027] target, if not [advancing it],' he said of the IT zero trust strategy during the panel. 'We are going to be coming out with guidance for OT, and that'll probably come out at the end of summer [2025] and we'll have a date beyond 2027 where we start establishing ZT [zero trust] into OT. 'Then, of course, we're also concerned about defense critical infrastructure, so that's another thing,' he added. If adversaries are able to hack into the DoD’s OT like machinery in factories, it could lead to catastrophic results, Resnick warned. 'The DoD leases and owns factories, the communication between every single piece of equipment is not IT. So it's OT, okay, the whole factory runs on OT,' he told Breaking Defense. 'If they coordinated across 10 to 15 things simultaneously, it means a tremendous amount.' 'It could shut the factory down for a period of time until they’ve recovered. DoD could be put out for a month. I hope not, but that's the worst case scenario. It's a point of vulnerability, it's a point of attack. The whole point of zero trust is to prevent these attacks in a modern day sense,' he added. Resnick explained that vulnerabilities in OT can lead to threat actors hacking into IT as well because OT is often connected to IT or the internet because that’s how the OT systems communicate with each other — think the Internet of Things. 'This creates a back door to get to IT, so I could break into OT, and it's called ‘swim upstream.’ I want to prevent that,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/as-adversaries-attack-pentagons-zero-trust-office-shifts-focus-to-protecting-operational-technology/	2024-11-21T07:50:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Chief-scaled-e1686258310375.jpg
Israel likely partner for Greece as it looks for integrated air defense systems	The Army has two Iron Dome batteries and is fielding both at JBLM. (David Huskey/DVIDS) JERUSALEM — Greece is kicking the tires on Israeli-made air defense systems, as the NATO nation seeks to build a multi-layered air defense system capable of countering both enemy jets and low-level drones, sources confirm to Breaking Defense. News of Greece’s interest was first reported by Reuters, with the Greek daily Ekathimerini reporting that the multi-layered systems could surpass $2 billion in cost. 'The defenses would likely mimic Israel’s Iron Dome and other systems that intercept short- and long-range missiles launched during strikes from its neighbors amid the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon,' per Ekathimerini. A pair of sources told Breaking Defense that Greece is in the fact-finding process of what systems Israeli might be willing to sell, and while it appears Athens plans to cast a wide net as it looks for options, the two are a clear match: Israel, which has grown closer to Greece in recent years, already possesses a multi-layered air defense system, all parts of which are in varying states of being sold or used by other countries. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems makes the short-range Iron Dome system, used primarily against rockets and small drones; that system is soon to incorporate laser air defenses as well. Rafael also makes the medium-range system David’s Sling, which was jointly developed with the US and has been sold to Finland, as well as the Spyder, which can defend against aircraft and other threats. IAI makes Arrow, an exoatmospheric defense system jointly developed with the US which has been sold to Germany, as well as the Barak air defense system. IAI's Elta also makes the air defense radars used with Iron Dome, radars that have been sold to Czech Republic and Slovakia. The initial Reuters report came after a closed door briefing in Israel with Greek Defense Minister Nikos Dendias, who has emerged as a key figure in advancing Israel’s closer ties with Athens. A former foreign minister for Greece, Dendias visited Israel in August 2023 and met with then-Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'We discussed the important achievements of our Strategic Defence Relationship and expressed our wish to further broaden it,' he wrote on social media. He highlighted the joint exercises between Israel and Greece and also said that Athens and Jerusalem had 'agreed to enhance our mutually beneficial cooperation in the area of defence research and technology with the involvement of the defence industry, research institutions, and other innovation bodies.' The Israel-Greece ties are part of a growing context of emerging partnerships in the eastern Mediterranean that also include Cyprus. This trilateral relationship is the background in which Athens’ interest in a multi-layered defense system have emerged, noted Eran Lerman, a former Israeli deputy national security advisor and now vice-president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security. He said he uses the term 'alignment' for these ties, as opposed to 'alliance,' because there aren’t agreements on the horizon involving mutual defense. 'It’s enough to generate intelligence cooperation, military training — this is essentially a triangular relationship because the Cypriots are part of this story,' Lerman said, citing two key ways the relationship with Cyprus is benefitting Israel. The first is training in Cyprus for units such as Israeli commandos, which helps them familiarize with long-range operations in terrain similar to Lebanon. The second development is that Cyprus can be a logistical backstop if there are interruptions in trade with Israel — for instance, when flights were cancelled due to the recent war with Hamas and Hezbollah, airlines would fly to Cyprus and then Israeli jets would take them the rest of the way. 'That’s not a trivial matter when we faced the possibility of serious limitation on flights to Israel,' Lerman added. The burgeoning ties also have roots in joint drills with Greece, where Lerman says there has been 'close cooperation, particularly with the air forces.' Israel has participated in the annual multi-national air exercise called Iniochos in Greece and the Greeks have participated in Blue Flag, a semi-annual air force drill in Israel. In addition, Israel is deliver M-346 training aircraft to Greece as part of a government-to-government deal, and Israel’s Elbit Systems is creating a flight training center in Greece.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-likely-partner-for-greece-as-it-looks-for-integrated-air-defense-systems/	2024-11-21T06:29:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/6798386-scaled-e1659458065341.jpg
Anduril could receive up to $100M for Space Surveillance Network upgrade	A sunset view of Maui Space Surveillance System on Mount Haleakala, above the clouds at 10,000 feet. (US Air Force photo/Tech. Sgt. Bennie J. Davis III) WASHINGTON — The Space Force has awarded artificial intelligence startup Anduril a contract worth up to almost $100 million to create a modern, machine-to-machine communications network to link sensors for monitoring the heavens to command and control (C2) systems and data analysts, the company announced today. The indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, managed by Space Force Space Systems Command, covers a five-year program to deliver its Lattice software to US Space Command (SPACECOM) 'as a resilient mesh networking capability' to modernize the Space Surveillance Network (SSN), Anduril's press release said. 'The U.S. Space Command has mandated full deployment by the end of 2026,' the release added. The SSN is composed of primarily ground-based radars and telescopes that detect and track objects in space, ranging from active satellites to debris such as jettisoned rocket bodies and pieces from satellite breakups. That observational data is downlinked to SPACECOM computer systems for use by analysts who are charged with characterizing whether those objects present threats to US and allied space systems — as well as figuring out whether any are on a course to potentially collide with other space objects, especially any operational satellites. Anduril's mesh network, called the Space Domain Awareness Network (SDANet), includes hardware that will be deployed at every SSN sensor type over the next two years, a company official told Breaking Defense. That hardware will use the Lattice open software platform, which can bring in data from any type of sensor, then employ machine learning to process that information and fuze it, and finally distribute the results. SDANet will replace SPACECOM's Space Defense Interface Network, which is 'a 40-year-old system of point-to-point network connections leveraging serial lines coupled with aging infrastructure' used by SSN sensors, the company official said. That legacy network 'can only move data at speeds of roughly one-tenth of old dial up internet (i.e., ~4,800 Baud),' the official explained, and doesn't have any way to automatically reroute data if any part of the network goes down. SDANet thus will 'increase the level of connectivity between sensors, command and control systems, and data platforms to drastically decrease communications/messaging latency, increase availability/resiliency, and enable new concepts of operations essential to space warfighting operations currently not possible with legacy communications systems,' Anduril's press release said. Specifically, the company official said, the new network will be 'transporting and translating data' from SSN telescopes and radars to the C2 systems at Space Force Delta 2's 18th Space Defense Squadron at Vandenberg SFB, Calif. and 19th Space Defense Squadron at the Naval Support Facility Dahlgren, Va. The 18th Space Defense Squadron is the primary space domain awareness unit for SPACECOM, and is charged with C2 of the SSN sensors and managing the command's computerized database of space objects, according to a Space Force fact sheet. It also is responsible for sharing space tracking data with Defense Department, interagency, commercial, international and academic users. The 19th Space Defense Squadron provides tasking orders to the SSN sensors 'to maintain up-to-date orbital parameters for over 40,000 man-made Earth-orbiting objects,' according to a Space Force fact sheet. In particular, its role includes 'expanding cislunar and extra-geosynchronous awareness via current SSN and commercial capabilities' and contributing to 'space-based environmental monitoring missions.' Anduril's network already is operational at a subset of the SSN sites in Maui, Hawaii, via an experimental program with Space Systems Command first initiated in November 2022. Under that program, the Anduril official explained, the SDANet is feeding data to the Non-traditional Data Pre-Processor system built by L3Harris — essentially one of a series of software patches that have been developed over two-plus decades of unsuccessful efforts to overhaul the aging computer processing, data analysis and C2 systems used by SPACECOM to manage space domain awareness operations, and enable integration of new sensors and observational data. Specifically, the official said, the Non-traditional Data Pre-Processor feeds Anduril's SDANet data to SPACECOM's 1980s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system and software. SPADOC links directly with legacy SSN sensors, pulls it down, and processes it. That pre-processor also will be used to feed data into SPADOC's replacement system, called ATLAS (Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System) also being developed by L3Harris. ATLAS, however, is facing it own developmental problems. SDANet further will enable connections to 'various mission partners that currently rely on this data for intelligence and analysis mission sets,' the Anduril official said. The Defense Department and the services began experimenting with Anduril's AI-powered Lattice platform as long ago as 2020, including for counter-drone operations — winning a $1 billion contract from US Special Operations Command in 2022 — and as an enabler of its ambitious Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept. Further, Anduril has ambitious plans for its own constellation of space monitoring satellites, to be launched by 2025, based on Lattice.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/anduril-could-receive-up-to-100m-for-space-surveillance-network-upgrade/	2024-11-21T05:00:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Maui-Space-Surveillance-site-e1732138371199.jpeg
Norway puts France, Germany, UK and US in the frame for future frigate partnership	Norway is looking to replace aging Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates through a 'strategic' partnership with one of four newly shortlisted nations (Norwegian government) BELFAST — Norway has officially shortlisted four countries it will consider as options to support a future frigate 'strategic' partnership. France, Germany, the UK and the US are set to receive invitations to begin discussions on the matter, said the Norwegian Ministry of Defence in a Wednesday statement. Although Norway's statement does not say what designs are up for discussion, it is expected that the options will cover France's Defense and Intervention Frigate (FDI), Germany's F126, the UK Type 26/City-Class and/or Type 31, and the US Constellation-class. 'The new frigates represent the largest acquisition planned for the Norwegian Armed Forces in the coming years,' Bjørn Arild Gram, Norway’s Minister of Defence, is quoted as saying. 'Norway is an important maritime nation in NATO, and through this and other maritime investments we will be strengthening both national and allied security.' A strategic partner for the effort is due to be picked in 2025. Between five and six new frigates could be ordered to meet a requirement set out in Norway’s long term defense plan. The future ships will also be capable of embarking anti-submarine helicopters. Additionally, the proposed partnership will cover 'joint acquisition, operation, maintenance, continuous development and upgrades of the new frigates throughout their service life,' per the MoD statement. Oslo is focused on joining an active production frigate program in order to minimize the need for Fridtjof Nansen-class upgrades. 'Solid and predictable cooperation on both security and defence policy will be at the heart of the strategic partnership that we envision, which will include everything from force generation to operations and joint development of new capabilities,' said Arild Gram. 'It is therefore essential that we and our partners have the same long-term interests.' The frigate partnership push comes on the heels of Gen. Eirik Kristoffersen, Norway's Chief of Defense, telling Breaking Defense in April that, 'we need to' work in 'close cooperation with one ally. We need the same frigate as another ally. We cannot be the one user of a system, we are too small for that.' Such an outlook also mirrors Norway's favored approach to submarine investment, where it has opted for a joint procurement with Germany of Thyssenkrupp-made 212CD class vessels. A first Norwegian sub, of four on order, underwent construction at the shipbuilder's Kiel yard in September last year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/norway-puts-france-germany-uk-and-us-in-the-frame-for-future-frigate-partnership/	2024-11-20T13:53:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/knm-fritjof-nansen-foto-johan-ludvig-holst-scaled-e1732136926280.jpg
Army picks Red Cat’s small quadcopter for 2nd Short-Range Reconnaissance tranche	A soldier flies a Red Cat quadcopter in this image from the company. (Red Cat) WASHINGTON — The US Army announced it has picked systems made by Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones for the service’s Short-Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program of record. After the company preempted the service announcement on Tuesday, the Army confirmed today that it had selected Red Cat’s quadcopter for SRR but noted that 'exact funding, quantities, and other details' will be hammered out throughout the rest of the year as the duo work though the contract details. 'The selection was made based on a combination of criteria that included soldier feedback, performance, and reliability during the SRR tranche 2 prototyping effort,' an Army spokesman said in a brief statement. The Army spokesman did not disclose if Red Cat’s small Teal drone would be the only drone selected for this second tranche but noted that the program office is focused on fostering competition among companies and will be continually assessing new technologies for future tranches. 'The long-awaited production selection marks a new era for our company and the future of American drones,' George Matus, Red Cat’s chief technology officer, said in an announcement on Wednesday. 'Our top priority now is to start ramping production of the next generation system, recently announced as the Black Widow and WEB, and give warfighters the tools they need to be successful on the modern battlefield,' he later added. Skydio’s RQ-28A quadcopter was picked as the first tranche of the SRR program and was first delivered to soldiers in 2022, one of which noted at the time that the man-portable drones were so new that the service didn’t have tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for using them in operations. The service is moving out on plans to acquire and field a host of new aerial drones to provide soldiers at every echelon with a system. That plan includes:	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-picks-red-cats-small-quadcopter-for-2nd-short-range-reconnaissance-tranche/	2024-11-20T13:01:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_red_cat_drone_HANDOUT-e1732136676896.jpg
AUKUS will ‘cannibalize’ other programs with no budget boost: Former top Aussie general	Sir Angus Houston (L) delivers the Defence Strategic Review 2023 to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Deputy PM and Minister of Defence Richard Marles at Parliament House on February 14, 2023 in Canberra, Australia. (Photo by Martin Ollman/Getty Images) SYDNEY — Sounding the alarm that the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal will eat into non-naval priorities, the former head of the Australian Defense Force today called for a significant boost in defense spending, up to 3 percent of GDP. Sir Angus Houston was Australia's top military officer from 2005-2011 and was tapped to co-lead the recent Defense Strategic Review, making him a key, respected voice on matters of defense. While the DSR TKTKT, his comments today reflect what he sees as changed situation. The review and its Integrated Investment Plan projected a $55.5 billion AUD budget for 2024-25, rising to $67.9 billion in 2027-28 — roughly 2.2 percent of GDP. Part of that is simply acknowledging that the world is much more dangerous than when the review was completed in early 2023. When the strategy was published Houston made headlines with his claims that Australia faced the most dire strategic situation since World War II, and the situation has only expanded, with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the back and forth between several actors in the Middle East, a modernized and aggressive China and the increasingly close ties between North Korea, China, Russia and Iran. But in comments at the US Studies Centre here, Houston made clear he wasn't just talking about spending more because of the threats. He made an important structural point, that Australia must increase its defense spending so that buying and building nuclear powered attack submarines — the AUKUS program with the US and UK — does not consume too much of the defense budget. Houston said the AUKUS boats 'must be a net addition to Australia's military capability. The only way they can be a net addition to Australian military capability is to increase our defense spending by 3 percent plus of GDP as we move into and through the 2030s.' If that does not happen, it will mean the military can only buy the subs 'through the cannibalization of other military capability. So that is the challenge for us. And I don't think either side of the body politic in Australia has really come to terms with that.' The question of whether AUKUS will eat up other programs for the Australian defense community has been an open one ever since the project, the most expensive endeavor in the country's history, was launched. Officials have largely towed the line that the Lucky Country can do everything. For instance, Richard Vagg, the service’s head of Land Capability, told Breaking Defense in October that he was not concerned about losing out to AUKUS, noting 'we’ve made some very, very considered decisions about our investment plans from a ADF perspective, and are quite comfortable where we’re sitting in terms of our land projects.' However, there may be signs of budget pressure emerging already. Earlier this month, Australia killed a $5.3 billion AUD satellite contract with Lockheed Martin, with one analyst saying more cuts will likely have to happen as the true cost of AUKUS emerges. The current government in Canberra has pledged to increase defense spending by $50.3 billion over the next decade, with the plan being to hit $100 billion by 2033. That would put the country at 2.4 percent — well below what Houston believes is needed. Earlier in the conference, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, who won't have a government job after Jan. 20, urged the incoming Trump administration to work closely with Australia and New Zealand to counter a 'relentless' China and not to turn inward. 'China is relentless. They want to build bases. They want to extend their power there. We are going to have to do more, and do more with Australia and New Zealand,' he told the conference on a feed from Washington. 'This is a time right now to be innovative, to be optimistic, to work, to make the argument about why common purpose is in our best interests, and why the United States should not withdraw from the world, from partnerships, to work more closely than ever with Indo-Pacific partners. Nowhere is that more important than Australia.' RELATED: AUKUS faces little threat from Trump, Aussie officials say Campbell made a direct appeal to the presumptive Secretary of State in the Trump administration, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Trump has talked about large cuts to the State Department and other parts of the US foreign policy structure and his public rhetoric is about America First, which could mean ignoring or withdrawing from engagement in the Indo-Pacific. 'My hope is that Senator Rubio, the Trump administration, will recognize that this is a moment of acute strategic competition,' the deputy said. A range of speakers from Japan, the United States and Australia said at the conference they thought the Trump White House would support AUKUS, citing the incoming president's penchant for transactional diplomacy. Australia is spending billions to buy and build nuclear-powered attack boats, is helping the US expand its industrial base and Trump is likely to recognize that, they said. Unlike some NATO countries, which Trump has criticized for spending too little, Australia has committed more than $6 billion USD to expanding the tripartite sub industrial base and plans to spend a total of $368 billion on Virginia- and SSN AUKUS-class subs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/former-top-aussie-general-warns-aukus-will-cannibalize-other-programs-with-no-defense-boost/	2024-11-20T12:47:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/angus-houston-scaled-e1732110317443.jpg
Turkey joins drone-carrier operations club with first takeoff and landing from Turkish ship	Bayraktar TB3 prepares to take off from Turkish ship TCG Anadolu. (Photo credit: Baykar) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Baykar's unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) Bayraktar TB3 performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu, a short runway vessel, the firm said Tuesday in a statement. 'The flight, conducted at the convergence of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, lasted for 46 minutes before the aircraft successfully landed back on the same short runway, without the need for any landing support equipment,' Baykar said in the statement. Bayraktar TB3 performed the test on Nov. 19 after completing open-sea shipboard trials. The drone had completed its maiden flight from land in October 2023, and Tuesday it became the first Turkish UAV to be deployed from the drone carrier TCG Anadolu. The vessel is expected to also host Bayraktar TB3 and Kizilelma drones. Bayraktar TB3 PT1 and PT2 UCAVs underwent flight trainings from the company’s Flight Training and Test Center in Edirne to Dalaman Air Base Command. Bayraktar TB3 PT1 was deployed in flights during day and night on TCG Anadolu and 'successfully complet[ed] Approach Tests without any issues,' according to the statement. Though the company hailed the takeoff and landing as a world first from a short-runway ship, other drones have executed flights from maritime vessels before, including US drone-maker General Atomics's Mojave, which conducted a short takeoff and landing from the UK Royal Navy's HMS Prince of Wales a year ago this month. Bakyar did not respond to a request for additional comment by press time. Either way, the demonstration shows the continued interest of the world's navies in carrier-drone operations. Beyond the Mojave tests, the US Navy is pushing ahead with carrier-based drone control rooms. In May reports emerged that China may have constructed a relatively small carrier specifically designed for drone operations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/turkey-joins-drone-carrier-operations-club-with-first-takeoff-and-landing-from-turkish-ship/	2024-11-20T11:45:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Bayraktar_TB3_TCG_Anadolu_Take_off_and_Land_on-8-scaled-e1732123005228.jpg
INDOPACOM’s Paparo acknowledges stockpile shortages may impact his readiness	Adm. Samuel Paparo receives a tour of the ballistic missile submarine USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN 730) during a tour of Naval Base Kitsap (NBK)-Bangor, Wash. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Brian G. Reynolds) WASHINGTON — As the American weapons packages for Ukraine and Israel have started to include increasingly more complicated systems, the commander of US Indo-Pacific Command conceded finite munitions stockpiles could mean American assistance heading elsewhere around the world will impact the readiness of his own forces. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-ranged weapons, I had said not at all,' Adm. Samuel Paparo told an audience at the Brookings Institute yesterday when asked about the issue. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it’s now eating into stocks … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he continued. As commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, Paparo is the most senior American military officer who is tasked on a daily basis with managing aggression from China as well as aiding in diplomatic efforts with other key US allies and partners in the region. He went on to say that the United States’s stockpiles are 'fungible' across all the possible military theaters they may be used in. Additionally he said his area of responsibility, however important it may be given the Pentagon’s rhetoric, has nothing 'reserved.' RELATED: &#8216;Up our game': The Pentagon's 3 strategies to shore up munitions stockpiles 'Inherently, it imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because [China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' he said. When asked if he agrees with Paparo's assessment, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said today he had not seen the admiral's comments but 'every time we do a presidential drawdown, we take things that we have in our stocks, provide them to the country in need, and there's been a significant need, and then we replace those items with new items and better items. And those munitions and those weapons are built in the United States of America.' 'That creates jobs,' he continued. 'It puts us in a better position militarily &#8230; but it takes a little time and we recognize that. So we work with industry to expand capacity in our industrial base and that's happening. In many cases industry has is rising to meet the demand, meet the challenge, and we're going to continue to do that.' The admission, though reserved, is significant coming from someone as senior as Paparo. The notion that America’s aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia is hampering the country’s ability to respond to China and potentially assist Taiwan has gained an audience in certain sectors of the GOP. Those criticisms intensified last October as it became clear the US would also divert some of its munitions — as well as key assets like capital warships — to the Middle East to help defend Israel. When called to testify in front of lawmakers, senior military officials from across the services have acknowledged the packages to Ukraine and Israel have made a noticeable dent in the stockpiles held for US forces. But at a policy level, the Biden administration has made assisting Ukraine a top priority and staved off suggestions that the US must choose between helping Ukraine or preparing to counter China. That could soon change. Some of Trump’s allies in the GOP have been the most vocal in their criticisms against continuing to send weapons to Ukraine, and with Republicans controlling both the White House and the two chambers of Congress, continued support to Ukraine is anything but assured. When pressed about whether Taiwan should be 'concerned' about US stockpiles and the effect multiple global conflicts are having on them, Paparo said, 'When you say concerned — should it keep them up at night? 'We should replenish those stocks,' he continued. 'I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth. I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/indopacoms-paparo-acknowledges-stockpile-shortages-may-impact-his-readiness/	2024-11-20T11:08:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240214_DVIDS_paparo_sub_7263379-scaled-e1707925090340.jpg
Nets, jamming and ‘cyber scalpels’: Pentagon weighs homeland counter-drone tech in mountain tests	Fortem's DroneHunter floats to the ground as a captured sUAS hangs in a net underneath. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) FORT CARSON, Colo. — Hovering hundreds of yards away, the small quadcopter drone was nearly invisible to the naked eye, but its size didn’t make it any less of a potential threat to operations on the ground here. Spotted by sensors, defending personnel dispatched their own drone — this one armed with a net. A few minutes later, in the Colorado air, the friendly drone snagged the interloper, popped a parachute and both floated harmlessly to the ground. The incident, this time, was not a real threat but a demonstration, part of a series put on by US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) to explore ways to counter small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), an increasingly ubiquitous presence not only on the battlefields of Ukraine and the Middle East but lurking around American bases back home. The Pentagon has documented hundreds of suspected drone incursions at military facilities in the last few years, even if many are thought to be the work of hobbyists. Nets were just one tactic on display during this two-week exercise in October called Falcon Peak, which was limited to non- and low-kinetic mitigation techniques to stop small unmanned aircraft systems, or sUAS. On this Army base here, defense industry firms brought kit tailored to defeat the drones in scenarios where military officials emphasize their options are limited by regulations that protect civilian travel, largely preventing them from using many commonly available but more aggressive kinetic and non-kinetic tools. 'By all indications, sUAS will present a safety and security risk to military installations and other critical infrastructure for the foreseeable future. Mitigating those risks requires a dedicated effort across all federal departments and agencies, state, local, tribal and territorial communities, and Congress to further develop the capabilities, coordination and legal authorities necessary for detecting, tracking and addressing potential sUAS threats in the homeland,' said NORTHCOM chief Gen. Gregory Guillot. According to a handout from NORTHCOM, representatives at Falcon Peak from industry included Leidos, Teledyne FLIR, Trakka Systems, D-Fend solutions, HGH USA, Fortem Technologies, and ICR. A handful of fielded DoD systems were also brought along. According to a spokesperson for NORTHCOM, 'Every participant' in the exercise, whether industry or DoD, 'had to detect, track [and] identify sUAS.' Only 'some' participants 'had the additional ability to mitigate/interdict' a drone threat. The vendors set up along a strip of road here near the foothills of Cheyenne Mountain, in an area of Fort Carson called Agony Hill, displaying their systems in demos throughout the Falcon Peak event. During the actual trials, the counter-drone systems were set up along a simulated perimeter of a base and were tasked with tracking and in some cases taking out adversary systems flown by a 'red' team, however they could. In countering drone incursions, the first step is knowing that it’s happening at all, and that’s where cutting-edge sensing technology, calibrated to spot small drones, comes in. 'I'm pretty confident in our ability to detect and track' mid-size and large drones, Guillot said in a roundtable with reporters ahead of the visit to Fort Carson. 'The purpose of this demonstration is to improve our ability to detect and track' small UAS, he added. For Falcon Peak, Teledyne FLIR brought along its Cerberus XL system, dragged straight from its debut at the AUSA expo in Washington. The Cerberus XL fuses radar, electro-optical/infrared and radio frequency (RF) sensors to detect and track drones, according to a press release from the company. That data can then be fed to different third-party effectors to defeat the drones — in the case of another demonstration, connecting to jammers aimed at taking down offending drones’ datalinks and denying them access to global navigation systems, according to the handout from NORTHCOM. (Breaking Defense did not view it in action.) Steve Pedrotty, Teledyne FLIR’s director of US Air Force programs, said in an interview on the sidelines of Falcon Peak that the event was a great opportunity, though he hoped to see the government firm up requirements. 'It's still kind of early in this cycle' of rapidly changing drone and counter-drone technologies, Pedrotty said. 'So honing in on the requirements would help.' Falcon Peak wasn’t just an opportunity for industry to see if their tech was up to snuff; the event was also a chance for existing DoD systems to make improvements. According to NORTHCOM’s handout, the SUADS — an apparent reference to the small uncrewed aircraft defense system — was among those in attendance, which the handout says uses electro-optical/infrared sensors to sense drones. 'Before you can shoot something, you have to see it,' Jason Mayes, counter-small unmanned aerial systems deputy test director for NORTHCOM, told reporters. 'So that's why we want to present profiles that those systems have never seen before, and see if we could, from a detection standpoint, beat those systems so that now the services understand you do really good up to this point, but they're not there yet,' he continued. 'So even on that side of the house, they have some homework to go do.' A small drone flies over a bus for distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) Once the drone is spotted, there are myriad ways to try and take it down — even before getting into options like shooting the things out of the sky, which current policy mostly prohibits on US soil. On the non-kinetic side, there’s cyber and electronic warfare: either hacking the drone to disable it or take it over, or jamming or spoofing its communications or navigation signals to render it 'lost' mid-operation. (Tactics like navigation disruption had to be closely coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration at Falcon Peak, as any disruption to civilian travel could spell danger to the general public.) One example outlined at Falcon Peak was ICR’s 'system of systems' called TMX and a specific cyber tool crafted by the company called Bullet. According to Mike Powell, executive director of counter-UAS at the company, Bullet works like a 'cyber scalpel RF system' that exploits the downlink of an adversary device to take it over. 'There's no footprint. You're not going to see it. It is a tiny signal that is only pointed at one drone at a time,' he said. 'We can do drones every second. So in 30 seconds, I can control a small swarm of drones with this system' and force them to land at a designated area, return to where they were launched from or force them straight down to earth by turning off rotors. (The Bullet tech was not demonstrated during Breaking Defense’s visit.) Even then, Powell acknowledged challenges to Bullet’s tactics in light of ever-evolving drone tech. For example, as intense signal interference has dominated the war in Ukraine, drones belonging to both sides have often had trouble reaching their targets. And now, newer systems are on the rise that can offer more resistance to interference, like drones that follow onboard maps rather than GPS to find their targets. That approach, in turn, makes hijacking drones electronically that much harder, if not impossible. A good radar is needed to sense those threats especially because they don’t emit detectable transmissions, Powell stressed, and a different effector is required to take the drone down. 'There's no RF signature. There's nothing to break into,' Powell said. 'That's the hardest problem.' Breaking Defense did not witness any electronic warfare or cyber techniques at the Falcon Peak demo, and a spokesperson for NORTHCOM said although the tactics were used over the course of the event, the 'specific number, type, and system is classified.' In the low-kinetic realm, there was Fortem Technologies’s DroneHunter, the one armed with a net referenced at the start of this report. In that demo witnessed by Breaking Defense and other media outlets, the system appeared to successfully demonstrate a non-intrusive, low-collateral way to bring down an sUAS threat with little threat to anyone else in the area. Spencer Prows, executive vice president of solutions engineering at Fortem, explained that the DroneHunter can integrate with other systems or work standalone with the company’s equipment, boasting a towing capacity of about five kilograms. If the intercepted airframe is small enough, DroneHunter can drag its captured quarry back to base, or, as Breaking Defense witnessed, simply bring it straight down to the ground with a parachute if it’s too heavy. Leidos’s AirShield also played a part in the demo, featuring a spindle-shaped drone effector called the Co-axial Unmanned Guided Autonomous Rotorcraft (CUGAR). It’s designed to take down sUAS by blanketing them with streamers, like ones you’d see at a gender reveal party. But the streamers were never launched in the demo Breaking Defense viewed, as Mayes, the event’s emcee, explained that a target drone was down for maintenance. Sometimes, it’s the enemy’s equipment that fails. Capabilities like net capture and streamers do hold promise for defeating sUAS along the lines of hobbyist systems, said Mayes. But the technology is challenged by faster and more agile drones like first-person view (FPV) systems gaining traction in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 'They do very, very good with that, because the profiles are fairly steady,' Mayes said of their ability to deal with slower, hobbyist-type drones. 'Once you start getting into some of the faster [UAS], like your FPV drones, these racing ones that are 150 to 200 miles an hour, or drones that have been outfitted to be very agile, the systems themselves are not able to keep up with that because of the agility of the other [drones].' Leidos's CUGAR effector hovers above attendees at Falcon Peak. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) The military is pondering whether its options for taking out drones could expand with the right guardrails — potentially featuring weapons like lasers and microwaves — as it pushes for policy changes that can better accommodate the need to fight off small drones on American soil, a key intergovernmental effort that will be the subject of a future Breaking Defense report. But at the end of the day, beyond all the complexities of new tech, the counter-UAS problem broadly is a cultural one too. Branches like the Marine Corps have declared plans to equip every squad with the capability to defend themselves against UAS, for example, and any new tactics or technologies will require doctrinal changes — as well as buy-in from troops doing the work. 'It takes time to change doctrine and tactics and techniques and procedures. It takes time for culture and the climate to change,' Command Sgt. Maj. Demetrius Johnson, senior enlisted advisor to the Pentagon’s Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, told reporters when asked what the timeline for a new counter-drone culture might look like. 'It's still a relatively new threat. And the threat is evolving. Every time the threat evolves, we have to go back to the drawing board and change doctrine and change tactics,' he said. 'So it's going to be ongoing, and I can't see where there's an end anywhere in sight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/nets-jamming-and-cyber-scalpels-pentagon-weighs-homeland-counter-drone-tech-in-mountain-tests/	2024-11-20T10:52:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/fortem-net-capture-scaled-e1732126428452.jpg
UK makes sweeping defense cuts, doing away with several warships, scores of helicopters and drones	The UK has announced it will scrap a fleet of British Army Watchkeeper drones BELFAST — In a surprise announcement, the UK has said it will scrap five warships, 31 helicopters and a fleet of 46 intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) drones. The move, announced in parliament today by UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey, will generate savings of £500 million ($632 million) over the next five years, he said, and get rid of 'outdated capabilities.' But it also drew immediate criticism from opposition party lawmakers. The cuts are 'all backed' by service chiefs and were made in consultation with personnel involved in the UK's strategic defense review — set to release results of equipment planning and strategic thinking in mid-2025. 'Allies have been informed and we have constant dialogue with NATO,' added Healey. On the naval side, two amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, will be withdrawn from service at the end of the year. Healey suggested the vessels had been 'effectively retired by previous ministers, but superficially kept on the books,' at a cost of £9 million a year. The Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland will be axed because of 'structural damage that makes her simply uneconomical to repair,' he noted, alongside two Wave-Class tankers, 'neither of which has been to sea for years.' Elsewhere, the British Army’s Watchkeeper drone fleet will be retired, a fate that follows years of delays, cost overruns and a series of test and operational crashes. As of September 2022, the UK had spent £1.31 billion on the program, according to a lawmaker statement. Watchkeeper initially entered service in 2014, supporting Afghanistan force protection efforts, but has not been involved in military operations since. The aircraft was deployed in 2020 over the English channel in a surveillance capacity to monitor migrant boats. A total of 14 CH-47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters, including 'some' that have been in service for 35 years, will be retired, in parallel with 17 Puma multirole rotorcraft. The Pumas had been due to be replaced under the £1 billion New Medium Helicopter acquisition, but that plan was thrown into disarray in August after Lockheed Martin and Airbus walked away without submitting bids for the NMH, leaving Leonardo as the last competitor standing. Prior to Healey's Puma declaration, London's strategic defense review, set for release in mid-2025, was expected to determine if NMH moved ahead or not. The phasing out of older Chinooks is a different matter because they are set to be replaced with new H-47ER (Extended Range) platforms beginning in 2027. 'The UK is the only nation to be provided access to this class-leading heavy-lift helicopter capability outside of the US,' said Grant Shapps, former UK defence secretary, in March. Healey revealed that in all the new cuts 'are set to save the MoD £150 million over the next two years, and up to £500 million over five years, savings that will be retained in full in defense.' Reacting to the changes, Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense think tank, said in a statement, 'These are mostly capabilities that are approaching retirement anyway, have been at low levels of readiness or aren’t worth further refits or investment (Watchkeeper is probably obsolete).' 'But the fact that Defence either can’t crew them, or is prepared to cut them to make very modest savings over five years in the current international environment is an indication of just how tight resources must be in the MOD right now,' he added. 'In particular, the Defence Review will be under pressure to set out the future role of the Royal Marines; how the Navy will bring into service and sustain more escorts, which are the workhorses of the fleet; and the impact upon helicopter capacity and procurement.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/uk-makes-sweeping-defense-cuts-doing-away-with-several-warships-scores-of-helicopters-and-drones/	2024-11-20T09:14:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/APOLOND-OFFICIAL-20221017-114-013.jpg.iCfFhcbqMWATAA.EhYLNwi3LY-e1732120552526.jpg
DIU picks 7 companies to support Replicator autonomy, C2 efforts	AeroVironment’s Switchblade 600 bares its teeth at Sea Air Space. The loitering munition has gotten real-world practice during the Ukraine conflict, as a number of the weapons have been sent from the US to Kyiv. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has inked deals with seven software developers and tasked them with moving out with autonomy and command and control work, aimed at propelling the Replicator initiative forward. 'Many leading AI [artificial intelligence] and autonomy firms are outside of our traditional defense industrial base, and DIU is working actively with partners across the department to bring the very best capabilities from the US tech sector to bear in support of our most critical warfighter needs,' DIU Director Doug Beck said in today’s announcement. 'This latest step in the Replicator initiative is a critical example of that teamwork in action.' While DIU did not disclose contract values or the work timeline associated with those new C2 and autonomy deals, it did provide a few insights into the competition pool while also announcing the winners. In the category of Opportunistic, Resilient &amp; Innovative Expeditionary Network Topology (ORIENT), 119 companies submitted 130 solution proposals. From that pool, DIU selected Aalyria, Higher Ground, IoT/AI and Viasat for prototyping work. Meanwhile, the office’s call for help with Autonomous Collaborative Teaming (ACT), designed to better automate the coordination between hundreds or thousands of unmanned drones, sparked 132 companies to submit 165 solutions. DIU has now whittled that down to three, awarding prototyping deals to Anduril Industries, L3Harris Technologies and Swarm Aero. 'We are seeing the strength of the joint teams that assemble to collaborate on the challenges of deploying autonomous systems including policy, software architecture, experimentation, and more,' Pentagon AI chief Radha Plumb said in the press release. In August 2023, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks launched Replicator as an avenue for countering China’s military mass by cranking out multiple thousands of 'attritable autonomous systems' within two years — think unmanned surface vessels and loitering drones. Earlier this month, the Pentagon confirmed a host of details about the initiative including that the two drones selected for the Army’s Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft System program — Ghost X from Anduril Industries and the C-100 from Performance Drone Works – were also both under the Replicator-1, Tranche 2 umbrella. The Marine Corps’ Organic Precision Fires program, which revolves around Anduril’s Altius-600, has also been deemed a Replicator initiative, and is there to complement the Switchblade-600 loitering munition that was previously announced as part of Replicator. The Air Force’s Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV), a drone prototyping competition, is also joining the Replicator pack. In addition to work on Replicator 1, the department announced plans for a second Replicator initiative in September, this time focusing on finding systems to counter small drones at US military installations across the globe.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/diu-picks-7-companies-to-support-replicator-autonomy-c2-efforts/	2024-11-20T09:00:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230405_SAS_underwater_drone_Mehta_crop.png
F-35 EW system for the future fight	Image courtesy of BAE Systems. Lisa Aucoin is the vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems (ES) sector. With more than 35 years of experience in the aerospace and defense industry, she has held numerous positions in engineering and program management. Previously, she was vice president of Engineering for the ES sector, leading more than 5,000 engineers and technical support staff. She is a certified Six Sigma Black Belt and holds a master's degree in physics from Northeastern University, and a bachelor's degree in physics from Valparaiso University. Lisa is exceptionally passionate about developing our next generation of scientists and engineers and is actively involved with organizations that foster curiosity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects through active student participation. We sat down to interview Lisa about electromagnetic warfare, the F-35 program, and her leadership. You are the vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems. Can you describe your organization and its focus? Lisa Aucoin, vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems (ES) sector. As a key partner on the F-35 program, we hold a 13 to 15 percent workshare of each aircraft, excluding propulsion, and we play a major role across multiple markets. I specifically lead the company’s F-35 program in the U.S. that has more than 1,000 employees dedicated to providing the electromagnetic warfare (EW) system for the F-35. As the EW system provider for the fifth-generation fighter, a role we’ve held since the program’s inception in 2001, we deliver a system that helps protect U.S. and allied forces. For those unfamiliar with EW, simply put, it is the use of electromagnetic (EM) or directed energy and integrated cyber capabilities to carry out military and intelligence missions. The more rigorously a military force exploits the full EM spectrum –– radio waves, microwaves, millimeter waves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet light, and gamma rays – and cyber effects, the more successfully it can pre-empt adversarial threats and respond to attacks electronically. The system needs to detect threats and identify them, and give pilots the opportunity to evade or engage. These threats include other fighter jets, missiles, anti-aircraft systems, drones, and other adversary weapons systems. Everyday those threats are evolving, becoming more complex and harder to detect and counter as the electromagnetic spectrum grows more congested. Our F-35 team is busy designing, developing, manufacturing, testing and repairing advanced systems that protect warfighters and enable them to conduct missions in highly contested battlespaces. Our people are highly skilled in disciplines including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, software development, manufacturing, supply chain management, and program management. The program requires everyone to come together to deliver an exceptional technical system for integration into one of the most sophisticated fighter jets ever flown. The AN/ASQ-239, the F-35 EW system, can detect a broad spectrum of electromagnetic signals in a 360-degree sphere around the aircraft at long range. This is done passively without emitting energy, making the F-35 less observable to adversaries. The systems’ 'staring' sensors are embedded throughout the aircraft, providing immediate detection of electromagnetic signals, giving pilots critical situational awareness, and allowing them to act first. By delivering long-range, all-aspect (360-degree) broad-spectrum EW capabilities, the system also increases the probability of signal intercept. BAE Systems has a long history in EW, how does the F-35 system fit into that portfolio? Our EW history goes back more than 60 years and our systems have flown on over 120 platforms. They operate on 80 percent of U.S. military fixed-wing aircraft, over 95 percent of U.S. Army rotary-wing aircraft, and those of U.S. allies. The F-35 EW system is a key part of our extensive EW portfolio that includes protecting fighter aircrafts like the F-15, F-16, and the F-22 platforms. What is the current status of the F-35 program and the EW system? To date, 1,600 F-35s have been delivered around the world. Each aircraft is equipped with our integrated EW system. The F-35 is expected to stay in service until 2070 and was designed for continual upgrades to help it outpace emerging threats throughout its six-decade service life. Recently, the F-35 platform achieved a significant milestone – it was cleared to enter full-rate production. As part of a broader strategy focused on whole-life mission effectiveness, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) entrusted BAE Systems to design and manufacture the next-generation 'Block 4' version of the system. The powerful Block 4 EW system will offer greater situational awareness, enhanced survivability, and increased capabilities to counter evolving threats. As an upgradeable system, Block 4 will combine adaptable hardware and incremental software updates to accelerate the delivery of advanced EW capabilities to warfighters. This will also reduce engineering and sustainment costs for the U.S. DoD and its allies. Block 4 systems will include significantly advanced hardware and software that improve sensing and signal-processing capabilities. New, high-performance sensors will boost the system’s ability to detect more difficult-to-observe threats. It will help warfighters execute missions today and into the future. What does success look like for you? There are two primary ways we measure success – technology and operational milestones. These are driven by evolving mission requirements and the need to innovate. Both types are important, but at the end of the day, it is about people –– our customers and our end-users. Protecting the warfighter is our north star. It really is what drives us. None of this would be possible without our people. We employ the best and brightest and we ask them to do very hard things. We talked about our long history in EW, but looking forward, a platform like the F-35 is expected to fly for 60 years. So, to achieve this, it is about culture. We have always focused on our current workforce, but we know culture is a long-term strategy. In many ways a focus on the future helps to drive today’s success. For example, the F-35 EW system was developed with the future in mind. Designed to be adaptable and upgradeable, it will be able to keep up with threats that haven’t been developed yet. It’s not a moment-in-time system, it is designed for the future fight, wherever that future leads. You mention preparing for the future, how do you build your workforce for the future? Internally, we have several leadership development programs for employees. Looking further into the future, we support STEM initiatives like FIRST® Robotics. BAE Systems has supported FIRST for 30 years –– working together to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM. The company provides funding to FIRST teams near ES sites nationwide, helps with robotics and coding grants for Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, and funds an annual college scholarship program for FIRST students. We value this partnership because we believe FIRST is building the next generation of innovators. Another element of building our future workforce is identifying and creating non-traditional entries into industry. One success story is our long-running Microelectronics Boot Camp program with Nashua Community College. The Microelectronics Boot Camp is a 10-week hands-on career training that was developed in partnership with BAE Systems in 2016 to prepare students for entry-level careers in wire/ribbon bonding and die attach for microelectronic components in manufacturing. The program recently celebrated its 30th cohort graduating class and has now graduated over 300 students with a 98 percent job placement rate –– with BAE Systems having hired more than half of these graduates. Final thoughts? Today’s F-35 system was built on the shoulders of giants. The technology leverages decades of innovation, lessons learned, and techniques and procedures cultivated over generations of an entire F-35 ecosystem and community. Past employees influenced those working on the program today and we are cultivating the workforce of tomorrow to assure that we continue to serve our warfighters for generations to come. At the end of the day, it is the history, the ecosystem, the focus on people and the future that drive me every day to come to work knowing I’m helping to safeguard generations of warfighters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/f-35-ew-system-for-the-future-fight/	2024-11-20T07:42:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/BAE-F-35-600x300-2.png
Why Germany’s Scholz won’t follow Biden on long-range strikes for Ukraine	Members of the German Armed Forces Bundeswehr carry a 'Taurus' weapon system during the International Aerospace Exhibition (ILA) in Schoenefeld on May 30, 2016. (TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) BELFAST — In the wake of the US government approving Ukraine to use Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to bow to new calls to supply Kyiv with desperately needed Taurus long-range precision missiles. The Swedish-German ballistic missile offers a range in excess of 500 kilometers and is designed to hit hardened targets like bunkers, bridges, and command and control facilities. Germany completed an order of 600 units for integration on Tornado IDS (Interdiction/Strike) fighter jets in 2010. Scholz publicly justified the decision not to make a Taurus approval on Monday at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, saying that he did not want to be held 'responsible' for the weapons 'targeting,' — a reference to his long stated redline that Taurus should not draw Germany into the war. Ukraine has reportedly since fired ATACMS to strike into Russia for the first time. Ukrainian officials said an initial salvo targeted an ammunition depot in the Bryansk region of southwestern Russia, according to the New York Times. Analysts Breaking Defense spoke with suggested that Scholz's position on Taurus effectively amounts to an attempt to protect his political career and argued that he has limited clout over Russia more broadly. If he was to change course, it would be 'deeply unpopular' with the left-leaning faction of the Social Democratic Party — to the extent that Scholz could 'say goodbye' to any chance of the SDP considering him for the chancellorship again, ahead of a new general election planned for February, according to Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert at the University of Oslo in Norway. The election was prompted by the Free Democratic Party leaving the coalition government, which is also made up of the SDP and the Greens. Speaking before Scholz's G20 press conference, Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense think tank, said, 'If Scholz could be moved, I suspect he would have done so by now — he was extremely negative about Taurus over the weekend, and although the Russian strikes almost immediately after his call with Putin show how little influence he has, it doesn’t look likely that he would respond by changing policy now.' Even if approved, Taurus would face problems reaching the frontline in Ukraine in a timely fashion. In February, a conversation about potential deliveries to Ukraine by German Air Force officials was intercepted by Russia and shared online by state broadcaster RT. The leak included the suggestion that Taurus operations could only begin eight months after political approval, based on training and mounts needed to integrate it on fighter jets. 'Taurus would require a new round of integration and validation work before they could be launched by Ukrainian aircraft (most likely the UAF’s relatively small number of Su-24 strike planes, which already carry Storm Shadow),' said Jacob Parakilas, research leader for defense strategy, policy and capabilities at RAND Europe. 'It might be easier to integrate onto the UAF’s newly-arrived F-16s, which have NATO-standard mounts and connectors, although Taurus is not currently certified for F-16 carriage and launch either — so it would be a matter of months before they could be used in either case.' The UK and France are expected to follow the lead of the US on ATACMS and approve Ukraine to launch Storm Shadow and SCALP long-range cruise missiles inside Russian territory. French newspaper Le Figaro reported that approvals by Paris and London had been given but later edited the story to clarify that debates are still ongoing. A spokesperson for the French President's Office declined to comment on specific weapon systems, deferring to an address by French President Emmanuel Macron during a state visit to Germany in May where he stated that, 'we must allow them [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked, but we must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia, obviously civilian capabilities or other military targets.' Macron added at that time, 'When Ukraine is attacked from identified targets in Russia, well, I think we have to be able to allow them to do that if we really want to retain our objective. And I think I can say that, factually, we are not escalating by doing this, since it is Russia that is organising itself in this way.' In the case of the UK and Storm Shadow, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment on whether an approval for Ukraine had been made. Earlier this week, UK Defence Secretary John Healey told another lawmaker that commenting on the issue 'risks operational security and the only person that benefits from public debate is President Putin,' according to the BBC. From a 'Ukrainian perspective it would be preferable for this [approvals on Storm Shadow and SCALP] to take place privately and not be announced until after first use, though the Russians already have some advance warning,' said Savill.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/why-germanys-scholz-wont-follow-biden-on-long-range-strikes-for-ukraine/	2024-11-20T06:44:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_taurus_missile_germany_GettyImages-535764452-scaled-e1709243670892.jpg
Putin’s new nuclear doctrine: It’s my arsenal and I’ll strike if I want to	In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin meets with Yevgeny Balitsky (not pictured), the Moscow-installed head of the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, at the Kremlin in Moscow on November 18, 2024. (Photo by VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Russian President Vladimir Putin signed Russia's new nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19, just days after US President Joe Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with US-made weapons. The timing of its publication surely is intended to send a message of displeasure to the West about this decision — as well as a larger anger around Western support for Ukraine in general. It also comes in the context of talks among the P5 — the nuclear weapon states defined in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: the US, UK, France, Russia, and China — that were scheduled earlier to discuss nuclear doctrine, but delayed by Russia and now back on the calendar. However, the contents of the document should not shock those paying attention. In truth, the changes contained in the doctrine are consistent with longer-term shifts in Russian public messaging about its nuclear deterrent, practical changes in Russia’s threat environment, as well as its own capabilities and confidence in those capabilities. In fact, the 2024 doctrine is likely closer to Russia’s actual nuclear doctrine, which is that Russia will use nuclear weapons whenever Putin thinks it necessary to do so. Public-facing, unclassified nuclear doctrine documents are a product of the post-Cold War thaw in relations, with the US publishing its first Nuclear Posture Review in 1994. Russia’s military was in a state of collapse at the time, with concern in Moscow that the United States might intervene in Russia’s bloody Chechen wars or in Iraq (twice) and Yugoslavia, or worse, overthrow the regime in Moscow. While Russia did not release an unclassified version of its nuclear doctrine during the 1990s, its leadership engaged in very public nuclear messaging, culminating with simulated nuclear strikes against NATO at the end of its ZAPAD 1999 exercise and a public discussion on a very-low Russian nuclear threshold. However, Russia’s nuclear threats were increasingly at odds with its position in the United Nations — particularly in the dialogue around the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — which has led to confusion about what, exactly, their doctrine allowed or precluded in terms of actual nuclear use. Finally, in 2020, Russia released its first public nuclear doctrine document, which appeared to have a very high threshold for nuclear use — with nuclear weapons used 'exclusively as a means of deterrence, their use being an extreme and compelled measure.' There are mentions of nuclear weapons in other official documents — such as Russia’s official Military Doctrine (current version: 2014), but they have a similarly high threshold. Such a high perceived threshold for nuclear use is not consistent with Russia’s nuclear posture — which includes nuclear weapons designed for warfighting — and became a direct impediment in President Vladimir Putin’s threats against the US and NATO for their support of Ukraine. Thus, something had to change. Russia’s new Nuclear Doctrine was published on the Kremlin website as Decree 991, 'On the Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence,' replacing the previous version — Decree 355 of 2 June 2020. As with all things, the devil is in the details. And, because bureaucrats are bureaucrats (that is, naturally lazy), a side-by-side comparison of the 2020 and 2024 documents is the best way to highlight and analyze the changes. So, what's different? Structurally, it's almost identical, with a few minor deletions alongside some highly-significant new language intended to make Russian threats more credible against its adversaries — particularly NATO and the United States. It is still about six pages, with 26 paragraphs (versus 25 in the old one) and a number of sub paragraphs, organized around four sections: Informed from 1,000 days of conflict in Ukraine and the world’s response, Russia’s new doctrine first and foremost seeks to lower the threshold for nuclear weapons use. The new doctrine accomplishes this by removing the word 'exclusively' for the use of nuclear weapons (new doctrine paragraph 6: 'The Russian Federation considers nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence, the use of which is an extreme and necessary measure'). It also replaces the threshold for use against actions that threaten the existence or viability of the state to include actions that pose a critical threat to Russian or Belarusian sovereignty or territorial integrity (new doctrine paragraphs 18 and 19.d, 2020 doctrine paragraph 17) including conventional attacks — a far more subjective judgement, leaving open nuclear use in far more abstract threat scenarios. Then, in Sections 2 and 3, Russia’s new doctrine expands who it is seeking to deter with nuclear weapons, under what conditions it would use nuclear weapons, and who it is defending under its nuclear umbrella. Section 2 expands the 'who it is seeking to deter' by adding not just nuclear weapon states (e.g., the US) or states in military blocs (new paragraph 10 in the 2024 doctrine) allied with nuclear weapon states (i.e., NATO) to include states that enable attacks on Russian territory from their borders and states that have significant conventional capabilities allied with nuclear weapon states (paragraph 11) or not allied with a nuclear weapon state (paragraph 9). In plainer terms, this now gives Russia the doctrine that any nation aligned with a nuclear state, or any state receiving assistance from any nuclear state or state aligned with a nuclear state — i.e., all of NATO — can be the target of nuclear weapons if Russia feels threatened. Section 3 expands the part about 'what conditions it would use nuclear weapons' significantly, to include not only launch on warning of ballistic missile attack (old doctrine paragraph 19 a), but a new formulation aimed towards a more comprehensive program of Launch on Warning: 'receipt of reliable information on the massive launch (take-off) of aerospace attack weapons (strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, unmanned, hypersonic and other aircraft) and their crossing of the state border of the Russian Federation' (new paragraph 19 e). Further on conditions for nuclear use, Russia’s nuclear doctrine lists dangers that might become threats that would require nuclear use. The old and the new doctrine both list the possession of WMD by adversaries, expansion of and deployment of missile defenses, buildups of conventional forces, nuclear weapons in outer space, nuclear weapons stationed on the territory of non-nuclear weapon states, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (the old doctrine highlighted the threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons only, the new doctrine expands this to all WMD). But the new doctrine adds new or expanded blocs of countries allied against Russia with military infrastructure nearby (15.f), the threat of blockades of Russia (15.g), the threat of damaging facilities that could cause widespread environmental damage (15.h) and the planning or conduct of exercises near Russia's borders (15.i). I guess Russia will try to deter what it does best? Finally, Section 3 expands 'who it is defending' with nuclear deterrence to include not just Russia and its allies (as in the 2020 doctrine), but specifically Belarus, and Belarus as part of the Union State (additions to paragraphs 18 and 19d), and to use nuclear deterrence Russian military forces outside its territory (new paragraph 19.b). The remaining changes are consistent with recent developments, including central control by Russia of its nuclear forces based abroad (read: Belarus), and it eliminates any reference to compliance with arms control — a bad sign for the future of New START, scheduled to end Feb. 4, 2026. In all, the new doctrine says that Russia will use nuclear weapons whenever the president decides to do so. It also contains a laundry list of things it doesn't like, in an effort to try to shape Western behavior. But by expanding the role of nuclear weapons beyond 'exclusively' deterrence, and by expanding the dangers that could become threats — to include military infrastructure or exercises near its borders — it risks sending ambiguous or non-credible deterrent signals that could, in turn, require Putin to act out further in order to credibly deter the West. It remains to be seen if President-elect Donald Trump will seek to stabilize the relationship with Russia, seek new arms control arrangements with Russia and China, acquiesce to Russian demands over things like Ukraine or NATO, or move in other unexpected directions. Regardless, in the interim, we can expect more threats from Moscow on the basis of a doctrinal document that is interesting but remains firmly in the world of propaganda rather than military doctrine.

Navy needs industry all in on 3D printing parts for subs, or else	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (US Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Leading Navy admirals and officials now see additive manufacturing as a potential savior of the overstretched submarine force and its 'exceptionally fragile' industrial base. But they need industry to get on board, ASAP. 3D printers are already churning out an ever-larger array of ever-larger parts, from simple plastic safety covers, to high-end specialty valves, to robust metal structures weighing a ton and a half. And while many companies are embracing the new approach, the service’s program executive officer for attack submarines (PEO-SSN) had stern words for the laggards. 'If you are a supplier, and your lead time is too long, and you refuse to work with us to give us your tech and help us figure out how to reverse-engineer it and how to manufacture it — not that we’re trying to take it from you — [but] we're going to figure it out,' said Rear Adm. Jonathan Rucker, the PEO-SSN. '[That’s] not a threat — [it’s] a fact of life. 'We're going to figure out how to get these parts quicker,' he told a ballroom full of contractors at last week’s Naval Submarine League conference. 'We need your help. We don’t have a choice. Time is not on our side.' Rucker reassured industry that 'we’re not trying to steal anyone’s IP [intellectual property].' He made a point to praise what he said were a large number of small businesses that were 'already … leaning forward [and] helping us in additive manufacturing.' 'All of us can benefit together,' he exhorted the conference. 'For all small businesses, I implore you to be part of the team with us.' The military has 3D printed small numbers of small, non-critical plastic parts for years, like safety covers for switches and connectors for LAN cables. But aerospace and defense firms are increasingly able to print large, high-strength metal components. Up until this year, the Navy had only installed two 3D-printed metal parts on its submarines, said Vice Adm. Robert Gaucher, commander of Naval Submarine Forces. But this year, he told the conference, they quadrupled that to eight — and when USS Michigan comes in for overhaul next year, 'we plan to have 33.' 'Delivering these parts will be faster than traditional casting, so we can mitigate our supply chain shortfalls,' Gaucher emphasized. 'Where I really want to press forward with metal data manufacturing is at our regional maintenance centers.' But in the longer term, 3D-printed metal parts can speed up construction of new submarines as well, said Matt Sermon, executive director of PEO-Strategic Submarine. 'Metallic additive manufacturing … it’s our Manhattan Project,' Sermon told the conference. It’s a 'national security imperative,' he said, along with increasing use of automation, robotics and other advanced manufacturing technologies to overhaul an ailing industrial base. The stakes are existential for a submarine force that is struggling to simultaneously maintain an overworked and aging fleet, build the upgunned and upgraded version of the Virginia-class attack sub fast enough to meet both US and Australian demand, and launch the first Columbia-class nuclear ballistic missile boat by 2027. 'We have a huge hole to dig out of,' said Adm. Bill Houston, director of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion program. 'We’ve let too much of the shipbuilding industry go away [because] we essentially stopped building submarines for about seven years' after the Soviet Union fell. The Navy is still paying for that decision today, he told the conference, rushing to ramp up production of new boats and improve maintenance of old ones 'with an industrial base that’s less than half the size' it was during the Cold War. 'It’s an exceptionally fragile supply base,' Houston said. That said, in recent years, the service and industry have had some success in reconstructing old-school heavy-metal industrial capabilities, such as the casting of hundred-ton hull sections. 'Castings [were] the bane of our existence when I talked to you two years ago,' Rucker told reporters at the conference. 'That chokepoint’s gone.' A big part of that breakthrough has been the United Kingdom, Rucker said: Whereas the Navy used to have just one vendor it deemed qualified for certain crucial, large-scale castings, 'we now have four' — two of them British. These four companies use conventional casting techniques, not additive manufacturing, which has historically been restricted to much smaller parts. But 3D printing has potential to speed up production of even heavy-metal, high-strength components. The traditional process 'takes years of machining' to smooth out the massive castings and remove the inevitable imperfections left by the traditional process, before they can be installed on a sub or ship, Sermon told Breaking Defense. By contrast, he said, 'as additive manufacturing matures &#8230; we believe we can print those [parts] with better quality,' saving time and expensive skilled labor. Sermon’s team has already 3D printed a 3,300-pound (1.65 ton) metal part and is beginning tests to ensure it’s up to standard, he told Breaking Defense. For the future, they are studying additive manufacturing of the kind of massive hull sections that currently can only be produced by casting. 'I see a world, not science fiction … but in the relatively near term, where we’ll be able to print submarine hull and ship modules,' he said. America’s AUKUS allies, Australia and the United Kingdom, need to be a part of this additive manufacturing revolution, Sermon added. 'We want to do it with our partners,' he said. 'We absolutely want their industrial base [using] a 2030s model … not a 1970s industrial base.' An Australian additive manufacturing firm, AML3D, joined the US Navy’s R&amp;D efforts last year, Sermon told reporters at the time. The firm’s work for the US is moving ahead, Rucker told reporters last week: Just before he came to the Submarine League conference, he said, he got an email asking for his formal approval on one of their engineering drawings.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-needs-industry-all-in-on-3d-printing-parts-for-subs-or-else/	2024-11-19T13:11:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8630521-e1732050099734.jpg
Morocco exempts defense firms from taxes, eyeing national and international investments	A Royal Moroccan Air Force CH-47 Chinook military helicopter takes off near the medical-surgical field hospital deployed in Akka municipality, province of Tata, Morocco during Moroccan-US military manoeuvres, as part of the Africa Command's largest joint annual exercise 'African Lion 2024,' on May 29, 2024. (Photo by FADEL SENNA/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Moroccan government has approved a proposed 2025 budget that exempts defense firms from taxes, in what's seen as an attempt to boost military production and encourage foreign and national defense producers to invest in the kingdom. 'This draft decree aims to enable the manufacturers of defense and security equipment, weapons and ammunition to secure a temporary exemption from corporate tax,' government spokesperson Mustapha Baitas said on Friday. The budget proposal is reportedly expected to increase the defense budget slightly from $124 billion MAD ($12.4 billion USD) in 2024 to $133 billion MAD ($13.32 billion USD) in 2025. RELATED: In North Africa, a fighter jet arms race, with Russia and the US on either side Moroccan defense expert Abdel Hamid Harfi told Breakiing Defense that the tax exemption comes as the North African nation is aiming to boost its reputation as an incubator for military industries. That, in turn, 'creates added value and benefit from Morocco’s international relations and partnerships as a good platform for export-oriented industrial investment, and within the framework of granting military industries the same privileges granted to civilian industries such as automobile industries and others,' he said. Harfi said that the income tax exemption is not the first for defense firms, as the Moroccan government approved a few months ago a complete exemption from value-added tax for a specific number of years. Taken together, 'these privileges would enhance the appeal of the emerging sector for foreign and local investors wishing to invest in this sector in the Kingdom,' Harfi said. In addition to the tax breaks, Harfi noted that Morocco has established 'two industrial zones that are scheduled to host military industrial units, where the construction of a number of factories has actually begun.' Senior advisor at Gulf State Analytics Theodore Karasik said that it is likely that 'Morocco seeks to boost its industry in several industrial parks while diversifying potential clients that had been steered away before because of taxation. Morocco seeks greater knowledge transfer and advanced weapons testing and production.' Like most Arab states, Morocco is still in the development phase of its defense industrial base. 'Up to now, there are experiences of some Moroccan firms in the field of the military industry, limited to military UAV industry that is still in the scientific research and development phase, military clothing manufacture, and 3D printing techniques of spare parts,' Harfi said. He highlighted that UAV development in Morocco is intended to create a competitive outcome capable of meeting the national needs as well as those of friendly countries. Elsewhere, Morocco has joined forces with US-based Lockheed Martin and Belgian firms Sabca and Sabena to maintain and support F-16 and C-130 Hercules aircraft locally.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/morocco-exempts-defense-firms-from-taxes-eyeing-national-and-international-investments/	2024-11-19T09:40:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241119_moroccan_helo_GettyImages-2154639442-scaled-e1732032991714.jpg
‘Self-inflicted wound’: Pentagon comptroller warns Trump against mass firings of federal employees	Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer Mike McCord delivers remarks at a Business Executives for National Security industry discussion at the National Defense University, Washington, D.C., April 11, 2022. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s stated plans to tee up the firings of thousands of federal employees has shaken many in the career workforce and is damaging productivity, the Pentagon’s chief accountant warned today. Mike McCord, the Pentagon comptroller, also predicted the current continuing resolution would stretch until March and the fiscal 2026 budget will not arrive before April or May. Near the end of his first term in office, Trump signed an executive order reclassifying thousands of government employees — often the type who typically remain in place regardless of presidential administration — as new 'Schedule F' staff without employment protections, essentially making them at-will workers who are easier to fire. Critics lambasted the move as politicizing the bureaucracy and an attack on civil servants amid calls by Trump to purge the 'deep state.' Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House, critics fear the policy could make a return after it was quickly rescinded by President Joe Biden. Trump has campaigned on reviving the Schedule F approach. 'I would certainly hope that the next administration can resist the temptation to [impose] self-inflicted wounds on the workforce with the Schedule F-type approach,' McCord said today in a keynote address at the Professional Services Council Vision 2024 Federal Market Forcecast conference. 'I can tell you that the career workforce is worried — those that I talked to already in anticipation of what might happen,' McCord said. 'It's not helpful for productivity.' 'There's a lot of hard-working, dedicated people in the Defense Department, and if you work with them instead of trying to stomp them, I think that we will get to a much better place,' McCord said. Based on the results of the November election, McCord also said he anticipated the current continuing resolution (CR) for the 2025 fiscal year, set to expire in December, would be stretched out to March as a new Republican congressional majority asserts its influence — though he characterized any gains the GOP could make on its priorities as marginal. 'There's a time value of money we all know in our personal life, and having a bill in December and a two percent better bill in March would be a bad trade for most of us, but that's not how things tend to get looked at here,' McCord said. 'So I think we're headed toward, probably, the two percent different bill in March than what we'd like to see in December.' The Defense Department, along with the rest of the federal government, is well-acquainted with CRs, which military officials have long complained set back modernization efforts by freezing spending at prior-year levels and preventing the start of new programs. By McCord’s count, there have been 15 CRs over the last 16 years, averaging four months a year. 'A third of the year wasted in CRs consistently over 15 straight years,' he said. 'Ridiculous.' Despite the current CR and uncertainties ahead of the November election, Pentagon officials still put together an FY26 budget through the regular process, McCord said. That budget has almost been finalized, he said, details of which can then be shared with the incoming administration. However, McCord noted Trump officials have still not signed transition documents, largely preventing current officials from communicating with their successors. Even when those documents are signed, the process of bringing on new staff from the incoming administration and formulating a new budget likely means the Pentagon’s FY26 spending plan won’t be released until April or May, he added. Freed from constraints of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which capped defense toplines for both 2024 and 2025 — though Congress circumvented those limits in April by passing a $95 billion supplemental defense bill anyway — McCord said the DoD would recommend getting back to the levels of topline growth defined by budgets in years like FY23 and FY24. 'This year, we’re working to a higher [topline],' McCord said of the FY26 proposal. 'But there’s no agreement, and there is going to be a new decision from the new team about what their topline looks like that will help inform their look at what program mix we’ve left for them.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/self-inflicted-wound-pentagon-comptroller-warns-against-mass-firings-of-federal-employees/	2024-11-19T08:14:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/mccord-e1732031536913.jpg
AeroVironment purchases BlueHalo to ‘redefine the next era’ of defense technology	AeroVironment's Switchblade launcher sits on display at AUSA 2023. (Tim Martin / Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Unmanned systems manufacturer AeroVironment is purchasing tech firm BlueHalo, the companies announced today, setting up a merger that could result in a major player on the unmanned systems market. The deal is an all-stock transaction, with a value of approximately $4.1 billion, according to an AeroVironment announcement. The combined company is 'expected to deliver more than $1.7 billion in revenue.' BlueHalo has 'more than $900 million in revenues for 2024,' per the statement. 'For over 50 years, AV has pioneered innovative solutions on the battlefield, and today we are poised to usher in the next era of defense technology through our combination with BlueHalo,' Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in the announcement. On paper, the two companies have little overlap, although some back-office jobs inevitably end up cut when companies merge. BlueHalo has focused on technologies in the space, counter-UAS, directed energy and electronic warfare realms, while AeroVironment has made its bones on unmanned systems, including loitering munitions. The company has found success particularly with its Switchblade family of loitering munitions, which has won Army contracts and been featured as part of the Replicator initiative. It isn’t hard to imagine taking BlueHalo’s technologies and integrating them onto AV systems. Or, as the announcement puts it, 'The companies’ shared culture of agile innovation and mission expertise will enable the combined entity to develop and deliver next-generation technologies that will have significant military value and redefine the next era of Defense Technology.' In a note to investors, Byron Callan, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, said that this deal fits into a broader trend across the defense space. 'The structure of the global defense sector is changing, and this transaction underscores that transformation. Mid-tier suppliers largely disappeared in the 1990s during sector consolidation. There was another wave of M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] in the mid-late 2010s as force protection companies that thrived during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were bought up. 'The 2010s-2020s have seen a rise in new defense tech entrants, with capital provided by venture and private equity. BlueHalo is an example of that change,' Callan continued. 'We expect this emerging mid-tier will take share from larger contractors.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aerovironment-purchases-bluehalo-to-redefine-the-next-era-of-defense-technology/	2024-11-19T07:21:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/231011_switchblade_launcher_MARTIN.jpg
Philippines, US build tighter intel ties, ease exports: ‘We are family,’ says Austin	Philippine’s Secretary of National Defense Gilbert Teodoro and Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III exchange documents while signing the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Nov. 18, 2024. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders) SYDNEY — In his last major trip to the Indo-Pacific region, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin embraced the Philippines, signing an intel-sharing agreement and avowing that the two countries are 'more than allies. We are family.' Austin's two-day stop saw him meeting with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, breaking ground for a new joint intelligence center at Manila's Camp Aguinaldo, and talking with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at Malacanang Palace. During the visit with Teodoro, the two signed a General Security of Military Information Agreement, an important change in security posture that permits the two allies to share classified information and ease the sale of sensitive technologies. The US has signed similar agreements with Indonesia in 2021, Japan in 2007, the United Arab Emirates in 1987, Ecuador in 1985. Egypt in 1982, Denmark in 1981 and with a host of other NATO and non-NATO allies and partners. 'Not only will this allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States, it will also open opportunities to pursue similar agreements with like-minded nations,' Philippine Department of National Defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong said, according to local media reports. Neither country provided details or released a copy of the agreement. Austin traveled to Palawan, an island on the edge of the South China Sea, with Teodoro today. They visited Antonio Bautista Airbase, one of nine Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites, as well as the command center for the Philippines Western Command. The latter is the command in charge of waters that, while legally Philippine according to a UN tribunal, have seen multiple skirmishes with Chinese ships over the last several years. 'The leaders discussed efforts to advance operational planning and deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation with like-minded partners in the South China Sea,' an official joint statement said. Austin also observed a Philippine Navy demonstration of American-supplied Mantas T-12 surface drones, built by Maritime Tactical Systems (MARTAC), on Palawan.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it a 'once in a generation' investment. The T-12s were provided as part of this financing. The drones will be used in part to monitor China's aggressive actions in the Philippines Extended Economic Zone, which have included ramming and using high-pressure water cannons against Philippine ships and attacking Filipinos with axes. The Mantas can carry sensors as well as electronic warfare gear. China issued a muted response to the intelligence-sharing agreement between the two countries. 'No military agreement, or defense and security cooperation, in whatever form, should target any third party or harm the interests of any third party. Nor should it undermine regional peace or exacerbate regional tensions,' Chinese Foreign Ministry Lin Jian said at the regular press conference. 'The only right choice for safeguarding national security and regional peace and stability is to uphold good-neighborliness and friendship and maintain strategic independence.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/philippines-us-build-tighter-intel-ties-ease-exports-we-are-family-says-austin/	2024-11-19T06:20:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/austin-phillipines-scaled-e1732023474834.jpg
India’s hypersonic missile test more stepping stone than game-changer	India test-launched what it called a hypersonic missile on Nov. 16. (Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh via X) WASHINGTON — India is claiming a successful test of a hypersonic missile over the weekend, but the system is likely a ways away from being a real game changer, analysts tell Breaking Defense. Little is actually known about the test, including the name of the new weapon. According to a statement from defense minister Rajnath Singh, the 'historic' launch happened Nov. 16 from Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Island, off the coast of Odisha. A photo shows that it was tested from a mobile launcher. And the weapon, produced by the Defense Research and Development Organization, has a range of greater than 1,500 km, according to a government statement. 'The flight data &#8230; confirmed the successful terminal maneuvers and impact with high degree of accuracy,' the statement reads, according to Reuters. Without greater detail, however, it’s unclear exactly how different this weapon is from systems already in Indian hands. Technically, most ballistic missiles are able to reach hypersonic — Mach 5 or higher — speeds. What sets apart the current crop of weapons loosely grouped as 'hypersonic' is the ability of the reentry vehicles to maneuver at high speeds, making them much harder to intercept. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while it's entirely possible this new weapon has that capability, it’s never good to leap at assumptions. The @DRDO_India has successfully conducted a flight trial of its long range hypersonic missile on 16th Nov 2024 from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island, off-the-coast of Odisha. Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh has congratulated DRDO, Armed Forces and the Industry for successful flight… pic.twitter.com/wq7yM2YS9f &mdash; रक्षा मंत्री कार्यालय/ RMO India (@DefenceMinIndia) November 17, 2024 'It may well be that this particular missile partakes in several characteristics of so-called &#8216;hypersonic flight,'' he told Breaking Defense. 'But it’s important to emphasize that there is no such thing as ‘a’ hypersonic missile, there is a spectrum of delivery systems that contend with the challenging and violent aerodynamic and thermal environment. 'Whether it is a game-changer or not is debatable, but it is clearly part of a larger trend towards high speed maneuvering missiles of various types.' Ankit Panda, the Stanton Senior Fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the weapon sounds less like a game-changer and more of an 'evolutionary step.' And, he said, moving to the next level will take a confluence of factors: 'Much will depend on whether this system receives political sanction and if it can lead to cost-effective procurement plans for hypersonic payloads. Both are indeterminate at the moment.' In the Pacific region, where long-range strike is a vital tool for any nation expecting to go to war over great distances of water, the lure of hypersonic weapons is easy to understand. The United States, China, Russia and North Korea have all claimed some version of a hypersonic weapon in recent years. As a result, India's pursuit of such systems is as much about military benefit as it is political, said Panda. 'I think this test is the result of technical, political, and strategic factors. At the strategic level, China’s growing midcourse missile defense capabilities no doubt have had planners in India thinking about the problem of assuring retaliation in the future. Hypersonic payloads will be naturally appealing for this reason,' he said. 'Politically, India has also ascribed value in the past to making clear that it can join the ranks of the few, elite states that have mastered certain strategic technologies. We saw this previously with their direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon test in 2019, and similar dynamics may underpin the push to develop hypersonic weapons.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/indias-hypersonic-missile-test-more-stepping-stone-than-game-changer/	2024-11-19T04:15:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/india-hypersonic.jpg
Ligado’s $39B lawsuit against federal government can move forward, judge rules	The GPS constellation that provides positioning, navigation and timing signals to the US military and civilians around the world, is made up of 31 active satellites. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A federal judge has ruled that Ligado Networks can move forward with its lawsuit against the US government, a major win for the communications company. In October 2023, Ligado sued the government for $39 billion over claims that officials at the Departments of Defense and Commerce took 'unlawful actions' to, in effect, improperly seize without compensation the firm’s L-band spectrum. In January, the government had asked a judge to dismiss the suit. Today Judge Edward J. Damich of the US Federal Claims Court ruled in part in favor of Ligado and in part for the government over aspects of the case, but ultimately said the case 'may proceed.' 'Ligado is encouraged by the decision and looks forward to pursuing its case to hold the government accountable for the just compensation it owes the company.,' a Ligado spokesperson said in an email. 'In the Order, the Court agrees with Ligado’s position that the spectrum bands it was licensed to use by the FCC are property vis-à-vis the Department of Defense,' per the statement. 'Accordingly, and as long argued by Ligado, the Department’s unauthorized occupation of the spectrum, which has blocked Ligado’s ability to use its own property, is a constitutional taking that must be compensated by the government.' The ruling marks the latest episode in the decades-long drama over Ligado’s plan to use L-band spectrum to develop a wireless cell phone network, which the Departments of Defense, Commerce, Transportation and a number of other federal agencies insist could interfere with signals from the Global Position Satellite (GPS) network. In 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted over department objections to grant Ligado the license to build a 5G network. GPS is used by myriad military weapon systems; the US air traffic control network; trains, planes and automobiles for navigation; and everyday citizens trying to find their way from here to there using interactive maps on their cell phones. The concern from defense officials has been that it will impact everything from soldiers trying to navigate on the ground to missile guidance systems. One complication for Ligado, according to expert Tim Farrar, is the Pentagon has not revealed which specific systems the department believes are at risk due to classification, so the firm has been hamstrung in mounting a counterargument. The Senate Armed Services Committee in June included language in the National Defense Authorization Act that would force the Pentagon to reveal that information, but it is unknown if that language will survive the final NDAA negotiations, currently ongoing. Farrar, an independent consultant on spectrum issues, told Breaking Defense, 'This is what it comes down: Is there going to be some justification for Ligado's claim of occupation, and if this will be a fight over the provision in the policy bill, because that’s what would provide Ligado with the leverage to discover some evidence to support that claim.' Outside of the courtroom, Ligado’s situation may end up being very different following the electoral victory of president-elect Donald Trump. Under Trump’s first administration, key administration officials pushed hard to open up the spectrum in order to boost economic growth. Leading the pushback at the time on behalf of the Pentagon was then-SASC chairman Jim Inhofe. However, Roger Wicker, the Republican from Missouri widely expected to take over the SASC leadership come January, was more sanguine about the situation, perhaps a sign that there will be less Senate pushback on Ligado’s spectrum moves going forward. Notably, Trump has announced he will nominate FCC member Brendon Carr as his FCC chair. In 2020, Carr, along with the rest of the FCC, voted to support Ligado’s application, and he was a vocal supporter of opening up spectrum for economic benefits. (Carr is also reportedly close to Elon Musk, who has sought to reduce oversight of systems such as the SpaceX Starlink satellite network, another issue that falls under the FCC.) 'This was an internal Trump administration back and forth last time around, and we’ll have to see what the positions are of people in this administration,' said Farrar. 'Ultimately, its going to be down to this administration to settle Ligado's claim, if it does need to be settled.'

(US Navy photo) WASHINGTON — The United States, United Kingdom and Australia today signed a new agreement under the AUKUS trilateral security pact that will allow the three countries to use one another's hypersonic weapons testing facilities as well as share technical information needed to develop and manufacture the technology. The new agreement has been dubbed the Hypersonic Flight Test and Experimentation (HyFliTE) Project Arrangement, and will include 'up to six' trilateral test flight campaigns by 2028 using a $252 million funding pool, according to a US Defense Department statement. 'We are increasing our collective ability to develop and deliver offensive and defensive hypersonic technologies through a robust series of trilateral tests and experiments that will accelerate the development of hypersonic concepts and critical enabling technologies,' Heidi Shyu, the Pentagon’s senior civilian overseeing research and engineering, said in the statement. 'Collaborative efforts are accelerating the development of underpinning enabling technologies, such as high temperature materials, advanced propulsion systems, and guidance and control. Each of these technologies is integral to the performance of hypersonic weapon systems and provides enhanced operational capability,' she continued All of the American military services have invested heavily into developing hypersonic weapons in recent years, with the Army and Navy designing a common glide body, while the Air Force has started — and closed — several air-launched weapons programs. 'This landmark arrangement with our US and Australian partners demonstrates the commitment of AUKUS partners to staying at the forefront of battle-winning defence technology,' said John Healey, the United Kingdom’s defense secretary. 'This work will keep us ahead of our adversaries on the battlefield, enhance our collective security and contribute to maintaining peace and stability in an increasingly complex and dangerous world.' The British statement added that the 'Hypersonic Technologies and Capabilities Development Framework' was used to source industry support and includes 'more than 90 suppliers and has a commercial headroom of' up to 1 billion British pounds, or 1.27 billion USD.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aukus-nations-ink-new-hypersonic-tech-sharing-agreement/	2024-11-18T10:38:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/210825-N-NO191-0002-e1726510358325.jpg
To counter China, Trump’s administration should build on Biden AI memo	Keyboard with China flag key (Getty images) Across both the Biden and Trump administrations, the US has consistently viewed China as the primary global rival, particularly in the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence. President Biden’s administration recently underscored this stance with the first-ever National Security Memorandum (NSM) on AI, which set a firm foundation for addressing the AI challenge posed by Beijing. The memo could prove to be a defining moment in the US strategy to retain global technological dominance, linking AI to national security and the broader competition with China's geopolitical and technological ambitions. The NSM directs the US government to implement concrete and impactful steps to ensure American leadership in the development of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. While there are some differences between Biden’s and Trump’s approaches to AI development, the overarching theme of AI as a national security imperative in the geopolitical competition with China remains a point of continuity and commonality. Rather than unraveling this framework, the Trump administration, upon its return, should consider building upon these elements. Continuity in this strategy would not only strengthen America’s position against China’s AI-driven ambitions but also demonstrate a cohesive and steady approach to technological competition on the global stage. The memo is part of a broader push to shape the global conversation around AI, aiming to establish norms and regulations that counter Beijing and temper down Brussels. For instance, the United Nations earlier this year passed a US-led resolution on AI, marking a pivotal step in the global push to set standards for the technology. And the document builds on a host of previous directives, including the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, Voluntary AI Commitments, AI Bill of Rights, and the CHIPS Act. For the US, this norm-setting effort is crucial — not only to safeguard its standing as a global leader in AI but also to prevent restrictive policies that could hinder American tech companies' competitive edge in the sector. The NSM’s focus on global competition with China reflects broader concerns about the balance of power in the current 'decisive decade.' China’s AI investments are tied to its 'Digital Silk Road' initiative, aimed at establishing control over global technological infrastructure, including AI-powered systems and digital communications networks. The NSM outlines the US objectives in the material side of technological competition: Diversifying chip supply chains and reducing reliance on traditional hubs like Taiwan while building partnerships with countries like India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Vietnam. A second priority is safeguarding American intellectual property from state-sponsored espionage. These goals have shaped Washington’s approach, as evidenced by the CHIPS and Science Act, which bolstered US semiconductor industries and spurred major progress. At the same time, forging deals like the G42-Microsoft agreement with the UAE, will help protect US intellectual property and foster tech collaboration with key allies. Acknowledging that technological developments will come largely from outside government, the NSM designates the AI Safety Institute as the primary US government point of contact for industry. The Institute will work with national security agencies and promote international cooperation on AI safety standards. It will also evaluate AI systems for national security and public safety implications and guide developers. However, the NSM intentionally overlooked the importance of export and capital controls, which are critical to Washington's strategy of containing China's technological rise and buying time. The Biden administration’s bet is that by creating a cohesive regulatory framework, it can give itself and its allies a critical head start in technology innovation and large-scale deployment of AI in the military and commercial domain. The key to this effort has been aligning export controls with allies like Japan and the Netherlands, which are nations that command essential technologies in advanced chipmaking. Furthermore, in addition to CFIUS's restrictions on investment in sensitive American technology, a 'reverse CFIUS' mechanism targets investments in semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence by restricting certain outbound investments in technology by US persons to China. Any new administration seeks to differentiate itself from its predecessors, and early signs are that is especially true for the incoming Trump team. But there is actually quite a bit of alignment between this NSM and the goals of the Trump administration, given the agreement that China is the greatest threat to the United States. In essence, the NSM on AI mirrors the Trump administration’s own Indo-Pacific Strategy, aiming to create a durable, bipartisan approach to managing technology competition with China. With China advancing AI to expand its geopolitical influence, the United States can’t afford fragmentation. Instead, the new Trump administration should build on the NSM as an essential blueprint, one that merits continuation. Embracing this continuity will ensure America, alongside its allies, maintains its edge in the race for technological supremacy in this defining domain. The AI vision outlined in the NSM reflects Washington's belief that sustained, coordinated efforts are essential to maintaining a competitive edge in the evolving technological landscape and ensuring US leadership in AI, tilting the technological competition with China in favor of the United States. Rather than viewing it as a relic of a previous administration, the new White House should look to build on this framework.

Amid its own war, Israel sending Arrow 3 air defenses to Germany in 2025	An Arrow 3 is tested by IAI. (IAI) JERUSALEM — Even as it relies on its own air defenses to fend off rockets, missiles and drones from enemies in the region — and anticipates a potential new attack from Iran — Israel said it’s preparing to send one of its key air defense systems to Germany, as previously agreed. Last week Israeli and German government and industry officials met for two days at Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), maker of the Arrow 3 high-altitude defense system, where they began coordinating 'joint preparations for the initial deployment of [Arrow 3] on German soil in 2025,' the Israeli Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Nov. 10. Arrow 3, originally developed as a joint project between Israel and the US, is the top layer of Israel’s three-layered air defense system and designed to primarily guard against ballistic missiles, while David’s Sling operates in the middle layer and Iron Dome sits at the bottom, taking out short-range, low flying threats. Though IAI is the Arrow’s prime contractor, the Israeli MoD said Israel’s Elbit Systems and Germany's MBDA Deutschland GmbH also took part in the meeting last week. That Israel would continue with the export of an advanced air defense system while using the same system to defend itself is evidence of Jerusalem’s commitment to its relationship with Berlin, according to Jeremy Issacharoff, former Israeli ambassador to Germany. The progress on the Arrow deal is a 'significant development and progression in the strategic partnership between the two countries,' Issacharoff told Breaking Defense. Prior to the Arrow deal, many of the largest deals between Germany and Israel involved Israel acquiring defense products from Germany, not the other way around, he said. For instance, Israel has purchased submarines and corvette ships to be built by German firms. This has changed in recent years, however. 'Germany’s national security mindset changed when Russia precipitated the crisis with Ukraine, creating a necessity to contend with a dramatically different security environment impacting Germany and Europe as a whole,' said the former ambassador, who left his post in May 2022 just weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 'When we saw what was happening with Ukraine … we passed on a clear message that we remain committed to German national security and would be willing to help in any way we could in providing defensive weapon systems needed in this new environment.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz poses with senior Israel Aerospace Industrie (IAI) officials in front of an Arrow missile at ILA Berlin Air Show 2024 on June 5, 2024. (IAI) Yaakov Katz, author of the book Shadow Strike and a Fellow at JPPI, agreed that there is a worldwide focus on the need for more missile defense systems. 'Europe is concerned with Russian aggression and threats that they could face on the horizon. Every country today, especially after the last year here in Israel, with Iran’s different attacks by Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, recognize the need to bolster missile defense systems,' he said. German and Israeli officials originally signed a letter of commitment to the deal for the Arrow 3 on Sept. 26, 2023, for $3.5 billion, just days before Hamas launched the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that drastically changed the security landscape of the Middle East. It sparked a deadly, devastating counterattack by Israel that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in Gaza as well as continuous mortar, rocket, drone and missile attacks against Israel from groups like Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and, in two extraordinary cases, directly from Iran. Arrow 3 had its first successful war-time interception on Nov. 9, 2023, taking down a missile launched from Yemen. All the while the German deal was still in motion, and two weeks after the November interception, it was finalized with an estimated late 2025 delivery. Ever since, Israel has pledged to make the delivery on time, as IAI’s CEO Boaz Levy told Breaking Defense in March 2024. The Arrow deal is one of several Israeli deals in Europe for air defense systems, and part of a rapidly growing interest in these systems that have proven themselves throughout a year of war as Israel faces multi-front threats. Finland is acquiring the David’s Sling system, a medium-range interceptor. Slovakia is acquiring IAI’s Barak MX system. The US Marines recently completed a successful live-fire Iron Dome drill. On Nov. 14 reports indicated Greece is also interested in developing an air defense system similar to the multi-layered Israeli system that is anchored in Iron Dome. As for Germany, Issacharoff said, 'The close bilateral relationship between the defense and intelligence establishments of the two countries [Israel and Germany] has been very strong and will in my opinion remain strong. This is exemplified by the agreement for Israel to supply the Arrow 3 missile defense system to Germany.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/amid-its-own-war-israel-to-send-arrow-3-air-defenses-to-germany-in-2025/	2024-11-18T06:29:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Product_Gallery_825X515_ARROW3_01-e1663010255599.jpg
