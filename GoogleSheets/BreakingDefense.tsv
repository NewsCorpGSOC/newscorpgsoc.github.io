Aussies hoping AUKUS relationship will spare them Trump’s steel, aluminum tariffs	US President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. Trump ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, escalating his efforts to protect politically important US industries with levies hitting some of the country's closest allies. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images SYDNEY — Last week, made its first payment of $500 million USD to the United States to bolster the submarine industrial base, part of an eventual $3 billion investment inside the US to help speed up production of the Virginia-class nuclear powered attack submarine. It was a move that drew rare praise for a foreign government from Trump administration officials. Now, just days later, Australia finds itself hoping that goodwill can carry over after US President Donald Trump used an Executive Order to slap 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from around the globe. There is hope for an exemption, although, as has happened multiple times in the first few weeks of the new administration, the message coming from the White House is sometimes difficult to ascertain with any precision. When Trump signed the executive order for the tariffs, he told reporters that there would be 'no exemptions.' But he also said he had had a 'warm and constructive' call with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, during which the PM made the case for an exemption. Trump noted the trade surplus that America has with the Lucky Country, 'and the reason is they buy a lot of airplanes,' he said at the White House after speaking with Albanese. He added that he told the prime minister the exemption is 'something that we'll give great consideration to.' During a discussion today with reporters after the call with Trump, Albanese was very careful to say several times that 'we agreed on wording to say publicly, which is that the US president agreed that an exemption was under consideration.' Clearly echoing his conversation with Trump, Albanese noted that 'the US has a trade surplus with Australia that it's had since the Truman administration.' He noted that the US only imports about one percent of its steel and two percent of its aluminum from Australia. The fifth largest steel maker in America is an Australian company, BlueScope, which has invested about $5 billion into the US, the prime minister said. At least one AUKUS supporter is concerned: Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who is a major backer of the trilateral agreement, said in a statement that 'What we're seeing is a completely needless, almost insult to the people of Australia by raising tariffs of Australian products coming into this country.' 'They are buying three nuclear submarines, cash on the barrelhead, full price, no gimmes, no giveaway,' Courtney continued. 'So again, by all the measurements that President Trump talks about trade issues that we're being ripped off by other countries, in this case, every one of those arguments fails.' One Australian defense expert, John Blaxland of the Australian National University, compared his country's 'circumstances with its strategic cousins in Canada. There, tariffs are driving a strong nationalist reaction, while also triggering a period of reflection on trade and national security priorities internal to the nation.' Australia and Canada share many characteristics, as both are wealthy Commonwealth countries with parliamentary democracies and they have extremely close relations with the United States. And yet, Canada has found itself in Trump's crosshairs, to the point Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that Trump's threats to annex Canada are 'a real thing.' Blaxland noted that 'the imposition of tariffs likely will have a corrosive effect on American soft power — of the latent good will in the Australian political scene towards positive US-Australian security and economic dynamics.' The good news for Australia is that steel and aluminum are not huge industries here so the country is not 'likely to suffer to any great degree as a result — as the pain probably will be diffused internationally,' he added. How should Australia measure its relationship with the United States, given the fact they are treaty allies, are working together to build a unique alliance based on the purchase and construction of nuclear-powered submarines and have fought side by side in every war since 1918? 'Do not be misled by the idea that there's any altruism in Washington towards Australia. Australians love to delude themselves to this,' former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the Australia Broadcasting Corporation. 'If we want to be respected, we have to stand up.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/aussies-hoping-aukus-relationship-will-spare-them-trumps-steel-aluminum-tariffs/	2025-02-11T06:38:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/trump-steel-tarrif-scaled-e1739283017690.jpg
Air Force pauses ‘reoptimization’ planning as service awaits new leadership	An F-15EX fighter jet taxis to its parking spot at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (US Air Force) WASHINGTON — The Department of the Air Force has halted planning for a sweeping overhaul of its internal structures amid an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to wait for new, Senate-confirmed leadership before proceeding, the service confirmed today. 'On Feb. 6, the Secretary of Defense directed the Department of the Air Force to pause all planning actions connected to its Reoptimizing for Great Power Competition efforts. The planning pause remains in effect until a Senate-confirmed Secretary and Under Secretary of the Air Force are in place and have the opportunity to review the initiatives,' an Air Force spokesperson said in a statement. 'The Department of the Air Force welcomes the opportunity for our new leaders to assess all ongoing actions and ensure compliance with DoD directives. We will issue clarifying guidance, as necessary,' the spokesperson said. The pause does not require reversing reoptimization actions already undertaken, they added. Formally launched last year, the Department of the Air Force’s 'Reoptimizing for Great Power Competition' initiative aims to revamp Air Force and Space Force internal structures and processes; for example, by ensuring acquisitions are more integrated, and overhauling airman education and training. The pause on reoptimization planning was previously reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. The reorganization was launched, former Air Force Secretary Kendall explained last year, with the intent to properly prepare airmen and Guardians for potential conflict with China. The overarching effort entails two dozen changes across the Air Force and Space Force, officials said when it was unveiled. The pause comes amid a wide-ranging review of DoD initiatives under the new Trump administration, where officials have now focused their gaze on purported diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Lawmakers have also voiced some skepticism of the reoptimization drive but have yet to substantively impede its progress. Trump has nominated Troy Meink, the National Reconnaissance Office’s No. 2 official, to serve as the next secretary of the Department of the Air Force. The president has additionally picked Matthew Lohmeier, a former Space Force lieutenant colonel removed from his post in 2021 over comments he made on a podcast, to serve as the department's next under secretary. Hearing dates for the two nominees have not yet been set, and it’s not clear how long the pause for reoptimization planning may last as a result.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/air-force-pauses-reoptimization-planning-as-service-awaits-new-leadership/	2025-02-10T12:33:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240216_f15ex_taxi_6959449-e1708094519988.jpg
DoD acquisition reform guidance expected soon, with focus on rapid prototyping	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Joint Task Force North, US Northern Command, along the southern border at Fort Bliss, Texas earlier this month. (US Army/ Sgt. 1st Class Andrew R. Sveen) WASHINGTON — Defense industry insiders are preparing for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to issue new guidance for the Pentagon's acquisition process aimed at getting new tech into the field at a faster clip, Breaking Defense has learned. Hegseth is expected to sign out a new memo kickstarting the process as early as this week, according to two sources. Though that timing could shift and memo contents remain under wraps for now, it is expected to be the first of several steps designed to accelerate the process of buying and fielding new weapons and software. Both sources predicted an expanded role for the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and its push to circumvent the traditional acquisition process. The wait for more details about priorities and the road ahead comes after Hegseth promised to 'rebuild' the military last week, to include the Department of Defense’s 'acquisitions process [and] how we rapidly field new technologies.' 'There's a lot of programs around here that we’ve spent a lot of money on that, when you actually wargame it, don't have the impact you want them to,' he said during a townhall-style event on Feb. 7. 'That means I'm going to take a lot of arrows, and I'm prepared to do so. That's fine,' he later added. 'We need the best systems in the hands of warfighters where they need it, to the COCOMs [combatant commanders] to deter and send the signals that when that fight comes, we're ready to win and win decisively.' Just how broad this shakeup will be remains to be seen, but a third source that works closely with a broad swath of defense companies said a new look at acquisition is par for the course when a new secretary hits the Pentagon. 'With all new administrations, there is a pretty much ‘stop, relook and clarify priorities period,’' the source said. 'And right now there is a sense of urgency with acquisition reform.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-acquisition-reform-guidance-expected-soon-with-focus-on-rapid-prototyping/	2025-02-10T12:00:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Hegseth2-e1739216330555.jpg
Promising biotech startups ‘dying on the vine’: In-Q-Tel	DNA molecular structure with sequencing data of human genome analysis. (Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Driven by the spread of CRISPR gene-editing techniques and rapid advances in AI-powered biochemical models, biotechnology is taking off. But not all biotech is equal in an investor’s eyes, and the biotech sectors that face the hardest fight for funding — at least in the United States — happen to be the ones with most promise for the Pentagon. While tens of billions of dollars pour into biotech ever year in the US and Europe, it overwhelmingly goes to pharmaceutical products, everything from lifesaving medicines like mRNA COVID vaccines to mass-market cosmetic creams, because those investments have the shortest and most obvious path to high returns. By contrast, there’s much less commercial demand — and a more confusing regulatory process — for other promising biotech that might matter for the military. That includes new, biologically-derived materials like lighter-weight body armor, anti-corrosion coatings or even explosives. 'The private sector on its own is not going to fund that stuff,' said Vivek Chilukuri, director of the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, in an interview with Breaking Defense. 'It’s going to fund skin creams and lotions and other mass-market pharmaceuticals.' 'It's easier to … either go after quick-turn products or to really focus, laser focus, on high return-products,' Jessica Dymond, vice president for technology at In-Q-Tel, the nonprofit venture-capital arm of the US intelligence community, said last week at a panel hosted by CNAS. 'There's a lot left on the sidelines, that is, you know, quite frankly, dying on the vine.' Private-sector investment just isn’t coming fast enough to sustain these biotech startups, Dymondvadded. That means, she said, 'a lot of thought is needed in terms of how to cultivate that early, very fragile stage.' Investors weren’t always so hyper focused on pharmaceuticals, lamented another panelist at CNAS, Jason Kelly, cofounder of Ginkgo Bioworks, which provides high-tech tools for other biotech firms. 'Fastest growing area for us now is biopharma,' he said. But if you go back to the first influx of venture capital about ten years ago, he said, 'all the rage at that point was … being able to make new materials,' such as humane alternatives to leather and meat. However, he noted that when interest rates rose in the last few years, the funding for everything outside of pharmaceuticals 'evaporated.' 'When private markets aren't there for the parts of biotech that are relevant in defense, how do you back-stop it?' he asked. One federal effort to fill the gap is BioMADE, a nonprofit, public-private partnership aimed specifically at bio-manufacturing. It was launched in the last months of the first Trump administration with $87 million in Pentagon funding spread over seven years, and $187 million in private-sector and university funds. The Biden administration followed up in 2023 by pledging another $1.5 billion for various biomanufacturing initiatives spread over five years, so it will be up to President Donald Trump to continue it or not. There’s also a congressionally chartered National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology just now wrapping up its work, though they’re not focused solely on DoD interests or biomanufacturing. 'In just a few weeks, the NSCEB will publish our major report, including a number of policy recommendations,' said the chairman, Sen. Todd Young, in an address to CNAS after the panel. 'Our government must take targeted action in ways only the federal government can.' Otherwise, the Indiana Republican warned, China will capitalize on its current dominance of the low end of the biotech supply chain — by some estimates, it exports 40 percent of all active pharmaceutical ingredients worldwide — and steal undervalued American IP to take the lead in biotech writ large. 'China, in short, plays to win,' he said. This really is a moment that Congress and Trump can seize, said Chilukuri, a former Hill staffer himself. 'I’m optimistic that the commission is going to put forward some very thoughtful, practical recommendations,' he told Breaking Defense. While finding more federal funding at a time of feverish DOGE cuts is far from easy, the money that’s gone to bio-materials and other non-pharmaceutical biotech so far is 'a rounding error' in the Pentagon budget, he argued. Even without new funding, he went on, there is an opportunity to streamline biotech regulation and improve coordination among federal agencies — 13 different offices have some degree of jurisdiction, with multiple funding sources in DoD alone. 'These programs could stand to scale up, but that should be paired with an actual strategic plan at DoD about how these different programs are going to be married together and what is the actual vision for the next five to 10 years of actual products,' Chilukuri told Breaking Defense. 'We don’t have that plan right now, and it’s a huge opportunity that I think is just waiting for this administration to seize.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/promising-biotech-startups-dying-on-the-vine-in-q-tel/	2025-02-10T08:43:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-1703790414-scaled-e1738964966546.jpg
On Lebanese border, Israel’s Plasan kept rolling out armored vehicles as war raged	Plasan's Sandcat 'Tigris' (Photo courtesy of Plasan) SASA, Israel — The Israeli defense company Plasan makes armored solutions for military platforms, such as producing complex armored plates for vehicles. But the company had to think about a different kind of protection in 2024 — how it keep its facilities and staff safe as the war expanded into Lebanon. The company is located in the northern Israeli community of Sasa, around a mile from the Lebanese border, right along the front line of Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah. The company continued to roll vehicles off the line and keep up production throughout the war. During a visit to Plasan, representatives discussed how they kept up with orders and dealt with the disruptions of war. The northern border of Israel is quiet these days. The rolling hills of the upper Galilee are preparing for spring, and some trees even have blossoms already. But for most of 2024 this area was a war zone. Israel evacuated more than 60,000 people from border communities in October 2023 when Hezbollah began rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel. Roads near the border were closed and concrete barriers were erected in many places where drivers or soldiers might be exposed to anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) fire. 'On October 7 [2023] the army came and took vehicles we had, those about to be delivered,' recalls Gilad Ariav, vice-president of marketing and business development at Plasan. And given the demand from the IDF, the company was charged with keeping production up at normal or higher rates, despite the potential dangers of being so close to the border. The IDF needed ceramic plates for soldiers, and Plasan reopened an old line to produce them, working 24/7 to produce 35,000 plates while also increasing production of armored vehicles. While the members of the Sasa Kibbutz that is adjacent to the company were evacuated to the south, the company’s employees stayed at work. Around 50 percent of the employees were called up to IDF reserve duty. 'It didn’t prevent us [from delivering]' says Ariav. As the company provided a tour of its site, the evidence of the threats from the last fifteen months of war was still visible: In one section of the factory there are several window sections that have been impacted by various projectiles. There is also one vehicle that is missing a rear wheel and was hit by some kind of IED, and concrete barriers remain in place to protect against missile fire from Lebanon. Members of the company described how one could often see and hear interceptions overhead during the war. Not only was Sasa targeted, but Mount Meron, which looms a mile away across a nearby valley, was often targeted because it has an IDF base near its peak. Many of the residents of the community around the company have not fully returned to their homes and schools. (Overall Plasan has around 450 employees in Israel and around 700 worldwide, with subsidiaries in the US, Australia and France.) But officials are proud of the fact that despite the frequent sirens, need to go into shelters, and the constant threats, the work went on. Today the company appears to be continuing to work at a fast pace to produce its armored solutions. In one area of a factory floor Ariav shows how armored plates for things such as doors of vehicles are produced. Small hexagonal ceramic pieces are placed as a layer and then they are sandwiched between metal, which the company says helps absorb blasts. During a presentation, Ariav stressed how the company uses live trials to test its armor and solutions against explosions and projectiles, as well as running complex computer simulations. The simulations examine how different projectiles might hit a plate, or how an improvised explosive device would impact armor. This saves the cost and effort of blowing up numerous vehicles, Ariav says the simulations have proven effective in terms of final design and predicting how threats will impact armor. In another area, the company showcased their FlexFence defense against RPGs, which looks like a kind of fence that can be draped around parts of the vehicle. The fence uses special technology to trigger the RPG and helps protect the vehicle from being penetrated, so that the damage of the blast is reduced. The firm is also in production on a number of vehicles. One is the Sandcat, which is called the 'Tigris' by the IDF. The company uses the chassis of F-550s and then adds an armored body on top of them. This is an armored solution the company calls Kitted Hull and it provides protection from all angles, including below for mines and above against small bomblets that drones can drop. In one hangar the company is producing the Sandcats for both the IDF and what they said was another, undisclosed customer. Each has a different configuration, and employees work on the vehicles by hand, producing around ten vehicles a week. Besides the Sandcats, a major focus for the firm are contracts for armoring JLTVs with Oshkosh as well as the Australian Redback infantry fighting vehicle, which is made by South Korea’s Hanwha. The company is also up-armoring a number of Piranhas, a family of fighting vehicles the originated in Switzerland in the 1970s and is now in its fifth generation and in use by a dozen countries. In addition, Plasan is also working on a new system called an All-Terrain Electric Mission Module (ATeMM), which is an electric-powered 'modular' system that can function as a kind of trailer for a vehicle, or be used as a four-wheeled robotic unmanned vehicle. ATeMM was first unveiled in 2021 but was tested by the IDF in the recent war in Lebanon. It was one of many vehicles in the Plasan factory that seemed to encapsulate how technology is transforming not only armored vehicles but also solutions for maneuvering forces — the kind of lesson that comes from 15 months of a multi-front war.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/on-lebanese-border-israels-plasan-kept-rolling-out-armored-vehicles-as-war-raged/	2025-02-10T07:14:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/PLASAN_SANDCAT_TIGRIS-004-690x388-1-e1738961341316.png
L3Harris unveils command, control software envisioned for 1,000s of drones	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. This exercise was the first of many held at the National Training Center. (US Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — L3Harris today announced it is unveiling a new command and control software, dubbed 'AMORPHOUS,' designed to control thousands of unmanned systems in a 'swarm,' joining a number of other companies in recent years that have homed in on that technology as a gap in the Pentagon's arsenal. 'There have been concepts that have said maybe you need one particular asset that is referred to as the mothership, or the brains of the operation,' Jon Rambeau, president of integrated missions systems, told reporters last week. 'We believe that's not the best approach, because if something happens — that asset is degraded, it's attacked, it's no longer able to communicate, then what happens?' The answer, Rambeau said, is that AMORPHOUS is designed to pass control of the swarm from one asset to another on the fly. Toby Magsig, vice president of autonomy programs, added that the idea behind a 'leaderless swarm' is that the user sends out instructions — for example, conduct a search of the area — to every asset in the swarm, but the drones intelligently delegate tasks among themselves. AMORPHOUS — Autonomous Multi-domain Operations Resiliency Platform for Heterogeneous Unmanned Swarms — is currently being used on contracts for the Army and the Defense Innovation Unit. To date it has demonstrated the ability to control 'multiple separate assets across multiple vehicle types operating in different domains during government-managed tests.' Asked about how large of a swarm AMORPHOUS has controlled to date, Magsig said the top number has been in the 'double digits,' and he believes it will soon exceed 100. 'It becomes an economy of scale in terms of testing this live, when you talk sort of four digits &#8230; and so that's where we rely on a Live, Virtual, Constructive mix to get and test and validate this scalability to what DOD is really looking for,' he said. Rambeau and Magsig acknowledged their product is joining a crowded field of competitors. Indeed, companies such as HII and Swedish defense giant Saab, among others, have all recently been making plays into software development focused on unmanned systems command and control. L3Harris's pitch may be among the more ambitious in scale but it's unclear how the Pentagon — or more precisely, each of the individual services — will approach the question of controlling thousands of drones in concert on a joint battlefield.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/l3harris-unveils-command-control-software-envisioned-for-1000s-of-drones/	2025-02-10T06:00:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1733415596741.jpg
Senate Republicans release budget plan with $150B more for defense	Senator Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, center, arrives with Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, right, during a confirmation hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2025. (Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate Budget Committee has released a budget blueprint that, if ultimately passed by Congress, could add $150 billion in new funds for defense. Details of exactly what that funding could pay for will be determined by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees if the budget resolution is passed. However, a summary of the bill lays out four main focus areas: maintaining military readiness; growing the Navy and strengthening the shipbuilding industrial base; building an integrated air and missile defense for the United States — a Trump administration priority it has termed the 'Iron Dome for America' — and investments in the nuclear enterprise. The new budget resolution, unveiled today by Budget Committee Chairman Sen. Lindsey Graham, tees up a separate process for the Senate and the House as the two legislative bodies grapple over how best to enact President Donald Trump’s policy agenda. The goal, as espoused by Trump and supported by House Speaker Mike Johnson, is for 'one beautiful bill' containing all the president’s priorities to move through Congress via the process of reconciliation, which allows bills to avoid filibuster and pass with a simple majority. However, the Senate is opting for a two-bill strategy, with a first that focuses on border security, defense and energy priorities and a second to follow that would extend tax cuts enacted in Trump’s first administration. The Senate Budget Committee will mark up its version of the budget resolution next Wednesday and Thursday. The House has not put forward its own budget blueprint. 'To those who voted for and support real border security and a stronger defense in a troubled world, help is on the way,' Graham said in a statement. 'This budget resolution jumpstarts a process that will give President Trump’s team the money they need to secure the border and deport criminals, and make America strong and more energy independent.' In a January interview with Breaking Defense, SASC chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said he was advocating for '$100 billion a year [for defense] for the next two years' to be added during the reconciliation process, which could help pay for defense needs such as Iron Dome, shipbuilding and submarine production, and sixth-generation fighter aircraft. In addition to the defense funds, the Senate resolution would add $175 billion in homeland security spending and $175 billion in spending to be determined by the judiciary committees. It would obligate an additional $85.5 billion to the federal budget each year from FY25-FY28, but that spending would be offset by equivalent cuts, according to a summary of the budget. The text of the bill directs several committees, such as agriculture and education, to identify potential cuts, and all committees would have until March 7 to provide recommendations. The reconciliation process is just one mechanism that Republicans are looking at in order to obtain funding for a US Iron Dome. Elsewhere, Sens. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and Kevin Cramer, R-ND, introduced legislation this week pushing for $19.5 billion for a US Iron Dome, with expenses including $12 billion to expand missile interceptors in Alaska with Next Generation Interceptors, and $1.4 billion for the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/senate-republicans-release-budget-plan-with-150b-more-for-defense/	2025-02-07T13:20:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2194682859-scaled-e1738963129851.jpg
Days after showing off ‘Gaza’ drone, Iran unveils its first drone carrier	Iranian-made unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), the Shahed-136, are pictured during a military rally in downtown Tehran, Iran, on January 10, 2025. The IRGC spokesperson says on Monday, January 6, that the military rally named Rahian-e-Quds (Passengers of Al-Aqsa) includes 110,000 IRGC members. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Iran this week unveiled its first indigenous drone carrier, dubbed Shahid (Martyr) Baqeri according to Iran's state-run media Islamic Republic News Agency. The carrier joined the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps Navy (IRGC) fleet in a Thursday ceremony held in the city of Bandar Abbas on the shore of the strategic strait of Hurmuz in the Arabian Gulf. The vessel is expected to conduct drone and helicopter naval missions, according to the announcement. Iran is the second country in the Middle East to develop and launch a drone carrier after Turkey, which began operating its drone carrier, the TCG Anadolu, in April 2023. 'The Martyr Baqeri drone carrier is capable of carrying several squadrons of unmanned aerial vehicles, launching and landing unmanned fighter jets, deploying various reconnaissance and combat drones, launching and recovering various light and fast combat vessels, as well as carrying and deploying various combat and support helicopters,' IRCG Navy Commander Rear Admiral Alireza Tangsiri said, according to Iran's partially state-owned news agency Tasnim. He added that the carrier will enhance Tehran’s 'defensive capabilities and deterrence of the Islamic Republic of Iran in distant waters and in safeguarding the nation’s national interests.' The carrier’s operational range is 22,000 nautical miles, and its runway is 180 meters long, according to Tasnim. Ryan Bohl, senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the RANE network, told Breaking Defense today that this carrier will add brown-water power projection capabilities for Tehran, 'particularly through the Gulf and around Yemen and the Red Sea. Having an independent drone platform based at sea will also improve Iran's surveillance and intelligence capabilities in theaters in which it has strategic interests like Yemen.' He added that the most immediate impact for Iran's strategic posture will be in 'surveillance capability where drones will help Iran provide proxies with better information for potential targeting missions of mutual rivals like intelligence cooperation with the Houthis to strike Israeli linked shipping or rivals in the Yemeni civil War.' However, Bohl doubted Shahid Baqeri’s long-range capabilities, noting that it cannot operate far from Iran's shores if not accompanied with support fleet or advanced anti-air defenses. The announcement comes days after Iran's operational long-range drone dubbed 'Gaza,' took part in a military exercise, and few months after Tehran and Jerusalem exchanged a barrage of missiles and drones. While Iran’s navy and the IRGC navy operate old and outdated vessels, Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Breaking Defense today that Tehran has a history in converting container vessels into warships. Ben Taleblu voiced concerns, saying 'The Islamic Republic would not be converting tankers into drone carriers if it did not intend on making its regional drone power a global one.' 'What makes the Shahid Baqeri unique is that it is billed by Iran as being exclusively used for drones making it the first drone carrier for the IRGC Navy,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/days-after-showing-off-gaza-drone-iran-unveils-its-first-drone-carrier/	2025-02-07T10:45:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2192728860-scaled-e1738946595181.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: DoD memo seeks review of Space Development Agency’s independent status, plans	Space Development Agency Tracking Layer satellites will keep eyes on both ballistic and hypersonic missiles. (Graphic: L3Harris) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department's acquisition office is calling for a review of whether the Space Development Agency's (SDA) 'organizational performance and acquisition approach' is meeting the needs of warfighters — and whether the agency should keep its independent status within the Space Force, Breaking Defense has learned. In a memo signed Jan. 31 and obtained by Breaking Defense, Steven Morani, who is performing the duties of the DoD undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment, requests the Department of the Air Force to set up an 'independent review team [IRT]' to assess 'the current state of health' of all programs comprising SDA's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA). The Department of the Air Force is responsible for civilian oversight of the Space Force. While SDA has been given freedom to make some acquisition decisions outside of the usual Air Force acquisition system, oversight is still provided by the office of the assistant secretary for space acquisition and integration. Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy, the office's military deputy, is currently the acting head. Morani's memo — while stressing that the called-for review should not interfere with the ongoing investigation or current contracts — states that if the review team finds 'any significant risks or issues related to contracting strategy, funding, schedule, or performance/capability delivery, the IRT should provide a characterization of impacts from these risks, with recommendations for corrective action.' Importantly, it makes it clear that one such corrective action could be for DoD and the Air Force to strip SDA of its semi-independent status underneath the Space Force — with Morani tasking the review team to assess 'the efficacy of the SDA’s organizational staffing, structure, processes, and position as a direct reporting unit within the United States Space Force (USSF).' While signed, it is unclear whether the memo has been approved by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and if it has been officially circulated within the Department of the Air Force, the Space Force and SDA. An Air Force spokesperson referred a request for comment to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD); neither SDA or OSD responded to a request for comment by press time. After initial congressional skepticism about its creation, SDA's recent performance has been widely lauded on Capitol Hill as the kind of innovative and rapid acquisition approach that should be serving as a model for the rest of the Space Force's acquisition programs managed by Space Systems Command (SSC). However, several government sources told Breaking Defense that Space Force and SSC officials have been concerned that SDA has made no plans for how it will transition its satellites and ground stations to active operations by Space Force personnel. For example, it long has been unclear how the PWSA missile Tracking Layer will be integrated with SSC's planned Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking constellation in medium-Earth orbit, as well as the Next-Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared missile warning satellites now in development. Nor, these sources said, has there been any Space Force budget planning for future operations of the PWSA network. SDA's first operational satellites currently are expected to launch this spring. The PWSA envisions multiple constellations of small satellites in low Earth orbit for rapid data relay, ballistic and hypersonic missile tracking, and 'fire control' for missile interceptors, as well as their associated ground systems. SDA also is looking at the potential of equipping some of the PWSA-related birds with capabilities to back up the Global Positioning System satellites used for positioning, navigation and timing. Morani's memo also seems to explain the decision by the Air Force not to elevate the agency's deputy, Ryan Frigm, to serve as acting director in the wake of the department's Jan. 16 decision to place then-SDA director Derek Tournear on administrative leave for undisclosed reasons. Instead, the Air Force first assigned Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, the head of SSC, to step in, and then just two days ago replaced him with William Blauser, deputy head of the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office. The changeover came following concerns expressed by Sen. Kevin Cramer, R.-ND, that the choice of Garrant appeared to be a move to subordinate SDA to SSC in defiance of the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act that stipulated the agency remain a separate organization, with a direct line to Space Force chief Gen. Chance Saltzman. 'Removing Derek Tournear from his duties as SDA director sends a chilling message to all DoD innovators: bureaucrats will oppose you and win every time,' Cramer said in a Feb. 5 statement to Breaking Defense. 'By putting SDA under the control of SSC, it only compounded that warning. Congress specifically spelled out that SDA would be a direct reporting unit within Space Force, so we corrected the latter situation. We need to fix the former issue as soon as possible.'

President Trump should base a new anti-terrorism team for the Pacific in American Samoa	Members of the Fleet Anti-terrorism Security Team Pacific, 2nd Company, 2nd Platoon, pictured in 2012. (U.S. Navy/James Norman) In the Pacific, the Trump Administration has inherited a set of US embassies and consulates that is different from the one that they managed during their prior term in office. Since then, the regional diplomatic footprint has expanded to include new embassies in Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu. The administration therefore needs to think carefully about what US military posture changes are needed to be able to mitigate the diplomatic security risks for US embassies, consulates, and consular agencies in Fiji, French Polynesia, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Vanuatu — all areas of interest for the US as it seeks to counter China. One simple solution: The president and the Pentagon should consider the activation of a new Fleet Anti-Terrorism Security Team (FAST) Company South Pacific, an elite unit of Marines which can be rapidly deployed to immediately secure US diplomats, officials, embassies or other US personnel or property. The Marine Corps Security Force Regiment has a small number of FAST Companies that are forward deployed to overseas military bases, including in Bahrain, Spain and Japan. These OCONUS forces provide Geographic Combatant Commanders with a unique set of rapid response expeditionary anti-terrorism and security capabilities that can be used to protect national assets and conduct other limited duration contingency operations. Among other things, the FAST Companies provide Geographic Combatant Commanders with a unique set of capabilities for rapidly responding to non-traditional security threats against US diplomatic missions and their staff. A well-known example would be the 2012 attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi. Adding a second FAST unit in the Pacific would send a loud signal that the US government is committed to making investments necessary to protect the safety and security of US diplomatic personnel and military forces across this vast region. It would also be logistically sound, as the current Asia-Pacific FAST Company is located in Japan but has responsibilities in the entire Pacific region. A second FAST would provide a much-needed rapid response and forward-deployed expeditionary anti-terrorism security forces that could also respond to other non-traditional crises involving US diplomatic and military postures in the Pacific Islands. If the DoD determines that such an investment is warranted, then they should next consider where to station the unit. In our opinion, the best option would be to select the Pele US Army Reserve Center in American Samoa. American Samoa has the air and maritime port infrastructure that is required to be able to respond to the full range of possible crises and contingencies. It is also the US permanently inhabited territory in closest proximity to our new and planned diplomatic posts in Melanesia and Polynesia. That makes it an optimal location for projecting rapid response and forward-deployed expeditionary security forces for the purpose of ensuring diplomatic security across the region. President Donald Trump has openly criticized how the Obama administration responded to the attack on Benghazi that resulted in the deaths of United States Ambassador Christopher Stevens and American diplomat Sean Smith. He has criticized how the Biden Administration mitigated the known threats associated with the Kabul Airlift that resulted in the deaths of over a dozen American service members. FAST Companies can help on the front line of threats to Americans abroad under his new administration. And decisions can be made quickly about them — the National Security Council could order an assessment of FAST Companies within 60 days, and come out of that with posture recommendations. If such a review happens, it will become obvious that in the South Pacific, the United States government faces a number of challenges. The biggest is that there is a high level of risk for either natural or manmade crises in a number of countries that host US diplomatic missions. There is also the risk of major power competition destabilizing the region even further. A FAST Company South Pacific could help to mitigate both of those risks. From the CCP focus on the region to the possibility of the aftermath following any natural disaster at the location of a US embassy in the Pacific Islands, there are increasing reasons to have FAST capabilities in readiness in the South Pacific. Stationing a FAST unit in American Samoa would strengthen the hand of US diplomacy in the South Pacific and bolster the sense of US presence and attention among allied partnerships in the island nations. Rep. Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen is the Member of Congress representing American Samoa in the United States House of Representatives. Michael Walsh is a subject matter expert on Pacific Affairs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/president-trump-should-base-a-new-anti-terrorism-team-for-the-pacific-in-american-samoa/	2025-02-07T08:08:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/FLEET-security-scaled-e1738877919994.jpg
Israel completes next round of counter drone testing with guns, interceptors	Officials pose with some of the technology shown off at the counter drone demonstration in Israel. (Israeli MoD photo) JERUSALEM — The Israeli Ministry of Defense has completed a new round of trials testing various counter-drone solutions, the ministry said in a Feb. 5 statement, as the military here seeks an accelerated focus on the unmanned threat. The latest test run, focused on countering smaller drone threats, involved the nine Israeli companies and twenty 'advanced counter-drone technologies,' the ministry said. The trials took place in southern Israel’s Negev desert, where there is ample space for downing drones without any civilians around. 'The UAV threat is an evolving and multi-arena threat that has expanded to all our combat sectors, led by Iran and its proxies,' Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz said in the statement in which he described the c-UAS effort as a 'national' priority. 'Against our enemies, we are committed to continue advancing and introducing new capabilities to the battlefield in the near term. We will act to ensure maximum protection for our citizens and forces on the ground against UAVs from Iran, Yemen, Lebanon, and any arena where we may be required to respond,' Katz said. During the recent multi-front war that Israel fought in the wake of the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, the country faced numerous complex drone threats. Hundreds of drone attacks were carried out by Hezbollah. The Houthis in Yemen also were able to penetrate Israel’s airspace in July 2024 with a drone attack on Tel Aviv. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias also launched numerous drones at Israel. The drones come in various shapes and sizes, most of them several meters long and with a wingspan of approximately two meters with a warhead at the front of the fuselage. But smaller quadcopter and other drone threats also emerged as a problem for Israel; the Ukraine war has illustrated the exponential growth that drones have had on the modern battlefield. Hence, the new focus on c-UAS systems. The original trials back in October were initiated by Maj. Gen. (Res) Eyal Zamir, who has been tapped as the IDF’s next Chief of Staff — meaning a key figure in this push for finding new technology will soon have his hand on the helm of the IDF if it takes delivery of these new systems. The IDF is also partnering with the US Department of Defense Irregular Warfare Technical Support Directorate (IWTSD) in this effort, the ministry noted. The NDAA for fiscal year 2024 included authorization for US-Israel counter-UAS cooperation, and the Israeli military was keen to point out American participation in the most recent trials. 'With more than twenty U.S. C-UAS experts from across the DoD participating in the blind test, this event plays a critical role in fostering cooperation between the nations, rapidly enhancing joint defense capabilities, and improving the chances of success,' the MoD said. 'Following the analysis of current trial results, the IMOD plans to select several technologies for accelerated development and production processes, aiming to deploy new operational capabilities immediately,' the ministry added. The methods of interception appear to break down into two broad categories. One is the use of guns or projectiles to shoot down the drones. The second method is to use drones to take down drones, either having a drone run into a drone or having it drop a net onto a drone. Laser interceptors did not seem to be a main focus of the trials, even though Israel has focused on developing various laser technologies for intercepting threats over the last several years. As to who attended the trial, it was a mix of major firms and smaller companies. Elbit Systems and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) both showcased various means of detecting drones and then shooting them down using a 30mm cannon. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems also brought its Mini Typhoon gun to the trial. All these companies have years of experience developing various systems for detecting and guarding against drone threats. Xtend, in cooperation with Axioma and Elbit Systems, demonstrated an advanced drone-based interception system, essentially using a drone to take down a drone. Airobotics, Tamar Group, General Robotics, Smartshooter, Robotican and Elisra also demonstrated other concepts. Most of these companies participated in the first round of trials back in October. 'In the coming months, we will select the most suitable capabilities and implement them extensively throughout the IDF,' the head of Planning and Force Build-Up Directorate, Maj. Gen. Eyal Harel, said in a statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/israel-completes-next-round-of-counter-drone-testing-with-guns-interceptors/	2025-02-07T06:14:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/MOD5February5-israeli-mod-drone-e1738936540301.jpg
India budget boosted 9.5%, but analysts say pensions hindering weapons spending	INS VIkrant with 4 MiG-29K fighters (Indian government) CANBERRA — India's defense budget is soaring by 9.53 percent, to a record high of 681, 210 crore ($78.8 billion) for 2025-2026, according to a new announcement from Delhi. And though more than a quarter of that record total will be put toward new equipment, analysts say the country must do more to restructure the military's pension-heavy spending to concentrate even further on building more and better weapons, in the face of challenges at its borders with Pakistan, China and beyond. 'With spending skewed towards pensions, the status quo must give way to a more ambitious restructuring,' says a report by Harsh Pant and Kartik Bommakanti of the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. They note that salaries, pensions, maintenance, repairs, and infrastructure constitute 72 percent of the total defense budget. 'The government cannot entirely overlook the need to evaluate and determine expenditure based on the military threats and capabilities of China and Pakistan, as well as their military expenditures relative to India’s,' their report says. Similarly, Ian Hall, a professor at Griffith University in Queensland, said in an email that salaries and pensions 'consume a very big slice of the budget,' noting that while the overall budget is almost 10% larger than last year's, the budget for weapons 'has only grown by a bit over 4.5%' despite inflation running at at least 5 percent in India. Hall also said that 'the overall budget remains low in terms of percentage of GDP — about 1.9%, in fact, which is unsustainably low, given the threats India faces from Pakistan and China, and indeed in the Northeast, due to spillovers from Myanmar and so on.' According to analyst Neelanjana Banerjee, the budget breaks down like this: India Defense Budget: Key Weapons Spending: The 'big strategic questions,' Hall said, are 'does India have what it needs to hold its own on the Line of Actual Control with China and can it sustain the deployments it has had to make since 2020, and what contribution can India make in maritime security in the Indian Ocean and perhaps beyond?' That's a reference to the conflict that broke out along India's border with China in 2020, where it suffered 20 dead in the Galwan Valley. The eerie combat was fought at high altitude by slow moving soldiers wielding sticks and clubs. At least four Chinese soldiers died. Hall says India can 'probably, but only just' control the line. 'India desperately needs drones, air defense systems, better tanks and fighting vehicles, fighter aircraft, and especially helicopters,' Hall said. Pant and Hall agreed that India's sluggish procurement system has not been good at delivering on major systems. 'We're still waiting for systems to be selected and contracts to be signed in a range of really important areas &#8211; especially a new batch of conventional submarines, but also fighter aircraft,' Hall said. That may have to change under US President Donald Trump, who has threatened India with tariffs while also urging the Indo-Pacific power to boost 'its procurement of American-made security equipment and moving toward a fair bilateral trading relationship.' (Politico reported today that Indian leader Narendra Modi will be visiting Washington on Feb. 13.) Many of the advanced systems that India needs will continue to come from foreign countries, Pant told Breaking Defense today in a phone interview. And Trump's pressure is likely to result in 'a lot of these sort of big, big ticket buy ins happening over the next few years, trying to satisfy Mr. Trump that India is engaged with the US on defense,' he said. But most of the weapons budget, known as the capital acquisitions budget has been allocated to locally-built systems. That program — the Atmanirbhar Bharat — has successfully boosted the amount of weapons and parts produced by Indian companies. 'India’s defense sector has undergone a remarkable transformation since 2014, evolving from a largely import-dependent military force to one increasingly focused on self-reliance and indigenous production,' a government statement released on Feb. 1 said. But India sees the Indian Ocean as a critical waterway in need of regular patrols to help monitor and counter Chinese submarines and surface ships. But the slow pace of defense procurement has not helped much. 'On a strategic basis, India does have 65-odd ships on order, but it needs more, faster, and it needs better and longer-range submarines, plus aircraft,' Hall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/india-budget-boosted-9-5-but-analysts-say-pensions-hindering-weapons-spending/	2025-02-06T23:04:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/INS_VIkrant_R11_underway_in_the_Arabian_Sea_with_4_Mig-29K_Fighter_Jet_performing_flypast-e1738878037421.jpg
Navy awards several contracts aimed at advancing key mine countermeasures capabilities	The Mine Countermeasures Unmanned Surface Vehicle is recovered onboard the Manchester (LCS 14) during a testing activity. (Photo courtesy of US Navy) WASHINGTON — The US Navy says it has recently made a series of contract awards to advance the mine countermeasures mission package (MCM MP) slated to deploy on its Littoral Combat Ships. 'With the first deliveries of the MCM MP underway and deployments closely following, it is critical to ensure we have the contracts in place to procure and deliver the quantity of mission packages to the Fleet required in today’s changing world,' said Capt. Matthew Lehmann, LCS Mission Modules program manager. 'These contract awards ensure our Littoral Combat Ships will continue to receive the modernized MCM equipment needed to conduct their missions, allowing our sailors to operate safely and stay outside of the minefield.' The MCM mission package is comprised of a dozen capabilities that, when working in tandem, are designed to clear the water of buried and bottomed mines. Its development and deployment paves the way for the service’s legacy MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopters and Avenger-class MCM ships to be retired. The awarded contracts include a $7.7 million advanced material order to Bollinger Shipyards, which focuses on procuring items needed to address findings from the operational testing done on the MCM Unmanned Surface Vehicle. That USV is one of the mission package’s key capabilities, and is able to be deployed off an LCS or other vessel of opportunity. The drone is designed to be capable of minesweeping, hunting and neutralization. 'The Navy also awarded a production contract for the Minehunt Payload Delivery System (MH PDS) to Raytheon Technologies. This contract is valued at $18.3 million to produce five units with deliveries by the end of FY26,' according to the service’s statement. 'Additionally, the Navy awarded a production contract for the Minesweep Payload Delivery System (MS PDS) to Textron Systems. This contract is valued at $12.1 million to produce four units, for delivery early in FY27,' the statement continued. The Raytheon-made system is an 'acoustic and magnetic' minesweeping capability, while the Textron-made system uses an 'AN/AQS-20 sonar to perform mine hunting missions.' 'As we continue to face evolving threats in the littoral environment, these investments not only enhance our operational readiness but also demonstrate our commitment to safeguarding our Sailors and maintaining a competitive edge,' said Rear Adm. Kevin Smith, PEO USC program executive officer. 'By modernizing and expanding our MCM mission packages, we are providing our forces with the tools necessary to maintain access to key maritime regions and keep global shipping lanes safe.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/navy-awards-several-contracts-aimed-at-advancing-key-mine-countermeasures-capabilities/	2025-02-06T13:10:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/220810_navy_usv_mcm_larger.png
‘Defending the skies,’ France delivers first Mirage 2000 fighters to Ukraine	Members of Marine Aerial Refueler Squadron-234, (VMGR-234) provide aerial refueling to French Mirage 2000 Fighters from a K C-130J over Djibouti (US Air Force) BELFAST — France has delivered Mirage 2000 fourth-generation fighter jets to Ukraine in a much needed strike capability boost for Kyiv as it continues to combat Russian forces. 'The first of them arrived in Ukraine today,' Sébastien Lecornu, France’s Armed Forces Minister, said of the Dassault-made aircraft deliveries in a translated X post. The planes will be mainly deployed to carry out air-to-ground strikes. 'With Ukrainian pilots on board who have been trained for several months in France, they will now participate in defending the skies of Ukraine,' Lecornu added. He did not disclose the exact number of aircraft delivered, but various reports state France’s National Assembly has previously shared that six Mirage 2000-5 platforms would be sent. Western nations, which have also supplied Ukraine with US-made F-16 fourth-generation jets have typically not commented on aircraft quantities upon delivery due to operational security concerns. Sharing details of the plan to send the Mirage jets to Ukraine, Lecornu said last year that they would be equipped with air-to-ground weapons and new electronic warfare equipment. Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the new aircraft deliveries on X, calling them 'another significant step in strengthening Ukraine’s security.' He added, 'With the latest deliveries, we are also continuing to expand our F-16 fleet, with the Netherlands fulfilling its commitments to support this effort.' As of July 2024, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway had collectively agreed to supply around 80 F-16s to Kyiv under an air force capability coalition, which includes 16 nations in all. Additionally, Denmark, Romania, the UK and the US host Ukraine pilot training for the jet. In the early stages of the war, Ukraine was forced to rely predominately on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion, though officials and experts have said the supply of F-16s won’t be a silver bullet. Zelensky has also pushed hard for supplies of Swedish Gripen fighter jets, but according to Swedish Minister of Defence Pal Jonson, other allies requested such a plan be put on hold to accommodate Kyiv first getting to grips with the F-16. Meanwhile, a key shift in leadership for the multinational Ukraine Defense Contact Group appears to be on the way after the Trump administration reportedly told the UK to take on the role of chair for a new meeting next week, in what would be a first for London. The Times newspaper said that UK Defence Secretary John Healey will become the new chair, which has been exclusively held by the US since 2022, though it remains unclear if the change is a one-off or if a rotational style involving different countries will be implemented going forward. The Office of the Secretary of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment. US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to lead a US delegation when the group meets at the Ramstein Airbase in Germany. The supposed pivot by President Donald Trump would mark a significant departure from Ukraine military aid policy under the Biden administration, with former US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin imploring the 50-member-strong group not to 'flinch,' 'falter,' or 'fail,' during a farewell address last month.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/defending-the-skies-france-delivers-first-mirage-2000-fighters-to-ukraine/	2025-02-06T11:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/6661467-scaled-e1718200536958.jpg
Exclusive: Here’s who Hegseth may task to put together Trump’s Iron Dome plan	A ground-based interceptor is launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, toward a ballistic missile target launched from Alaska during a test Dec. 5, 2008. (Photo courtesy of the Missile Defense Agency) WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has been drafted an all-hands-on-deck memo for crafting an action plan to deploy a comprehensive missile shield over the United States, including readying a budget request for fiscal 2026, Breaking Defense has learned. The undated, unsigned 'strategic guidance,' obtained by Breaking Defense, lays out a two-phase process — led by the undersecretary for policy and supported by the assistant secretary for space policy — for meeting the 60-day deadline set by President Donald Trump in his Jan. 27 'Iron Dome for America' executive order. That deadline requires a DoD action plan to substantiate a 'next-generation missile shield &#8230; against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.' Former Heritage Foundation adviser Alexander Velez-Green is currently 'performing the duties' of the USD-policy role while Elbridge Colby awaits confirmation. John Hill, who served in the space policy office both under the first Trump administration and the Biden administration, is now performing the duties of assistant secretary for space policy. The memo is a draft, and things can change quickly in the Pentagon. But even if details change before a final memo goes out, the draft provides a preview of who will likely be the drivers on what could be Trump's signature national defense project. When OSD was asked for comment on the memo and when Hegseth may sign it, a defense official said: 'We don’t have anything to announce at this time.' As a first step, by Feb. 28 the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, DoD components, military departments, combatant commands and the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) are to put together three 'scalable reference architectures' for 'small, medium and large options' for the shield using 'kinetic and non-kinetic' weapon systems. Estimated costs are to be provided for each option. Plans for specific elements to be included in each of those options are tasked to interagency working groups. Work on a plan to 'accelerate a Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor Layer' is tasked to Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman, 'in coordination' with the DoD policy shop, Cost Assessment and Program Office (CAPE), and Office of Acquisition &amp; Sustainment, as well as the MDA director. Saltzman also is to submit a plan for the custody layer of the Space Development Agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. The custody layer is being designed to maintain 'weapons quality tracks for time-critical targets, coupled with low-latency space data transport' to 'enable the creation of a targeting solution from the sensor to the warfighter in operationally relevant timelines,' according to the agency's website. The DoD undersecretary for Research &amp; Engineering is to coordinate with DoD Policy, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Space Force and the DoD undersecretary for Intelligence and Security to craft a plan for a large constellation of kinetic and non-kinetic space-based interceptors, including for boost-phase intercept shortly after a missile launches. The Research &amp; Engineering office also is develop an 'assessment' of the potential for directed-energy weapons as part of the architecture and funding options for doing so. The MDA director — in coordination with the secretaries of the Army and Navy, the Joint Chiefs chairman, and the commanders of US Northern Command and US Strategic Command — is responsible for planning 'underlayer' and terminal-phases capabilities to 'defeat a countervalue attack.' Under the second phase of Hegseth's draft Iron Dome action plan, with results due in mid-March, tasking orders are laid out for: Lastly, DoD and the State Department are tasked to complete an allied and theater missile defense review by May 15.

Honeywell to divide business into three parts, separating aerospace unit	A Honeywell office in Atlanta, Georgia, US, on Wednesday, Oct. 25, 2023. Honeywell International Inc. released earnings figures on October 26. Photographer: Elijah Nouvelage/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — Honeywell will split itself into three separate companies, the company said today as it announced a plan to break up its automation and aerospace businesses in addition to a previously-announced spin off of its advanced materials unit. 'Unprecedented demand' in both commercial and defense aerospace sectors led to the company’s decision to break off that division as a standalone, public company, Honeywell CEO Vimal Kapur said in a statement. The company plans to complete the separation of its the automation and aerospace businesses in the back half of 2026, pending regulatory approvals. The spin off of its advanced materials business, announced in October, is slated to occur in late 2025 or 2026, the company said. 'The formation of three independent, industry-leading companies builds on the powerful foundation we have created, positioning each to pursue tailored growth strategies, and unlock significant value for shareholders and customers,' Kapur said. 'Our simplification of Honeywell has rapidly advanced over the past year, and we will continue to shape our portfolio to create further shareholder value,' he added. 'We have a rich pipeline of strategic bolt-on acquisition targets, and we plan to continue deploying capital to further enhance each business as we prepare them to become leading, independent public companies.' Honeywell’s defense activities are concentrated inside its aerospace unit, which will be spun off into the standalone Honeywell Aerospace. The business logged $15 billion in revenue in 2024 and produces a laundry list of aviation technologies such as engines, avionics, and cockpit and navigation systems. The separation plan, which was announced following the completion of a portfolio evaluation led by Honeywell’s board of directors, mirrors the recent breakup of industrial heavyweight General Electric. The legacy GE completed the three-way split of its aerospace, energy and health care businesses last April, with the company’s defense engine business now residing inside GE Aerospace. The Honeywell split also occurs amid pressure from an activist investor, Elliott Investment Management, which called for the breakup last year, reported The Wall Street Journal. Elliott Partner Marc Steinberg and Managing Partner Jesse Cohn praised the decision in Honeywell’s statement announcing the move, saying that 'the enhanced focus, alignment, and strategic agility enabled by this separation will allow Honeywell to realize the opportunity for operational improvement and valuation upside.' Defense and space sales in Honeywell’s aerospace unit grew by 14 percent in fourth-quarter 2024 due to 'ongoing global demand and further supply chain improvements,' the company said in earnings today. In 2023, Honeywell made about $4.9 billion in defense-related revenue, or about 14 percent of its overall revenue, according to Defense News 2024 ranking of the top 100 defense companies by revenue.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/honeywell-to-divide-business-into-three-parts-separating-aerospace-unit/	2025-02-06T10:00:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240724_honeywell_building_GettyImages-1745952145-scaled-e1721840284972.jpg
The secret to delivering Trump’s Iron Dome program	Rockets fired by Palestinian militants from Gaza City are intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome defence missile system in the early hours of October 8, 2023. (Photo by EYAD BABA / AFP) (Photo by EYAD BABA/AFP via Getty Images) There is no leadership principle more universally recognized and validated than this: 'You get what you reward.' Whether training service dogs at New Skete Monastery or deploying an 'Iron Dome' missile defense system in orbit, the key to success is the same: Incentivize the right behaviors and, just as crucially, refuse to reward the wrong ones. Yet, when it comes to urgent national security needs, Washington’s default response follows an all-too-familiar script. Bureaucrats dust off a sole-source, cost-plus contract, hand it to one of the usual defense primes, and rush out a press release touting their 'responsiveness.' The result? Decades-long, bloated 'space programs to nowhere' that consume billions without ever delivering an operational system. These no-bid, cost-reimbursed contracts primarily reward primes with well-connected lobbyists and overhead schemes designed to game the system — not those actually capable of solving the problem. Worse, they incentivize spending over results: As long as the program continues, so does the flow of money. That challenge is no longer hypothetical. Last month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order launching 'Iron Dome for America' — a bold initiative aimed at defending the US against ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missile threats. On paper, it’s exactly the kind of forward-thinking defense program the nation needs; in practice, whether it delivers on its promise or becomes another expensive boondoggle depends entirely on the execution. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has made it clear that this project is a priority, aligning with the administration’s broader push to modernize US military capabilities. To jumpstart the effort, the DoD has been given just 60 days to produce a comprehensive implementation plan — a breakneck pace for a government program of this scale. But urgency alone isn’t enough. So how do we ensure that the Iron Dome for America doesn’t become another example of wasted billions and unmet promises? The answer lies in rewarding the right behaviors — those that drive results, not bureaucratic inertia that will turn it into a punchline at some future Space Symposium. That means structuring the program to incentivize speed, efficiency, accountability, and common-sense leadership from day one. RELATED: How Trump’s ‘Iron Dome for America’ upends four decades of nuclear doctrine For the engineers and technicians designing these capabilities to raise an Iron Dome, the challenge is immense. But for Washington bureaucrats who need only to structure the contracts properly, it’s not much harder than applying basic common sense. And that part is decidedly not rocket science. For America’s Iron Dome, that means sticking to these non-negotiable principles: Is there an urgent need for an initial capability? Then make schedule your highest priority: Set a firm two-year delivery date if that's what it takes, with additional incentives for early completion. Write performance specifications that encourage the use of proven, state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf systems and subsystems — no reinventing the wheel just to pad development contracts. Want to further minimize schedule risk to the government? Demand proven technology: Select only companies with demonstrated flight heritage — those that have already put their satellites, rockets, and networks in orbit. These companies have either delivered for the government before or risked private capital to prove their capabilities. Unless absolutely necessary, do not fund the development of bespoke, military-unique technology that will become obsolete before it’s even deployed. Want to prevent contractor buy-in without real commitment? Make payment contingent on delivery: If you pay for billable hours, you’ll get a lot of them. But if you want actual missile defense capability, pay only for delivery. Fixed-price contracts should be the rule, not the exception. The defense industry has been running on a law firm model for too long — where revenue is based on the hours billed, not the results produced. Need to ensure long-term sustainability? Forget bureaucratic paper trails — lock in future support: Instead of buying endless reams of costing data and bills of materials that no one will ever read, bake in fixed-price options for maintenance and autonomous operations of on-orbit capabilities. If the government wants these systems to remain viable in the decades ahead, it needs to plan for that now — not scramble to figure it out later. The sheer size and importance of the American Iron Dome effort means it will inevitably end as either a case study in success or one of failure. The difference comes down to common sense leadership — whether decision-makers have the discipline to reward what works and refuse to incentivize what doesn’t. Of course, critics are already asking how we can afford a new program like this. But the real question isn’t how much we spend — it’s how well we spend it. Washington doesn’t necessarily need a top-line budget increase to make this happen. It needs better priorities. Right now, this initiative is at a crossroads. Follow the familiar path of unchecked spending and bureaucratic inertia, and it will become just another cautionary tale. But if it stays fiscally disciplined, technologically adaptive, and relentlessly results-driven, it can set a new standard for national security programs. Anything less, and America’s Iron Dome won’t be a breakthrough. It will be just another over-promised, under-delivered venture — one we can’t afford to repeat.

When the stakes for space missions are at their highest, solid rocket motors meet the challenge	Northrop Grumman’s solid propulsion technology ensures durability, readiness and versatility for a wide range of applications — from supporting NASA’s human spaceflight missions and commercial launch applications to safeguarding U.S. and allied defense systems. (Northrop Grumman photo) From launching deep-space probes to intercepting threats, the need for robust propulsion systems is greater than ever. High-stakes missions like national defense and space exploration demand solid rocket motors (SRMs) that are not only powerful but also reliable and ready at a moment’s notice. Northrop Grumman has met that demand, and over the past six decades has produced more than 1.3 million SRMs that have made a critical difference in powering the world’s most challenging and vital missions. 'The innovation and scale at Northrop Grumman is remarkable, especially if you understand the complexity of these systems and the technology required to build them' said Jim Kalberer, the company’s vice president of propulsion systems. Advancing space exploration and defense Northrop Grumman’s SRMs are designed to meet the toughest demands in space exploration and defense. Launch vehicles rely on these SRMs to provide the power needed to break free from Earth’s gravity and carry essential payloads into orbit. SRMs enable deep-space probes and landers to push the boundaries of space travel. In defense applications, rapid response is crucial. The instant thrust provided by SRMs gives armed forces a tactical advantage, allowing missiles to intercept threats and maintain security.

Applied Intuition takes flight, sets sail in acquiring EpiSci	EpiSci contributed to DARPA's AI dogfighting algorithms, Air Combat Evolution (ACE), aboard the X-62A VISTA (shown here inverted). (Air Force photo by Kyle Brasier) WASHINGTON — Silicon Valley startups buy each other out all the time, but rarely with implications for the Pentagon. That’s not true for the latest news from Mountain View, Calif., home of autonomy developer Applied Intuition, which is acquiring a smaller California drone firm called EpiSci. It’s a marriage of two military contractors on the cutting-edge of unmanned vehicles, meant to combine Applied’s experience in ground systems, like autonomous freight trucks and the Army’s Robotic Combat Vehicle, with EpiSci’s expertise in the sea and air, executives told Breaking Defense. This merger is all about adding capabilities, not cutting costs, Applied co-founders Qasar Younis and Peter Ludwig said in an interview. 'We’re not letting anybody go, we’re not doing any redundancies, we’re not doing any lay-offs, or anything like that,' Younis said. 'We’re keeping EpiSci intact, [because] they do the things we don’t do and we do the things they don’t do.' 'They’re actually famous within their domain,' Ludwig added. That domain gets pretty broad: EpiSci works for DARPA on unmanned air-to-air-combat, for the Navy on unmanned surface vessels and drones, for the Space Development Agency on missile-tracking satellites, and for NASA on bringing 5G connectivity to the moon, among other federal contracts. At Applied, by contrast, 'historically, all our of autonomy work has been really focused on ground, so it’s cars, trucks, it’s construction, mining,' Younis said. 'We’ve done some things in the air but nothing like EpiSci. We’ve always thought, the last few years, it’d be great to get into autonomy in the air or maritime or space, [and] EpiSci actually plays in all those domains.' To understand 'the complementary nature of the companies,' Ludwig went on, it’s crucial to understand that not all robots are created equal. Teaching a computer to navigate a complex, cluttered, but essentially two-dimensional surface — like an Army RCV maneuvering around obstacles off-road — is very different from mastering movement in three dimensions with far fewer obstacles, as through the air, sea or outer space. Roughly speaking, Ludwig told Breaking Defense, about 75 percent of the software modules required to operate autonomous vehicles can be shared across environments. These are general-purpose algorithms that ingest, interpret, and output data (such as sensor feeds) in ways that apply equally to driving, sailing and flying. But, he said, 25 percent of the code absolutely does need to be customized to the challenges of the specific 'domain,' or else you get a very clever robot that can’t actually go anywhere. Applied’s general-purpose modules are 'a very mature solution for that common base layer,' he said, and it’s solid in the off-road domain. But EpiSci brings the 'domain-specific algorithms … that actually work in that three-dimensional space,' Ludwig said. The two companies are different in other ways as well. Applied, though several years younger than EpiSci, has grown faster and bigger (its latest valuation is $6 billion), has sponsored DC-area conferences, made highly public pitches to the Pentagon, and it’s delivered commercial vehicles and software in use by 'thousands of engineers globally,' Younis said. By contrast, he continued, 'EpiSci’s historically been a research organization, and that’s where their real strengths are. The trick for Applied will be to bring their ambition, scale, and ground-system expertise to EpiSci’s deep technical knowledge of its domains, without diluting either partner’s core competencies in the process.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/applied-intuition-takes-flight-sets-sail-in-acquiring-episci/	2025-02-06T02:30:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/inverted-x-plane-220826-F-DB956-1974-scaled-e1738792060822.jpeg
One deployment, three ships and a whole lot of challenges	The USS Somerset (LPD-25) last year was tasked with the unusual assignment of deploying ahead of the two other ships in its assigned amphibious ready group (US Navy Photo by Seaman Kelsey Hockenberger/Released) WASHINGTON — When the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) was preparing for a deployment to the western pacific in the back half of 2023, they received news that the commanding officer later described as 'unprecedented.' The Somerset (LPD-25), one of the three key ships slated to deploy, would get underway two months ahead of the rest of the amphibious ready group (ARG). That Somerset would leave earlier than the other two ships — Boxer (LHD-4) and Harpers Ferry (LSD-49) — was unprecedented because an ARG, the complement of Navy vessels that transports Marines and their gear, is designed to work in conjunction with one another. 'The challenge for us was the employment model changed, but our requirements did not,' said Marine Corps Col. Sean Dynan, who was the 15th MEU’s commanding officer during the deployment. 'We were still a crisis response force forward, and we ended up eventually responding to crisis' when called upon. (Dynan relinquished command of the MEU last month.) It was a rocky start to what ended up being an exceedingly challenging deployment for Dynan and Capt. James Robinson, the commodore of the amphibious squadron deploying alongside the MEU. Starting in January and spanning through most of 2024, the 15th MEU and Amphibious Squadron-5 completed nine major exercises; visited 11 foreign countries; responded to a typhoon that hit the Philippines; and completed 80 operations over the course of 10 months. Similar to any large formation of military units, every ship in the ARG has its part to play and capabilities that work in tandem with one another. Asking the Somerset to deploy ahead of the rest of the ARG-MEU was challenging because it fundamentally changed how the Navy and Marine Corps had prepared to employ their forces. 'What that required us to do was to build out self-contained staffs aboard each of the ships that could operate independently for an extended period of time,' Dynan explained. Just days after it initially deployed in April, the Boxer (LHD-4) was forced back to San Diego to fix a variety of maintenance issues. The derailed deployment made headlines due to the ship’s history with maintenance problems. Robinson said that for most exercises and operations, the ARG was able to substitute in other ships or capabilities to compensate for Boxer’s absence. But he did concede there was at least one 'OAI' — an acronym short for 'operations, activities and investments' — that was missed due to the ship’s maintenance problems. The 15th MEU was also the first unit to employ the ACV in real operations. In recent years, the Marine Corps has had a number of mishaps involving their amphibious vehicles, and one of those mishaps occurred during the 15th MEU’s training cycles at Camp Pendleton in California. That mishap, a rollover, killed one Marine and injured more than a dozen others. Dynan’s MEU deployed with 12 ACVs in tow, and, he said, 'it’s almost underwhelming to say that we learned a lot.' There were challenges in understanding how to maintain the vehicles while deployed and concerns about corrosion prevention. The MEU also had to coordinate sending beach survey teams ahead of the ACVs to check that conditions were safe. At one point, even the water temperatures were cause for a concern. Dynan recalled that the waters in the Philippines were particularly hot, and there were questions about whether the vehicle’s cooling systems would cope. 'That was somewhat of a surprise,' he added. The MEU’s training and deployment also coincided with the Pentagon’s three-month-long grounding of the V-22 Osprey fleet, including the Marine Corps’ MV-22 variant. RELATED: ‘Considerable’ effects: How the Osprey groundings hit one Navy wing 'We were the first unit to re-integrate, train and re-certify Ospreys with the [Marine Air Ground Task Force] just before the Boxer got underway again in June because they missed the two pre-deployment exercises,' Dynan said. Due to where the MEU was operating, Dynan said the restrictions the Pentagon left in place after the Osprey fleets returned to flight didn’t affect operations. But the missed training time did mean that his flight crews had to work fast to regain qualifications and proficiency once the grounding was lifted in April. Despite the bumps, the colonel ultimately praised the performance of the thousands of sailors and Marines who took part in the deployment. 'Through resilience and extraordinary efforts by leaders and individual Marines and Sailors and their families, we still executed a very successful non-standard deployment,' Dynan said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/one-deployment-three-ships-and-a-whole-lot-of-challenges/	2025-02-05T14:00:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/USS-Somerset-scaled-e1738782682703.jpg
Officials call for unified cyber standards for space systems	Crews at US Space Command's National Space Defense Center provide threat-focused space domain awareness. (US Space Force photo by Kathryn Damon) WASHINGTON — As information sharing between allies and partners becomes increasingly important in the space domain, the US needs to create a uniform set of cybersecurity standards for its space systems, government officials said Tuesday. Right now there are several entities and agencies who have or are working on their own set of cybersecurity standards for space systems. These include the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, OASIS and commercial providers. Additionally, a Biden-era executive order mandated practices that would protect commercial satellite systems against cyber attacks. But if all of these standards are siloed, it will be more difficult to share them with international allies and they won’t be useful in protecting space systems against adversarial threats, Lauryn Williams, former chief of staff in the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy, said during a Washington Business Space Roundtable discussion Tuesday. Williams said that a meeting with Japanese officials during her stint in the Office of the National Cyber Director prior to her most recent post was her catalyst for wanting to develop a clear set of cyber standards for space systems. 'The Japanese government turned to me as the kind of cyber person sitting at the table, and they said, very straightforwardly, &#8216;What is your cybersecurity policy? What is your cybersecurity standard?' We could not answer that question. I cannot answer that question,' she said. 'We need to be able to answer that question, so that we can lead because that was the indication that I got, was that the Japanese were looking to us to be able to say, ‘Here it is.’ So that they and many of our other international partners could take and build on it,' she added. 'I hope that we've got a piece of that answer now, not the entirety of it, but the world really is looking to us on this.' Erin Miller, executive director of the Space Information Sharing and Analysis Center (Space ISAC), echoed Williams’ need for a cohesive set of cyber standards. She noted that ideally one agency would be in charge of setting these standards; for example, the Department of Homeland Security. This, however, could be tricky since the federal government tends to fall behind commercial industry in terms of understanding cyber threats to space systems. 'There's a lot of [standards] that are available that we can look at. We actually formed a task force in Space ISAC to look at all of these different standards and see if we can get a comprehensive view of how to address risks for space systems,' Miller told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the event. 'But the challenge is that the commercial sector can do that, and organically we can come to a conclusion on how we're all going to manage sector risk, but it's still a commercial sector that's driving it. We need a complement from the federal government side to drive overall sector risk.' Both Williams and Miller made clear that such a set of uniformed cybersecurity standards would benefit international cooperation. Miller also used the opportunity to make her argument that space systems should be considered critical infrastructure. With this, she explained that another benefit to having the DHS in particular take on the responsibility of creating space cyber standards would be allowing space systems to be considered critical infrastructure, something the space community has been advocating for for several years. But the federal government maintains these systems do not qualify as critical infrastructure. 'Human lives depend on the security of space systems, and it's not just humans in the US. That's another challenge, is that DHS has primarily been responsible for critical infrastructure that humans in the US rely on, and so risk management is based on US lives, but this is a global conversation,' Miller told Breaking Defense. 'People across the whole world are dependent upon the space systems, and we have a lot of international sales and trade and commerce that's associated with our space systems and the use of them in countries around the world. So it's dynamic.' Though Miller said the DHS could be responsible for making the uniformed set of standards, she acknowledged that there is more than one agency capable of tracking critical infrastructure, so the DHS wouldn’t necessarily have to be the agency responsible for creating the standards. 'Space ISAC has heavily advocated that we have a designation of space systems as a critical infrastructure sector, and that's where DHS’s role is that they have a responsibility for critical infrastructure sectors, and they also share that responsibility with other agencies. So that's why this conversation of which agency is responsible is so challenging,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/officials-call-for-unified-cyber-standards-for-space-systems/	2025-02-05T12:42:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/SPACECOM-NSDC-SDA-ops-scaled-e1721331563372.jpeg
Air Force taps Rapid Capabilities Office deputy as acting SDA chief	The Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office is charged with speeding new capabilities to the field, such as the X-37B reusable space plane (Courtesy graphic by Boeing Space) WASHINGTON — The Air Force today announced that William Blauser, deputy head of the department's Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), has been appointed acting director of the Space Development Agency. The move comes in the wake of the Jan. 16 decision by the Air Force to place permanent director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. Blauser is taking over the acting role from Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander of the Space Force's primary acquisition command Space Systems Command. 'Given the importance of space acquisition programs, both the Space Development Agency and Space Systems Command require full-time leadership, and the Department of the Air Force has named Mr. Blauser as SDA’s new acting director,' the Air Force statement explained. Blauser, who came to Air Force RCO last July from Systems Technology and Research LLC in Arlington, Va., has had a long career in Defense Department acquisition, including of space systems at the National Reconnaissance Office. RCO is responsible for rapidly acquiring and fielding critical new weapon systems based on cutting-edge technologies, such as the X37B reusable spaceplane, according to an Air Force fact sheet. SDA directors are appointed by the DoD secretary, but do not require Senate confirmation. Tournear was appointed as the first permanent director in October 2019, when the agency was still under the purview of the Pentagon's Office of the Director of Research and Engineering. On Oct. 1, 2022 as mandated by Congress, the agency was transferred to the Department of the Air Force under the first-ever Senior Acquisition Executive for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli. The Air Force continues to refuse comment on the reason Tournear was placed on administrative leave — a decision made by Calvelli and approved by then-Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall. However, as Breaking Defense was first to report, the issue being investigated by the department's Office of the Inspector General is related to Tournear's actions in the run up to an SDA grant award now under protest by Viasat. According to a Jan. 4, 2024 Department of the Air Force guidance document (DAF Instruction 90-301, PDF), such investigations have a deadline of 150 days for completion, pending any 'extraordinary circumstances' or the need for higher-level DoD IG review. An Air force spokesperson today declined to comment on the rules regarding the investigation or the timeline for its likely conclusion. Meanwhile, Viasat's September protest against two SDA prototypes awards worth approximately $424 million for 20 total (10 each) Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) – Gamma variant prototype space vehicles to York Space Systems and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems in the US Court of Federal Claims has yet to be resolved, according to court documents. Under the case, DoD and SDA admitted to a need for 'corrective action' and initially offered to remediate Viasat's complaints by halting work on both rewards pending a review. Updates to that initial offer have been placed under seal, but several industry sources have told Breaking Defense that while Tyvak's work has been halted, York's has not and instead the company is continuing toward preliminary design review of its 10 prototypes. Interestingly, Tyvak's corporate parent Lockheed Martin on Jan. 30 filed a request to be given access to the court documents under seal. Lockheed Martin bought Tyvak's former parent Terran Orbital in October 2024. Lockheed Martin did not respond by press time to a request for comment.

Boosting ties with the Gulf, Turkish Aselsan opens new office in Oman	ASELSAN a defense electronics company display air defense, radar, electronic warfare, electro-optics, avionics, guidance, land and weapon systems, communication, satellite and space, command and control systems during the Farnborough International Airshow 2024 at Farnborough International Exhibition and Conference Centre on July 23, 2024 in Farnborough, England. (Photo by John Keeble/Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish electronics giant Aselsan will inaugurate its first office in the Sultanate of Oman, on the Southern border of the Arabian peninsula, 'as part of its global expansion strategy,' the firm said in a statement today. 'This new office is aimed at enhancing the company’s ability to provide better services to its partners in Oman,' the company announcement said, highlighting its endeavor to foster 'its existence in the Middle East and Gulf region with its office in Oman.' Aselsan has already established offices and branches in other Arab states states, including the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Jordan. Hence, this new office aims to boost its presence in the region rather than initiating it. Aselsan develops defense electronics platforms including electronic warfare software, radar systems, electro optics, and communication capabilities. It is also a member of the consortium of Turkish firms developing the Steel Dome air defense system. 'It is a great honor to be here for the opening of ASELSAN's Muscat office in Oman. In recent years, the Turkish defense industry has achieved remarkable global success through the technologies it has developed and its growing exports. This new office is a testament to that success, reflecting our commitment to deepening our ties with the Gulf Region,' Turkish Secretary of Defense Industries Haluk Görgün said in the statement. He expressed his confidence that the office will deepen ties between Turkey and Oman. Aselsan CEO Ahmet Akyol said that the new office will focus on 'marketing, business development, customer satisfaction, and providing comprehensive post-sales support for end users of Aselsan technologies.' The inauguration of the office follows Aselsan's announcement that it set a defense export record of $1 billion in 2024. During 2024,Turkish defense exports surged to $7.15 Billion. Speaking about the broader reproachment of Turkey and the Gulf states, Serhat Süha Çubukçuoğlu, an expert at Trends Research &amp; Advisory in Abu Dhabi, told Breaking Defense that 'there is a clear synergy between Turkey’s know-how and the Gulf’s tremendous resource endowments.' 'Gulf countries aim to diversify their economies to prepare for the post-oil era and make an impact on emerging fields such as AI and robotics. They want to leap ahead to catch the AI revolution and become high-tech manufacturing hubs in West Asia,' he said. Çubukçuoğlu added that 'Turkey sits as an alternative supplier with less or no strings attached, no political conditionalities in arms exports — unlike the EU and the US, which puts it at an advantage. Its suits the Gulf countries’ goal is to boost their defense economies and be able to act in a more autonomous fashion, to reduce their reliance on Western security guarantees.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/boosting-ties-with-the-gulf-turkish-aselsan-opens-new-office-in-oman/	2025-02-05T10:13:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/GettyImages-2164323220-scaled-e1723138468790.jpg
Saab doubles up on Giraffe 1X radar capacity with grand opening of UK production base	Saab's Giraffe 1X Compact Radar Module has been designed for fast paced, short range air surveillance missions (Saab) FAREHAM, UK — Swedish manufacturer Saab celebrated the addition of a second Giraffe 1X short range air surveillance radar production line after formally opening a state-of the art manufacturing facility in Fareham, Southeast England. The new site, which will also support in-service UK military radars supplied by Saab and play host to the company’s Seaeye underwater robotics family of vehicles, was opened on Tuesday by Jonathan Reynolds, UK business secretary. The manufacturer has taken the unconventional step of pre-empting Giraffe 1X demand by starting production of the 3D Active Electronically Scanned Array (EASA) radar on the new line without securing additional UK or export orders. In 2023, London ordered 11 of the systems under two contracts valued at 264 SEK ($25.6 million). That batch has been produced out of Gothenburg, Sweden. When exactly a new British order will arrive is unclear. Reynolds told reporters that due to the ongoing Strategic Defense Review (SDR), it is 'not an easy question' for UK Defence Secretary John Healey to respond to, given 'pressures' his department faces over equipment planning. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and accommodations from Saab for this trip.) 'I do think there are tremendous export opportunities for the UK defense sector,' added Reynolds. The UK MoD plans on publishing the SDR in the spring amid pressure from NATO and local lawmakers to urgently address air defense vulnerabilities and capability gaps in the face of Russia’s war against Ukraine. 'We are actually manufacturing [Giraffe 1X at the Fareham production line] on speculation, rather than … contract by contract,' to support market needs, said Saab CEO Michael Johansson. He explained that there is 'huge demand' for the sensor, which has already been deployed in Ukraine, noting the second production line was needed to increase capacity and deliver a 'regionalized supply chain.' Designed to be used as either a mobile or fixed asset, the Giraffe 1X radar can track fixed wing aircraft, helicopters, drones, rockets and mortar rounds, out to a range of 120 km. A British Army representative told media that the sensor can detect up to 800 targets. It can serve as the primary sensor within a Very Short Range Radar (VSHORAD) system, or as a standalone Counter-UAS (C-UAS) solution, according to Saab. Company literature also outlines that the combination of the radar’s weight, below 150kg, and its 'very low power consumption' means that it can be equipped on 'any type of mobile platform or fixed structure.' The sensor can also be integrated on a pick up sized truck as a Compact Radar Module (CRM), first unveiled by the manufacturer last year at the Eurosatory trade show. Enabling faster deployment times, the solution offers a range of 75 km but will increase over time through software based machine learning applications, said Andy Taylor, head of UK business development and sales in the surveillance division at Saab. At a wider level, the UK already has a base of Saab radars including next generation Taipan artillery locating systems, delivered last year, and land-based Giraffe Agile Multi Beam (AMB) radars, in service since 2010.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-doubles-up-on-giraffe-1x-radar-capacity-with-grand-opening-of-uk-production-base/	2025-02-05T07:54:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Saab-Fareham2.png
Navy’s 4th Fleet to start operation focused on unmanned systems countering illicit trafficking	Saildrone will deploy 20 of its Voyager USVs in support of 4th Fleet's Operation Southern Spear. (Photo courtesy of Saildrone.) WASHINGTON — The US Navy’s 4th Fleet will begin a new operation, dubbed Southern Spear, in the coming weeks focused on using robotic and autonomous systems to aid in the detection of illicit trafficking, the service recently announced. 'Southern Spear will operationalize a heterogeneous mix of robotic and autonomous systems (RAS) to support the detection and monitoring of illicit trafficking while learning lessons for other theaters,' Cmdr. Foster Edwards, 4th Fleet’s hybrid fleet director, said in a statement last week. 'Southern Spear will continue our (4th Fleet’s) move away from short-duration experimentation into long-duration operations that will help develop critical techniques and procedures in integrating RAS into the maritime environment.' The operation will take place in the Southern Command area of responsibility, which spans the coasts of Central and South America. While Southern Spear's goals do align with the new administration's priorities for tighter security at the United States's southern border, the timing is likely a coincidence because the Navy usually spends months planning these kinds of operations in advance. The operation is an evolution of the Navy’s previous operation dubbed Windward Stack. Windward Stack was one of the initial operations that began under Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro and Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Michael Gilday in 2023 during their efforts to scale unmanned technologies from experimental task forces to useful operations. One of the companies involved in Windward Stack was Saildrone, which deployed 10 of its unmanned surface vessels in support of 4th Fleet following the service brass's announcement. Saildrone said on Monday it would deploy 20 USVs 'equipped with a newly upgraded sensor suite' as part of Southern Spear. 'You can do all the exercises you want with kind of staged targets, but when you're deployed in the field, trying to track adversaries who are trying really hard not to be found, like narcotics smugglers, people smugglers, that's a much, much harder task,' Saildrone CEO Richard Jenkins told Breaking Defense in an interview. 'Operating the real world with real weather, real conditions and real adversaries, is where we really start to learn the lessons very quickly.' RELATED: Saildrone CEO says Iranian interference was valuable experience, not a surprise Jenkins said those lessons are focused on how to upkeep a fleet of USVs so that they can maintain a persistent presence for the Navy, as well as efficiently sifting through the terabytes of data the USVs pick up and delivering only relevant information back to the service. 'The Navy literally doesn’t have the eyeballs to absorb all the data we collect, so we have to down sample that for the highest priority information,' said Jenkins. 'So, the real lessons begin when you have 10s of vehicles out there permanently to really understand how to get the operational cadence and uptime to where it needs to be.' Rather than trying to sell the Navy unmanned systems or autonomy software, Saildrone uses what is called a 'contractor owned, contractor operated' model of business. This means the company is responsible for operating, deploying and maintaining its USV fleet. Its customers, in this case the US Navy, are paying only for the data those drones collect. A company spokesperson told Breaking Defense the contract with 4th Fleet was facilitated by the Defense Innovation Unit and includes 180 days of operations per USV, but did not provide an associated dollar amount for that work.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/navys-4th-fleet-to-start-operation-focused-on-unmanned-systems-countering-illicit-trafficking/	2025-02-05T06:22:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250109-St-Thomas-200W-Radar-Voyagers-6741-scaled-e1738750883331.jpg
Army says DUCES to cyber hackers: New RFI looks for tactical edge zero trust solutions	Sgt. Victor Sanchez, a fire direction coordinator assigned to Alpha Battery, 1st Battalion, 258th Artillery Regiment, 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the New York Army National Guard, operates an advanced field artillery tactical data system. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. Alexander Rector) WASHINGTON — The Army is on the hunt for zero trust capabilities to ensure its data is secure in tactical network architectures, according to a request for information published Monday. The service’s C5ISR Center is soliciting information from interested businesses to help find zero trust solutions that can 'integrate seamlessly' into the Army’s existing infrastructure while operating in denied, degraded, intermittent or limited (DDIL) environments. The service is calling such capabilities Tactical Data in Use Security (DUCES) solutions. 'This constrained, highly dynamic, and adversarial-susceptible tactical environment will be a challenge to implement ZT solutions that meet mission needs,' the RFI reads. The Army is turning to zero trust to protect its data as it has found that 'traditional' security models aren’t making the cut anymore given the ever increasing complexity of cyber threats, according to the RFI. The solicitation is specifically looking for solutions that offer advanced capabilities in encryption and anomaly detection in addition to 'secure communication protocols' that protect against current and future threats. The concept of zero trust has gained considerable momentum in recent years as data leaks and the proliferation of adversarial attacks on critical infrastructure have surmounted. At its core, zero trust follows the philosophy 'never trust, always verify' and assumes that the network is always compromised. This means that instead of allowing users to have free reign over a network, there are constant checks to make sure that users are allowed to access what they are trying to access. This verification happens through identity, credential, and access management, or ICAM. Related: Army picks Akamai for prototype battlefield zero trust project: T-ICAM Monday’s RFI is not the first time the Army has searched for zero trust solutions at the tactical edge. Last spring the service chose cloud and edge-computing company Akamai to develop prototype Tactical ICAM capabilities for its combat units. However, the service didn’t go through the typical procurement process or fire out an RFI for Akamai’s prototypes. Instead it used the streamlined Software Acquisition Pathway and a flexible Other Transaction Authority contract to get Akamai’s products in the hands of the warfighters much quicker. But this time around, the Army seems to be acquiring zero trust solutions the old-fashioned way. Responses are due before noon on March 5.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-says-duces-to-cyber-hackers-new-rfi-looks-for-tactical-edge-zero-trust-solutions/	2025-02-04T13:06:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/3472038-1-scaled-e1696963690988.jpg
Eyeing a new autonomous launcher prototyping initiative, Army checking out industry options	The US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command Aviation &amp; Missile Center and Ground Vehicle Systems Center's combined Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher team conducted a live fire of a Reduced Range Practice Rocket fired from the AML at Yuma Proving Ground in April 2024. (US Army photo) WASHINGTON — US Army leaders are looking at different autonomous launchers as they eye a possible prototyping competition and grapple with the right mix of crewed and uncrewed systems for the future force, according to a one-star general helping to lead the charge. After a series of studies and projections into surface-to-surface fires threats through 2035, the service believes it is facing 'deficits' in three categories — range, capacity and survivability — if it doesn’t 'rectify our course,' said Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team leader Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks. 'Achieving local fire superiority starts with surface-to-surface parity,' he explained during a Jan. 29 interview with Breaking Defense. 'Once we achieve that local fire superiority with surface-to-surface [and] surface-to air, then we can set the right conditions to bring in our air component,' Crooks later added. But to achieve that vision and address those perceived deficits, the service has devised a three-pronged approach: ammunition innovation; scaling launched effects plans; and introducing 'mature or existing platforms' and augmenting them with autonomous systems. Work on all three lines of effort are underway, and for that third bucket, it includes penning new requirements for autonomous launchers that could lead to an eventual prototyping competition. That potential move comes as the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) has spent years developing its own Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher (AML), an uncrewed M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System. But as an internal development effort, the command is not in a position to produce enough AMLs for soldiers to test out and feed the requirements and acquisition decision cycle. 'I don't see DEVCOM as being the way to introduce larger numbers into formations in the near future: That will be how we leverage industry,' Crooks said. 'But it starts with refining that requirement, which we're in the process of [doing].' The next step, he explained, is inking an abbreviated capability development document (A-CDD) that essentially validates the need for a capability and could lead to a competitive rapid prototyping competition. While work on AML will be factored into that requirements process, so will observations from demos with alternative autonomous launchers being pitched by industry and set to be demoed at events like the upcoming Project Convergence Capstone 5 event. 'This is not all about not replacing humans with robots but how do you make existing formations more lethal with autonomous systems,' he said. While service priorities could change with new Army civilian leadership, such a future launcher may mean the service is not constrained by a 13-foot pod and could instead fire a new 'Affordable High-Speed Strike' missile slated for science and technology development in fiscal 2026. (The service previously referred to that weapon as the Precision Strike Missile Increment 5.) 'We're interested to see what we can achieve in terms of range, lethality on a surface fired missile that might be larger than 13 feet,' Crooks said. 'We don't know yet what a crewed system can accomplish in terms of its own tasks that we expect of it today … receive the mission, fire, resupply, all those associated tasks, and how much of that can they do and also control an autonomous system simultaneously,' Crooks said. 'It could be one-to-one. It could be one-to-N. We don't know what that is yet,' he added. While he didn’t dive into the specific unmanned launchers at the event to help answer those questions, the AML is expected to be on hand, potentially alongside two launchers under development by different industry teams. Lockheed Martin has been touting one such new launcher, and Raytheon confirmed it is working another one that will be at the Army event. 'Integration of autonomous vehicles into the military can lead to a future where operations are faster, safer and more adaptable,' Brian Burton, vice president of Precision Fires and Maneuver at Raytheon, wrote in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'Our innovative approach with multiple partners helps bring a next-gen solution that increases operational efficiency, crosses difficult terrain, enhances mission survivability and reduces risk to soldiers.' Crooks’s requirements team has also been closely following US Marine Corps progress on the smaller Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE Fires), a program ripe for 'collaboration,' he said. ROGUE Fires integrates the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) — a mountable, ground-based anti-ship missile launcher with two Naval Strike Missiles — onto the 2.5-ton class Joint Light Tactical Vehicle chassis instead of the five-ton Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles (FMTV) platform used for the AML. The USMC is also ramping up the weapon’s level of autonomy, announcing last month a new $30 million investment in autonomous navigation in the form of tech firm Forterra’s AutoDrive system. 'We think [AML] could be complimentary in some ways to what the Marine Corps is doing,' Crooks said, noting that some of the autonomous launchers share the same autonomy stack.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/eyeing-a-new-autonomous-launcher-prototyping-initiative-army-checking-out-industry-options/	2025-02-04T12:03:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/AML1-e1738692850160.jpg
Turkish defense exports surge to $7.15B, up 29 percent from 2023	Kaplan MT tanks produced for Indonesia are ready for delivery as the first package of the project will be completed this year in Ankara, Turkiye on March 13, 2022. (Photo by Dogukan Keskinkilic/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Turkish defense sector saw a 29 percent growth in defense exports in 2024, amounting to $7.15 billion, according to President of Turkey's Defence Industry Agency Haluk Görgün. 'These figures reflect not only an economic success but also the vision of independence in the defense industry that Turkey has written on its own,' Gorgun said in post on X. He further stated that Turkey is 'building a strong defense industry for our friends and allies, and a groundbreaking ecosystem in technology exports for our future. We are working tirelessly for a Turkey that not only produces, but also designs, exports, and builds the future.' Turkey's biggest defense exporters include dronemaker Baykar, Turkish Aerospace Industries, ASFAT, armored vehicle producer MKE and ARCA, according to another post on X by Gorgun. Aselsan said in a statement that it signed export contracts with seven new countries worth $1 billion in 2024, 'a record high figure in its history.' Meanwhile, Baykar made $1.8 billion in revenue from exports, amounting to 90 percent of the firm’s total revenue, according to a statement from the company. 'In 2023, the company ranked among Türkiye’s top 10 exporters, achieving $1.8 billion in exports — a milestone it successfully repeated in 2024, further cementing its resounding success,' Baykar said. Turkey has been pushing to boost its defense production to decrease dependence on Western nations and firms that might be subjected to embargoes. 'Turkey saw the need for localization of defense innovation/production for strategic reasons and accelerated a campaign to invest in developing critical high-tech equipment encompassing a whole array of highly sophisticated platforms with homegrown weapon systems,' Serhat Süha Çubukçuoğlu, an expert at Trends Research &amp; Advisory in Abu Dhabi, told Breaking Defense today. The upsurge in defense exports could be due to 'Turkey’s localization of strategic industries including defense and Turkey’s economic instability and relatively small market size that prompts defense firms to aim entry into foreign markets,' he said. 'It helps Turkey to earn much needed foreign-currency denominated revenues to plug budget deficits, service foreign debt, and re-invest in R&amp;D. With a wider portfolio of clients the defense sector receives more demand and becomes financially more sustainable.' Çubukçuoğlu highlighted that while Turkey sources most of the standard, mid-grade equipment locally, 'critical dependencies on key components like jet engines, semiconductors, and naval propulsion technologies persist.' Turkey's 'commitment to self-reliance in defense technology is evident and this trend is set to continue in the coming decade,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/turkish-defense-exports-surge-to-7-15b-up-29-percent-from-2023/	2025-02-04T11:15:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230712_turkey_kaplan_tank_GettyImages-1239187201-scaled-e1689172760648.jpg
How Trump’s ‘Iron Dome for America’ upends four decades of nuclear doctrine	Rockets launched towards Israel from the northern Gaza Strip and response from the Israeli missile defense system known as the Iron Dome leave streaks through the sky on May 14, 2021 in Gaza City, Gaza. (Photo by Fatima Shbair/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — For 40 years America's missile defense framework has been based on two parallel concepts: First, that kinetic missile defense systems would be designed to physically stop missiles fired by a rogue nation like North Korea or Iran. And second, that those same systems would not be scaled to the level that the US could credibly defend the homeland against a barrage from Russia and China. It may seem counterintuitive, but the policy case is simple, if somewhat apocalyptic: only the threat of a world-ending nuclear response would keep those powers from launching, and if Moscow and Beijing felt the US could credibly hold them at threat while defending itself, it would cause those competitors to invest even more in nuclear weapons. And with the stroke of a pen, President Donald Trump upended that balance, with the call for a vastly expanded missile defense system he's dubbed 'Iron Dome for America.' Trump's Jan. 27 executive order maintains that the US should 'deter' or 'defend' against 'any foreign aerial attack,' but goes a step further in calling on the Secretary of Defense to submit plans for 'Defense ... against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries[.]' The shift in US policy would be, in the words of a former US official involved in nuclear operations, a 'big change,' one that a bevy of experts interviewed by Breaking Defense say raises questions about the stability of nuclear arms control, the basic feasibility of such a plan and, particularly, how it will change the balance of power in space. Trump’s vision is 'even more bold' than former President Ronald Reagan’s 1983 Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) program, the former official stressed. 'SDI was an R&amp;D program. This is: ‘come back to me in under 120 days with a plan for how you're going to deploy something.’ So, in that sense, it's very ambitious,' the former official said. Already, it has led to swift threats from Moscow. Discussion of a comprehensive missile defense shield for the US, especially one that includes space-based interceptors (SBIs) — long a nightmare scenario for Russian leaders worried about their nuclear deterrent — was enough for Russian Foreign Ministry official Grigory Mashkov to say any such move 'puts an end to the prospects of strategic offensive arms reduction and preservation of strategic stability on the previous terms.' 'It is not ruled out that in the current conditions of confrontation with the West, with its policy of inflicting strategic damage on Russia, we may face the need for moving away from restrictions on nuclear and missile arsenals in favor of their quantitative and qualitative increase,' he wrote in a Russian publication, according to a Jan. 30 report by the state media service TASS. Mashkov’s comments were tantamount to a threat that Moscow, in an effort to counter Trump’s plan, will bust through the caps placed on both US and Russian nuclear arsenals under the 2011 New START treaty. Asked to respond to Mashkov’s suggestion that Moscow may increase its nuclear arsenal, a White House official told Breaking Defense that 'President Trump is focused on ensuring Americans stay safe. Russia’s threats suggest this focus is well founded.' The State Department referred to a statement by Secretary Marco Rubio detailing the priorities and mission of the administration. Citing 'longstanding SOP [standard operating procedure],' a Pentagon spokesperson said 'we don’t discuss hypothetical situations' when asked the same. But with Trump’s executive order, that situation is much less hypothetical than at any point since the 1980s, seven experts told Breaking Defense. And while split on whether the risks of Trump's plan outweigh the benefits with regard to US nuclear security — and in particular whether a space-based capability is a good idea, or even feasible — all agreed on one thing: An American Iron Dome system would mean the global nuclear calculus will change dramatically. The fundamental policy argument with regard to homeland missile defense vice peer nuclear powers reflects long-standing differences within the US nuclear literati: does it improve the US ability to deter nuclear attack, or instead increase the likelihood of atomic armageddon? Ankit Panda, Stanton Senior Fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Breaking Defense that Moscow’s signature on New START was contingent on there being no fundamental change in Washington’s missile defense policy. 'The most essential principle of nuclear deterrence is the principle of an assured second strike, and Russia and China are going to ensure that as the United States seeks new types of missile defense modes, including space-based interceptors, they will have the means to retaliate and to penetrate,' Panda explained. Further, he said, both Russia and China might not simply move to increase their ICBM arsenals, but also find 'alternative' ways of delivering nuclear weapons, such as Russia’s Poseidon underwater autonomous torpedo. 'This [Iron Dome] doesn't solve the problem of vulnerability,' he argued. 'It simply gives America's adversaries incentives to adapt their own forces to ensure that they're able to assure their ability to retaliate.' Already, some of the longstanding arms control threads have frayed between the US and Russia. (China, while a signatory along with the other major nuclear powers of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that pledges them to reducing their arsenals over an unspecified time, has never signed up to bilateral arms control with the United States.) While Russia in February 2023 suspended its compliance with the treaty citing US and NATO support for Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin at the time still pledged to uphold New START’s weapons caps, refraining from a formal withdrawal. The treaty sets the following limits, according to the State Department website: Russia moving away from New Start, and its investments in alternative types of nuclear delivery mechanisms, means America is adhering to the old paradigm while ignoring reality, said Rebeccah Heinrichs, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and member of the bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission. 'The solution cannot be only offensive investments on the part of the US,' she said. 'It has to be defensive investments as well.' Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), argued: 'I think [the Trump order] is largely irrelevant in terms of arms control implications. Arms control is effectively dead already with China building out its arsenal at a rapid pace under no treaty constraints.' However, Tom Karako, head of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, argued that some narratives are missing the larger strategic context. Efforts to preserve nuclear stability are 'old think' based on a paradigm that has disappeared, he said. On the other hand, he cautioned against those who are championing a 'faith-based' idea of an invulnerable shield against all missile threats against the US homeland, saying 'missile defense is hard. … They're not taking the threat seriously enough, is what I would say.' And nothing fits the description of a hard missile defense technology than the most controversial part of Trump’s executive order: space-based interceptors. A view of the U.S. Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test taken at Maui Station in Hawaii on July 9. 1962. (Credit: Los Alamos National Laboratory) Experts said it was no surprise that what caught Mashkov’s attention was the executive order’s call for space-based interceptors (SBIs), a technology that has long been a point of contention in the arms control community. The concept of space-based interceptors for hitting missiles in their boost phase seconds after launch was a central focus of Reagan’s SDI effort — hence its infamous 'Star Wars' nickname — and has been controversial ever since. Scientists then and now are at odds about not only the effects on nuclear stability, but also whether SBIs are affordable, technologically possible, and operationally sound. Further, in more recent years, the debate has broadened to include what impact SBIs might have on the risks of war in space. 'The pursuit of space-based interceptors is a blueprint for instability. History shows that chasing invulnerability only fuels arms races,' Jessica West of Canada’s Project Ploughshares said. 'The hard truth? SBI won’t shield us; it will spark a wave of new threats while offering limited real protection in return.' With regard to space war, the key issue is that Russia and China not only worry that SBIs will negate their nuclear deterrent, but that they also could be used to kill their satellites, opponents assert. Victoria Samson, a long-time missile defense analyst at the Secure World Foundation, said that the new order’s resurrection of SBIs will throw a monkey wrench into ongoing talks at the United Nations aimed at creating norms of responsible behavior in space — talks that the State Department and Pentagon helped lead under the Biden administration. 'These discussions are crucial for the future of space stability,' she told Breaking Defense. Other analysts point out that America’s adversaries are already deploying weapons on orbit. China, for example, has demonstrated a fractional orbital bombardment system, and American officials have accused Russia of plans to equip a satellite with a nuclear weapon. 'Our adversaries have not restrained themselves the way we would have liked over the last 40 years,' Heinrichs said. While emphasizing the US should not violate the principles of the Outer Space Treaty, which bans weapons of mass destruction in space, Heinrichs said that US space assets have to be protected, and not only by defensive measures. 'We have to … make sure that they know that the United States also has a kill capability in space,' Heinrichs stressed. But does it work? After all, Star Wars is famous not just for its nickname, but as a wildly expensive program that ultimately was a failure. Harrison, in a commentary on AEI’s website, said that while the technology wasn’t ready and the costs were way too high during the Reagan era, that is not the case today. Working SBIs can be deployed, and for a price that is not undoable, he maintained. What hasn’t changed, however, is that the laws of physics make the concept of operations for SBIs somewhat dubious, because of the large number of interceptors required even to defeat a small number of incoming enemy missiles, Harrison cautioned. 'The total cost to develop, build, and launch an initial constellation of 1,900 space-based interceptors would likely be on the order of $11 to $27 billion' — with the 'catch' that such a constellation could only take on 'a maximum of two missiles launched in a salvo,' he wrote. That means that if three missiles were launched simultaneously, at least one would get through, a problem that is known as 'absenteeism.' If China and Russia were to launch missiles at the US, one can safely assume it would be more than three. 'Do we really want to be investing in yet another type of weapon system that does not scale well with the threats we face?' Harrison told Breaking Defense. The Glide Phase Interceptor is the first system specifically designed to defeat hypersonic threats. (Raytheon graphic) While there is an argument to be made that a 'thin' layer of SBIs could be deployed specifically to cover Pacific latitudes to address the Chinese regional threat, Karako stressed that SBIs are not the end-all, be-all for missile defense. Missile defense and space warfare concepts have to be integrated into a larger defense strategy that includes protecting against modern technologies like hypersonic delivery systems and cruise missiles, he said. 'It’s about raising the threshold for the other guys to be able to cause damage and to inflict all manner of bad effects short of the perceived nuclear threshold,' he said. Doing so means using not just missile defenses but also weapons for 'missile defeat' — that is, taking out launch systems before any missiles actually take off. 'There's no one panacea. There's no one silver bullet. You have to do all the things,' Karako said. And therein lies the biggest question of all: what things can actually be achieved within the next four years — especially given that Trump’s plan goes way beyond SBIs to include 'an underlayer and terminal-phase intercept' systems, space-based sensors, long-range radars, and ‘non-kinetic’ capabilities to augment the kinetic defeat of ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks.' The former government official said that, given weapon development timelines, the only weapon systems that will be able to actually 'shoot down anything' during Trump’s current term are the ship-launched SM-3 Block 2A, being co-developed by the US and Japan, and US Army’s THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense), which would form the Trump plan’s missile defense 'underlayer.' 'In the last year of the Trump administration, they had proposed a five-year spending plan for SM-3 and THAAD to integrate them into the GMD program. So this is something that the last Trump administration had in the works when they left,' the official said. Thus, the former official said, the wisest thing for the Defense Department is to put forward a research, development and testing plan to determine what pieces of the Trump executive order can be deployed by when. A key issue, of course, will be funding. And while the Pentagon and the US Space Force are expecting an increased budget, there still will need to be tradeoffs among many competing priorities. The question then becomes what priority the Iron Dome effort will be accorded in those budgetary food fights. 'Right now, we spend about one third of one percent of the defense budget on homeland missile defense, and I'm referring just to the GMD system,' for a total of about '$3 billion' a year, the former official said. 'If you believe that this is an important mission, why don't we raise this to say, one percent, of the DoD budget for homeland defense,' which would raise it to around $8 billion in total. At this level of spending, the Trump administration 'could do just about everything' in the Iron Dome plan, the former official said, but stressed that it is 'a lot of money. … I think they're in for a rude awakening, if you will, with the numbers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/how-trumps-iron-dome-for-america-upends-four-decades-of-nuclear-doctrine/	2025-02-04T09:59:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220113_israel_iron_dome_GettyImages-1232873450-1-scaled-e1642095709377.jpg

Marine Corps cutting F-35B buy for more F-35Cs: New aviation plan	An F-35B lands aboard Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) for the first time on Oct. 20, 2024. (Photo by Cmdr. Darin Russell.) WASHINGTON — The Marine Corps is shifting the balance of F-35 Joint Strike Fighters it intends to buy, opting to purchase dozens more carrier-based variants in lieu of the short-take-off and vertical landing variant, according to the service’s new 2025 aviation plan. Moving forward, the Marines plan to buy a total of 280 F-35Bs rather than their previous objective of 353 aircraft. In turn, the service will purchase 140 F-35Cs rather than the previous objective of 67 F-35Cs. The total procurement objective of 420 F-35s remains the same. 'Per the TACAIR Transition plan, Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 232 (VMFA) and VMFA-323, VMFA-112, and VMFA-134 will now transition as F-35C squadrons. The program of record now includes 280 F-35Bs and 140 F-35Cs to support 12 F-35B squadrons and 8 F-35C squadrons,' according to the document, published Monday and signed out by Lt. Gen. Bradford Gering, the deputy commandant for aviation. The new aviation plan states 183 F-35Bs and 52 F-35Cs have been delivered to the service thus far. The aviation plan acts as a high-level roadmap detailing the Marine Corps’ plans for its various platforms. Central to this new plan is the inclusion of 'Project Eagle,' a multi-phase initiative spanning through 2040 that focuses on projects such as new warfighting concepts as well as the implementation of artificial intelligence. 'What Project Eagle does for us, as we look across three [future years defense programs] is it shows us where the trade space is,' Gering said last year. The US Air Force has for years set its sights on buying 1,763 F-35As, a number that former Secretary Frank Kendall suggested before leaving office should be revisited down the road. The US Navy intends to buy 273 F-35Cs. After publication of this report, F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin said in a statement that 'We support the U.S. Marine Corps’ decision to adjust to an F-35 fleet configuration that best allows them to fulfill their critical missions with the world’s most advanced aircraft.' Meanwhile, the F-35 program is still plagued by a series of issues, from lagging readiness to sluggish software development, the Pentagon’s top weapons tester found in a recent report. A leading issue for the tri-variant stealth fighter is its disappointing availability — measured by mission capable rates, meaning a jet could perform one of its assigned missions, or fully mission capable rates, meaning it can execute all of them — a critical issue for officials and a focus of a 'War on Readiness' launched by the program in 2023. Despite concerted effort spanning several years, results have been mixed, according to a chart included in the report. The conventional takeoff and landing F-35A has seen declines in its mission capable and fully mission capable rates in recent years, which are well below targets. The short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B saw its mission capable rate decline and its fully mission capable rate plateau, where both metrics are still below objectives. Only the carrier-launched F-35C has seen measurable improvement, as its mission capable rate remained largely flat and its fully mission capable rate inched up, but both key measurements are also beneath program goals. Another central problem for the program is software development, a key reason why officials previously took the unprecedented step of halting deliveries for a full year amid difficulties with a new upgrade known as Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3). According to the report, in some cases the program 'has shown no improvement in meeting schedule and performance timelines for developing and testing software designed to address deficiencies and add new capabilities.' Jets currently flying with the TR-3 upgrade are restricted to training, and officials are striving to ensure full combat capability can be delivered this year. Still, the program likely will not begin 'dedicated operational testing' of the full TR-3 enhancement until 'mid to late FY26, approximately two years after the configuration began delivery to the field,' the report says. And even after years of production, military customers are still discovering quality escapes with aircraft, which the report notes should have been identified during the acceptance process. But there have been improvements in the manufacturing process as well: According to the report, the program has achieved a 47 percent reduction in scrap, rework, and repair time as well as a 63 percent reduction in quality escapes discovered from the aircraft’s production line between 2016 and 2023. The program has also generally improved upon some reliability metrics in recent years, indicating advances like more sturdy parts that don’t need to be removed as frequently. A spokesperson for Lockheed said in a statement that 'Delivering the highest quality to the warfighter is foundational to our Lockheed Martin culture, and we remain focused on achieving 100% quality each and every day.' Regarding mission capable rates, the spokesperson said the aircraft 'has demonstrated high combat and deployed readiness since data was collected for this report, in some cases more than five years ago.' They added that information in the DOT&amp;E report is 'dated,' and that quality escapes could entail 'minor items such as an incorrect serial number on paperwork.' The spokesperson also pointed to a previously announced internal investment of over $350 million to boost the program. 'These investments will enhance fidelity and capacity across our development, integration, and test labs, ultimately enabling us to shift defect discovery to the left,' they said. In a statement, the head of the F-35 program, Air Force Lt. Gen. Mike Schmidt, said the report 'highlights shortcomings without adequately addressing the corrective actions the JPO has taken to address the challenges. Every observation requires — and has received — a response from the JPO, and we have made tangible progress in remediating the issues in the report.' Readiness is weighed down by what the program calls 'degraders,' which can be factors like supply chain issues. Over the past year, according to Schmidt, the program has eliminated 20 of these degraders, though a 'small number' of remaining degraders 'mask tremendous progress that’s been made.' Additionally, Schmidt noted that deployed and operational aircraft achieve higher mission capable rates than the fleet when measured as a whole, though he acknowledged that 'overall readiness rates remain unacceptable.' Regarding TR-3, Schmidt said, 'We are aggressively implementing comprehensive test plans to ensure this critical upgrade delivers cutting-edge capabilities to the warfighter.' 'While there is always room for improvement, the steps we have taken reinforce our dedication to providing the capabilities our warfighters need,' Schmidt said. 'The F-35 program remains the cornerstone of our nation’s air superiority, and this report underscores both our accomplishments and areas for continued growth.'

(Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) Elsewhere in the aviation plan, the Marines detailed several planned upgrades and modifications to its MV-22 fleet in the years ahead to better position the fleet to foresee material failures before they disrupt operations. Those changes include the VeCToR upgrade, which deals with a number of obsolescence issues inside the cockpit; a new modernization plan, dubbed ReVAMP, to 'ensure platform relevance' until the end of the aircraft’s service life; and redesigning the flight control computer. With respect to the proprotor gearbox, which has been the focus of numerous mishaps in recent years involving the Osprey, the aviation plan states the Marines will 'install sensors in critical areas of the PRGB and drive train to provide vibration signature data that will allow maintenance to forecast the failure of parts and plan to remove those parts prior to failure.' 'A more refined Triple-Melt steel will be the source material for the internal components of the PRGB which will drastically reduce the likelihood of material defects in critical gears and bearings,' according to the document. 'A redesigned Input Quill Assembly (IQA) will reduce the incidence of the wearout mode observed in previous IQA failures that led to aircraft Hard Clutch Engagement (HCE) occurrences.'

Baltic Sentry mission could provide proving ground for NATO’s underwater drones	Standing NATO Maritime Group One trains with Finnish FNS Hanko during a 2017 passing exercise in the Baltic Sea. (FRAN CPO Christian Valverde) This is the latest in a series of semi-regular columns by Robbin Laird, where he will tackle current defense issues through the lens of more than 45 years of defense expertise in both the US and abroad. The goal of these columns: to look back at how questions and perspectives of the past should inform decisions being made today. NATO has formed a new Baltic Sentry effort to deal with threats to the NATO nations surrounding the Baltic Sea from the Russians. And while the challenge is real, there is significant opportunity for innovation in shaping a new paradigm in maritime operations. Currently, I am in Europe and had a chance to discuss this opportunity with Torben Mikkelsen, former head of the Danish navy and a well-respected innovator in maritime affairs. His key point: 'Baltic Sentry' could serve as a forcing function to get these nations focused on integrating uncrewed systems, notably automated ones, to deliver the basic ISR needed for a mission which encompasses both underwater and above water surveillance. 'These systems could be launched from shore, air dropped or launched from manned vessels. In fact, learning how to work multiple platforms and locational launch points in a mesh consisting of manned and unmanned platforms and systems would be an important part of preparing for any future crisis in the Baltic Sea region. 'NATO needs to start from the ground up with a new approach built on how a combination of manned ship platforms with payloads of uncrewed systems could deliver the desired results in the entire spectrum of conflict, and the Baltic Sea is a very good ‘naval laboratory’ to use for exactly that,' Mikkelsen said. 'It is important to ensure that we can deliver the needed effects both now, when operating without a direct threat, and in a wartime scenario which is congested with hostile unmanned effects in all domains. In the latter situation the interest in operating with manned assets will be very low. 'It is about being able to transform the needed effects between manned and unmanned assets and to be able to use such in the right combination in line with the current threat and that signal you want to send to the opponent,' he added. We also discussed the fact that NATO has a shortage of manned ships and personnel, which will not end any time soon, and that using autonomous systems provided a significant innovation path to get the desired effects one wanted with much less operational personnel. And with maritime autonomous systems, the personnel would not even have to be in the military but could be private contractors as well. With the European states surrounding the Baltic Sea all now part of NATO there was the important opportunity to learn how to operate these new systems together and to share the data generated from them. As Mikkelsen put it: 'If we do this right, then we will be able to share military payloads amongst those nations.' It is a question of both technological and organizational change which is entailed in a new approach to managing Baltic security. The time to learn to do so is now, and not when in the midst of a crisis. (I will be publishing a book later this year addressing the question of the nature of the paradigm shift in maritime operations.) Mikkelsen’s last job was as Denmark’s executive director for Navy programs at Defence Command, where he was laser focused on building a new generation of modular ships which were designed with the engagement of autonomous systems in mind. The Danes, like others, are focused on building capital ships which function as 'motherships' that are tied inherently into unmanned operations. The question then, he asked: 'How much autonomous military payload can the mothership carry? And [can] that mothership platform [also be] remotely controlled in case of full-scale war?' He underscored the similarities between the Black Sea with the Baltic and felt that the experiences of the Ukrainians and Russians there would clearly be deeply imprinted on the Russian mind. The irony could be that the Russians learned faster from the Ukraine war about maritime operations than NATO, and now NATO needs to adjust its own thinking. The Ukrainian example of using remotely piloted USVs to significantly impact maritime operations has led to Ukrainian interest in such a concept as well. If the Russians have learned the value of these new systems taught to them by the Ukrainians, why would NATO drag its feet on learning to use them as part of its combat force? The Baltic Sentry effort is a perfect place to start.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/baltic-sentry-mission-could-provide-proving-ground-for-natos-underwater-drones/	2025-02-04T07:15:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/finland_navy-scaled-e1680813959198.jpg
North Korea welcomes Trump back with ‘strategic’ cruise missile test: What’s next?	A Yonhap news TV broadcast shows test-firing of a sea-based (underwater) ground-to-ground strategic cruise guided missile in North Korea. (Photo by Kim Jae-Hwan/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SYDNEY — North Korea's test launch of a 'strategic' underwater-launched cruise missile within a week of President Donald Trump's inauguration brought back into the spotlight a key geopolitical relationship from Trump's first term: How he will approach North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The American president's relationship with Kim was a source of soundbites and drama between 2017 and 2021. It was the origin of 'fury and fire' as a nuclear crisis between the two countries escalated in 2017. It was also the core of Trump's 2019 meeting at the DMZ, when Trump became the first US leader to step foot into North Korean territory. And this last week, Trump said he would reach back out to Kim, saying of the dictator, 'He liked me.' But while that relationship warmed over Trump's term, North Korea has a tendency to want to make sure it's seen on the world stage with proverbial fireworks — or as close to proverbial as one can get when it involves missile launches. Which means the Jan. 25 launch, which was 'succesfu' according to the Korean Central News Agency, could very well have been timed to catch the attention of the newly-sworn-in American leader. Experts seem to agree that Kim is in a much stronger position than he was when Trump was first elected in 2016, a reality that will impact how Washington and Pyongyang interact in the coming years. Meanwhile, they say, the American president is much more likely to press ahead on ending the war in Ukraine, pursuing Chinese tariffs and domestic priorities before pressing ahead with efforts to reshape relations with Kim. Start with the situation in North Korea itself. Kim has repositioned his country over the least year, scrapping all cooperation with the South and declaring his country was on a war footing. 'Kim has already signaled a change in state policy vis a vis South Korea, to turn away from any sort of reunification and instead to prepare the DPRK military for war. So his military build up will continue, including investing in advanced missile capabilities,' Malcolm Davis, an expert on the Indo-Pacific at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) in Canberra said in an email, 'These include a range of delivery systems for tactical and strategic nuclear forces, including hypersonic weapons, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and cruise missiles.' What has long been the unachieved goal of the West — North Korea abandoning nuclear weapons and allowing inspections of its facilities to prove it — is unlikely to happen, both Davis and Leonid Petrov, a North Korea expert at the Australian National University in Canberra, told Breaking Defense. 'From Donald Trump's point of view, he's not going to gain anything by denuclearizing North Korea. North Korea is not posing any plausible threat to US territory,' Petrov said. 'Yes, it can create trouble to South Korea, to Japan, to US bases in the Pacific, but that's probably it. I don't think North Korea is actually a threat, any threat to the US homeland.' The CIA's former deputy division chief for Korea, Bruce Klingner, said last week that there are conflicting signals coming from the Trump administration towards Pyongyang in its early days. 'Everyone has to be prepared for a wide variety of course changes and high speed changes. And we'll just have to wait and see on some of these,' the Heritage Foundation expert said during an event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Michael Allen, a former National Security aide to George W. Bush and managing director of Beacon Global Strategies, noted on the CSIS panel that Trump's comment about talking to Kim was in reaction to a question. 'I don't hear him proactively raising this issue,' he said. Allen added that Trump 'may have made the assessment that a deal is just not possible.' He said he didn't know if talks with North Korea are 'going to be a big thrust of what President Trump wants to be able to do, because I think a lot of people look at this and they say, this is a huge problem.' Part of that problem is how to manage US and allied relations with the isolated leader. 'As for how Trump and US allies &#8216;manage Kim' — I don't think they do. Trump may be tempted to do a summit, but he'll get nothing out of it, and probably come under pressure to make concessions,' Davis said. He noted that South Korea, under disgraced leader Yoon Suk Yeol had discussed the need for nuclear weapons. Now that he appears likely be removed from office and the opposition opposes nuclear weapons and favors engagements with Pyongyang, Davis says the situation grows even more complicated for Trump. But perhaps the biggest change in Kim's posture is not an internal shift, but a new powerful friend: Russian strongman Vladimir Putin. Petrov pointed to the fact that 'things have changed dramatically,' since Trump stepped briefly into Kim's country, thanks to Putin serving as Kim's new 'benefactor &#8230; Putin gives them money and technology and protection.' Of course, it's not been free. Kim has sent at least 11,000 North Korean troops to help Russia in its war against Ukraine. In return, Kim is getting billions of dollars in advanced weapons, food and oil from Russia. 'He already has secured his regime through Russia's commitment to secure it, and North Korea will get enough technology and recognition and sanctions can be diverted through Russian border and the Chinese border,' Petrov said. For his part, Kim followed the missile test up with a Jan. 29 visit to a nuclear weapons facility, which he praised for 'epochal successes' in producing material for nuclear weapons and 'strengthening the nuclear shield of the country,' the state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said. Kim said 2025 will be 'a watershed year' for improving his nuclear forces. So, about that missile&#8230; Perhaps the most important question is whether this cruise missile can carry a nuclear warhead. North Korea has claimed it has a warhead that is small enough to fit onto the weapon, but like so many things about North Korea, no one is really sure. 'The DPRK has shown several purported nuclear weapons. In 2016 and 2017 they showed two designs in relation to ballistic missiles. It is unclear whether these were real, but in any case they were too large to fit inside a cruise missile. However, more recently, in March 2023, they unveiled the much smaller &#8216;Hwasan-31' nuclear warhead. This would fit inside a cruise missile,' Ralph Savelsberg, a missile expert with the Netherlands Defence Academy said, adding that he 'cannot assess whether these are real, though.' The KCNA announcement of the launch, published in English late on Jan. 26, included alleged details of the test, which it says Kim watched. 'Based on the press statement, the missile flew 1,500 km,' Savelsberg said. 'If that is its range, when launched from the DPRK, that would put all of Japan, including Okinawa, in range. If it can indeed be launched from a submarine, depending on the range of the submarine, it could threaten Guam. They claim to have launched a nuclear submarine in September 2023 and that could theoretically even threaten Hawaii or the US West Coast.' In some ways a smaller missile like this poses a more difficult threat to the US, South Korea, Japan and other countries in range because cruise missiles are 'difficult to defend against. They don't fly as fast as a ballistic missile, but they are small and fly at low altitudes, which makes them difficult to detect. Furthermore, they can fly an unpredictable path and thus attack from a direction which you might not anticipate,' Savelsberg said. One of the interesting tidbits in Pyongyang's news story is that 'the test-fire had no negative impact on the security of the neighboring countries.' According to Savelsberg, the North Koreans 'seem to fly them in circles or figure-8 patterns, in order not to overfly any of their neighbors.' That may be a clear indicator of how much North Korea wants to remind the world of its weapons without sparking serious reactions to its actions. Yonhap, South Korea's semi-official news agency, said the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff sent a text message to reporters saying that, 'Detailed specifications are currently being closely analyzed by the intelligence authorities of South Korea and the United States.' No statements or comments have been made by US Indo-Pacific Command since the launch. Breaking Defense requested comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/north-korea-welcomes-trump-back-with-strategic-cruise-missile-test-whats-next/	2025-02-04T04:52:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250129_nk_missile_launch_GettyImages-2195386955-e1738160480944.jpg
Pentagon weapons tester highlights delays for B-52, 3DELRR radars	A US Air Force B-52H Stratofortress and a Royal Australian Air Force F/A-18F Super Hornet fly over the Northern Territory during Exercise Talisman Sabre 23. Credit: Australian MoD WASHINGTON — The Air Force is pushing back its schedule for modernizing the Eisenhower-era B-52 Stratofortress with a new radar by a year amid integration challenges, according to a new report by the US military’s top weapons tester. A two-stage Milestone C decision — the beginning of a program’s production phase that in this case signifies when the first bombers will get new radars — for the B-52 Radar Modernization Program is now planned for fiscal 2026, in the second and fourth quarters, according to the Jan. 31 report [PDF] from the Pentagon’s Director of Operational Test &amp; Evaluation (DOT&amp;E). The dates are somewhat notional, as the report states that '[e]xact dates are uncertain due to technical and schedule risks.' However, last year’s DOT&amp;E report [PDF] found the decision points were previously planned for the same quarters in FY25, pointing to a full-year delay. The two-part milestone C decision calls for modifying a total of 28 aircraft, roughly a third of the B-52 fleet, with the new radar, the DOT&amp;E report says. A full-rate production decision for the remaining 48 aircraft set to be outfitted with the new radar will then follow initial operational test and evaluation (IOT&amp;E), now slated to kick off in FY28. Delays for the radar effort largely stem from 'integration issues,' the DOT&amp;E report says, leading the Air Force to 'refine' the design of the aircraft’s radome, or the housing for the radar. The radar program is part of a larger overall effort to modernize the B-52, which includes fielding new engines for the decades-old Stratofortress. Boeing is the prime contractor for both efforts, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment. RTX, which supplies the updated radar, and the Air Force similarly did not immediately reply. Air Force officials in August warned that costs are rising and schedules slipping for the overall modernization effort of the B-52 a platform that will continue to play an integral role in the service’s bomber force structure and likely continue to fly into the 2060s. Service leaders revealed then that the price tag for the bomber’s new radar in particular was projected to jump from $2.3 billion to $3.3 billion. The report found similar delays for a project to deploy a new radar that can detect and track airborne targets like aircraft and ballistic missiles, known as the Three-Dimensional Expeditionary Long-Range Radar (3DELRR). The radar plugs into a mobile command and control center the Air Force can use in theater. Fielding the 3DELRR system has been a long-running saga for the service, which booted previous contractor RTX from the program and offered a new deal to Lockheed Martin in 2022. Lockheed’s AN/TPY-4(V)1 radar is now planned to replace the legacy TPS-75. But the program is still experiencing schedule hiccups owing to testing and production delays, the report says. Last year’s DOT&amp;E report found that developmental testing was slated to begin in 2Q FY24, but this year’s report now projects it will begin in 2Q FY25. The report found similar delays for IOT&amp;E, previously set to begin in 3Q FY25 but now is set for 1Q FY26. The Air Force and Lockheed Martin did not immediately respond when asked about the schedule slips.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-weapons-tester-highlights-delays-for-b-52-3delrr-radars/	2025-02-03T13:19:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/B-52-and-RAAF-F-18-Talisman-Sabre-2023-scaled-e1691500489687.jpg
Missile Defense Agency asks industry for American ‘Iron Dome’ concepts	Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS). (Northrop Grumman image) WASHINGTON — The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) has issued a call for industry ideas on how it can implement President Donald Trump's Jan. 27 'Iron Dome for America' Executive Order — a surprisingly fast turn around on a Pentagon program. The Request for Information (RF) comes just four days after Trump's order mandated Pentagon development of a comprehensive 'shield' to repel any aerial attack on the US homeland. The RFI asks interested vendors to show and tell relevant capabilities by Feb. 28. The request to industry is structured to be open to a wide range of ideas, as it seeks details on what capabilities can be 'delivered or demonstrated' in two-year 'epochs': not later than Dec. 31, 2026; Dec. 31, 2028; Dec. 31, 2030 and 'beyond' Dec. 31, 2030. MDA is 'conducting market research to assist in the identification of innovative missile defense technologies (system-level, component level, and upgrades) architectures, concepts, and Concept of Operations (CONOPS) to detect and defeat the threat of attack by ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles, and other advanced aerial attacks,' the RFI elaborates. 'MDA desires to collaborate with Industry on potential concepts to deploy and maintain a next-generation missile defense shield that will deter and defend its citizens and critical infrastructure against any foreign aerial attack on the Homeland and guarantee its secure second-strike capability,' it adds. The list of technologies of interest reads as a cut-and-paste of the Trump executive order: Interestingly, the RFI indicates MDA would take charge of deploying the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), rather than the Space Development Agency (SDA). The fate of the HBTSS — which uses a medium-field-of-view camera optimized to provide high-fidelity missile tracking capable of providing targeting coordinates to anti-missile interceptors — has been the subject of a years-long tug-of-war between the two agencies. MDA originally developed the sensor to help target its new Glide Phase Interceptor for knocking hypersonic missiles out of the sky. But SDA effectively killed the HBTSS program after the first two test satellites were launched last February, absorbing some of the technology into its own designs for new 'fire-control capable' infrared sensors. Thus, the Trump executive order breathes life back into the HBTSS program, and MDA has re-claimed control of it in the RFI. As things stand today, however, SDA has no plans to integrate the two HBTSS sensors into its Tracking Layer of the Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture — which begs the question of once HBTSS is developed how will it be deployed and operated so as to work with SDA's Tracking Layer satellites and ground systems? Another unanswered question is which Defense Department organization will operate the future space-based and directed-energy interceptors to be developed by MDA as part of the Iron Dome plan. The Ground-Based Interceptors that make up the sharp end of the Defense Department's Ground-based Midcourse Defense System are 'administered' by MDA (to include funding for upgrades) but the Army has operational control in support of US Northern Command. Further, both the Air Force and now the Space Force provide support functions to the overarching system. That long-standing arrangement also will apply to the Next-Generation Interceptor replacement program. However, US Space Command is now responsible under the Unified Command Plan for operations in space, with its 'area of responsibility' defined as extending from 100 kilometers above the Earth to, in theory, infinity. The command also serves as the Joint Force Global Sensor Manager, and operates the current Space-Based Infrared System constellation of missile warning satellites. And while the Space Force supplies the bulk of personnel to SPACECOM to conduct operations, the other services also all provide space specialists and capabilities. The defense community may not have to wait for answers. Under the executive order, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has until March 28 to submit 'a reference architecture, capabilities-based requirements, and an implementation plan for the next-generation missile defense shield' — a task that is being spearheaded by John Hill in his role performing the duties of the assistant secretary of defense for space policy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/missile-defense-agency-asks-industry-for-american-iron-dome-concepts/	2025-02-03T11:44:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/06/Hypersonic-and-Ballistic-Tracking-Space-Sensor-Northrop-Grumman-image-.jpeg
Saudi Arabia increases defense spending to $78B in 2025	The GAMI stand seen at World Defense Show 2024. (Agnes Helou/Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has allocated $78 billion for defense spending in 2025, up from $75.8 billion spent in 2024, Governor of the General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI) Ahmad Al-Ohali said in a statement Saturday. 'The Kingdom allocated approximately $78 billion to the military sector in the 2025 budget, which constitutes 21% of total government spending and 7.1% of Saudi Arabia’s gross product,' he said, according to the statement. The statement further noted that the Kingdom has witnessed a 4.5 percent annual defense growth since 1960, adding that it has become the fifth largest defense spender worldwide and the largest in the Arab world. Saudi Arabia, historically one of the largest defense importers worldwide, is concentrating heavily on the Kingdom’s Vision 2030, which was launched in 2016. It aims to decrease the Kingdom’s dependence of the oil sector and boost other sectors based on national production. Vision 2030 has a set goal of localizing 50 percent of all defense spending by 2030, and has been pushing defense firms to open regional headquarters in the Kingdom. 'I am really confident that by 2030 we will reach 50 percent [localization], [even] more than 50 percent,'Al-Ohali told Breaking Defense in February 2024. The localization rate of military industries reached 19.35 percent at the end of 2023, according to the statement. 'The Authority's vision is to develop a sustainable military industries sector that enhances the readiness of military equipment and contributes significantly to the national economy,' Al-Ohali said on Saturday, according to a translated post on X. GAMI, which is the contracting authority for the Saudi MOD, launched in October 2023 'Invest in Saudi Arabia' section on its official website with the goal of pointing international firms to areas of opportunity to invest in the Kingdom. During his speech on Saturday, Al-Ohali highlighted that there are 74 opportunities within Saudi supply chains for military industries, 'identifying 30 opportunities as a priority, representing about 80% of the total future expenditures on supply chains,' per the post on X.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saudi-arabia-increases-defense-spending-to-78b-in-2025/	2025-02-03T11:27:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/426321683_2247560928782093_3567854556366620292_n-e1707316197608.jpg
Rep. Bacon: Enough talking about defense innovation. It’s time to make choices and move out.	Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., makes his way a House Republican Conference meeting in the U.S. Capitol on Thursday, October 19, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) As we begin the 119th Congress and a new presidential administration, a narrow window of opportunity exists to accelerate Department of Defense technology development and deliver a decisive advantage to the United States as it confronts mounting security challenges in the twenty-first century. As chairman of the House Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Cyber, IT, and Innovation, I believe we must take this opportunity to act with urgency to prepare our military to win the future. But first: We in Congress, the executive branch, and industry must stop hiding behind the word 'innovation.' We must move beyond innovation theater and recycled talking points about technology transition. We need real warfighting capabilities, clear-cut ways and means to achieve them, and streamlined resourcing to make it happen on a timeline relevant to the speed of battle and pace of technological change. The time to admire the problem has passed. Now is the time to procure and produce. As I learned in my 30-year military career, success in any complex task depends on starting with a well-defined desired end state. It may sound simple, but without explicit objectives, we cannot achieve useful results. I implore the new DoD leadership to state quickly and plainly the biggest operational challenges the armed forces must solve. Flowing from these objectives, the department must clearly define the priority capabilities and supporting technologies our warfighters require to deter and — if necessary — defeat adversaries like China, Russia, and Iran. To deliver results, Congress must have a clear, unambiguous, and prioritized demand signal in areas like biotechnology, quantum, directed energy, nuclear command and control, missile defense, and more. Armed with these prioritized operational needs, capabilities and technologies, Congress will be able to work collaboratively to authorize and resource the actions necessary to deliver. If ongoing research and development is duplicative, or if it does not aim to solve an operational challenge posed by great power competition, DoD must reassess whether these taxpayer research dollars can be better spent. Ruthless prioritization and focus must be the order of the day. Once our direction of travel is set, DoD must effectively partner with industry and academia to develop and field critical technologies at increased speed and reduced cost to the US taxpayer. If industry is already committing private capital towards critical technologies, the department must focus resources elsewhere and avoid duplication of effort to maximize the power of government and commercial research investments working in tandem. There is absolutely a role for bespoke DoD research and development, particularly for specialized military problems for which there is no commercial market. This is where the military service research labs and national laboratories excel. But, unlike the recent past where DoD was the leading investor in science and technology, the paradigm has shifted. US commercial investment now vastly exceeds the US government in dollars spent on research and development. DoD must harness this and leverage it as the strategic national asset that it is. And Congress can help ensure taxpayer dollars are being invested in essential military R&amp;D, while leveraging the billions of dollars invested by industry for internal R&amp;D that can also help solve military problems. Time and time again, DoD and Congress reinvent the wheel with strategies and roadmaps for critical technology areas, and what do we really have to show for it? America can no longer afford the time and expense of producing pages and pages of strategies, pilot programs, and technology demonstration and experimentation efforts, with no meaningful follow-on production contracts or capabilities delivered to warfighters at scale. This cycle must end. In this moment we need clearly defined operational problems to solve, explicit capabilities developed to meet those challenges, clear-cut funding and contracting mechanisms, and a culture that is willing to move fast, take risks, and deliver solutions. Fortune favors the bold and it’s time to get to work.

Eyal Zamir, well known to industry, named Israeli Defense Forces Chief of Staff	The Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir (Center), in mid-January signing the first contract under the U.S. aid package given during the recent war. (Israel Ministry of Defense.) JERUSALEM — Israel’s Minister of Defense Israel Katz has tapped Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir to be the new Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff, the government here announced Feb. 1. Zamir will take up his post after serving for two years as Director General at Israel’s Ministry of Defense, a role in which he interfaced regularly with the Israeli defense industry. He will replace Herzi Halevi as Israel’s top officer. Halevi, who assumed his role in January 2023, announced on Jan. 21 that he stepping down; as the commanding general during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas, Halevi had come under increasing pressure over the military’s failures to protect Israel from the attack. 'I congratulate Major General (Res.) Eyal Zamir on his appointment as the 24th Chief of the General Staff of the Israel Defense Forces. I have known Eyal for many years, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF forward in the face of the challenges ahead,' Halevi said in a statement. 'In the coming weeks, we will complete a professional and high-quality transfer of command over the IDF.' It was not clear from the statement if Halevi’s desire to leave in March may be moved up now that a successor has been appointed. Zamir was born in 1966 and joined the IDF in 1984, serving in the Armored Corps during the First and Second Intifadas. We was eventually named the commander of the 36th Division, which includes the IDF’s 7th Armored and 188th Armored as well as Golani Infantry, making it one of the most powerful, and tank heavy, of the IDF’s regular divisions. In the last decade and a half Zamir served as Military Secretary to the Prime Minister, and later as head of IDF Southern Command. During his time at Southern Command, he faced off against increasing threats from Gaza in 2018 when there were increased protests along the Gaza border fence. Given those high profile roles, he was seen as a candidate for Chief of Staff twice before: he lost out to Aviv Kochavi in 2018 and then Halevi in 2023. As a consolation prize, he was appointed Deputy Chief of Staff under Kochavi and then moved to the Defense Ministry in 2023. In that role, he played a key role in the IDF’s formulation of the Momentum multi-year plan. This plan was supposed to streamline the IDF’s ability to confront Hamas and Hezbollah in case of a ground war, making the IDF more effective and lethal in multiple domains using the latest technology — though the nature of the conflict since Oct. 7 has raised questions about whether that approach was the correct one. Zamir’s background in the armored corps is unique for a chief of staff. Halevi, Kochavi, Benny Gantz, Moshe Yaalon and Shaul Mofaz were paratroopers, while Gadi Eizenkot and Gabi Ashkenazi came from Golani infantry backgrounds. Industry may find someone who is very open to their new ideas. Zamir played a key role in many of the defense industry deals since the beginning of the war, such as procuring more munitions and interceptors for Israel’s air defenses, and investing in 'Blue and White' Israeli local industries to produce material. One of the most recent deals Zamir played a role in was the first contract signed under the new US aid package, which includes, which a dedicated $5.2 billion allocation to strengthen Israel’s air and missile defense systems. The CEO of Israel Aerospace Industries, Boaz Levy, put out a statement in the wake of Zamir’s appointment, saying 'We would like to thank Maj. Gen. (Res.) Zamir for the fruitful cooperation during his tenure as Director General of the Ministry of Defense, which helped lay additional foundations for ensuring the security of the State of Israel.' Zamir is believed to have beaten out two other top officers for the role, both of whom quickly issued statements of support. IDF Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, said 'I have no doubt that he will excel in this role, demonstrating the necessary combat leadership and strategic vision given the current challenges. I will assist my commanders in the preparation and transition process as needed, and I wish Eyal a smooth and successful entry into this important position.' Maj. Gen. Tamir Yadai, the IDF’s head of the ground forces, also congratulated Zamir. 'From my many years of acquaintance with Eyal, I can attest that he is an experienced and excellent officer, and I am confident that he will lead the IDF successfully through the many challenges of this time,' Yadai said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/eyal-zamir-well-known-to-industry-named-israeli-defense-forces-chief-of-staff/	2025-02-03T00:22:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Zamir_center.png
With Foreign Military Financing paused, Lebanese forces wait on promised funds	The Lebanese Army is deployed on the ground as search operations continue at the site of the israeli strike in Basta, Central Beirut. According to the rescue teams on the ground, this bombing killed at least 15 people and around 35 are still missing. November 23 2024. (Photo by Nael Chahine / Middle East Images / Middle East Images via AFP) (Photo by NAEL CHAHINE/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As the Lebanese Armed Forces try to keep up their end of the ceasefire deal, a large pot of funds meant to enhance their equipment is tied up in Washington. At the end of the Biden administration, there were public reports the State Department planned to shift $95 million in Foreign Military Funding (FMF) from Egypt to Lebanon. The office of Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, R-Fla., who chairs the House appropriations subcommittee in charge of foreign aid, confirmed to Breaking Defense that the Biden team successfully shifted that money. But the funds are now held up as part of a broader State Department freeze on foreign aid ordered by Trump administration Secretary of State Marco Rubio. FMF is money the US government gives to other nations in order to build up their national security capabilities. FMF is required to be spent only on US-made goods, meaning the money from Washington flows out to foreign capitals and then back into the US defense industry. While FMF totals for many countries are relatively small, 'a little can go a long way,' according to Tressa Guenov of the Atlantic Council. 'It is one tool as a bulwark against influence from adversaries and competitors who may be looking to also sell their wares to key partners that may be under pressure from lots of different power sources from around the world,' Guenov, who served principal deputy assistant secretary of defense for international security affairs from 2022 to 2024, told Breaking Defense. At a tactical level, she also noted that getting countries onto American kit helps with interoperability, especially with counter-terrorism and border security issues many of these countries are facing. In the case of Lebanon, the Biden team wanted to show support for the new government formed just weeks ago, and to provide military aid to the Lebanese Armed Forces as they try to secure territory formerly held by Hezbollah and, later, by invading Israeli forces. Transferring that money from Egypt’s standing FMF pot to Lebanon was seen as the easiest way to get that aid underway. 'Additional FMF will further enable the LAF to secure the South Litani area, implement UNSCR 1701, and signal strong U.S. commitment to advancing the U.S.-brokered agreement to partners who may be considering increasing assistance to the LAF,' a State Department official told Breaking Defense in early January, speaking on background before the Biden administration left office. 'Supporting the LAF to exert sovereignty across all of Lebanon will constrain the malign activities of Hizballah and their Iranian backers both in Lebanon and their destabilizing activities across the globe.' However, one of Rubio's first moves after arriving in Foggy Bottom was 'initiating a review of all foreign assistance programs to ensure they are efficient and consistent with U.S. foreign policy under the America First agenda,' according to department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce. While the scale of the global assistance pause is different from previous administrations, it’s not unheard of for a new administration to pause and review foreign security assistance programs when coming into office. The first Trump administration did so under then-secretary Rex Tillerson, and when the Biden administration came into office, it froze sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as part of a review. It's also unclear exactly how much FMF is actually available to be frozen. According to Diaz-Balart’s office, the total FMF appropriated for FY24 was $6.1 billion. But with the confusion about the budget — the government is operating under a continuing resolution, essentially stretching FY24 out six months — it is possible that a significant portion of that $6.1 billion has already been spent. And because FMF is essentially a loan, it’s possible that countries that received FMF dollars already aren’t able to spend them under the freeze. Asked for clarification on the status of FMF deals, a state department spokesperson said, 'We are reviewing all foreign assistance funds to ensure they are aligned with American interests. During this review period, all foreign assistance funding mechanisms with the exception of programs with waivers, are paused. National security is and will remain a top priority.' Ironically, that $95 million for Lebanon actually would still be flowing if it was tagged for Egypt. That’s because Rubio carved out an exception for 'foreign military financing for Israel and Egypt and administrative expenses, including salaries, necessary to administer foreign military financing,' according to the BBC. Guenov noted that a 'loss of such support can really be a sore spot in relationships,' and raises the risk that if a freeze lasts a long time or FMF broadly is cut, other countries, such as China or Russia, could move to fill the void. 'There are other competitors who offer, sometimes, cheaper, more quickly available equipment, which come in with deals for countries that provide an alternative to the US,' she said. 'And certainly that’s something we want to avoid.' As to FY25, the Biden administration requested $9.04 billion in security assistance funds through State, with roughly $6.08 billion of FMF included; should Congress finally pass an FY25 budget those totals will likely change, even if the freeze is lifted by then. Meanwhile, Foreign Military Sales cases, where the US government acts as a seller of US-made weapons to a foreign partner, are moving forward. The first FMS case approved under the Trump administration was announced Friday, a deal with Japan for Standard Missile 6 weapons, with an estimated price tag of $900 million.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/with-foreign-military-financing-paused-lebanese-forces-wait-on-promised-funds/	2025-01-31T12:45:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250108_LAF_beirut_GettyImages-2185633357-e1736362566933.jpg
Addressing risk and intellectual property rights in the FLRAA supply chain	The Future Long Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) team show Col. Matthew Scher, the 25th Combat Aviation Brigade commanding officer, what his Soldiers can expect from the FLRAA in the 3rd Battalion, 25th Aviation Regiment hangar Sept. 9, 2024. A tiltrotor aircraft, FLRAA will have the hybrid capabilities of planes and helicopters. (Photo by Spc. Charles Clark, 25th Infantry Div.) Risk is a program killer, most recently leading to the demise of the Army’s Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft that planned for a new platform in addition to a greenfield engine. In contrast, its program-mate under the Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program – the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) – is taking an iterative path that places a reliance on mature and high-TRL systems already flying on the the Apache, Black Hawk, and Chinook, including an upgraded but established powerplant, to augment development of new, advanced capabilities such as launched effects. There’s something else noteworthy about the FLRAA program – it will introduce a tiltrotor to the Army’s aviation fleet for the first time. That in of itself will open new paths to risk throughout the defense industrial base as suppliers design, build, and support systems for FVL, while also creating new opportunities for technology insertion into an aging fleet. 'The last developmental rotorcraft [in the Army was] about 40 or so years ago,' said FLRAA Project Manager Col. Jeffrey Poquette. 'So, yes, there are challenges and at the forefront are the industrial base and supply chain risk. This was highlighted during COVID, how fragile the supply chains are – everything from cars to electronics. On the defense side, we’ve seen it with ammunition and now with aircraft, which is a very complex weapon system with a lot of components. 'I wouldn’t say that there are unique challenges particular to a tiltrotor. A tiltrotor is a kind of rotorcraft, a helicopter is a kind of rotorcraft, and both of them have complex supply chains that we have to manage carefully. Ensuring a resilient supply chain has been at the forefront of this program for many years now. We’ve stood up a supply chain risk management team that looks at everything from the raw materials to finished products and subcomponents [at] the lowest level in the supply chain.' In addition, a relatively recent DoD-wide acquisition capability called 'consent to subcontract' gives project managers and contractor officers greater control over subcontracts that their prime contractors award to their lower-tier subs. In the case of FLRAA, Bell is the prime. The FLRAA tiltrotor is now in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase where the critical design of the aircraft will be finalized, leading to development of aircraft prototypes for testing. (Bell photo) 'When Bell wants to subcontract with a supplier, they have to prove out a number of things, and one is supply chain resilience and risk level,' said Poquette, noting areas of particular concern that include whether suppliers rely on raw materials that can only be sourced from outside the U.S., and if they’ve developed multiple sources of supply within their own lower-tier suppliers. 'My team then assesses it and before I sign off on that consent, we take a look at supply chain risk management.' FLRAA’s Milestone B decision attained in mid-2024 was, in part, due to the program’s risk posture at that point. The tiltrotor is now in the Engineering and Manufacturing Development phase where the critical design of the aircraft will be finalized, leading to development of aircraft prototypes for testing, ultimately informing a Milestone C decision in 2028 about production of fieldable aircraft. 'Supply chain risk management is key to a healthy production line,' said Ryan Ehinger, senior vice president and program director, FLRAA Future Long Range Assault Aircraft/V-280 Valor at Bell. 'Aviation component lead times are long and requalification/switching costs for making changes mid-production are high. The government and industry collectively have done a tremendous amount of work over the last decade to reduce risk and inform the requirements, and the current EMD phase is all about further maturation of the digital models, finalizing engineering hardware and software designs, maturing the sustainment artifacts, and driving toward a successful weapon system critical design review as the next major program milestone. 'Bell takes pride in the internal vertical integration of many key components and final assembly, but it is a team of industry leaders spanning many layers of the supply chain that complete the weapon system. All parts are important, and each supplier should feel the weight of program success on their shoulders and an accountability to the warfighters who need this affordable and sustainable capability. We are all working together in EMD, developing myriad systems and components in parallel for integration into our models and assembly and test against the requirements set.' In addition to risk reduction, the disposition of Intellectual property rights for FLRAA systems is another supply chain issue – who owns what and for how long, and the Army’s desire to prevent vendor lock on systems so new capabilities to address evolving threats can be more quickly spiraled in via the application of the Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA). The Army says it doesn’t want to own or control all the IP, only where it fits with the Army aviation mission, especially as it relates to sustainment. 'IP for the Army is focused around logistics functions like training, maintaining, sustaining,' said Poquette. 'We have the heritage of wanting to be able to do that without reliance on contractor support, especially where the Army operates deep in areas that are considered hazardous. So how did we do that? 'Rather than ask for specific IP, we presented to the contractors what it is we wanted to do. We did that in hundreds of use cases. We need to be able to develop training materials and manuals, we need to be able to change them when it’s time to change them. We need to be able to instruct and train on how to do maintenance. What we did was incentivize the contractors during competition to provide the most that they could in order to meet those use cases. Once we had a winner in the competition, we signed Bell up to provide all that intellectual property,' he said, adding that this has been an effective way to get access to the appropriate amount of IP that the Army needs while still protecting the creators of that IP. Such strategies around MOSA, intellectual property, and data rights for FLRAA’s long-term sustainment are a significant shift that will impact how suppliers have traditionally operated their businesses. Said Ehinger, 'With some of these new initiatives, suppliers that are able to provide the best value in a competitive environment will do well and suppliers that fail to adapt will see fewer opportunities. A key element of this requires collaboration between industry and government to understand associated intellectual property and data rights, what is needed for long-term organic sustainment, and how industry can help facilitate that. Customers are rightfully passionate about their ability to sustain their platforms over the long term. MOSA is going to be a game changer in terms of enabling affordable upgrades to mission systems. 'As an industry we are at a unique time where we can create a truly new weapon system leveraging the latest in manufacturing technology to yield improvements in affordability and quality. Part of this is due to the advancement in machinery, as well as how the digital thread and software has matured to allow fewer steps in the transition from engineering to manufacturing to assembly and inspection, all leveraging the same source data and reducing the opportunity for defective data. The industrial base is advancing to embrace this and, from a supply chain perspective, those that are able to thrive in this environment of model-based definition and maintain the integrity of the digital thread are at a clear advantage.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/addressing-risk-and-intellectual-property-rights-in-the-flraa-supply-chain/	2025-01-31T12:42:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/DVIDS-FLRAA-photo-for-Bell-Poquette-scaled-e1738355079836.jpg
The sky is not falling: Why Trump may not need the space council anyway	US President Donald Trump watches the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, with astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, lifts off from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on May 30, 2020. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images) Since the inauguration of President Donald Trump to his second term, close observers of American endeavors in space seem to be wringing their hands over the potential dis-establishment of the National Space Council. The council, established in the late 1980s but dormant for many years before its 2017 revival by an executive order by Trump and continued through the Biden years, was designed to '[synchronize] the nation’s civil, commercial, and national security space activities to advance the broader priorities' of the United States in space, according to a Biden-era fact sheet. But media rumors suggest Trump could ax the council, egged on by lobbying from Elon Musk’s SpaceX, according to Reuters. That, in turn, has prompted concerns related to how 'we need a National Space Council to chart our future in outer space.' There are several layers to this argument, but the long and short of it is that it’s overblown. It may be the case that Trump simply does not need a space council to pursue his administration’s strategy for American space leadership for the next four years. Here’s why: The President already has the policy framework and strategy for American spacepower from his first term. The second Trump administration does not need another year long space posture review to decide where we are going when we have the National Strategy for Space and all the SPDs developed during the 2017-2021 first term. It can be argued that the National Space Council has already met its objectives for the administration, and now its up to the President and his new team to execute these directives and strategy across civil, commercial, and national security space as soon as possible. RELATED: Space Force zeroed out funding for in-space mobility in FY26 budget request, sources say The National Strategy for Space was never fully implemented, neither were the Space Policy Directives (SPDs). These should provide the framework for American excellence in space and all departments and agencies tasked within these should be held accountable with timelines and budgetary support from OMB and Congress. That will be hard enough dealing with Congressional opinions and ideas despite having majorities in both Houses. No need to bury the president in excess policy discussions when that homework has been done. The existence of a National Space Council will not prevent 'rogue agencies doing what they want.' I know this from experience. In the last Trump administration, there were many departments and agencies that would use the implementation guidance coordination process as means of 'resistance' to the president’s strategy and policy directives. While many people complain about how the president is looking for senior appointments to run the departments and agencies who are 'loyal', the fact is that each of these people serve at the pleasure of the president, and their jobs is to execute his policies, once the discussion period is complete. To avoid providing additional means for resistance to policy directives from continuing, recruiting those who are of the same mind is key. It might be that some at the highest levels think that the time for discussion is over and the time to move out is now. I for one believe this to be the case. The relationship between Trump and Elon Musk has not 'politicized space.' I have written on this topic of 'politicizing space' before. The reality is space policy has always been a political undertaking, both nationally and internationally. Apollo was a geopolitical decision by John F. Kennedy. Not everyone in the US government was on board and did what they could to kill the effort. The Space Shuttle and space station were both political decisions. Many have argued that if the Russians weren’t engaged for the International Space Station, NASA might not have had a vote to continue the project. Cancelling the Constellation project to send astronauts back to the moon and to Mars, started by President George W. Bush, was a political decision that even President Barack Obama’s own party members in Congress were not totally happy with. RELATED: &#8216;Changes' expected in ISR satellite operations to sort NGA, Space Force roles, official says Decisions in the future regarding civil and national security space will continue to generate political mobilization. It is an area of great emotion, passion, and strategic need. Space is only politics free in science fiction. Musk is a very outspoken proponent of going to Mars. This is not a new thing. Musk was a huge advocate of this when Obama was in office as well as during the Biden administration. The difference between Trump and Obama with the Biden administration is while Obama and Trump sought to enable commercial space technology such as SpaceX for commercial crew, cargo, and other capabilities, the Biden administration was perceived as overly restrictive. While some regulation is vital to safety of property and the environment, too much is hindering to American leadership in space. It only makes sense that Musk would ally with Trump given his stated position to extend American 'manifest destiny among the stars.' Given that is Musk’s dream as well, this is a not an unusual business and personal relationship between an industry figure and the president. There are other voices included in the space policy world, Newt Gingrich, Bob Walker, Jared Issacman, and many more are also part of this discussion and will be joining the Trump administration’s space policy team, in the case of Issacman. Keeping all these realities in mind, might help people understand that while a national Space Council is something that should be supported, there is some sound logic behind why, at least in the Trump administration, such an institution is not necessary for the second term. The objective now is to get moving. Get the Space Force armed and ready to defend the nation’s critical space infrastructure out into cis-lunar space, and to see the 'stars and stripes planted on the planet Mars.' Let’s get going!

‘More work to be done’ to lower barriers to tech-sharing for AUKUS Pillar II, Australian official says	The crew of the USS Asheville assemble on the casing of the submarine during a visit to HMAS Stirling in Rockingham, Western Australia. (Australian government) WEST 2025 — The AUKUS nations have made progress in loosening regulatory barriers when it comes to the exchange of defense technology for the alliance's Pillar II initiative, but an Australian official said much more red tape still needs to be cut. 'If we're going to step into this endeavor, we've got to be committed to creating opportunities to accelerate and getting technology into the hands of our warfighters,' Commodore David Frost, naval attache in the Royal Australian Navy, told an audience here at the West conference on Thursday. 'That can only be achieved if we knock down many of the barriers to that, one of which is the licenses that are required for us to share.' Frost was referencing licenses still withheld under the Excluded Technology List (ELT), a list that, as its name suggests, identifies tech that's still controlled by onerous export rules like the US government's International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). In August the US approved new ITAR rules to speed along AUKUS-related tech sharing, but experts and lawmakers have called for the alliance to go further. Frost suggested that's been in the works. 'So Australia, and particularly in Washington, with the State Department, with the Pentagon, with the Navy, we've been very focused on that excluded technology list to make sure it's as minimal as possible so we can get at sharing that technology. Now are we there yet? No, we're not,' he said. 'We need to focus on that so there's more work to be done.' Related: AUKUS ITAR changes not much help for Pillar 2 tech: US Studies Centre experts Frost said that narrowing down the excluded tech list will help strengthen not only Pillar II efforts — which include capabilities such as hypersonics, autonomy, AI and other advanced weapons — but also would give small businesses the opportunity to showcase their capabilities. 'We are committed to creating an environment where not just the clients who have the ability to operate in an ITAR environment, because they have resources and people that just do that as part of their business, but small backyard people, the SMEs [small and medium size enterprises] that have really good technology that can be shared and get into the hands of the warfighter,' Frost told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the event.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/more-work-to-be-done-to-lower-barriers-to-tech-sharing-for-aukus-pillar-ii-australian-official-says/	2025-01-31T07:15:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/20230314ran8562933_0001-scaled-e1678829734251.jpg
Army launching self-propelled howitzer competition in mid-February, after globetrotting evalution tour	A photo of the Extended Range Cannon Artillery (US Army) The service plans to host a competition that will kick off with the release of a Phase I request for proposal in mid-February, the service’s Program Executive Officer for Ground Combat Systems Maj. Gen. Glenn Dean said in a Wednesday email. 'Phase I is the ‘get to test’ phase which includes further testing of mature platforms, and it will not be a vendor downselect — competition in this phase remains critical,' Dean added. Instead, the Army is planning to pick an unspecified number of companies to proceed and award Phase I contracts around the July to September timeframe. Those vendors will then participate in additional 'competitive evaluation testing' that will run through fiscal 2026. RELATED: Army anticipates return of repaired logistics vessel prototype by month's end 'To support current and future operations, next generation artillery must deliver precise and effective fires at range and be able to mass fires to support operations,' the two-star general wrote in response to questions. 'It is not an either/or, but both.' 'The ability to mass fire is not just the ability to fire rapidly (rate of fire), but also the ability to load, move, emplace, fire, displace, reload, and re-emplace/refire at a pace that supports the needs of the supported force,' he added. While the Army continued work on associated munitions under the ERCA banner, it was torn over whether to relaunch development of a new platform or pull an existing one from industry. To help find that answer, the service went on an international roadshow in recent months, visiting a handful of companies from Europe to Asia to the Middle East — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems. In early December, Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team leader Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks said those evaluations were going well with early findings indicating that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation.' 'We’re very pleased with what we’re seeing so far, and even some on the autonomy side,' the one-star general told an audience at an Association of the US Army event on Dec. 3.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-launching-self-propelled-howitzer-competition-in-mid-february-after-globetrotting-evalution-tour/	2025-01-31T05:23:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Extended-Range-Artillery-Cannon-ERCA-Army.jpeg
Don’t force Pacific Island nations to choose between us or China, says UK Royal Navy admiral	China's Premier Li Qiang shows the way to Solomon Islands' Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare after they observed their national anthems during a welcome ceremony at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on July 10, 2023. (Photo by ANDY WONG/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) WEST 2025 — Western countries should avoid pressuring Pacific Island nations from making a binary choice between working with China or the United States and its allies, an admiral from the United Kingdom’s Royal Navy warned, citing the massive maritime might the Chinese could bring on smaller countries. 'The way in which global trade is interconnected at the moment means that China has a trump card of maritime trade that no other nation on the planet’s got,' Rear Adm. James Parkin, who is responsible for overseeing the development of the Royal Navy’s technologies, told attendees at West in San Diego on Wednesday. Parkin specifically cited China’s shipbuilding infrastructure, which is consistently rated as the best in the world when measured in number of ships built per year. The Chinese government 'passed a law that every merchant ship can be changed to be a state-owned vessel in era of combat,' Parkin said. 'So, as well as the silhouettes of warships versus warships … there’s another 10,000 state-owned Chinese vessels which could be brought to bear in an era of conflict.' More specifically, he said China could use its fleet to create an 'almost universal maritime trade embargo' which would have immediate consequences for smaller, secluded Pacific Island countries. US Coast Guard and Navy leadership often talk publicly about the assistance they strive to provide to smaller island nations in the Indo-Pacific as a means of military diplomacy. They also warn those same nations about the coercive tactics the Chinese have used: offering money and aide up front, but then later calling in a debt to gain access to useful ports and other resources. 'The [People’s Republic of China] has resorted to corruption, bribery, and personal threats to advance its influence in the [Pacific Island countries],' according to the Pentagon’s 2024 report on China’s power. 'In March 2023, outgoing Federated States of Micronesia President David Panuelo criticized the PRC for its widespread bribes of Micronesian officials and reported PRC officials made direct threats to his personal safety.' Although US military officials don't directly ask these countries to pick sides in the way Parkin stated, they do stress the importance that these nations and others view the United States as its partner of choice over China. Asked about this, Parkin said, 'I think if you look at the different levers of power, the diplomatic, the industrial, the military and the economic, in times of peace, people don't connect to those elements.' 'What my points are reflecting is that in time of conflict, clearly, the military element of those four levers of powers is much more important,' he said, 'but if the other three levers have already been locked down, then we may not get the answer we want when it comes to the way in which other independent nations may choose to go.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/dont-force-pacific-island-nations-to-choose-between-us-or-china-says-uk-royal-navy-admiral/	2025-01-30T14:07:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230721_china_solomon_GettyImages-1517817161-scaled-e1689946587637.jpg
Sweden’s new $1.2B donation to Ukraine includes drones, missiles and boats	Swedish and Ukrainian flags on a balcony in Kiev, Ukraine. (Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — Sweden today announced a 13.5 billion SEK ($1.23 billion) military aid package to Ukraine and Moldova, the 18th support package Stockholm has announced for Kyiv’s aid. Among the key components of this package is approximately $90 million for the production of long-range missiles and drones, which aims to bolster Ukraine’s offensive capabilities, according to the announcement by the Swedish government and its coalition party on Thursday. The package also includes donations of 16 CB90-class fast assault boats, 1,500 anti-tank TOW missiles and 200 anti-armor AT4 weapons. The aid package also includes 23 naval weapons stations and one million rounds of ammunition for the combat boats, to support Ukraine's naval capabilities. 'This is also a signal to our other allies that we need to prepare for the fact that Europe will have to take greater responsibility for the support to Ukraine,' Defence Minister Pål Jonson said. Approximately 45 percent of the military aid package for Ukraine, amounting to $544 million, is money being set aside for the Swedish Defense Material Administration to buy more equipment for Ukraine’s needs from European defense industries. Decisions on where to spend that money has been made in consultation with Ukraine, and deliveries will happen within the next 24 months, Jonson's spokesperson told Breaking Defense. In addition, $181.5 million will be sent through the 'Danish model' to Ukraine's defense industry, and another $72.6 million will be sent to funds such as the Comprehensive Assistance Package (CAP) and the British International Fund for Ukraine (IPU), which finance the purchase of military equipment. The decision to include AT4s for Moldova is notable, as it reflects Stockholm’s broader strategy of supporting regional stability beyond Ukraine’s borders. Moldova, a non-NATO member state, is viewed by regional experts as the next potential target for Russian aggression should Moscow win out in Ukraine. 'Increasing our engagement with countries within the EU’s Eastern Partnership, such as Moldova, is a key part of Sweden’s policy to constrain Russia. This policy aims to constrain Russia’s influence, freedom of action and ability to do harm,' Jonson said on X. 'Moldova is a target of repeated Russian influence campaigns, and it is in Europe’s security interest to help Moldova get stronger and safer.' Ukraine dictates the needs and short delivery times are crucial, according to the government press brief on Thursday. In 2025, Sweden will be allocating $58 million towards the education and training of Ukrainian soldiers, demonstrating a long-term commitment to enhancing Ukraine’s military capabilities through education. As of today’s announcement, Sweden has contributed a total of approximately $5.62 billion in military support to Ukraine since Russia's full-scale invasion began nearly three years ago, according to a government summary.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/swedens-new-1-2b-donation-to-ukraine-includes-drones-missiles-and-boats/	2025-01-30T12:05:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/sweden-ukraine-flags-scaled-e1738261497904.jpg
Germany’s Diehl Defence receives 4-nation IRIS-T Block II development contract	Concept art of the future IRIS-T Block II short range, air-to-air missile (Diehl Defence) BELFAST — German weapons manufacturer Diehl Defence announced today that it has been contracted to lead development and production of IRIS-T (InfraRed Imaging System – Tail/Thrust Vector Controlled) Block II air-to-air missiles on behalf of program partner nations Germany, Italy, Spain and Sweden. The company said in a statement that the Block II contract was originally signed by Germany’s federal office for armed forces equipment, information technology and in-service support (BAAINBw) at the 'end of December' 2024 and was 'realized in the shortest possible time.' It added, 'The IRIS-T Block II contract marks an important milestone for the future of IRIS-T,' but did not disclose a contract value, quantities of Block II weapons on order or delivery dates. Neither Diehl nor the BAAINBw responded to requests for comment by press time. The Diehl statement did not explain the defining features of the Block II upgrade, sharing only that the missile will be 'improved continuously and will continue to set benchmarks with new capabilities in its original air-to-air role.' As noted by the manufacturer, IRIS-T is a European short range, air-to-air missile, with the in-production Block I developed in collaboration at an industrial level by Germany, Greece, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden. 'The seeker assisted radar proximity fuze and the large warhead give the missile a remarkable anti-missile capability,' states achieved Diehl company literature. Capable of striking enemy fighter jets and intercepting air-to-air or surface-to-air missiles, the weapon was designed as a successor to the US Air Intercept Missile (AIM)-9X Sidewinder air-to-air missile and has been in production since 2005. To date, over 5,000 units have been delivered. The weapon is integrated on a range of fighters jets including the Swedish Gripen, Eurofighter Typhoon, US platforms like the F-5E, F-16, EF-18, and South Korea’s KF-21. More broadly, the IRIS-T family also features the IRIS-T SL (surface-launched) missile equipped for Ground Based Air Defense (GBAD) systems. It is a core part of Ukraine's air defense. A total of 11 IRIS-T platforms, split between SLS (short) and SLM (medium) types, have so far been delivered by Germany, according to a military aid factsheet. As Breaking Defense previously reported, Germany plans on taking deliveries later this year under a six IRIS T-SLM fire unit acquisition. Diehl also unveiled the newest addition to the IRIS-T collection at the Berlin Airshow last year. The in-development system will be capable of 'covering ranges of up to 80 km,' it said at the time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/germanys-diehl-defence-receives-4-nation-iris-t-block-ii-development-contract/	2025-01-30T11:01:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/2024_12_Pressemitteilung_IRIS_T-scaled-e1738251614684.jpg
Northrop to sell training services unit to Serco in $327M deal	In this photo illustration, the American multinational aerospace and defense technology company Northrop Grumman logo is seen displayed on a smartphone with an economic stock exchange index graph in the background. (Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Northrop Grumman is selling off its training services business to Serco for $327 million, as the prime contractor restructures its defense systems division and focuses its business on innovation. The transaction is expected to close mid-year 2025, the companies said in a statement announcing the deal. 'We continuously evaluate the portfolio to ensure that we are investing in the businesses that are core to achieving our strategic vision. This includes accessing any gaps that may emerge over time or businesses that may make sense to exit. With this in mind, we've decided to exit our training services business that is part of defense systems segment,' Northrop CEO Kathy Warden said during an earnings call this morning. 'This is an important capability for our customers, and we expect the team to continue to deliver world class training services under new leadership, allowing us to focus on our core business.' The sale will grow Serco’s revenue in North America to beyond $2 billion and its workforce by about 1,000 employees, adding mission training services and software for satellite ground stations to the company’s portfolio, Serco said in a news release. Alongside the sale of training services, Northrop has transferred its strike and surveillance aircraft services business from its defense systems division to its aeronautics unit, a move that puts aircraft sustainment in the same portfolio as aircraft development and production. The realignment will allow for a 'more seamless development and sustainment of next generation aircraft' in aeronautics while focusing the defense systems portfolio on strategic deterrence systems like the Sentinel, advanced weapons and missile defense, said Northrop Chief Financial Officer Ken Crews. Northrop’s fourth quarter earnings provided few surprises, with Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners calling it a 'clean, event free quarter from Northrop.' Warden, however, did provide some new details on usually-quite-secretive programs like the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system and the services’ next-generation fighter jets. Northrop is continuing to meet milestones on the Sentinel contract, even as the Air Force 'paused work on some small infrastructure efforts in the command and launch' as it considers how to restructure the program in the wake of massive cost overruns, Warden said. Last year, the Pentagon determined that it would continue the program despite an 81 percent increase in cost, and the Air Force is considering reopening pieces of the troubled ground infrastructure portion of the contract up for competition. Asked about the Air Force and Navy’s next-generation fighter programs, Warden specified that Northrop is 'not a prime, but we are a contributor to the program through mission systems' on the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance program. For the Navy’s F/A-XX program, where Northrop is competing as a prime contractor, the company continues to monitor the effort and 'would be excited to be selected,' she added. The company has not built either program into its financial guidance. Last year, Gen. Thomas Bussiere, head of Air Force Global Strike Command, said that the service may need to accelerate or increase its planned buy of B-21 bombers. Asked today whether an accelerated buy would affect pricing of the aircraft, Warden was noncommittal. 'We would work with the Air Force to look at when those units would come into the contract, and obviously we are accumulating more and more actual performance to help inform discussions with them about the right pricing,' she said. 'It would be premature for me to comment on where we expect that to land.' Warden praised the Trump administration for its attention to missile defense issues through its support of an Iron Dome system for the United States, saying that Northrop is 'well-positioned to support that architecture.' She also said the company looks forward to engaging with the Department of Government Efficiency headed by Elon Musk. 'I believe we all see that there is room for cost efficiency in the way that we work together between industry and government, and so we've embraced the opportunity to share some of our observations and ideas, and are starting to do that,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/northrop-to-sell-training-services-unit-to-serco-in-327m-deal/	2025-01-30T10:07:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/northrop-logo-phone-scaled-e1699982995194.jpg
Elbit to supply Israel with $80 million in EW and protection suites for F-16s	The F-16I has been in service for 20 years with the IDF, and several squadrons fly the warplane. (IDF) JERUSALEM — The Israel Ministry of Defense is acquiring $80 million in 'advanced self-protection suites' for Israel's F-16I aircraft, the latest in a procurement blitz in the wake of the conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon. The Ministry of Defense made the aquisition announcement on Monday, saying the F-16s will 'be equipped with cutting-edge technologies to ensure maximum protection in complex combat scenarios.' The ministry did not specify how many F-16Is will be equipped, nor did it say which squadrons flying the F-16I will get the upgrade. However, photographs distributed by the ministry showed planes from the 107th squadron, with an orange crescent emblazoned on its tail and the 201st squadron, known at The One, which has a '1' on the tail. The IAF has two other F-16I squadrons: the 253rd, which first integrated the warplane, and the 119th 'Bat' squadron. The Israeli Air Force has flown F-16s since the 1980s, including the F-16I since it entered service in 2004. The new protection suite includes an 'Electonic Warfare (EW) system providing advanced threat disruption capabilities, ⁠Infra-Red (IR) Missile Warning and Launch Detection System for early identification of airborne and ground threats and Advanced chaff and flare dispensing system for protection against guided missile,' the ministry said. The procurement of the new systems for the F-16s is part of a much larger process the Ministry of Defense has embarked upon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas. Israel was already acquiring new heavy lifter helicopters and refuelers. It had also just taken delivery of four new corvette warships and was upgrading its air defenses. However, the war has highlighted the need for Israel to acquire a large number of new systems for a much larger number of forces and platforms. One part of this process was underlined by the Nagel Commission, empaneled in the summer of 2024 to look at force building needs. 'This process joins a series of strategic deals promoted by the Israel Ministry of Defense under Director General Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir to strengthen production independence in Israeli defense industries and reduce dependency on external factors. This is to ensure the IDF’s qualitative military edge and support its current and future operational needs under all conditions,' the ministry said in its statement. Zamir is reported to be on the short list for the new Chief of Staff as Israel’s Minister of Defense Israel Katz looks for a replacement for Herzi Halevi, who recently said he is resigning. Elbit Systems has secured several EW and self-protection suite deals in recent years. In 2024 it was awarded $175 million to supply them for Embraer C-390s and Airbus H225M helicopters for an unnamed NATO country. It has also been contracted to provide EW to the German air force for CH-53 helicopters, and also for the Netherlands Gulfstream G650 aircraft, in deals in 2023 and 2022 respectively.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/elbit-to-supply-israel-with-80-million-in-ew-and-protection-suites-for-f-16s/	2025-01-30T09:46:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250130_f16i_inflight_IDF-e1738257717105.png
Army secretary nominee pledges focus on aviation after Black Hawk collides with airliner	Emergency response units assess airplane wreckage in the Potomac River near Ronald Reagan Washington Airport on January 30, 2025 in Arlington, Virginia. An American Airlines flight from Wichita, Kansas collided with a helicopter while approaching Ronald Reagan National Airport. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In the wake of last night’s tragic accident involving a civilian aircraft and US Army helicopter that has left dozens dead, service secretary nominee Daniel Driscoll kicked off his confirmation hearing vowing to focus on aviation. 'Our thoughts and prayers go out to all involved in last night's tragedy, which occurred a few miles away from this hearing room. If confirmed [I’ll work to ensure] this never happens again,' Driscoll told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during his opening statement. The committee met hours after American Airlines Flight 5342 and an Army UH-60 Black Hawk collided in the air near Washington National Airport, on the outskirts of the nation’s capital. The commercial aircraft — inbound from Wichita, Kan. — was carrying 64 people, while the helicopter was flying a training mission with three soldiers from the 12th Aviation Battalion at Fort Belvoir, Va. There are no presumed survivors and the National Transportation Safety Board is slated to lead the investigation. 'It's an accident that seems to be preventable, for what we can tell [right now], that should not happen. I think of focus from the top down, on a culture of safety, there are appropriate times to take risk and there are inappropriate times to take risk,' Driscoll said in response to questions from Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-NH. 'I don't know the details around this one, but [if] confirmed, and working with this committee to figure out the facts, I think we might need to look at where is an appropriate time to take training risk, and it may not be near an airport like Reagan.' Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth addressed the accident this morning in a pre-taped video release, noting that the soldiers were conducting an annual proficiency training flight. 'It was a fairly experienced crew, and that was doing a required annual night evaluation. They did have night vision goggles,' Hegseth said. 'The 12th aviation battalion, as of now, is granted a 48 hour operational pause on contingency missions as what happened is reviewed and a senior level Aviation team, an investigative team from our aviation safety center was deployed last night.' While last night’s accident didn’t take center stage at the start of today’s confirmation hearing, Chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., kicked it off with a moment of silence. Last night's deadly crash comes in the wake of several years of intense scrutiny over Army aviation. In April 2023, the Army leaders announced a service-wide aviation stand down following a pair of deadly helicopter accidents that claimed the lives of a dozen soldiers. That stand down grounded all Army aviators, except those participating in 'critical missions.' 'The safety of our aviators is our top priority, and this stand down is an important step to make certain we are doing everything possible to prevent accidents and protect our personnel,' then-Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said in a release. 'During this stand down, we will focus on safety and training protocols to ensure our pilots and crews have the knowledge, training and awareness to safely complete their assigned mission.' But the accidents kept coming, as did the scrutiny. According to an online Army newsletter [PDF] about aviation mishaps that was released this month, things got worse in fiscal 2024. 'FY24 will be a year that Army aviation looks back on in hopes of never repeating,' the newsletter begins. 'After years of a steady decline in mishap rates per 100,000 hours beginning in 2006, FY23 saw a twofold increase in mishap rates from FY22’s record low 0.50 Class A mishaps per 100,000 hours. Then FY24 produced a Class A flight mishap rate almost four times greater than FY22, with a rate of 1.90.' More specifically, it notes that last year was the 'most' Class A flight mishaps since FY14 and the 'worst' Class A flight mishap rate per 100,000 hours since FY07. 'The most obvious trend in the FY24 mishaps was the AH-64 [Apache] fleet being overrepresented with nine of the 15 Class A flight mishaps,' the Army newsletter continues. 'Eight of the AH-64 mishaps were attributed to human error, with two of those being attributed to maintenance errors. The final AH-64 mishap was a bird strike.' In FY24, there were also three UH-72 Lakota Class A mishaps, and one-off mishaps with the fleet of UH-60 Black Hawks, the CH-47 Chinooks and the Beechcraft C-12 Huron. There was also a Class A environmental event that damaged over 40 aircraft and a C-12 Class A aircraft ground mishap during maintenance operations. In April 2024, before the fiscal year ended, the Army announced an Aviation Safety Stand-Up with no pause in operations. 'During this stand up, aviation units will execute targeted training that we've really been deliberate about crafting while continuing to fly missions,' said Brig Gen Walter Rugen, then the director of Army aviation. 'Again, for our overarching goal to build enduring readiness and proficiency in our force. 'We assess that the recent accident increase would be better mitigated by focusing more on specific training topics to better get at targeted areas that are contributing to many of our safety issues,' he later added. 'So, more training, more focused training.' While President Donald Trump’s pick to be 26th Army secretary is relatively unknown, with a limited social media presence, he seemingly has support from both sides of the aisle. Driscoll, who previously served as an advisor to now-Vice President JD Vance, is a graduate of Yale Law School, former Army soldier, and has spent time working in the private equity arena. In a rarity for Washington, he arrived at the committee with a bipartisan show of support: Sens Markwayne Mullen, R- Okla., and Richard Blumenthal, D-Ct., introduced Driscoll at the start of the hearing. 'I spoke to Dan a number of times in the course of his preparing for his appearance here today, and those conversations convinced me that he is willing to work on the basis of collegiality, to be transparent and open with this panel with the Congress and our colleagues,' Blumenthal said during his introduction. The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Jack Reed, D-RI., also seemingly threw his support behind the nominee to lead the Army saying he brings 'integrity, intelligence and the experience of the young officer leading soldiers.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/washington-dc-aviation-airport-crash-black-hawk-army-secretary-safety/	2025-01-30T08:16:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/dca-crash-scaled-e1738253107889.jpg
Saudi defense giant SAMI appoints new CEO	Visitors check out the booth for Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI) at the Dubai Airshow in 2023. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Saudi Arabia’s government-owned defense giant has appointed Thamer AlMuhid as its new Chief Executive Officer, five months after previous CEO Walid Abukhaled stepped down, the company's board of directors announced today. 'In his role as CEO, Eng. AlMuhid will lead SAMI's mission to develop cutting-edge technologies, manufacture world-class products, and forge strategic partnerships,' according to a statement from Saudi Arabian Military Industries. The company said AlMuhid served earlier in several executive positions from CEO of Saudi Chemical Company to the vice chairman of the board of directors of the National Academy of Military Industries. As CEO of SAMI, one of AlMuhid's primary responsibilities will be to push SAMI to realize Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 goal of localizing 50 percent of defense production in the country. RELATED: Saudi Arabia reveals strides in local defense production as it races towards ambitious 2030 goal AlMuhid will be the third SAMI CEO since the organization's founding in 2017, after German national and former Rheinmetall executive Andreas Schwer, and Saudi national and former Northrop Grumman executive Walid Abukhaled. 'I’m extremely proud to say since the inception of SAMI, we became one of the top 100 defense companies in the world,' then-CEO Abukhaled told Breaking Defense in an interview at the World Defense Show in Riyadhi in February 2024. 'Whether it's a vehicle land vehicle, a futuristic UAV that is a concept, some C4I systems, C2 systems, smaller versions of UAVs, converting a manned boat to unmanned boat — we've done it, it's us. The shift is already happening.'

Breaking down how the Pentagon could spend $200 billion extra	On March 11, 2024 the Pentagon and military services presented their fiscal year 2025 budget requests. (Graphic by Breaking Defense, original images courtesy DVIDS, Getty) The president has recently reiterated his commitment to 'peace through strength,' and the Congress is hard at work to make that happen. Initial press reports indicate that Congress could increase defense spending through the reconciliation process by as much as $200 billion, or $100B per year for fiscal 2025 and 2026, above the Biden-proposed defense topline request of $849.8B. With the FY25 NDAA already passed, normally, any additional funds would be added by the appropriators. However, if these funds are added through reconciliation, then it may be that the authorizers, led by Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., as opposed to the appropriators, who will have greater control in deciding where these funds will be allocated. More money for the Pentagon is an inherently good thing: The department needs not just the money it has asked for, but whatever extra Congress can churn up. But given that DoD has only one confirmed Trump appointee, the Congress will need a guide to determine where this money should go. Fortunately, a written guide already exists in the form of Wicker’s May 2024 plan, appropriately called 'Peace through Strength.' Of course, that plan was written with a different potential topline increase in mind, so a 'new math' will be needed when considering how to spell the potential increase. This 'new math' will have three factors to consider: Wicker’s core plan, fixes for inflation, and what we can call the DOGE transformation. First, let’s start with Wicker’s original plan, which was for a $110 billion increase over two years, or $55 billion of additional funding per year. To start with nearly 85 percent of this $55 billion (Table 1) would go towards Defense/COCOM agencies, the Air Force and the Navy. What is striking is how little funding is allocated to the Army, Marines and the Space Force. While Wicker’s plan is not broken out by appropriation, some careful guesses based upon the descriptions of the individual items shows that this plan allocates over 91 percent of the funding for the three investment accounts (Table 2) and only about 8 percent for operating the force. With over $14 billion allocated in the continuing resolution for nuclear submarines, money that was set after Wicker’s plan was released, the $3.2 billion allocated in the Wicker plan for the Virginia-Class submarines could be reallocated and the ground forces should be running over to the Congress to get a piece of it. With $110 billion of the $200 billion now accounted for, let’s look at inflation. Right now, the military is limping along under a six-month long continuing resolution that my colleague at AEI Elaine McCusker calculates wastes billions of dollars per month. Additionally, inflation has eaten away at least 3 percent of the Pentagon’s buying power, which seems small unless you actually do the math and realize that this is almost $25 billion, or $2 billion per month in decreased readiness and capabilities. In FY24, due to the Fiscal Responsibility Act, the Pentagon’s topline was about $847 billion, so the Biden administration FY25 request of $850 billion is a 'cut' when inflation is taken into account. Assuming a 3 percent inflation rate, the defense budget in FY25 would need to be about $25 billion higher just to have the same buying power as in FY24. Looking forward into FY26, the Pentagon’s topline would need to add another $30 billion to maintain its buying power. Therefore, roughly $55 billion in spending authorized ($25 billion in FY25 and $30 billion in FY26) under reconciliation will be eaten up by simply keeping up with inflation. It’s not ideal, but it is what is realistic. The third bucket of funding is what remains of the $200 billion, which is $35 billion. And if the Trump administration is serious about DOGE and transforming the Department of Defense, then the Congress should allocate these funds to the Deputy Secretary of Defense nominee, Stephen Feinberg. These funds will enable the administration to immediately change the arc of defense procurement. The funds should be used to execute a 180-degree pivot away from exquisite, large, and costly platforms towards a future of mass production and mass customization. This would manifest itself as a full embrace of autonomy in the air, a massive embrace of autonomy at sea, and a new information technology backbone. If Ukraine can produce four million drones per year, certainly, with $35 billion per year, every year starting in FY26, the United States can change the arc of its defense industrial base and boost the efforts of the non-traditional defense firms. There seems to be bipartisan agreement that more money is needed for defense. This is a once in a generation opportunity. With Wicker clearly in the driver’s seat, this $200 billion added through reconciliation will enable the nation to truly achieve 'peace through strength.' It simply needs to follow the path set before it. Retired US Army Maj. Gen. John G. Ferrari is a senior nonresident fellow at AEI. Ferrari previously served as a director of program analysis and evaluation for the service.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/breaking-down-how-the-pentagon-could-spend-200-billion-extra/	2025-01-30T05:59:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240311_budget_day_gfx.png
Japan picks Textron T-6 for JASDF training fleet	A T-6A Texan II takes-off from Laughlin Air Force Base, Texas, June. 10, 2024. (U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Harrison Sullivan) SYDNEY — The Japanese military plans to buy Textron's T-6 as part of its effort to modernize its pilot training fleet, the American plane-maker said in press release. Textron's Tuesday announcement did not disclose how many of the Beechcraft T-6 Texan IIs the Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would buy, but said the agreement also includes a comprehensive ground-based training system, training for instructor pilots and aircraft maintainers, and long-term logistic and sustainment support. The Beechcraft T-6 Texan II will replace the Fuji/Subaru T-7 aircraft that has been Japan's basic trainer. RELATED: Chinese military delegation make rare visit to Japan, experts see pre-Trump prep The move continues Japan's strong tendency to buy American weapons, not surprising given its status as a treaty ally, and one that faces a surging Chinese military in the region.

‘Considerable’ effects: How the Osprey groundings hit one Navy wing	A CMV-22B Osprey inside a hangar at a US Navy base in San Diego, Calif. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense.) WEST 2025 — The three-month grounding of the Pentagon’s V-22 Osprey fleets last year had 'considerable' impact on the Navy's aviators and crews at a time when the service is transitioning to the Osprey as its primary aircraft for ferrying personnel and cargo, a deputy commodore of an Osprey wing here in San Diego told reporters. 'VRM-30 lost two deployments [on the aircraft carriers] Teddy Roosevelt and the Lincoln,' Capt. Andrew Beard, deputy commodore of the Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Wing, told reporters on Monday ahead of the West 2025 exposition. 'You had pilots and air crewmen who were banking on going away, getting lots of experience [and] getting qualified … Instead of doing that, they sat here and couldn’t train, they couldn’t fly,' he continued. VRM-30 is the Navy’s first CMV-22B Osprey squadron as the service transitions away from the legacy C-2A Greyhounds. VRM-50, based in San Diego, and VRM-40, based in Norfolk, Va., are the other fleet replacement squadrons focused on training new aviators and enlisted crews to operate the Osprey. Beard compared the situation to when an individual is sidelined for an extended period of time due to a medical incident, losing training time and flight hours as a result. The difference, Beard said, is that the squadron can mitigate that risk by pairing them with more senior personnel who can monitor them. But due to the fleet-wide grounding, even senior personnel had to spend time getting back up to the standard while junior crewmen had to continue waiting their turns to be cycled back into operations. 'I would say some of the junior folks probably didn’t fly in an aircraft for about five months. That’s considerable — due to no fault of their own,' Beard said. But the fleet has been dealing with a series of safety pauses going back to August 2022. The longest downtime, the roughly three-month pause Beard discussed, followed a November 2023 crash off the coast of Japan that killed eight airmen. After the most recent issue in December, Naval Air Systems Command cleared the V-22 fleets to continue flight operations under specific restrictions which were put in place following a brief pause implemented earlier that month. At that time, NAVAIR said a predetermined flight hour threshold for the aircraft’s gearbox would determine how it could operate, specifically the restriction implied newer gearboxes were more susceptible to problems. But the command decline to disclose a specific number for that threshold. A spokesperson for NAVAIR declined to comment when asked about Beard’s comments. 'Right now, our primary focus is on getting the [detachments] formed [and supporting] the carrier schedule. And we are keenly focused on doing that,' Beard said. 'That has become a challenge because of the recent interim flight clearance and the restrictions based on the gearboxes that are going on.' One of the restrictions in place under the interim flight clearance includes never being further than 30 minutes from a landing area. That poses particularly difficult challenges for the Navy, which operates its Ospreys over blue water ocean, compared to the Marines and Air Force who are usually closer to shore. Beard said the detachment currently aboard the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN-70) is unable to fly on certain days based on where the carrier is in the western pacific. But he also said that flight crews ultimately have some leeway to act as they see fit if circumstances demand it. 'All of our crews know and train to if there’s — if you’re in extremis and there’s a rock and it’s flat. Get it done,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/considerable-effects-how-the-osprey-groundings-hit-one-navy-squadron/	2025-01-29T14:24:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/CMV-22B-Osprey-scaled-e1738187152758.jpg
To be ready for China in 2027, think new software, not ships: Navy tech officer	The Navy is working to digitize its infrastructure and operations. (Graphic by Breaking Defense, original images via Getty and DVIDS) The Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) 'has tasked us with being able to close that kill chain against the PRC, our peer competitor in the western Pacific, no later than Jan. 1, 2027,' Chief Technology Officer of Task Force Hopper, Lt. Artem Sherbinin, said during a panel discussion here at the West naval conference. 'New warships &#8230; are not coming. New aircraft are not coming in that timeline. &#8230; But software is,' he said. 'Software delivery to ships is impacting the Red Sea fight today. We are updating those ships at sea and making them more lethal.' RELATED: Crowded waters: Who's doing what in the international hotspot of the Red Sea Sherbinin is in a key position for any focus on software, as the task force he's on is primarily aimed at enabling AI and machine learning integration across the service. His mention of 2027 is likely a reference to what's known as the Davidson Window, the time at which the US says Chinese leader Xi Jingping has told his military he wants the capability to invade Taiwan, should he decide to. (Xi reportedly told US officials he never made such a mandate.) US Navy CNO Adm. Lisa Franchetti highlighted the 2027 deadline in her 2024 navigation plan, dubbed Project 33 [PDF]. Closing the kill chain refers to the process of using a myriad of sensors to detect, locate, identify and track targets before attacking them with the most effective measure available. Better software, updated constantly, can keep the US ahead of its enemies, Sherbinin suggested. RELATED: To kill the kill chain: How Space Force could use AI to avoid &#8216;operational surprise' on orbit 'Software closes the kill chain faster and tightens that OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) Loop, because software cycle times and software production times and software deployment and delivery times are much faster. So, the rate of change is faster in the world of software and AI, as opposed to the world of large platform-centric warfare,' he said. 'Artillery shells still matter. Tomahawk still matters. Standard Missile Twos and Sixes still matter,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/to-be-ready-for-china-in-2027-think-new-software-not-ships-navy-tech-officer/	2025-01-29T14:06:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/230105_navy_digital_gfx.png
Poland adds long-range strike to its F-35 fleet with AARGM-ER missiles	Polish officials signed off on the procurement of the AARGM-ER missile on Jan. 28, 2025. (Bartosz Glowaki/Breaking Defense) WARSAW — Poland this week signed a $745 million agreement to purchase 200 AARGM-ER (Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missiles – Extended Range) missiles, produced by Northrop Grumman. The weapons, which are to be used on Poland’s fleet of F-35A Joint Strike Fighters, are scheduled to be delivered between 2029 and 2035. At Jan. 28 signing ceremony, Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defence, called the deal a 'breakthrough purchase' that will allow Poland to 'effectively use all the capabilities of these most modern aircraft.' The range of the weapon is over 200 km, giving Poland a long-range standoff system which can push back on the anti-access, area-denial air defenses of a potential foe — Russia, though it was not named directly by Maj. Gen. Ireneusz Nowak, general inspector of the Polish Air Force. An A2AD system 'is nothing more than a network of anti-aircraft systems based on medium- and long-range missiles, which are dangerous for our aircraft. The F-35, which, combined with its stealth [technology], will now have armament that allows the elimination of the control radars of these anti-aircraft systems, will be the right tool to do this job, which may not, let's hope, wait for us, but must be ready for it,' Nowak said. 'We are joining the club, one could say, of an exclusive nature of users of the AARGM-ER missile &#8230; the United States, the Netherlands, Finland and Australia. And here we can say that once again Poland is becoming a leader in implementing modern weapons, but it is also acquiring capabilities that will raise its rank and position in the Central-Eastern Europe region,' the general added. 'So this is a very significant purchase, and in my opinion this purchase brings not only operational capabilities, combat capabilities, but also re-establishes Poland's position in the region.' The US approved the potential Foreign Military Sale of the AARGM-ERs in April 2024. At the time, the approval was for 360 of the missiles with an estimated price tag of $1.275 billion. However, FMS announcements are often larger than final deals when completed. Poland is considering future purchase of advanced weapons for use on the F-35, including the JSM anti-ship or land attack cruise missiles, GBU-53/B StormBreaker air-launched precision-guided glide bombs, as well as new AIM-120D AMRAAM or Meteor BVRAAM missiles, Lt. Col. Łukasz Treder told Breaking Defense last summer. Treder, part of the F-35 implementation team for the Polish Air Force, said the missions that the jet will perform are secret and will depend on NATO declarations and Poland’s national requirements. However, he did not 'using these aircraft … for Quick Reaction Alert missions would be a waste of their combat potential.' The first F-35A Husarz for the Polish Air Force (AZ-02) flew on Dec. 2, 2024. The roughly one hour flight took off and at NAS JRB Fort Worth, Texas, located next to the Lockheed Martin plant where the fighters are built. The second Polish F-35A (AZ-01) flew one day later, and the third (AZ-03 flew on December 17. The first pair of jets then arrived at Ebbing Air National Guard Base in Nebraska on Dec. 23. The two aircraft will be used to train Polish fighter pilots and maintainers to use the newest generation jets. Overall, six F-35s are to be delivered to Poland in 2025, with another 14 scheduled for 2026, followed by four each in 2027 and 2028 and the final two in 2029. The Air Force’s 85th Fighter Group, a tenant at Ebbing ANGB, will conduct the F-35 pilot training for the Foreign Military Sales program. 'The arrival of Poland’s first F-35s is a significant milestone for our state, the nation and our allies who will train on this fifth-generation fighter at Ebbing Air National Guard Base,' said Brig. Gen. Chad Bridges, Arkansas adjutant general.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/poland-adds-long-range-strike-to-its-f-35-fleet-with-aargm-er-missiles/	2025-01-29T12:15:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Poland-AGM-88G_1-scaled-e1738172353464.jpg
Army anticipates return of repaired logistics vessel prototype by month’s end	The Army's Maneuver Support Vessel-Light. (Vigor LLC photo) WASHINGTON — After needed repairs sidelined the US Army’s new logistics ship for nearly a year, the service anticipates receiving the vessel back by month’s end before finally launching into a testing series. Designed to replace the aging Landing Craft Mechanized-8 (LCM-8), the Army tapped Vigor Works to produce the initial Maneuver Support Vessel-Light (MSV-L) prototype. But after the vessel was delivered to the service in early February 2024, it began experiencing mechanical issues en route to Camp Pendleton and was turned to the company for evaluation and repairs. 'The prototype vessel’s repairs to its cooling system were completed at the OEM’s [original equipment manufacturer’s] site in Washington state,' a Program Executive Office for Combat Support &amp; Combat Service Support spokesperson wrote in an emailed response to questions by Breaking Defense. 'Repair is complete; expect the vessel to be returned [in] January 2025,' the Army spokesperson later added. The repair check totals $200,000, the service said, and the delays testing the new vessel in open waters did not halt work on subsequent boats. Right now, the Army is moving forward with the production of a second MSV-L, while also awarding deals for the company to build three more. In the meantime, the service is working though the logistics associated with getting that first MSV-L prototype into the US Indo-Pacific theater by the April-June timeframe to resume experimentation and follow-on test activities. And while the service didn’t expand on what that may include, last year a two-star general leading the 8th Theater Sustainment Command provided some insights. 'Everything that we can knock off that list we will do in the archipelago … because that allows us to do the tests in the environment that the vessel will operate in ultimately,' Helwig added. 'It’s a great opportunity to really kind of get the vessel, then see it in the environment that, ultimately, it’ll operate in.' While the Trump administration could potentially shake up foreign policy and national security priorities, for now preparing for a military contingency against China in the Indo-Pacific remains a chief focus. For the Army, that means looking for ways to sustain the force in the Indo-Pacific theater and making sure its fleet of existing vessels, the new MSV-L, unmanned vessels, and a possible MSV-Heavy are all ready to go. Part of that work centers on finding new avenues to maintain and repair vessels abroad, and the service put this to the test as its contribution to the Pentagon’s recent Regional Sustainment Framework initiative. Rolled out in mid-2024, the Pentagon plan called on the service to first focus on the Indo-Pacific region and finding ways to sustain equipment abroad. Steven Morani, the acting assistant secretary of defense for sustainment, told reporters on Jan. 17 that services are conducting pilot programs, or 'pathfinders,' to help the department work through some of the contractual relationship questions. 'What we try to do is look at those workloads that were already established starting with the systems that the services are operating regionally already,' he explained. 'We also looked at programs where you had foreign military sales of equipment and you had arrangements in the theater where companies, both US and allied, are doing that repair and expanding that. We’re working through some of the data rights issues for systems.' For the Army’s 'pathfinder' in the Indo-Pacific region, its Logistics Support Vessel-3 — the USAV General Brehon B. Somervell — underwent repairs in South Korea late last month instead of returning stateside, Lt. Gen. Heidi Hoyle, the Army’s deputy chief of staff for logistics (G-4), explained in early January. That move, the three-star general explained, saved the crew from traveling 9,000 nautical miles over 38 sailing days just to get back to the US West Coast. 'We did this operation in Korea, it was five days, we have now proven that we can work with our partners and allies for ships to conduct maintenance forward in the battle space,' Hoyal added. Maj. Gen. Michael Lalor, the commander of the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, worked on the contract piece of that work and said the Army is now 'actively renegotiating that and expanding' similar deals in the region and around the globe.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-anticipates-return-of-repaired-logistics-vessel-prototype-by-months-end/	2025-01-29T11:01:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/MSV1-scaled-e1677702737147.jpg
Blockchain, big data and genAI: US Army uses novel tech to track billions in Ukraine aid	An airmen double-checks a shipment of aid bound for Ukraine in 2022 (U.S. Air Force photo by Staff Sgt. Marco A. Gomez) WASHINGTON – With foreign policy in flux, new Army contracts in question, and humanitarian aid frozen, including to Ukraine, there’s never been more pressure on the Pentagon to prove that military aid to Kyiv — almost $70 billion to date — is being managed efficiently and accountably. The lion’s share of that burden falls on Army Materiel Command which oversees everything from arsenals building cannon barrels, to warehouses of equipment being transferred under Presidential Drawdown Authority, to an international distribution network spanning private companies, NATO allies, and frontline Ukrainian brigades. American logisticians are rightly famous for their ability to move 'iron mountains' of equipment around the world. But their proficiency at keeping track of it is patchy, as the Pentagon's own Inspector General has pointed out in several recent audits of aid to Ukraine. So making sure the iron mountains arrive in good condition at the right place and time requires managing a mountain of paperwork. Nowadays, most of that data is virtual — but hardly all. 'Inside of the Army, I would say near 100 percent of that data is automated,' said Chris Hill, AMC’s chief data and analytic officer. That is, he told Breaking Defense in an interview, the information is automatically, digitally transmitted from database to database without needing a human to laboriously re-key it. But everybody else’s data? Not so much. Kyiv’s post-Soviet institutions are still struggling to implement modern business process automation services such as SAP, said Lt. Col. Colby Smithmeyer, a senior AMC analyst. So, he told Breaking Defense, 'data we’re getting from the Ukrainians, it could be coming from a phone call from a liaison officer, it could be an Excel spreadsheet in digits, or it could be a printed-out Excel spreadsheet.' Standard Defense Department data systems were never built to tame such a mad menagerie of different sources. So soldiers and civilians across AMC have innovated, improvised, and on occasion outright kludged together a digital toolkit including big-data analytics, generative artificial intelligence, and, in their most recent experiment, blockchain. 'It’s pretty important we maintain visibility, accountability, and auditability of those specific pieces of equipment,' said Pat Sullivan, a civilian Highly Qualified Expert at the command, in an interview with Breaking Defense. 'We have to maintain that full end to end [visibility] in a contested environment, [so] we can see it and trace it and track it all the way through.' RELATED: Telemaintenance and stockpiles: Army Materiel Command takes its own lessons from Ukraine Any given combat vehicle, box of ammunition, or pallet of supplies may begin its journey in one of AMC’s own arsenals, another government agency’s warehouse, or a contractor’s factory, officials explained in interviews. Then the aid has to be handed off to the military transport units and/or private shipping companies that physically move it overseas, overseen first by US Transportation Command, which handles inter-theater movements, and then by US Army Europe and Africa, a four-star theater command. Only then does it reach the Ukrainians. As a shipment moves through the system step by step, each of those actors needs to be able to see what’s coming to them next. Then, once they receive it, they need to update everyone else that it’s arrived intact and in the proper hands, plus when and how they’ll send it on. So AMC needs a system where all the authorized actors — but no one else — can read and modify the data relevant to them — but not anything else. To track all these transactions securely, AMC is testing a technology best known for cryptocurrency: blockchain. Like crypto, after all, information on military aid needs to be accessed securely by authorized users around the world who don’t share a single, centralized database (and who may not entirely trust each other). 'It proves traceability by creating an immutable record of transactions that allows DoD to track these assets,' said Maj. Matthew Goyette, who led a blockchain pilot exercise. 'It does away with all of the manual processes, the Excel sheets, the PowerPoints, the calls, the emails. The data is cryptographically hashed into that ‘block’…for select parties to see at the exact level you want them to see it at.' Officials declined to say when the pilot began and how long it lasted, but they did say AMC tapped expertise on blockchain from a host of partners in and out of government: Defense Logistics Agency, Air Force Research Lab, public-private digital manufacturing hub MXD, and contractor SIMBA. But they couldn’t just copy-and-paste existing commercial solutions, which notoriously consume a lot of processing power and electricity, Sullivan and Goyette emphasized. Instead, they built a slimmed-down blockchain that only stored encrypted keys to the logistics tracking data, rather than putting all the files in the blockchain itself. What’s next? 'We’ve proven out the initial pilot and we’re determining with leadership how we scale [up],' Sullivan said. The technology’s future at AMC will depend on finding funding, he acknowledged. But he’s optimistic because the command has been investing resources and high-level attention into a lot of digital projects, of which blockchain is just the latest one. Much of that investment has been driven by the demands of suppling Ukraine. With its vast logistical responsibilities, Army Materiel Command has been keenly interested in better data management for years. But 'once the Russians invaded [Ukraine], it really lit a fire under this,' Hill said. 'We went over there with algorithms that were not really ‘AI.’ I would call them ‘advanced analytics,’' he told Breaking Defense. 'We decided we’ve got to bring more AI in this, [and] about a year ago, we started really getting into the generative space.' While chatbots are infamous for 'hallucinating' made-up information, intensive study reassured the Pentagon that GenAI can be constrained to cite only authoritative government data, instead of random Reddit posts about putting glue on pizza. Once suitably tamed, Large Language Models show a remarkable ability to digest and organize what’s called 'unstructured' data: information that’s interspersed through a passage of ordinary English text, rather than carefully categorized and labeled in a 'structured' database. This capability comes in especially handy for AMC, because the Presidential Drawdown Authority orders specifying what aid to give Ukraine are, in fact, unstructured. Instead of sending out precisely formatted files that load seamlessly into military logistics databases, the White House issues PDFs. At first, Army personnel simply had to sit down, read through every order line by line, and hand-type all the relevant information into the proper fields in AMC databases, explained Lt. Col. Joseph Lavalle-Rivera. But manual data entry is notoriously labor-intensive, slow, and prone to error, and the drawdown orders were just too big, and the schedule too tight, to do it all by hand. Even in early orders, Lavalle-Rivera said, 'you would have 200 items with 12 to 15 different fields associated with each.' That’s easily over 2,500 individual entries per drawdown order — and they just kept growing. Next AMC tried to automate the data entry by writing traditional, non-AI code to search the drawdown orders, extract the data, and upload it. This worked better but only briefly, because traditional IF-THEN-ELSE software struggled to parse even minor formatting changes from one PDF to the next. 'The format constantly changes, and every time they change the format, add a new piece of data, or whatever... it immediately breaks [the code],' Lavalle-Rivera told Breaking Defense. 'Even changes of an additional tab, extra lines, can throw things like that off.' So rather than constantly hand-write and rewrite code to parse the PDFs, AMC turned to GenAI. At first that didn’t work well either. On the upside, the LLM didn't 'hallucinate' and add made-up data, because it was restricted to answering based on what was actually in the official documents. On the downside, it often omitted data that was actually there, because the algorithm initially interpreted items marked 'classified' as things it wasn't allowed to tell its user about. It took Lavalle-Rivera 'about a week of messing with it' before the LLM would give a full and accurate answer, he said. 'A lot of that comes down to the prompt engineering. &#8230; There’s more of an art to it than you’d think.' Once the LLM was tamed, and its outputs double-checked, it has provided an efficient way to turn unstructured Presidential Drawdown Authority PDFs into structured data that’s digestible by Army Materiel Command’s big-data system. That system is a variant of the Army-wide Vantage platform, but modified to allow easier input of non-US data from partners like Ukraine. The command calls it APAS, the AMC Predictive Analytics Suite — 'predictive' because it not only tracks the flow of arms and supplies but tries to forecast what Ukraine (or US units) will need next. 'If you need ammunition and you’re in eastern Ukraine and you have to go through the process of requesting that, getting a Presidential Directive, having that get funded, acquiring the ammo, shipping it, etting it there — that’s quite a long timeline,' Hill told Breaking Defense. '[Hence] the importance of predictive analytics: I’ve got to know when I’ve got a problem a couple of months out so I can work that now.' The US Army is learning a lot about the challenging logistics of modern war as it supports Ukraine, added Smithmeyer. Starting out, he said, 'we didn’t have a good idea for a lot of these consumption [rates] because we didn’t have a good baseline.' Take the rate at which M777 howitzers wore out their gun barrels, he offered by way of example. 'The rate at they were firing was unlike anything we have seen certainly in Iraq and Afghanistan.' Ukraine is pouring ever greater quantities of real-world battle data into Army Materiel Command’s analytics, Smithmeyer said. 'Now we’re tracking the maintenance status of the [Ukrainian brigades in theater, we’re tacking the consumption of supplies in theater,' he told Breaking Defense. '[That] is building a lot of data sets that now we can use…As we collect more and more data, we’re able to get better and better predictions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/blockchain-big-data-and-genai-us-army-uses-novel-tech-to-track-billions-in-ukraine-aid/	2025-01-29T09:27:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Hi-res-220320-F-QD007-0103C-scaled-e1738164097982.jpeg
F-35A crashes in Alaska, pilot ejects safely	Two F-35A Lightning II aircraft fly over the Alaska Range en route to their new home at the 354th Fighter Wing, Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska, April 21, 2020. (US Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Adam Keele) WASHINGTON — A US Air Force F-35A crashed at Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska Tuesday afternoon, according to a statement from the base. The jet’s pilot ejected safely and was taken to Bassett Army Hospital for evaluation but was deemed to be in stable condition. The crash occurred at 12:49 p.m. local time near the base’s air field and within its fenceline. Video circulating on social media showed the jet tumbling in free fall with its landing gear down just before impact, as what is presumably the aircraft’s pilot floated toward the ground with a parachute deployed. The stealth fighter exploded on impact and is likely a total loss. Emphasizing that it’s 'premature to speculate' about what led to the crash, Air Force Col. Paul Townsend, commander of the 354th Fighter Wing at Eielson, told reporters that 'the pilot was executing standard procedures and executing their respective mission, and essentially experienced an in-flight malfunction' before declaring an emergency and safely ejecting. The aircraft was in a 'landing phase' after conducting a 'local training event,' Townsend said. Eielson is located in the interior of Alaska, about two dozen miles southeast of the city of Fairbanks. The 354th Fighter Wing is 'the northernmost fighter wing in the world,' according to the wing’s website. The first F-35s were delivered to the base in 2020. Russ Goemaere, a spokesman for the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO), said in a statement to Breaking Defense that 'The JPO will support the Air Force in the investigation of the mishap. We are committed to ensuring the safety of our warfighters.' F-35 manufacturer Lockheed Martin said in a statement that the company is 'aware of the F-35 incident at Eielson Air Force Base. Safety is our priority, and we are standing by to support the United States Air Force as needed.' The Eielson F-35 crash is the second for the stealth jet in a year. A short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B developmental test jet previously crashed into a hillside in Albuquerque, New Mexico, in May 2024, adding strain to the program’s limited test fleet. The pilot involved in that mishap safely ejected as well. A full investigation will be carried out into the crash, and results could take months, if not longer, to become public. 'We are confident in the capability of that platform as the US’s premier fifth-generation fighter,' Townsend said of the F-35, stressing that the crash investigation will 'uncover' any contributing factors to the incident. 'But right now, I can stand and say that I have full faith in the capabilities of the F-35A.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/f-35a-crashes-in-alaska-pilot-ejects-safely/	2025-01-29T07:49:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/eielson-f-35-scaled-e1738163481700.jpg
Military services need to ‘sync up’ Replicator software, Navy official says	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. (U.S. Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WEST 2025 — As the Pentagon approaches its two-year deadline to get thousands of autonomous systems operational as part of the Replicator initiative, two Navy officials recently urged the services and the Pentagon to do more to coordinate their efforts, especially when it comes to software used on the systems. 'We do need to sync up on some of these solutions, right? Whether it's autonomous software, C2 [command and control] software, fight from the [Maritime Operations Center] MOC collaborative, heterogeneous software, we do need to do that,' Director of the Integrated Warfare (N9I) office, Rear Adm. Christopher Sweeney, said on a panel at AFCEA West on Tuesday. 'I can't have every fleet commander buying their software or their robot. I mean, some of that can happen, obviously, but we do have to settle up,' he later added. Commander of Naval Information Warfare Systems Command, Rear Adm. Elizabeth Okano, said on the same panel that to implement such an 'enterprise level' strategy, not only do Navy fleet commanders have to work together, but the services as a whole must do so too to truly make Replicator a multi-domain operation. Right now, that's not happening as much as it should, she said. 'We're not organized correctly,' she said. 'We're not incentivized to work collaboratively together.' She explained that certain program managers are rewarded on cost schedule performance, not 'on connecting the dots and saying, ‘Hey, you know what? This information is really good, and not only is this information good, but I'm going to figure out a way to unlock my information and give it to them [the other services] in a way that's meaningful for somebody else.' Chris Brose, chief strategic officer at defense firm Anduril, added that the wider government should be more 'assertive' in tracking the software capabilities involved in Replicator. To do so, Brose envisioned something like 'government reference architecture' that serves as a database that keeps track of all the various software the Pentagon is buying and how it will all work together. 'This needs to be something where the government is actually a bit more assertive on some critical things that will set those conditions, from a software perspective, how all of these capability comes together, sort of across that entire mission element, from automatic target recognition to mission level autonomy to the algorithms underlying it, to the different behaviors,' he said. 'All of those different things I believe need to be governed by something like a government reference architecture. Something where the government can have confidence in how these pieces are coming together.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/military-services-need-to-sync-up-replicator-software-navy-official-says/	2025-01-29T06:45:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/5356116-scaled-e1738101657589.jpg
Iran’s ‘Gaza’ drone makes military exercise debut	A model of Iran's Gaza UAV at DIMDEX in Qatar in March 2024. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) over the weekend offered a fresh look at what appeared to be an operational long-range drone dubbed 'Gaza' as it took part in a military exercise there. Iranian news reports said the unmanned aerial vehicle, whose bodyframe resembles the American-made Predator or Reaper drone, weighs over three tons and has a wingspan of 22 meters (72 feet). (For comparison the American MQ-9 Reaper UAV has a 66-foot wingspan.) The Gaza is claimed to have a range of 1,000 kilometers (621 miles) and can carry a payload up to 500 kilograms (1,102 pounds) — which could purportedly include 13 missiles. Samuel Bendett, an AI and unmanned systems expert at US-based CNA research organization, said those stats should be viewed with skepticism, at least for now. 'Any capability that is advertised has to ultimately be proven — so it remains to be seen if this particular drone can actually deliver on this capability,' Bendett told Breaking Defense. The Gaza, which was in development long before the most recent conflict in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, was on display at Qatar's DIMDEX show in March 2024. At the time, representatives at Iran’s stand told Breaking Defense that the Gaza is a medium-altitude, low-endurance (MALE) UAV, equipped with satellite communication capabilities and has a maximum flight altitude of 35,000 feet. An airborne synthetic aperture radar meant to detect surface and underwater targets can also be equipped on the platform, they said. If the drone is as capable as adverstized, analyst Ryan Bohl said he could see it having a 'greater tactical impact on Iran's near abroad in places like Iraq, Pakistan and Afghanistan' as opposed to presenting a real threat to Iran's regional enemy, Israel, 'which has a sophisticated air defense network and the ability to shoot down slower moving drones like this which have to travel a great distance.' That said, Bohl, senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the RANE network, told Breaking Defense that if the drones were utilized 'against the Israelis or against the United States and Gulf Arab partners in the case of an all-out regional war, they would be a notable angle to conduct near abroad strikes on US forces in Iraq, Syria or the gulf.' Bohl said the drones could also see some success in the export market, whether to smaller aligned groups like the Houthis in Yemen, or to the Russian military, which the US says has used other, smaller Iranian drones throughout the conflict in Ukraine.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/irans-gaza-drone-makes-military-exercise-debut/	2025-01-29T04:06:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/429765236_724472513004242_5343046013244468278_n-e1709577273996.jpg
MQ-25 will fly in 2025, fly off carriers in 2026, says Navy’s air boss	A Boeing unmanned MQ-25 aircraft rests aboard the flight deck aboard the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77). (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Brandon Roberson) WEST 2025 — The US Navy’s top operational aviator says he’s confident the service will have its new unmanned aerial tanker flying this year and operating off aircraft carriers in 2026, characterizing it as a key point in paving the way for future next generation aircraft. 'We will fly MQ-25 in 25. You can quote me on that. We will fly that platform in 25 and get that thing on a carrier in 26 and start integrating [it],' Vice Adm. Daniel Cheever, commander of Naval Air Forces, told an audience here at West in San Diego. 'That unlocks the future of manned-unmanned teaming.' 'We’re going after that thing in a big way so we can do manned-unmanned teaming off an aircraft carrier and that is a different world. It opens up the future of sixth-gen collaborative combat aircraft and everything that comes after it,' he continued. The MQ-25, also dubbed Stingray, is an unmanned tanker designed to refuel the strike fighter fleet while performing a secondary intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance mission. Its fielding is also expected to relieve pressure on the service’s F/A-18s which have had to act as aerial refuelers in the meantime, taking them away from strike missions. Boeing won the initial contract in 2018 to design and produce the aircraft, a bid that was strengthened by previous prototypes on the ultimately abandoned Unmanned Carrier Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program. At that time, service officials said the aircraft would reach initial operational capability — Pentagon nomenclature effectively signifying the aircraft is ready for fielding — in 2024, but program hiccups have pushed that date into fiscal 2025. Boeing has previously conducted test flights with its prototypes, but Navy officials have targeted 2025 for its own test flights with the aircraft. Cheever, who the Navy also refers to as the 'Air Boss' because he is the most senior operational aviator, expressed confidence in the Navy’s ability to integrate MQ-25 into the air wing despite the operational challenges associated with unmanned technology and landing any aircraft onboard a carrier’s flight deck. 'I don't see a lot of issues bringing it together,' he said. 'I’m just going to turn the weapons tactics instructors loose, and they will exactly figure out how to operate this thing seamlessly in a manned-unmanned teaming [environment].' 'So, [I’m] pretty excited for that, because we need that capability and we need it this year to start flying,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/mq-25-will-fly-in-2025-fly-off-carriers-in-2026-says-navys-air-boss/	2025-01-28T13:58:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/mq-25-12.20.21-2-scaled-e1738099987404.jpg
Space Force plans 18 NSSL launches in 2025, including on ULA’s Vulcan	U.S. Space Force Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, Space Launch Delta 45 commander, and Assured Access to Space program executive officer, takes a tour of Vandenberg Space Force Base, Calif., Oct. 31, 2023. (U.S. Space Force photo by Senior Airman Tiarra Sibley) SPACE MOBILITY 2025 — The US Space Force is planning 18 launches under its current National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 program in 2025, along with four small launches carrying payloads under 400 pounds, according to Brig. Gen. Kristin Panzenhagen, the program executive officer for assured access to space. That includes, she told to the third annual Space Mobility Conference in Orlando, Fla., missions to be conducted by United Launch Alliance's Vulcan heavy lifter — despite the fact that the Space Force has yet to certify the rocket to carry NSSL payloads following a problem during its second qualifying launch in October. Speaking to reporters afterwards, Panzenhagen said that of those 18 planned launches, 11 were slated for Vulcan and seven for SpaceX's Falcon 9. Col. Jim Horne, senior material leader for launch execution systems whose shop is overseeing ULA's certification process, said during the media briefing that the Space Force is 'still working through' the problem that caused a nozzle on one of the solid rocket boosters to fall off. The service is 'targeting mid-February' for being able to give the all clear to Vulcan, 'depending on how some of the anomaly investigation activities go.' Panzenhagen further noted that the service is planning to begin launches under the next phase of the NSSL program, called Phase 3, in 2025. Those would be under Phase 3 Lane 1, which covers launches to easier to reach orbits, payloads with less mass, and missions that are not absolute must-gos. Lane 1 launch providers also face fewer 'certification requirements,' she said, including only having to complete one successful launch meeting Space Force requirements. For example, while she said that all the data has yet to be collected and analyzed, Blue Origin's New Glenn rocket is expected to become Phase 3 Lane 1 certified. New Glenn made its maiden launch on Jan. 16. 'The early indications are that the payload got to where it needed to be. So, as we're going through the data, something still could be flagged where we would say, &#8216;Wait, this doesn't fully count. But the early indications are that it does look like for our purposes it was a successful launch,' Panzenhagen elaborated. Panzenhagen said that the 'launch cadence' at both the service's Eastern Range at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida and the Western Range at Vandenberg SFB in California will be higher in 2025 than in 2024. 'I would expect 2026 is going to be higher as well. We've been going up pretty steadily in about a 25-to- 30 percent increase per year, and I think we'll continue to increase at that rate, or at least the next couple years,' she said. This 'ops tempo' is worrying for the Space Force, Panzenhagen said, because of personnel shortfalls. At the moment, she explained, the number of billets being funded is based on the launch rates for 2017. 'We've implemented automation, we've re-looked at processes and streamlined a lot of things, but it does continue to be a stressing ops tempo when it comes to manpower,' she said. Panzenhagen said her focus going forward is 'resiliency' across her portfolio, which includes launch vehicles, range infrastructure and capacity, and base security. 'I want resiliency in the different types of launch vehicles that we have, so, if you have a fleet running anomaly, you have other launch vehicles that you can look to other families and launch vehicles. I want resiliency across companies so, God forbid, if a company has a strike or a serious financial issue that would prevent them from continuing operations, I have other options. Resiliency across supply chains, because if something happens in another sector, we want to make sure that they continue to launch,' she said. The Space Force also is working to increase the number of launches at both ranges by speeding payload processing, Panzenhagen explained. 'One bottleneck is payload processing facility. So, we are very fortunate to get a congressional add in 2024 that will go towards expanding payload processing capacity on the Western Range. We are hopeful to get an add in 2025 to do something similar in the Eastern Range. We're using an innovative acquisition strategy called the commercial solutions opening to be able to quickly obligate those funds and get that capability realized,' she said. Likewise, Panzenhagen noted, the service has been working to improve base security, including beefing up cybersecurity. 'We're really investing in defense at the two space ports — whether it's physical security, cybersecurity, just across the board — and we're exercising all these things too to make sure that you know when the bad day comes we know how to react and we know how to react quickly, and, ideally, we know how to mitigate,' she said. In the end, Panzenhagen said, it all comes down to ensuring that the warfighters can do their job of deterring adversary aggression. 'I see our ability to deter based on the launch capacity we have, our readiness, our resiliency, because ultimately, we have a deterrent effect when the adversary knows that,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/space-force-plans-18-nssl-launches-in-2025-including-on-ulas-vulcan/	2025-01-28T13:21:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/231101-F-GJ070-1007-scaled-e1738086977356.jpg
Air Force moves forward with next-gen engine work, raises GE, Pratt contracts to $3.5 billion each	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) WASHINGTON — The US Air Force is moving ahead with development of a next-gen fighter engine following awards to manufacturers GE Aerospace and RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney, according to contracts announced by the service Monday evening. The awards, issued under the service’s Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, raise the total potential value of contracts previously issued to both companies from $975 million to a new ceiling of $3.5 billion each. No funds are being issued at the time of the announcement, the contract notice says, and work is planned to wrap up in July 2032. The NGAP program is expected to produce the engine that will power the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, though the effort to field the sixth-gen jet is currently paused pending a decision on the way forward by the Trump administration. GE and Pratt are expected to fabricate full-up engine prototypes as part of the NGAP competition, where current plans call for eventually eliminating one of the vendors from the running. A representative for GE did not respond to a request for comment by press time. A Pratt spokesperson told Breaking Defense today that the company 'is working closely with the U.S. Air Force to execute on and meet NGAP program commitments. Our program remains on track for major milestones and we look forward to delivering for our customer.' According to fiscal 2025 budget documents released last year [PDF], the Air Force plans to spend about $1.3 billion through FY27 to complete development of the NGAP engine, with following work likely aimed at further assessments and readying the engine for production. The program draws from efforts by both companies under the Air Force’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program (AETP), which developed prototype engines for the F-35. The Air Force axed the AETP program in 2023. By delivering better performance for features like thrust and fuel efficiency, the 'adaptive' engine technologies underlying both the NGAP and AETP efforts could herald a revolutionary leap in propulsion, officials have said. It’s not clear exactly where the two companies are in the development process. During an earnings call in October, GE CEO Larry Culp said the company was 'nearing completion of the detailed design' for the firm’s NGAP offering, known as the XA102. And in February 2024, Pratt announced that its NGAP offering, dubbed the XA103, completed a 'critical assessment' that 'move[s] the program closer to completing its detailed design review.' The FY25 budget documents say that detailed design will be followed by 'engine fabrication,' meaning both vendors could soon fashion their physical engine prototypes. The exquisite NGAP powerplant has been identified by former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as a potential source of cost savings for the NGAD fighter, whose projected price of several hundred million dollars per copy could prove prohibitive. Among other changes that could be made to the fighter, reducing the complexity of its engine could be one option to make the aircraft more affordable, Kendall said. Internal Air Force analysis recently validated the requirement for a manned, sixth-gen fighter, Breaking Defense previously reported. And remaining budget concerns could be ameliorated by a potential surge in defense spending championed by top Republicans on Capitol Hill. The NGAP contracts were issued amid what could be a total freeze on awards by the Army. As of Tuesday morning, an Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the service’s contract awards are continuing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/air-force-moves-forward-with-next-gen-engine-work-raises-ge-pratt-contracts-to-3-5-billion-each/	2025-01-28T12:47:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-R1-scaled-e1718985449640.jpg
Super Puma resurgence provides updraft for Airbus Helicopters annual order growth	Airbus Helicopters is under contract to manufacture 12 newly configured H225M Caracal helicopters for Dutch Special Forces (Airbus Helicopters) BELFAST — A much-needed spike in demand for Super Puma heavy-lift helicopters helped Airbus Helicopters deliver strong annual results in 2024, with the company’s product line recording gross orders, overall, of 455 rotorcraft across the year — a 10 percent increase compared to 2023. The Super Puma family (comprising civil and military H215/M and H225/M variants) recorded a total of 58 orders, a welcome uptick after a difficult 2023 where Airbus failed to secure a single order for the line. At a military level, 2024 orders for the Super Puma included The Netherlands and Romania. Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even told reporters during an annual results call on Monday, 'It's really a strong performance [from the Super Puma], confirming that this helicopter is really well positioned and meeting well the demand of our customers.' He added, 'We are committed to the product, and I'm optimistic that we'll be able to continue this positive trend in the year to come.' Even also said that a contract with Iraq for a dozen H225M helicopters is now 'in force.' 'I see a good momentum in the [Middle East] region for the years to come,' he said, referring to potential new business not just for the H225M program, but also H145M light-twin and NH90 multirole helicopters. A standout performer in terms of 2023 business, drawing 186 orders, the H145M saw demand marginally drop off to 114 aircraft last year. At the other end of the spectrum, the embattled NH90 multirole helicopter did not receive any orders in 2024, with the H160 medium utility type gaining only four. Even said he was not 'at all disappointed' by the H160 low order total because the company is 'committed to the market for the long term' and stressed that aircraft performance has so far exceeded customer expectation. The military version of the H160 has a long future ahead, as it is under development to support France’s Light Joint Helicopter program, comprising of 169 aircraft. On a lack of orders for the NH90, he similarly said that assessment of the multirole rotorcraft is based on a 'long-term' market view and that priorities for the program include improving fleet availability rates, reducing maintenance workload issues and preparing for a production ramp up. The NH90 has been troubled by delivery delays, poor availability rates and contract cancellations, with an Oslo court, for example, set to begin proceedings, this year, relating to Norway's decision to terminate a contract for 14 aircraft. On a more positive note for helo-maker NHIndustries, in June 2024, the company announced the launch of the NH90 Block 1/Software Release 3 upgrade, backed by Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, and Italy which covers integration of the new Link 22 datalink, Leonardo’s LEOSS-T Electro-Optical gimbal, sonar equipment and 'additional weapons integration,' according to the manufacturer. 'Im really optimistic about the future of this helicopter,' added Even. His perspective chimes with Axel Aloccio, NHIndustries CEO, who drew on similar plans last year and said that 'commercial opportunities' amounting to sales in the region of '50 to 100' aircraft, are in play. Broadly speaking, Even shared that the military helicopter market remains 'stable,' adding, 'we all know the geopolitical context and the decision of many countries to increase defense budgets.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/super-puma-resurgence-provides-updraft-for-airbus-helicopters-annual-order-growth/	2025-01-28T11:39:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/unnamed-4-scaled.jpg
Denmark strengthens Arctic defense with $2B package for naval vessels, drones	HDMS Triton from the Royal Danish Navy's Thetis-class frigate fleet, patrols the waters of Greenland (NATO) BELFAST — Under a new Arctic and North Atlantic security agreement, Denmark says it will spend 14.6 billion kroner ($2.04 billion) to bolster defense in the region, based on the acquisition of new naval vessels, long-range drones and improved space capabilities. The pact was struck in 'close collaboration' with Greenland and the Faroe Islands, Denmark’s autonomous territories, according to a Danish Ministry of Defence statement. 'We must face the fact that there are serious challenges regarding security and defence in the Arctic and North Atlantic,' said Denmark’s Minister of Defence Troels Lund Poulsen in the statement. 'For this reason, we must strengthen our presence in the region. That is the objective of this agreement, which paves the way for further initiatives already this year.' Copenhagen said the spending pledge covers the purchase of three Arctic naval vessels capable of carrying helicopters and drones; two long-range drones with the 'ability to conduct surveillance over large areas at great distances;' and increased situational awareness through additional satellite 'capacity.' A fleet of four Danish patrol vessels currently protect the waters of Greenland year round, operating under the country's Joint Arctic Command based in Nuuk, according to NATO. A second Arctic and North Atlantic security agreement is also set to be finalized in the 'first half' of 2025. Copenhagen did not disclose any equipment details related to the forthcoming agreement, but said it will focus on 'strengthening deterrence and defence in the region.' The renewed effort to beef up Arctic capabilities follows a flurry of comments from US President Donald Trump threatening to buy Greenland and increase tariffs on Danish goods. Trump also said that he could not rule out taking the territory or the Panama Canal by force. Earlier this month, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pushed back on the military force takeover idea, telling local broadcaster TV 2 'I don’t have the imagination to imagine us getting there.' Frederiksen met with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte today, but amid the growing tension between the US and Denmark, the alliance took the unusual step of advising press ahead of the meeting that there will be 'no media opportunity.' Frederiksen also met today with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin and French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. Previewing the 'whirlwind day of international diplomacy', Politico said it was an attempt, on Frederiksen's part, to prevent Trump's push for Greenland. Such efforts follow on from Poulsen announcing in December a separate $1.5 billion Greenland defense spending package covering two inspection ships, two long-range drones and two additional dogsled teams. Greenland, the world’s largest island, declared self-rule after a referendum in 2009 but defense and foreign policy remain under the control of Denmark. Situated between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans, the US holds a strategic interest in the island, and as rising temperatures cool Greenland's glaciers, new shipping lanes are expected to open, likely leading to increased military competition. Existing Russian capabilities across the Arctic already threaten freedom of navigation for Washington and NATO allies. The US also operates the Pituffik Space Base from Greenland. According to a US Space Force factsheet, the base is the DoD’s 'northernmost installation' and is responsible for missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance missions. It also notes those operations depend on 'the solid-state phased-array radar operated by the 12th Space Warning Squadron (12 SWS) and Satellite Command and Control through the Pituffik Tracking Station operated by the 23rd Space Operations Squadron, Detachment 1.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/denmark-strengthens-arctic-defense-with-2b-package-for-naval-vessels-drones/	2025-01-28T11:14:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/231130-patrolling-greenland-1-e1738070582646.jpg
A shipbuilding action plan for the Trump administration	USS Pierre (LCS-38) at Austal USA's shipyard in Mobile, Ala., as it prepares for launching into the water. (Photo courtesy of Austal USA) As the Trump administration’s national security team takes office, shipbuilding will clearly be a top priority for the Pentagon, the National Security Council, and even the president himself. The reason for this focus is simple. China is leveraging its booming commercial shipbuilding industry to expand its military capabilities, whereas shipbuilding in the United States is virtually a monopsony, with the US Navy being the near-exclusive customer. While our warships have quality that our competitors simply cannot match, it will be increasingly difficult to dominate the seas if we lack the quantity of ships that are needed. There are immediate opportunities for the incoming administration and Congress to move the needle on shipbuilding. Use the tools at hand. Any plan to improve shipbuilding must begin with a bottom-up review of the root causes of the differing challenges within each program. This need not be an extensive reform of major acquisition authorities, which could take years to design and implement. Instead, the focus should be assessing what can be done under current contractual and statutory authorities to address the problems specific to each program or each shipyard — whether that pertains to people, facilities, supply chain, process, or something else. While working on that review, the upcoming budget should prove shipbuilding is a top priority. The Biden administration and Congress unleashed billions of dollars of investment in the submarine and broader shipbuilding industrial base, attacking fragility in the supply chain, difficulties in workforce recruiting, and opportunities with advanced manufacturing. But more needs to be done, including raising wages for shipyard workers to compete with other employers, and investing in modernized shipyard infrastructure. Most importantly, this process of thinking about how to use authorities at hand and making changes must begin immediately, in order to justify a larger shipbuilding budget. Friends can help. The strengths of American naval technology are being challenged by China’s hyperscaling of shipbuilding capacity. While the US barely registers in the world market as a commercial shipbuilder, the good news is that our allies — particularly South Korea and Japan — make up the balance of the world’s shipbuilding capacity not currently serviced by China. Our Navy is significantly short of the number of logistics vessels that it needs for worldwide operations, to say nothing of what would be required during a conflict. Leveraging our allies’ commercial shipbuilding capabilities is a clear opportunity, but how to do so is less straightforward. President Donald Trump himself seems on board with this idea. In an early January interview, Trump said, 'We used to build a ship a day. We don’t build ships anymore. We want to get that started. And maybe we’ll use allies, also, in terms of building ships. We might have to.' The president will certainly demand that a plan to capitalize on US and allied shipbuilding capabilities will be a win for America, which will mean wins for key stakeholders: the Navy, shipbuilders, shipyard workers, and suppliers. Helping them all come out ahead is a challenge, but it is also an opportunity for the incoming administration to convene partners in industry, labor, Congress, and the Navy to hammer out a plan this year. Get real about how much ships cost. Each year, the president’s budget tells Congress that a certain number of ships can be bought for a precise amount of money. The point has been reached where those numbers are wrong more often than they are right. We must restore realism in budgeting for ship procurement. And it’s not as if this is an impossible thing to figure out: Analysts outside the Navy, particularly the Congressional Budget Office, are right far more often than they are wrong. For years, ships have been budgeted at a lower costs than they can be produced. This means the Navy is asking Congress each year for additional funds to complete ships already under construction. Congress has lost its patience for these follow-on costs, and this practice must end. A renewed emphasis on budgeting to independent cost estimates, rather than rosy scenarios, could produce sticker shock. But it is preferable to the current trap of not reliably fulfilling promises to buy each ship at a transparent price. Get the right people in the right seats. While not a sexy, high-level job, there is no position more important to shipbuilding reform than the Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development, and Acquisition. This official will be responsible for building and executing the plan to reform shipbuilding, and there is no alternative to having a Senate-confirmed official in the seat as soon as possible. The president should nominate, and the Senate should confirm, a fully qualified candidate by this summer. It’s not just the Navy. It’s America. Finally, and most ambitiously, the administration and Congress must look beyond the Navy as the source of, and solution to, our nation’s eroding maritime industrial strength. The shipbuilding industrial base is a subset of the defense industrial base, and the defense industrial base is a subset of the American industrial base. Creating policies for the Department of Defense to help shipbuilders is good; whole-of-government efforts to invigorate manufacturing are better. All levers of government power must be put on the table to maximize the impact of the renewed focus on shipbuilding. That includes renewed focus on national workforce training programs — not just those at the waterfront — and examining how grants and tax credits can incentivize industry investing in its own renewal. Addressing the shortfalls in America’s maritime industrial base is not the only action that needs to be taken to improve our military capabilities to match the challenges to our security, but the remedies are unique. Maximizing our military advantages in other domains or capabilities requires approaches focusing on accelerating technology adoption, removing red tape, or sometimes simply increasing production rates (read: more funding). But shipbuilding is different than the rest of America’s arsenal. Solutions to this problem will not be found in disruptive start-ups, an organizational change, or simply writing bigger checks and expecting a different outcome. Instead, the common thread among these recommendations is that rethinking the business of shipbuilding offers a more promising outcome for our economic, political, and military strength. But we have to start now.

Iranian official says Tehran has purchased Russian fighter jets: Reports	A Russian Su-35 flies near an American F-16 on Sept. 23, 2024 in what US officials called an unsafe manuever. (Department of Defense video) BEIRUT — In what appears to be another sign of the tightening of relations between Iran and Russia, a senior Iranian military official reportedly confirmed that Tehran has completed the purchase of Russian Sukhoi SU-35 fighter jets. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Gen. Ali Shadmani was quoted by an Iranian news outlet as highlighting the deal, according to Reuters and Russia's TASS news agency. 'Whenever necessary, we make military purchases to strengthen our air, land, and naval forces. &#8230; The production of military equipment has also accelerated,' Shahdamani said, according to Reuters, though he did not say how many jets had been purchased or for how much. He warned that 'if the enemy acts foolishly, it will taste the bitter taste of being hit by our missiles, and none of its interests in the occupied territories will remain safe,' pointing at Tehran’s regional enemy, Israel. In November 2023 Iranian officials reportedly finalized the deal with Russia. Shadmani's comments came just days after Tehran and Moscow inked a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty, to boost cooperation in many domains, including defense. Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, was circumspect about Shadmani's reported comments. 'Seeing will be believing in the case of the Su-35 and Iran. Given the number of false starts, early reports, rumors, and even misinformation about the matter, seeing the plane in Iran will be the truest indication that the deal has gone through,' Ben Taleblu told Breaking Defense. He said that such reports regarding training, payment or notes of a finalized deal 'are designed to manage expectations about the Russia-Iran relationship while politically helping Tehran bolster its battered deterrence.' But should the planes enter Iran's service, Ben Taleblu said they would significantly enhance Iranian territorial defense, particularly after the regime’s long-range air defenses, 'which were also Russian provided, were damaged or destroyed by Israeli airstrikes last year.' Iran currently operates a number of Russian warplanes including Su-24 MK and Mig-29 A and outdated US-built fighter jets including the F-4 and F-5E. The SU-35, introduced in 2014, is a singleseat 'primarily air superiority fighter, but with [a] secondary air-to-ground capability,' according to a US Army database. The purchase will make the Islamic Republic more of a hybrid warfighter in the Middle East, posing 'an additional layer of challenges for those seeking to land an uncontested blow against the regime’s nuclear or military infrastructure.' Still, he said, the planes 'will not revolutionize Iran’s long-range strike capabilities overnight given the regime’s emphasis on unmanned systems and the time needed to train Air Force personnel.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/iranian-official-says-tehran-has-purchased-russian-fighter-jets-reports/	2025-01-28T09:54:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250128_DVIDS_russian_su35_8669046-scaled-e1738086120412.jpg

‘What the f— is going on?’ Confusion, uncertainty in industry as Army contracts seemingly halted	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) WASHINGTON — The defense industry is in a state bordering between confusion and panic, following what could be a pause awarding new Army contracts as the service reviews its plans under the Trump administration. The fear among industry now is that this move is just the first in what would amount to a Pentagon-wide halt on new awards, for an indefinite period of time. Word of some sort of freeze on Army contracts began circulating late Friday, and by Monday evening was moving quickly through industry, the Hill and the Pentagon — but with a lack of certainty from anyone about what, exactly, was going on. That includes inside the Army, where as of Tuesday morning different officials seemed unsure what the guidance meant. In a statement, Army spokesperson Ellen Lovett said, 'Army contracting activities continue to move forward. As is customary, the Army is currently conducting a review of existing solicitations and awards of contracts to ensure that our programs are aligned with the incoming leadership’s policies and directives. We remain committed to transparency and being responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars.' However, that clashes with information from a well-placed Army source who told Breaking Defense that the service is 'pausing and reviewing' contracting activities and outgoing solicitations. The source couldn’t say how long this may last and it wouldn’t be responsible for the service to put an 'X-day pause' in place, especially if conditions change with a new leadership team in place. (Bloomberg reported late Monday that it could last as long as several months.) 'It’s a bit of a pause and review, excluding things directly tied to readiness, modernization and people,' the Army source said this morning, noting it 'touches all aspects of the requirements and contracting process.' However, the source did not detail what sorts of programs would fall into the readiness category. The confusion seemingly stems from the way the news was circulated amongst the service and then to industry. According to multiple sources, the guidance came down in an email as opposed to a formal memo, leading to uncertainty among program managers about how and when to implement it. As of press time, it’s unclear who penned the email or to whom it was originally sent, but that hasn’t stopped word of it from ricocheting around the Army community. There is 'certainly confusion, escalating to concern,' said one industry source, one of several who spoke to Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity. 'Especially among companies who were about to get something, or been told they have something, or even been selected but now don’t know if the money will come.' Or, as a second industry source asked Breaking Defense during a Monday call, 'What the f— is going on?' According to six industry and military sources who have seen it, the email states that there is 'Direction from the Secretary of the Army's office to immediately hold' on awarding all contract or Other Transaction Awards (OTAs), all solicits and requests for information, any funding association related to grants and any Congressional notifications. 'We are working with leadership to get additional direction as to the timeframe and may come back to you for impacts to mission,' the email says, before concluding with a final note: 'If you have an action that supports the Southern Border, please report up through your chain of command and we will seek permission … to move forward.' A second Army source familiar with contracting and requirements, noted that the relationship between the Army and the defense industrial base is a vital part of enacting the President's vision for lethality across the DoD. 'As we receive updated guidance on how to orient our effort, we are proactively evaluating ways to create decision space for the administration in support of new strategic priorities,' the source told Breaking Defense. 'Receipt of new guidance is an opportune time to evaluate the effectiveness of our existing contracting effort with the DIB, and is a necessary step in ensuring our resources are fully aligned to the department’s highest priorities. 'In the context of this review, some existing contracts may be modified or cancelled and others may be increased,' the source added. 'This level of agility is vital to ensure our Army is responsive to and in full support of achieving peace through strength,' In the meantime, industry is standing by for official contracting memos to drop while also circulating one from the director of the Army Staff, Lt. Gen. Laura Potter, one source dubbed the 'DEI memo.' Dated Jan. 21, that document, a screengrab of which was viewed by Breaking Defense, notes that ongoing solutions, requests for proposals, grants and notices of funds 'may not reflect' new administration priorities. It goes on to task the Army’s acquisition office with reviewing all those contracting options, establishing an 'operational planning team' to review all solicitations and grants and make recommendations. 'Immediately identify and recommend freezing or suspending' all contracting items related to DEI, critical race theory, climate change, transgender and abortion polices, it adds. At press time, Army public affairs had not immediately confirmed the existence of that Potter memo, but one service source said it sounded like one that went out. The big question swirling now is whether this is a service-specific issue or one that is going to spread elsewhere. As of Monday evening, multiple industry sources said they had not yet seen similar language for the departments of the Air Force and Navy, and both services, unlike the Army, awarded new contracts on Monday. However, a third industry source said they’ve been told that similar direction could come down from the Navy and Air Force in the coming days, and a fourth source said that Air Force direction could come as early as today. Spokespeople for the Navy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Asked whether the service was pausing new contract awards or solicitations, an Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the service continues to award contracts. When asked about a contracting hold Monday afternoon, a Pentagon spokesperson for the Office of the Secretary of Defense said, 'unfortunately I don’t have anything for you on that' and pointed out that the standard daily DoD contacts were announced. If a larger freeze on contracting is coming, it may be part of a push by the Trump administration writ large to halt federal spending and review it. The State Department issued guidance to that extent, effectively freezing foreign assistance money with a few key exceptions, such as Foreign Military Financing for Israel and Egypt. And according to a memo viewed by Breaking Defense, the Department of Energy issued guidance hours after Trump’s inauguration that 'any announcements or awards regarding procurement opportunities and contracts are to be put on hold,' including requests for proposals, request for quotations and contact negotiations — effectively the same guidance sent down by the Army. (DOE manages the nuclear warheads stockpile and works with the Navy on nuclear reactor issues.) Industry, meanwhile, is scrambling to figure out just exactly what is going on. 'Uncertainty doesn’t benefit anyone except our adversaries,' the second industry source said. 'Industry is spending time now trying to adjust to rumors when we should be absolutely dedicated to the national security mission. 'We need to get after our adversaries. This is absolutely unhelpful.'
