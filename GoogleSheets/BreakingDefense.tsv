Not on the same wavelength: Trump inherits spectrum fight between DoD, commercial industry	USS Ramage (DDG 61), equipped with the Aegis Weapon System. (US Navy photo) WASHINGTON — When newly confirmed Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth finally sits down in his Pentagon office, a complicated but consequential problem will be among those piled on his desk: What to do about the ongoing war over the electromagnetic spectrum. For years the Defense Department and commercial providers have tussled over usage of mid-band spectrum — between 1 GhZ (gigahertz) to 6 GHz usage, which makes up the 3.1-3.45 and 3.5 GHz S-band — widely considered to be the 'Goldilocks' zone of the spectrum. The DoD long has contended that this part of the spectrum band is essential for its various satellite communications, radars and navigation systems. However, US and foreign commercial companies covet those frequencies for providing high-speed wireless service to civilian and military users alike. The issue: spectrum space cannot be used by both parties at the same, and crowding too many broadcasters into nearby frequency bands causes interference that would have a crippling effect on critical warfighting missions, current and former DoD officials tell Breaking Defense. Commercial industry, on the other hand, says the DoD’s concern is overblown. 'It is a zero sum game. There is finite spectrum, and the physics of the spectrum, about the desirability of the lower [3 GHz band] both for our target acquisition radars and for 5G, this makes it very difficult,' John Sherman, former DoD chief information officer and now dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University, said in an interview. While it may seem the Trump administration has more pressing issues to tackle in its first month, industry is expecting to get a real sense of where the new government is going on this issue with a Feb. 13 meeting of the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA). And if past statements from Trump appointees hold, the Pentagon may find itself on the back foot as it seeks to defend its spectrum turf. Here’s what you need to know about the fight over spectrum, key players and where the Trump administration may be leaning. The spectrum debate is hardly a theoretical one. The systems that rely on it are being used regularly by US forces around the world, said one defense official involved in the issue, speaking on background. The Navy’s Aegis AN/SPY radar, for instance, operates on the 3.1-3.5 GHz S-band. US ships in the Red Sea are currently 'using critical spectrum for radars to make sure drones and missiles are not striking their vessels or commercial ships. The military uses spectrum in Ukraine to thwart Russian missiles aimed at Kyiv and elsewhere. In the domestic United States, service members use the spectrum to train for overseas deployment,' the defense official told Breaking Defense in an email. That’s why, the defense official said, DoD 'must maintain spectrum access where and when needed to meet security objectives. Both international and domestic regulations regarding telecommunications and information and communication technologies (ICTs) must support this end state.' It technically would be possible for the DoD to move its signals from the 3.1-3.5 range frequencies so they can be given to commercial industry, but Sherman said that amounts to a massive undertaking that would require replacing countless US military radar systems, costing 'hundreds of billions' of dollars and creating a major security risk as the Pentagon scrambles to replace systems. Though the spectrum may be finite, there could be ways to share parts of it, or at least part of the time — an idea the Pentagon has suggested it’s not totally against. In fact, a prototype methodology for spectrum sharing was agreed way back in 2015 between NTIA and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which regulates commercial spectrum use, for sharing of the 3.55 to 3.65 GHz band, otherwise known as the Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS). The CBRS supports a wide range of wireless communications, including keyhole markup language files that are used to store and display geographic data. That agreement was modified last summer, with input from the Navy, to expand spectrum access to the civilian side for high-speed internet services. The DoD last April announced that it is undertaking a study, along with the NTIA, which coordinates federal agency spectrum use, on what is called 'advanced dynamic spectrum sharing' with wireless providers in that band. The announcement came less than a week after release of a heavily redacted Pentagon report finding that — and echoing the defense official who spoke to Breaking Defense — any sharing scheme would need to ensure DoD has first dibs on access and strictly control other usage to avoid interference with military activities. It is unclear, however, how long that study might take, and similar technical reviews in the past have taken years.

(Photo Credit: Lockheed Martin) The FCC and the NTIA are the two organizations with responsibility for setting US spectrum policy, and governing which users get access when to what bandwidths for what functions. Within NTIA, it is the Office of Spectrum Management that sets the regulations for spectrum allocations to federal agencies, as well as certifying that government equipment meets the necessary standards to comply with those regulations. In addition, there are two other interagency bodies that coordinate federal agency spectrum use. The Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee (IRAC) is made up of most of the spectrum using agencies, including each of the military departments, according to the group’s website. The IRAC, which also has a liaison function with the FCC, is chaired by NTIA and is primarily a technical body. It meets monthly. The second body is the Interagency Spectrum Advisory Council (ISAC), a top-level policy group composed of the principal members of each federal department that have an oversight control over spectrum use. It provides advice to NTIA and ensures 'that all decisions made by NTIA, including those involving representations to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), take into consideration the diverse missions of the Federal Government,' according to NTIA’s website. DoD and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence both have seats on this council; for DoD it is the chief information officer who participates. The ISAC charter calls for a minimum of four meetings per year. DoD 'does have a little bit of a priority' in these groups, because it can 'play the national security card' in decision making that then requires secret-level discussions, said one government official on background— before rushing to add that the department 'rarely' takes such action. Within the FCC, the Office of Engineering and Technology 'develops and administers Commission decisions regarding spectrum allocations' for commercial telecommunications companies whether they use satellites, ground stations, ships or airplanes as broadcast platforms, according to the commission website. None of the relevant agencies, including the National Security Council, responded on the record for this report. The trouble comes when the NTIA and the FCC disagree on spectrum usage, which has long been the case regarding DoD’s hold on mid-band spectrum. At the working level, there are cooperation practices that are designed to avoid such disagreements in the first place, the government expert said. In the event that there is 'already an existing federal allocation,' then the FCC must consult with NTIA and unofficially discuss any plans they might have for commercial use of frequencies within or nearby that spectrum band, the expert said. The NTIA most often would then put together a technical group to undertake a study to see if there are compatibility issues and determine if spectrum sharing is possible between federal and non-federal users. The FCC, in turn, shares draft proposals for new rules for commercial spectrum allocation with the NTIA for unofficial comment prior to FCC publication. Further, the NTIA, DoD, and even Pentagon agencies and military departments can comment in public once an FCC proposal is officially sent to the Federal Register. Another government official told Breaking Defense, there is a 'formal memorandum of understanding' between the NTIA and the FCC that clearly defines 'coordination procedure when it comes to domestic rule makings.' That MoU, the first government official said, is an official legal document [PDF] that specifies that the NTIA administrator and the FCC chair meet on a quarterly basis. If there are disagreements that cannot be resolved at the staff level, the idea is that these would be elevated to the principals to work out. That document was signed in September 2022, following a GAO study in 2021 that found that there was no 'clear' path for resolving high-level disputes between NTIA and the FCC and what processes existed were 'chaotic.' 'If those meetings don't resolve them, they would go up to the White House, to the Executive Office of the President,' the expert added. But even if the president wants to get involved, the nation’s leader doesn’t have control over the FCC, meaning even the president is limited in their ability to resolve any disputes. When a DoD dispute with the FCC remains unresolved after being fanned all the way up the chain of command, a last ditch effort for the NTIA is to go to court to block FCC action. The agency 'can actually sue,' the first government official said, or make filings in lawsuits by other parties. This is what has happened in the long-running Ligado case, although the experts said such action is almost never taken. 'In 24 years, [Ligado is] the only case I can recall of that happening. It's extremely rare,' a second government official said. Staff Sgt.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) With the change in administration, it is not beyond the pale that the entire effort to find a way to share the Goldilocks spectrum could be scrapped. During Donald Trump’s first administration, the FCC leaned heavily toward the camp of wireless providers in the long-running spectrum wars — for example, controversially granting telecommunications firm Ligado a license to use spectrum over the vociferous objections of DoD, NTIA and a bevy of federal agencies that doing so would imperil the accuracy of GPS signals. Trump's recently appointed FCC chair, Brendan Carr, has been supportive of the wireless broadband industry's campaign to widen its access to the spectrum. In 2020, Carr, along with the rest of the FCC, voted to support Ligado’s application, and he was a vocal supporter of opening up spectrum for economic benefits. Further, the composition of Congress has changed and with it the members of the Senate Armed Services Committee that traditionally has been strongly in DoD’s camp regarding spectrum access issues. In particular, former Sen. Jim Inhofe, R.-Olka., was unrelenting in fighting the FCC decision on Ligado. By contrast, current chair Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Missl, supported the FCC and Ligado during his previous tenure as chair of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee. Furthermore, the spectrum battle is showing to be not only a conflict between agencies or government bodies but is also becoming a partisan issue. Republicans recently announced they want to include wireless spectrum adjustments in their upcoming reconciliation package that would reinstate the FCC’s spectrum auction authority. However, Democrats contend that the revenue in the package should be used for communications investments instead of offsetting other spending, Broadband Breakfast reported.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/not-on-the-same-wavelength-trump-inherits-spectrum-fight-between-dod-commercial-industry/	2025-01-27T12:10:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/USS-Ramage-DDG-61-guided-missile-destroyer-Aegis-e1678391103574.jpeg
Space Force zeroed out funding for in-space mobility in FY26 budget request: Sources	Astroscale US is building a prototype satellite for refueling other satellites on orbit under a Space Force contract worth $25.5M. (Graphic: Astroscale US) ORLANDO, Fla. — The Space Force this year decided against including any new money in its initial fiscal 2026 budget request for in-space servicing mobility and logistics, according to two former senior government officials who had been involved in the process, despite strong support for such an investment from lawmakers and officials then serving in the Biden administration. Both the National Space Council and the Office of Management and Budget had been pushing the service to reinstate some funds for those efforts as the Biden administration wound down, according to those sources, but the Space Force declined to do so. The Space Force declined to comment for this report on the FY26 budget request. As it has yet to be approved by the new Trump White House, it's possible funds for space mobility have been or could be added back as the budget request worms its way through the administration before heading to Congress later this year. The Space Force could have quite a pot of money to disperse, as Air Force undersecretary Melissa Dalton reportedly said earlier this month that service officials 'successfully advocate[d] for $87 billion of additional topline,' apparently in reference to additional money requested for the next several fiscal budgets. 'While it is up to the next administration to determine where the ’26 budget will land, you have a compelling foundation for them to consider,' Dalton said, according to Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. On the eve of the third annual Space Mobility Conference here — originally launched in 2023 as a brainchild of US Space Command — supporters of Defense Department investment in technologies to enable what SPACECOM calls 'dynamic space operations' are facing a recent cooling of near-term interest from senior Space Force officials. Even SPACECOM, which previously has been vocal in calling for urgent funding for the mission, may now be looking at capabilities such as satellite refueling and repair, new propulsion systems, and in-space manufacturing as far future goals post 2040 rather than immediate needs. That said, at the Space Power conference in December, SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting noted that the ability to 'maneuver without regret' is number six on his Integrated Priorities List of needs. '[I]t's vital that given the threats we now see in novel orbits that are hard for us to get to, as well as the fact that Chinese have been testing on orbit refueling capability, that we need some kind of sustained space maneuver,' he said. The service added space 'mobility and logistics' to its 'core mission' basket in 2020, and in 2023 established the Servicing, Mobility and Logistics Office under Space Systems Command's Assured Access to Space program office. The mission area was funded by congressional plus-ups until 2025, when the service asked for $20 million, which was approved in the FY25 National Defense Authorization Act. Currently, projects related to mobility and logistics largely have been small, experimental research efforts. For example, in September 2023 the Space Force's public-private Space Enterprise Consortium awarded the American arm of Japanese startup Astroscale a $25 million contract to build a prototype satellite designed to refuel other satellites on orbit. More broadly Trump officials are working with Republicans in Congress on a significant increase in the Pentagon's top line for FY25, but how much of that will go to the Space Force is anyone's guess, much less where specific funding requests land.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/space-force-zeroed-out-funding-for-in-space-mobility-in-fy26-budget-request-sources/	2025-01-27T10:04:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/image002-1-e1705506491937.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: New SASC chair sets sight on $200B defense boost, major acquisition reform push	Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., raises his right hand during his ceremonial swearing-in with Vice President Kamala Harris inside the Old Senate Chamber in the U.S. Capitol on Friday, January 3, 2025. (Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The new chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee has two goals as he takes the gavel in 2025: boost defense funding by about $200 billion in the Republican’s reconciliation package and pass a sweeping acquisition reform proposal in the next defense policy bill, he told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview. If successful in getting a plus-up for defense, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., suggested the money could be used to help fund an Iron Dome-like missile shield over the United States — one of President Donald Trump’s stated defense priorities — as well as to make key investments in areas such as shipbuilding, submarines and the Air Force’s next-generation fighter. 'I hope and believe that President Trump's pledge to restore peace through strength so that we can avoid conflict is going to be followed through with adequate funding,' Wicker said in a Jan. 23 interview. 'At the same time, it is a magnificent opportunity to make the Defense Department and defense procurement more efficient and modern.' Wicker’s office confirmed to Breaking Defense that the SASC chairman is pursuing a parallel strategy to enact his two priorities. The first goal is getting buy-in from Trump and GOP leadership on a substantial funding increase for defense in the reconciliation bill currently under negotiation. The second involves using the fiscal 2026 National Defense Authorization Act as a vehicle to pass Wicker’s acquisition reform vision, laid out in December as the Fostering Reform and Government Efficiency in Defense (FORGED) Act. The budget reconciliation bill, which uses a special procedure that allows bills to avoid filibuster and pass with a simple majority, could include funding for Trump priorities like tax cuts and border security and is targeted to go to the president’s desk in April. (House Republicans are expected to discuss the reconciliation bill during their annual meeting in Miami early this week.) RELATED: New No. 2 House appropriator: Reconciliation bill going to be ‘heavy lift’ Wicker — who has argued that US defense spending should grow to 5 percent of GDP — and House Armed Services Committee chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., are hoping to make the case to GOP leadership that additional money for defense should be included as part of the legislation. 'It would not be outside the realm of possibility to make it $100 billion a year [for defense] for the next two years,' Wicker said. 'That would start to get us where we want to go.' A plus-up of that size — over a 10 percent increase from what Wicker's committee marked up for the FY25 NDAA — could be used to accelerate the construction of warships, amphibious ships and submarines, he said, as well as to start development of an American Iron Dome missile defense shield, an investment that Wicker acknowledged will be a technical challenge as well as a costly expenditure. 'Israel is a small state about the size of New Jersey, so Iron Dome for Israel is much different from Iron Dome for America,' Wicker said. 'But a missile defense shield with a large satellite, a space-based component, that's going to be expensive, but it's a must, and it happens that the president feels some urgency in getting that done.' It could also help fund continued development of the Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance fighter, which faces an uncertain future due to budget constraints as the service balances other expensive modernization projects such as the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system and the B-21 Raider bomber. As Breaking Defense first reported, the service recently concluded a study that validated the requirement for a manned sixth-gen fighter, but has left the incoming Trump administration to make the final decision on whether to continue or cancel the program. In 2024, 'we agreed reluctantly to do a bit of a pause to let the experts take another look at whether NGAD should be manned. And the answer came back after the election with the vengeance, absolutely yes,' Wicker said. Wicker’s defense acquisition plan largely sailed under the radar when it was released in late December, as Congress was racing to pass a last-minute government funding extension. But if enacted, it could radically reshape the Pentagon’s contracting apparatus by injecting new policies meant to ramp up competition, make the acquisition process more agile and responsive to changes in threat, and untether nontraditional defense firms and commercial companies from some of the most onerous Pentagon contracting procedures. 'I haven't gotten a lot of pushback from the big guys. The folks that would like to innovate and participate as startups are wild about it,' Wicker said. 'I think [the primes] would agree that there are too many steps along the way that could be eliminated. But then the little guys — the guys with a new idea, the Elon Musks of the future — see this valley of death, and it's real to them.' One of the FORGED Act’s biggest shifts would make commercial procurement processes the default contracting method for the Pentagon, making defense-specific contracting procedures used by bespoke weapon systems like fighter jets and aircraft carriers the exception rather than the rule. The hope is to make it easier for companies that manufacture consumer products to do business with the Pentagon without having to go through the onerous process of proving they meet government standards for commercial goods. RELATED: Incoming SASC head lays out acquisition reform vision In a potentially even more radical change, the bill proposes making all nontraditional defense firms subject to commercial procurement rules, even if they are selling defense-specific products like missiles or drones. Because nontraditional defense firms have largely funneled their own research and development dollars into bringing a product to the market, unlike most defense products that are developed primarily with government funding, the report accompanying the FORGED Act argues that nontraditional companies should be exempt from rules that would force them to 'stand up federal units with separate infrastructure' — a cost burden that might prevent them from continuing to invest their own capital into R&amp;D in the future. The legislation would also require the Pentagon to transition from a structure where program executive officers manage a given weapons program, into one where a 'portfolio acquisition executive' or PAE has oversight over a group of related capabilities and can make tradeoffs among those weapon systems as funding, requirements and schedule evolves. Under that construct, the services would push some of their requirements and programming staff into the PAE offices, as well as designating representatives from the operational community who would offer insight from the perspective of the troops would use the new weapon in the field. In what could be another controversial move, it directs the Chairman of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council (JROC) and Director of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation (CAPE) to co-chair a Joint Requirements &amp; Programming Board, which would 'provide analysis, set agendas, and lead debate' on defense acquisition policy measures but be purely advisory in nature, according to the report. The legislation would strip the JROC of its responsibility to validate joint requirements, with the organization instead tasked with 'reviewing' requirements. So far, industry organizations have yet to weigh in on the specifics of Wicker’s plan. In December, Aerospace Industries Association President Eric Fanning said the organization was reviewing the proposal and looked forward to working with Wicker moving forward. 'As the voice of the American aerospace and defense industry, we welcome Senator Wicker’s continued focus on strengthening the defense industrial base and reforming defense acquisition,' Fanning said then. 'Senator Wicker’s proposal, along with the Department of Government Efficiency, offers a real opportunity to unleash innovation and get new weapons and equipment to the warfighter faster.' While Wicker's office is still early in the process of determining the legislative strategy for the reform proposal, senate aides said some of the FORGED Act will likely appear in the Wicker’s chairman’s mark of the FY26 NDAA, while more contentious changes will have to be dealt with in the committee’s markup process, where they will be offered as amendments to the policy bill and voted on after debate. 'This is not a Wicker-only effort,' one GOP aide said, adding that both Republicans and Democrats have historically been invested in acquisition reform. 'So ideally, we are going to have a full team effort on the committee here.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/exclusive-new-sasc-chair-sets-sight-on-200b-defense-boost-major-acquisition-reform-push/	2025-01-27T09:02:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/roger-wicker-scaled-e1737995435127.jpg
Will S. Korea’s drama cause problems, or savings, for Poland’s large weapon buys?	In a file photo, officials from Poland and South Korea, including the previous Polish defense minister, shake hands during the announcement ceremony of a major new arms agreement between the two countries. (Polish MoD) WARSAW — On Dec. 3, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly declared martial law, a move that critics widely viewed as an internal coup attempt. Since then, political uncertainty has gripped South Korea, with Yoon’s fate to be determined and interim leadership guiding Seoul. It has the Indo-Pacific region watching carefully. But Yoon’s move also reverberated deeply 4,800 miles away in Warsaw, where Poland has spent several years tying itself to South Korea’s defense industry. The political ramifications, and subsequent impact on the won — which hit a five year low versus the dollar in January, as the political crisis continued — have raised two key questions about whether Poland’s major investments could be impacted. First, could there be any benefit to Poland's big Korean buys if the won stays depressed? And second, is there any concern in Poland that they may not be able to get everything they want from the Koreans, given the big arms deals were signed under an administration that seems likely to be replaced sometime in 2025? For now, everyone involved is putting on a brave face that business is normal. But Marek Świerczyński, head of security and international affairs desk at the Polityka Insight center for policy analysis based in Warsaw, told Breaking Defense that 'The question is how this crisis will affect the functioning of the Korean economy, including the defense sector, and what long-term effects it will have on both sides.' 'The longer this crisis lasts, regardless of possible ‘profits’ on the currency, the worse for the future of strategic cooperation between Poland and South Korea. Let us remember that the Koreans' competitors are not sleeping,' Świerczyński said. 'Despite the Korean side's quick assurances that nothing is changing in relations with Poland, this situation is a cold shower for Polish decision-makers.' Over the last decade, South Korea has worked to make itself into a global arms exporter. Those efforts do seem to be paying off: The combined operating profit forecast for 2024 of the four major defense companies, three of which have major deals with Poland, was estimated at 2.114 trillion won, according to local reports from financial information company FnGuide. Hanwha Aerospace is projected to have operating profits rise 94.65 percent year-on-year to 1.35 trillion won. In 2022 Hanwha Aerospace signed export contracts for K9 self-propelled howitzers and K-239 Chunmoo multiple rocket launchers with Poland. Hyundai Rotem, driven by its K2 tanks, is projected to see an operating profit to surge by 116.66 percent to 455.1 billion won. The company delivered 84 K2GF tanks to Poland under its first contract last year and plans to deliver an additional 96 tanks this year. KAI is anticipated to have an 11.28 percent increase in operating profit at 275.4 billion won. It is also set to include development earnings from the FA-50PL, a customized variant for Poland, which will begin deliveries at the end of this year. All told, Poland has signed over $16 billion worth of contracts with South Korean firms since the start of 2022. However, many of those deals are being broken down into tranches, which are negotiated individually over time. Which gets to question number one: Could Poland take advantage of the weakened won as it is negotiating future tranches, and save some zlotys in the process? Speaking on background, a representative for a number of Korean firms in Poland downplayed concern, saying that while the companies are monitoring the situation, 'there is probably no such thinking at all' that the won situation will impact Poland’s plans. That is, at least in part, because Poland isn’t buying things in Korean currency. In a statement to Breaking Defense, the Ministry of National Defense said that 'payments for military equipment obtained from the Korean direction are made in US dollars, in accordance with the adopted schedule for the implementation of contracts.' Given that the deals are not done in Korean currency, the Polish Ministry of State Assets (MAP) said in a statement that 'when contracting deliveries, the purchasing power of the won is not so important. In turn, the division of the order for a given equipment into individual tranches depends on the agreements between the parties to the contract and depends on the capabilities of the manufacturer as well as the needs of the ordering party.' 'It should therefore be assumed that there are no mechanisms for pre-emptive purchase of Korean currency or overpayment at its lower exchange rate. However, it should be recalled that there were cases of repayment of tranches, e.g. for the Wisla air defense systems (the Polish name for Patriot systems), if there were funds available for use in the MND budget at the end of the year. However, the current situation, at the beginning of the new budget year, is different,' Świerczyński said. 'Of course, it is always better to buy something cheaper than more expensive. If, as a result of the prolonged crisis, the South Korean currency maintains a low exchange rate, then in a sense we can benefit from this.' The second question then: Is there concern South Korea’s internal political situation will impact delivery, whether because the won’s crash raises prices in the supply chain or because a new government could cancel contracts? Asked that question, the defense ministry replied that 'the MND does not comment on the political situation in other countries.' MAP responded that there should be no real issues: 'From an industrial point of view, the agreements contain appropriate provisions regarding cooperation, not directly related to the current internal political situation in both countries. The Polish side has not received information that could indicate that the current situation in [South] Korea may have any negative impact on business relations built on the basis of long-term agreements. 'Of course, the development of events in Seoul is being closely monitored,' the statement reads. The industry representative emphasized that in South Korea there is bipartisan support for defense equipment exports to Poland, and that the companies themselves are dedicated to making deliveries happen on time and on budget. 'These companies have a very high level of responsibility, even culturally old-fashioned, and for them obligations are sacred. So, there are no threats, nothing there negatively affects production,' the representative said. 'But of course everyone is following the development of the political situation in South Korea with the hope that this crisis will end as soon as possible.' Świerczyński, for his part, agreed that defense exports are a non-partisan priority for Korea. But, he cautioned, 'the political earthquake that was the attempted coup and its consequences must have an impact on the institutions and the people functioning in them. Let us recall that the Korean Ministry of National Defense was headed by a close confidant of the compromised president, who is no longer a minister. We do not have a full picture of the purges, but we can imagine what a crisis of trust exists within the institution, which was somehow subordinate to the president. 'All this does not create a favorable landscape, and the problem that can be seen in Seoul with stabilizing the situation does not inspire optimism,' Świerczyński stressed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/will-s-koreas-drama-cause-problems-or-savings-for-polands-large-weapon-buys/	2025-01-27T06:45:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/07/poland_korea.jpg
General Atomics aeronautics CEO calls on DOGE to speed acquisition, cut FMS red tape	American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) should take steps to speed up the defense acquisition process and reduce barriers to foreign military sales, the chief executive of General Atomics’ aeronautical systems division said in a new letter. 'Within GA-ASI’s own export market, poor US Government (USG) policy and sluggish bureaucratic decision-making has opened the door for competitors like China, Turkey, and Israel to win important international customers,' Linden Blue wrote in the Jan. 24 letter addressed to DOGE head Elon Musk and released by the company today. 'Sales lost to these competitors while we waited on some USG action means less funding available for re-investment into R&amp;D and modernized manufacturing infrastructure. 'Bold leadership is needed. Past reform efforts, often supervised by the very organizations most in need of reform, have failed. DOGE has the potential to drive meaningful change, and we are ready to help where we can,' he said. Blue’s letter comes about a week after L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik sent a letter to Musk laying out his ideas on how to reduce Pentagon bureaucracy, including by eliminating certain government accounting rules as well as reducing regulations that require defense contractors to submit detailed pricing data. At the time, Kubasik's letter — which also directly criticized the outgoing Biden team — seemed an outlier. With General Atomics now following suit, it could signify a trend in which others in industry now race to get their own takes in front of DOGE. RELATED: Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon’s DOGE to wow The agency (not a Department, despite the name) was formally established on inauguration day, with the White House issuing an executive order establishing the Department of Government Efficiency. The order renamed the existing US Digital Service as the US DOGE Service and tasked it with 'modernizing Federal technology and software to maximize governmental efficiency and productivity,' specifically by improvements to software, networks and IT systems. While the Defense Department waits to see how DOGE could seek to overhaul existing processes or systems, defense contractors have begun soliciting Musk with their own ideas for reform. In his letter, Blue calls for setting time limits on Defense Department milestones for larger acquisition programs, specifically suggesting that the length of time between when a program’s requirements are first defined and a product's initial operational capability be capped at five years. He criticizes a culture of 'buck-passing' in the foreign military sales process, stating that greater accountability is needed across the State Department, Pentagon and military services to ensure an administration is meeting its security cooperation goals. That can be accomplished by instating 'clear lines of authority and responsibility, time limits for decision-making, and a modern IT system to track the distribution and expenditure of billions of dollars (entirely funded by foreign customers) in the US FMS administrative fund account,' he said. Finally, Blue recommends revamping the US government’s current interpretation of the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement that governs the export of missiles and uncrewed aerial system, arguing that the US should focus its attention on 'focus on missile technology tied to weapons of mass destruction rather than UAS.' The MTCR has been a longstanding concern of General Atomics, which has held that the US’s current posture is too restrictive, and has resulted in stricter controls for drones than exist for other military aircraft, including advanced, lethal capabilities like fighter jets. (On the way out the door the Biden administration issued guidance loosening the interpretation of MTCR, but primarily for space-related technologies.) 'We should counter the unfair market advantages gained by foreign suppliers not subject to self-imposed MTCR limitations. Further, we must objectively balance the prioritization of technology security with that of arming allies and partners (using their own money!) for future conflicts and increased burden-sharing,' he wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/general-atomics-aeronautics-ceo-calls-on-doge-to-speed-acquisition-cut-fms-red-tape/	2025-01-27T02:00:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/doge-logo-scaled-e1734035776699.jpg
Trump nominee Pete Hegseth confirmed as defense secretary	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth testifies during his Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on January 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Pete Hegseth to be the next secretary of defense tonight by the narrowest of margins, with Republicans relying on a tiebreaking vote from Vice President JD Vance to clear one of Trump’s most controversial nominees after weeks of questions about his fitness to lead the Pentagon. The nomination prevailed in a 51-50 vote after Republican Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and Mitch McConnell joined Democrats to vote against Hegseth. Hegseth, a Fox News host and National Guard veteran, has faced a rocky road to the top defense job since being tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the Pentagon in November. In the following weeks, allegations of sexual misconduct and whistleblower reports alleging that Hegseth abused alcohol while on the job at Fox News and as the former president of Concerned Veterans for America threatened to topple his nomination. Hegseth has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and has pledged to stop drinking if named secretary of defense. Although Hegseth’s nomination appeared to be on steady footing after his Jan. 14 confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questions about Republican defectors arose after new allegations surfaced about Hegseth’s previous marriage. Senators received an affidavit Tuesday, a redacted copy of which was obtained by Breaking Defense, in which Hegseth’s former sister-in-law, Danielle Hegseth, claimed that Pete Hegseth’s aggressive behavior caused his second wife to fear for her safety and form an escape plan. Hegseth’s second wife, Samantha Hegseth, told NBC News — which was first to report on the affidavit — that there had been no physical abuse in her marriage, while Hegseth’s lawyer denied the allegations. On Thursday afternoon, Alaska’s Murkowski became the first Republican to state she would vote against Hegseth, noting her enduring concerns about Hegseth’s judgement, his comments about women in combat, and questionable financial management of the veterans organizations he previously led. 'I believe that character is the defining trait required of the Secretary of Defense, and must be prioritized without compromise. The leader of the Department of Defense must demonstrate and model the standards of behavior and character we expect of all servicemembers, and Mr. Hegseth’s nomination to the role poses significant concerns that I cannot overlook,' she said in a statement on X, formerly known as Twitter. Collins, who represents Maine, released a statement declaring her intent to vote against Hegseth shortly afterwards. 'While I appreciate his courageous military service and his ongoing commitment to our servicemembers and their families, I am concerned that he does not have the experience and perspective necessary to succeed in the job,' she wrote in a statement on X. Both Murkowski and Collins on Thursday joined Democrats in voting against a procedural move to bring Hegseth’s nomination for a final vote, which succeeded 51-49. However, questions swirled around whether McConnell and Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who both voted to advance the nomination on Thursday, would join Murkowski and Collins to vote against Hegseth during the final vote — potentially torpedoing Hegseth's nomination. Minutes after the final vote began, Hegseth posted his response to Danielle Hegseth's allegations, addressed to Tillis, on X. 'I dispute Ms. Dietrich’s characterization of me as being abusive to my ex-wife Samantha or having an alcohol abuse problem,' Hegseth wrote, referring to his former sister in law. 'I have been very open about how I have used alcohol in the past to deal with the demons that I experienced from my time in Iraq and Afghanistan, as countless of my fellow veterans have. However, this something I have overcome.' 'My ex wife Samantha has also been explicit in both court filings and in her public statement to NBC (and I believe her FBI interview) that were was no physical abuse,' he wrote later in the letter. Shortly afterward, Tillis announced on X he would support Hegseth's nomination. 'From the beginning, I have been clear about my position: if President Trump’s nominees were reported favorably out of the relevant committees, I would support their confirmation on the Senate floor absent new material information about their qualifications,' Tillis wrote. 'Once Pete Hegseth’s nomination was sent to the floor by my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee, I conducted my own due diligence, including asking tough questions of Pete and I appreciated his candor and openness in answering them.' During Hegseth’s nomination hearing last week, Republicans praised Hegseth’s focus on readiness and lethality and repeated Hegseth’s claim that the allegations against him were baseless smears. Sen. Joni Ernst — a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor who was the most visible SASC Republican holdout on the nomination — announced hours after the hearing that she would support Hegseth’s defense secretary bid. However, SASC Democrats hammered Hegseth about his comments on women in combat and said he didn’t meet the standards of character or job performance necessary to run the nation’s largest employer. SASC voted 14-13 along party lines on Monday evening to report the nomination out of committee. In a floor speech on Tuesday, SASC top Democrat Sen. Jack Reed raised concerns about Trump’s firing of Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan earlier this week and said Hegseth’s confirmation could further destabilize the US military should he support efforts to purge military leaders who do not align with Trump’s politics. 'Our servicemembers, since the birth of this country 249 years ago, have taken an oath to the Constitution,' Reed said. 'Their mission is to protect the country and all of its citizens and the ideals this country was founded on, which should endure no matter who is President or what political party is in power. Mr. Hegseth's idea of meritocracy, however, seems to be that servicemembers should pledge fealty to a President who will be in power for only four years and fit the ideas of a party that only half of this Nation supports. 'There is no faster way to undermine the lethality and morale of our Nation's military&#8211;and support of the Nation's citizens for it&#8211;than to inject politics into the system,' he said. SASC Chair Roger Wicker, in a Thursday floor speech following Reed’s, said Hegseth had been a victim of a smear campaign and false media reports. He acknowledged Hegseth is an 'unconventional' nominee, like Trump as president, but added that fresh ideas could shake up the Pentagon bureaucracy. 'That may be what makes Mr. Hegseth a good choice. He’s not beholden to the status quo and he’s open to new ideas,' he said. 'His experience in the line of fire and his servicemember advocacy make at least one thing clear. Pete Hegseth will put the men and women of our military first.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trump-nominee-pete-hegseth-confirmed-as-defense-secretary/	2025-01-24T18:51:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/hegseth-confirmation-scaled-e1736870161374.jpg
ChatNC3: Can the US trust AI in nuclear command, control and communications?	An Air Force Global Strike Command unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile launches during an operational test Oct. 29, 2020, at Vandenberg AFB, Calif. (US Air Force photo by Michael Peterson) WASHINGTON — As the US military experiments with AI for everything from streamlining contract documents to coordinating global operations, there’s one area that’s remained off-limits: nuclear command and control. Perhaps that's not surprising, given the obvious fears of a WarGames-like accidental apocalypse. But what if the Pentagon at least let AI help in nuclear crises, in a contained and limited way, by using algorithms to process incoming intelligence on a potential strike more quickly, giving the human beings involved — and ultimately President Donald Trump — precious additional time to make the most difficult decision imaginable? Last fall, no less a figure than the four-star chief of nuclear forces, Gen. Anthony Cotton of US Strategic Command, argued publicly that 'advanced AI and robust data analytics capabilities provide decision advantage and improve our deterrence posture.' This morning, that question of even a limited use-case for AI was the dividing line in a public debate, hosted at the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies, between two experts on systems of military command. On the 'yes' side, saying the US nuclear enterprise should give AI a chance, was former Pentagon official and House Armed Services staffer Sarah Mineiro, who’s also worked at AI-enthusiast defense-tech upstart Anduril. On the 'no' side, saying the risks are just too great, was Paul Scharre, a former Army Ranger who led a DoD working group that established policies on autonomy in weapons systems and recently published a book on AI in conflict. Now, no one on either side of today’s debate was arguing the US should let AI decide whether or not to launch a nuclear strike, let alone suggesting a computer should have the ability to launch a nuclear weapon without human authorization. (Do you want Skynets? Because that’s how you get Skynets.) Even Chinese President Xi Jinping, notoriously averse to arms control, has seemed amenable to discussing AI 'risks' with the US. But, contrary to Hollywood depictions of giant war rooms filled with dramatically lit screens, real-life military operations centers can be clunky, antiquated, and labor-intensive, reliant on staff officers manually entering information or relaying it verbally over secure phones. That can be true even when it comes to what’s called 'nuclear command, control, and communications.' NC3 systems used floppy disks until 2019, and operations still ultimately rely, not on anyone pressing the proverbial 'button' — no such button exists — but on verbal orders from the President that cascade down the hierarchy of human officers. So while everyone wants a human being to make the final call, could AI perhaps help streamline and secure the process? If AI can be trusted to help analyze all sorts of other military intelligence data, like satellite imagery and intercepted messages, the US should use it to aid nuclear decision-making as well, argued Mineiro. Once an ICBM is in the air, she noted, it takes at most half an hour to reach its target. That’s dangerously little time to make the decision whether or not to fire back, and every minute spent figuring out what’s actually happening is one minute less to make the crucial judgment call. 'AI tools and techniques can actually help to expand the decision space for the human decision maker …when you are analyzing petabytes of data that are going to impact millions of people's lives,' Mineiro said. 'If you can crunch [numbers] and do that pattern recognition, classification and determination, flight path determination, any quicker … you should absolutely do that. 'At the end of the day, this ends up being an optimization question,' she said. 'It’s … allowing computers to do what computers do best, and let humans do what humans do best.' But there’s a practical problem with letting AI crunch the numbers for NC3, responded Scharre: No one has the right numbers to crunch. No nuclear weapon has been used in combat since 1945, back when they had to be dropped by propeller-driven planes. 'What is the training data set that we would use for nuclear war? Thankfully, we don't have one,' Scharre said. The lack of nuclear wars is a good problem to have, of course, but it is a real problem for nuclear decision-making — even for human analysts looking for 'indications and warnings.' AI algorithms require mountains of data in order to shape themselves into effective analysts, and are notoriously 'brittle' when faced with problems outside the data set that they were trained on. 'Humans can flexibly respond to novel conditions, and AI can't,' Scharre said. 'AI systems are terrible at adapting to novelty. If they are presented with a situation is outside of the scope of their training data, they are effectively blind and unable to adapt.' As a result, he said, 'a nuclear crisis is exactly the kind of situation we would expect an AI system to fail catastrophically.' Especially insidious, he added, is the possibility that the AI early-warning system would predict outcomes accurately under peacetime conditions, only to go haywire and 'hallucinate' like ChatGPT when a crisis created conditions it had never seen before. Such a track record could lull humans into a false confidence that they can just trust the computer and stop paying attention or thinking for themselves. That’s a well-known phenomenon known as 'automation bias,' which had led to fatal accidents in wartime, commercial aviation, and even on the highway. 'Humans can over-trust AI with catastrophic consequences,' Scharre said. 'We've seen this in other areas, like in self-driving cars, which drive very well in some settings, but then, suddenly and without warning, have driven into concrete barriers, parked cars, fire trucks, semi-trailers, pedestrians, causing fatal accidents.' Unlike an NC3 AI trying to identify a nuclear strike in progress, Scharre added, self-driving cars have abundant real-world data to train on, and yet they still make the occasional lethal mistake. That rate of error may be tolerable when the worst outcome is a car crash, he said, or even a conventional airstrike hitting the wrong target, he said, 'but it is nowhere near reliable enough for applications that require zero tolerance for failures, and that's what we need in nuclear command and control.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/chatnc3-can-the-us-trust-ai-in-nuclear-command-control-and-communications/	2025-01-24T10:24:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240708_minuteman_launch_6406505-scaled-e1720469241527.jpg
Why Ukraine’s all-drone, multi-domain attack could be a ‘seminal’ moment in warfare	A D-21 reconnaissance and combat ground robotic complex is pictured during an event organised by JSC Ukrainian Defense Industry (UkrOboronProm) to mark the Defence and Industrial Complex Employee Day, Kyiv region, northern Ukraine. (Photo credit should read Pavlo_Bagmut / Ukrinform/Future Publishing via Getty Images) FARNBOROUGH, England — Ukraine successfully pulled off an all-drone, multi-domain attack on Russian positions near Kharkiv in December, an official speaking at the International Armoured Vehicle (IAV) conference disclosed this week, in what they are calling the first-ever such operation. Addressing delegates under the Chatham House Rule at Defence iQ’s IAV event here, the official described how the operation exclusively featured weaponized uncrewed ground vehicles (UGVs) and first person view (FPV) attack drones and did not feature any crewed platforms or boots on the ground. UGVs conducted the full spectrum of mission sets including surveillance, mine clearance and direct fire, supported by uncrewed aerial systems (UAS), the official stated before explaining how the 'tactical air-land operation' represented the first instance of an 'uncrewed battle fought by one side' in the ongoing war. Reflecting on the attack, which appeared at the time as merely a 'footnote in daily reporting,' the official went on to describe it as a 'seminal moment in the changing character of conflict.' Warning 'Ukraine faces today what [NATO] could face tomorrow,' the speaker went onto describe how Ukraine’s military continues to place a premium on attritable technologies to create combat mass,' before adding: 'Ukraine has made the most of turning industrial disadvantage into a furnace of innovation.' The December attack was confirmed by the National Guard of Ukraine, with a spokesperson at the time describing how 'dozens' of uncrewed equipment had been used to conduct an assault near Lyptsi, equipped with machine guns and munitions. Exact types of UGVs and FPV drones used during the attack were not disclosed but a defense source informed Breaking Defense that ground vehicles included the 4&#215;4 ‘Ratel S’ which was developed through the Ukraine Government’s Brave1 Defence Innovation Forum. Ukraine has been trying to use drones in as many mission sets as possible, Paul Clayton, director of industrial partnerships at UGV manufacturer Milrem Robotics, told Breaking Defense at the show. Clayton described a visit in July to Ukraine, where the military showed off how UGVs were being employed for 'first strike' missions with '10 or more UGVs on an objective and achieving victory because they overwhelmed an enemy, getting inside their OODA loop.' 'If [Russian forces] destroyed one [UGV], another will come in,' he added before suggesting UGVs are being specifically used to disrupt or destroy command and control nodes. But Clayton also warned of limitations facing UGVs in Ukraine. 'The winter-mud season critically impacts tactical, operational and even strategic operations. Mud severely limits off road mobility, rendering wheeled vehicles virtually interoperable and hampering tracked vehicles under extreme conditions. Additionally, Clayton described how UGVs were vulnerable to the enemy’s advanced EW and jamming capabilities. RLEATED: Inside Ukraine, startups try to edge Russia in the electronic warfare race 'These pose significant challenges to [uncrewed] operations including their control and effectiveness,' he stated before also suggesting UGVs must use fortified positions to take cover during missions. 'Drone-operating frequencies are constantly shifting. Intelligence and EW teams must remain vigilant to detect and counteract newly adopted enemy frequencies. A decline in jammer effectiveness must be swiftly identified and addressed,' he added. Since 2022, a total of 15 THeMIS UGVs, produced by Milrem, have been used by the Ukrainians for cargo, casualty evacuation and demand. But Clayton suggested 'additional orders are coming' for anti-tank, indirect fire and direct fire capabilities, as well as intelligence-gathering, communications relay and engineering. The executive said it’s his aspiration to have more than 200 UGVs operating in Ukraine by the end of the year, fulfilling a variety of intelligence-gathering and combat roles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/why-ukraines-all-drone-multi-domain-attack-could-be-a-seminal-moment-in-warfare/	2025-01-24T07:45:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/ukraine-UGV-scaled-e1737666918181.jpg
UK awards Rolls-Royce $11B nuclear reactor ‘Unity’ contract	Concept art of a future UK Royal Navy Dreadnought Class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (Rolls Royce) BELFAST — British engine manufacturer Rolls-Royce has received its largest ever contract from the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), valued at $11.1 billion, for the design, manufacture and support of Royal Navy nuclear submarine reactors. The new eight-year deal, dubbed by London in a statement today as a 'Unity' contract, will enhance the UK’s continuous at sea deterrent (CASD) and strengthen the AUKUS trilateral partnership. Maria Eagle, UK minister for defence procurement told lawmakers, 'It's a contract that will help Rolls-Royce operate in a more integrated and efficient way, driving efficiencies, reducing waste, saving more than £400 million, and delivering on the government's commitment to provide value for money for the taxpayer.' UK Defence Secretary John Healey said in the MoD statement, 'National security is a foundation of our government’s plan for change, and this is a clear demonstration of our commitment to the UK’s nuclear deterrent, which is our ultimate insurance policy in a more dangerous world.' Britain's deterrent is singular in nature, meaning its nuclear strike capability is submarine based only, as opposed to the ability to deploy ground or air launched weapon systems like other nuclear powers. CASD is currently supported by a fleet of Royal Navy Vanguard Class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) fitted with Trident 2 D5 missiles, but will be replaced by four new Dreadnought Class vessels in the 2030s. The future submarine program is expected to cost £31 billion (38.4 billion), excluding a £10 billion contingency fund. Each of the new Dreadnought Class platforms will also be armed with Trident weapons and four Spearfish medium-range torpedoes. In a supporting statement, Rolls-Royce noted that the Unity contract will include 'continued support of the build and commission of Dreadnought Class submarines and the beginning of the previously announced SSN-AUKUS contracts.' The manufacturer has committed to expanding its nuclear reactor production facility in Derby, England, equivalent to 'almost double' the size of the current site, as a result of demand from the Royal Navy and AUKUS, according to a company statement. In 2023, the UK awarded AUKUS Detailed Design and Long Leads (D2L2) phase contracts, amounting to £4 billion to Rolls Royce and British manufacturing counterparts BAE Systems and Babcock. The funding was allocated to support design and prototyping activities and to enable contractors to acquire long lead items for future UK submarines due to replace Astute-Class (SSN) vessels from the late 2030s. New Royal Australian Navy SSNs are set to follow from 2040 on, before which the US will deliver three Virginia-class types to Australia and potentially an additional two units. Canberra is replacing Collins-class diesel-electric subs. SSN-AUKUS vessels are set to be integrated with technology from all three partner nations. They are also based on a next generation design from BAE Systems. The firm and Australia's ASC Pty were selected in March 2024 to manufacture the Australian set of subs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/uk-awards-rolls-royce-11b-nuclear-reactor-unity-contract/	2025-01-24T07:08:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/rr-signs-landmark-unity-contract-with-uk-ministry-of-defence-content-img.jpg
Boeing to log $1.7B in defense program losses in fourth quarter	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — Boeing expects to log a $1.7 billion loss across several defense programs when it announces its fourth quarter 2024 results next Tuesday, the company said, meaning the company will have incurred almost $5 billion in losses on defense programs for the full year. Boeing’s total year end charges of $4.9 billion on its troubled portfolio of fixed price weapons contracts is the largest-ever loss for its defense unit, up from losses of $4.4 billion in 2022, according to figures from Boeing financial disclosures compiled by Breaking Defense. The newly revealed fourth quarter charges include a $800 million loss on the KC-46 tanker, reflecting what the company said were higher-than-estimated manufacturing costs. Boeing attributed part of that loss to the September strike of its Seattle-area machinist union, which resulted in a seven week production halt on jetliners such as twin-aisled 767 from which the KC-46 is derived. It also included a $500 billion loss on the T-7 Red Hawk trainer programs due to higher estimated production costs starting in 2026, Boeing said in a statement. EXCLUSIVE: Air Force reworking approach for T-7A Red Hawk, delaying production by 1 year The company will also record losses on the Air Force One replacement program known as VC-25B, the Navy’s MQ-25 tanker drone and NASA’s Starliner, Boeing said, although it did not provide exact figures for those programs. 'Although we face near-term challenges, we took important steps to stabilize our business during the quarter including reaching an agreement with our IAM [International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers]-represented teammates and conducting a successful capital raise to improve our balance sheet,' said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg. 'We also restarted 737, 767 and 777/777X production and our team remains focused on the hard work ahead to build a new future for Boeing.' RELATED: Boeing's defense unit logs massive $2 billion in losses for third quarter Fixed price contracts, which hold the company responsible for covering all costs over a certain threshold, have long been the bane of Boeing's defense unit, which has seen costs of programs like the KC-46 and MQ-25 skyrocket due to supply chain problems, the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and labor issues. Boeing executives have repeatedly stated that the company will no longer bid on development contracts that use a fixed-price structure. Altogether, Boeing’s defense unit is set to report revenue of $5.4 billion for the quarter, as well as an operating margin of negative 42 percent, Boeing said. Earlier this month, the Air Force announced it had delayed Milestone C for the T-7 by a year and that it would allocate additional funds toward incentive agreements with Boeing to address issues that were not originally envisioned when the plane’s fixed-price development contract was negotiated. In September, Boeing announced the departure of Ted Colbert, who has led its defense unit since 2022. The planemaker has not announced a full-time successor, with Steve Parker, the defense division's chief operating officer, taking on the acting CEO role.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/boeing-to-log-1-7b-in-defense-program-losses-in-fourth-quarter/	2025-01-23T14:52:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
Despite high-profile exits, most Defense Business, Innovation Boards intact	Former Defense Innovation Board chair Michael R. Bloomberg speaks at the board’s fall meeting, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Oct. 17, 2022. (DoD/ Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — The new Pentagon leadership has not taken steps to dismiss members of the Defense Business Board and Defense Innovation Board, but there was a spate of resignations before President Donald Trump was sworn in for his second term on Monday. A Pentagon spokesman told Breaking Defense today that there was no announcement on a broader shakeup on those two boards 'at this time.' However, he noted several recent resignations. For the Defense Business Board — a collection of private sector executives appointed by the Secretary of Defense for business management advice — Chairwoman Deborah Lee James, the Obama-era Air Force Secretary, resigned effective Monday, along with Sally Donnelly, Oscar Munoz, Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah and former US Central Command Chief Joseph Votel. 'Board Vice Chair, Ms. Linnie Haynesworth, will serve as acting chair until a new board chair is appointed,' the spokesman wrote in a short statement. 'No new members have been appointed at this time.' Over on the Defense Innovation Board — an advisory group focused on emerging technology and innovation — Chairman Michael Bloomberg stepped aside effective Jan. 14. Other recent resignations also included LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, former House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry and retired Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen. So far, Acting Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses has not yet appointed new members to the DIB, the spokesman said, meaning six members remain. While the Pentagon has not disbanded these two boards, the Department of Homeland Security terminated similar boards this week. Such boards have also acted as political volleyballs in the past. In December 2020, with just over a month left in office, Trump’s Pentagon swapped out nine members of the Defense Business Board, which has traditionally been non-partisan, with loyalists; similar moves happened at other advisory committees around the department. By February 2021, then Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered hundreds of Pentagon advisory board members to resign, a move that essentially purged the Trump administration's last-minute appointments.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/despite-high-profile-exits-most-defense-business-innovation-board-members-intact/	2025-01-23T13:22:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/7467530-scaled-e1736885904170.jpg
OpenAI’s $500B ‘Stargate Project’ could aid Pentagon’s own AI efforts, official says	An 149th Intelligence Squadron airman conducts training in a computer training lab at Mather Field, California Dec. 2, 2023. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — If OpenAI can actually implement its Stargate Project to build $500 billion-worth of AI infrastructure in the US, one of the major beneficiaries may be the US military. 'It depends on how much of that they devote to gov[ernment] cloud and AI cloud,' said Roy Campbell, chief strategist for the Pentagon’s High Performance Computing Modernization Program and deputy director for advanced computing in the undersecretariat for research &amp; engineering. And if the Defense Department can get a slice of Stargate’s computing power, he told Breaking Defense, it could bypass a major bottleneck for its current high-tech ambitions. 'We really don’t have the footprint inside [DoD], the in-house capabilities, to answer all the questions, so we’re really going to have to ‘phone out’ to all these assets' that the private sector is building, Campbell told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Potomac Officers’ Club annual defense R&amp;D conference. What Stargate will build, precisely, is still a little vague. Announced in a high-profile press conference Tuesday at the White House, featuring newly elected President Trump, the Stargate Project will be a new company created to develop that 'AI infrastructure' to train and operate ever-larger artificial intelligence models, including new data centers and the electrical power to run them. Managed by OpenAI and Japan-based Softbank, Stargate will also draw funding from computing giant Oracle and UAE-based investment firm MGX. OpenAI will also provide technology to the new Stargate company, along with Arm, Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Oracle. 'We will begin deploying $100 billion immediately,' OpenAI's launch announcement said. 'The buildout is currently underway, starting in Texas, and we are evaluating potential sites across the country.' The ambitious half-trillion project is aimed at commercial customers: Neither the White House press conference nor the OpenAI announcement mentioned national defense. But it could also help DoD solve its own AI dilemma. For over a decade, the Pentagon has placed ever-bigger bets on artificial intelligence to achieve a wide array of goals, from streamlining procurement contracts, to analyzing intelligence data, to coordinating all the services’ disparate forces over land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace, a concept called CJADC2. But with over three million troops to pay, train, equip, and keep supplied around the world, even the nearly trillion-dollar DoD budget can’t keep up with AI’s exponentially growing hunger for computing power. Cutting-edge Large Language Models and other generative artificial intelligence tools require so much electricity, in fact, that industry is looking to nuclear power. By one calculation, OpenAI’s flagship ChatGPT burns almost three times as much energy per query as Google Search, and it consumes enough power per year — over 226 gigawatts — to charge three million electric cars (or 186 time-traveling DeLoreans). Meanwhile DoD is already straining to meet its own computing needs. That includes just figuring out how to implement AI by running field experiments with battle command networks, swarming drones, and other autonomous systems. At last year’s Autonomous Warrior 24 in Australia, for instance, as well as similar events stateside, 'they have to bring the supercomputer out to the test site,' Campbell told the conference today. 'The amount of data that has to be pulled off of all of the [test] assets and annotated, that has to be crunched overnight to be able to make sense of what happens, is phenomenal.' RELATED: Don’t blow the budget on ChatGPT: Army CIO sounds alarm on big bills for GenAI As more and more military AI moves from the proving ground to the battleground, Campbell continued, that kind of supercomputing power may become necessary in the warzone as well. While AI can sift inhumanly large amounts of information at superhuman speed, experts warn it can also be 'brittle,' prone to breaking down or producing nonsense results — 'hallucinations' — when exposed to new inputs that are sufficiently different from the data it was trained on. That means AI algorithms can’t be trained once and used indefinitely: They have to be constantly updated and retrained on new data. 'If you encounter something new in the battlefield, you may have to retrain, which then begs the question of, how much do I need in my Forward Operating Base?' Campbell told the conference. 'I may only have hundreds of kilowatts of capability in that Forward Operating Base,' he said, rather than the megawatts required to train and retrain a cutting-edge AI model. To meet future power demands, the Pentagon is looking at smaller, safer nuclear power plants to provide one to five megawatts of power in a compact or even truck-transportable package. But where long-range, high-bandwidth connections are available — and as long as a savvy adversary doesn’t jam them — then forward-deployed forces may be better off referring their AI problems to supercomputing clusters back in the US, Campbell said. That would include not just DoD’s own high-performance computing assets, he emphasized, but the larger capabilities in the private sector. That's where Stargate could come in, providing computing resources beyond the Pentagon's capability. Of course, that assumes Stargate pans out. Within a day of OpenAI’s high-profile announcement, which featured newly inaugurated President Trump, no less a figure than Trump ally and multi-billionaire Elon Musk publicly dissed Stargate’s backers, claiming they did not having adequate cash. 'They don’t actually have the money,' he said on his social media network X.com, known before he acquired it as Twitter. 'SoftBank has well under $10B secured,' Musk said of one of OpenAI’s three major partners on the project. 'I have that on good authority.' OpenAI CEO Sam Altman promptly shot back that Musk was 'wrong,' while the CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, said 'I’m good for my $80 billion.' But a close reading of the Stargate press conference at the White House suggests the partners did scramble to quintuple an initial $100 billion proposal in just a few weeks, under pressure from Trump. 'Mr. President, last month, I came to celebrate your winning and promised that we will invest $100 billion,' said Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son. 'And you told me, ‘Oh, Masa, go for $200!’ Now I came back with $500 because, because this is the — as you said yesterday — this is the beginning of golden age of America.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/openais-500b-stargate-project-could-aid-pentagons-own-ai-efforts-official-says/	2025-01-23T13:11:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240919_DVIDS_northcom_computer_8201957-scaled-e1726767561824.jpg

Fearing US ‘hostility,’ Russia could ‘escalate early’ in a space conflict: RAND	Russian President Vladimir Putin delivers a speech during his visit at the Vostochny cosmodrome on April 12, 2022. (Photo by Yevgeny Biyatov/Sputnik/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Russia's 'inflated' fears of a potential US first strike in space, as well as Moscow's increasing 'risk tolerance' present challenges to US efforts to keep the peace in the heavens, a new Space Force-commissioned think tank study finds. The study published today by RAND, 'Emerging Factors for U.S.-Russia Crisis Stability in Space' authored by summer associate Cheyenne Tretter, further warns US policymakers and diplomats that Russia's 'relative restraint' regarding the space domain in the conflict in the Ukraine war should not be expected in any future conflict in the West. RAND's research work was commissioned by the Space Force's Chief Strategy &amp; Resourcing Officer Lt. Gen. Shawn Bratton, and was conducted within the RAND Project AIR FORCE Strategy and Doctrine Program as part of its fiscal year 2023 project, 'Crisis Stability in Space.' The key problem, the study finds, is that Moscow's hyper-suspicious view of US military intentions in space are driving Russia's military to a more aggressive and hair-trigger stance, but also raising barriers to bilateral communications aimed at ratcheting down conflict risks and/or finding ways to de-escalate once a crisis is underway. 'Russia's fears about U.S. incentives for early escalation in the space domain and perceptions of U.S. hostility heighten the potential for misperceptions of U.S. actions in space. Russia's emerging approach to escalation management—a cost-imposition strategy based on the belief that escalation can be controlled—might further reinforce perceived incentives to escalate early,' the study states. Indeed, there is a school of thought among Russian analysts that is highly concerned about US threats to the space-based elements of Moscow's nuclear deterrent and the possibility that Washington plans to use space to conduct a disarming attack to deprive Russia of its retaliatory capability, the study adds. The author makes two key recommendations:	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/fearing-us-hostility-russia-could-escalate-early-in-a-space-conflict-rand/	2025-01-23T09:37:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240917_putin_rocket_GettyImages-1239929978-scaled-e1726593428608.jpg
UK unveils first locally built Boxer armored vehicle	The $6.15 billion UK Boxer 8&#215;8 armored vehicle program, covers the acquisition of 623 vehicles (Breaking Defense) IAV 2025 — The UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) unveiled the first British-manufactured 8&#215;8 Boxer armoured vehicle at Defence iQ’s International Armoured Vehicle (IAV) conference in Farnborough this week, the first time in over a decade the UK has locally produced an armored vehicle. Minister for Defence Procurement and Industry, Maria Eagle MP announced the news on Tuesday, claiming it to be the 'leading Boxer variant currently in the market' and suggesting British-manufactured Boxers could be made available for international customers in the future. Made by RBSL, which is a joint venture between Germany's Rheinmetall and the UK's BAE Systems, and under licence from the ARTEC consortium of KNDS and Rheinmetall, Boxer vehicles are being constructed for the British Army’s Mechanised Infantry Vehicle (MIV) program of record. The MIV is a £5 billion ($6.15 billion) program with a requirement for 623 platforms. In 2023, the then Conservative government said that it had allocated funding for 1,016 vehicles from a total requirement of 1,305. The UK MoD did not respond to a request for comment on current vehicle projections at the time of publication. Variants on order from the UK include infantry carrier, specialist carrier, command post carrier and an ambulance type. 'Boxer is the mould for the types of partnerships we want to build through the forthcoming strategic defense review [due to be published later in 2025],' Eagle stated before confirming defense partners manufacturing in the UK is a 'win-win' solution. The news follows comments made at IAV in 2024 by MoD officials who voiced frustration with Boxer manufacturers regarding supply chain delays. Local manufacturing of Boxer in the UK falls in line with the Anglo-German 'Trinity House Agreement on Defence' signed in October 2024 which encouraged bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Drive units and mission modules are being manufactured in Telford and Stockport with support from KNDS UK. Platforms are expected to enter service by the end of 2030 with a first batch of Boxers comprising 540 platforms, RBSL officials confirmed to Breaking Defense. UK manufacturing facilities are also expecting to build additional bridging, artillery and mortar Boxer variants in the future. Martyn Williams, Senior Responsible Officer, Mechanised Infantry Programme &amp; Director Boxer Strategic Pipeline said in a statement: 'The first UK-manufactured Boxer rolling off the production line is a landmark moment for the British Army and Defence in delivering Boxer and restoring full Armoured Fighting Vehicle manufacture back into the UK. 'It also reflects a strong partnership between the UK and Germany under the Trinity House agreement. This milestone exemplifies the upcoming Defence Industrial Strategy as we deliver world-class military vehicles whilst driving prosperity and growth across the UK.’ The Boxer displayed at IAV featured Kongsberg’s RS4 remote weapon station although a 12.7mm weapon system was not integrated on the vehicle. The British Army is also considering integration of the larger RS6 remote weapon station in the future, equipped with a 30mm cannon. According to Will Gibby, managing director of RBSL, the local build of Boxer is the first time the UK has manufactured an armoured vehicle since the Terrier armoured engineering vehicle by BAE Systems. That vehicle's production line in Newcastle, England, was shutdown in 2013 after orders came to a halt. Speaking to Breaking Defense at IAV, Gibby confirmed RBSL has manufactured a total of four Boxers to date with another four currently undergoing factory acceptance tests. An additional 48 platforms are scheduled to be manufactured over the course of 2025 in command post, special carrier, ambulance and infantry carrier variants, he added. Gibby also explained how RBSL is 'looking at capacity [to support] international pipelines', similar to Boxer vehicles being manufactured in Australia and destined for service in the German Armed Forces. 'We want to increase and develop new variants in the UK,' he added before referencing opportunities in Germany via the Trinity House agreement as well as potential sales into the Middle East. According to an MoD statement provided to Breaking Defense, the Boxer is an 'all terrain, highly protected armoured fighting vehicle that can be rapidly adapted to suit various military missions, roles and scenarios across many theatres of operations.' 'The purpose of Boxer is to rapidly transport soldiers and mission systems to and around the battlefield, enabling them to conduct their special-to-arm roles. In addition, Boxers can be rapidly reconfigured, meaning that through its life, its capabilities can evolve,' the statement added. The UK’s Boxer variant is derived from a series of lessons learned from similar designs adopted by Australia, Germany, Lithuania and the Netherlands. The British Army's ambition of delivering a warfighting division by 2030 is based around the delivery and entry into service of Boxer, new Challenger 3 main battle tanks and Ajax armored fighting vehicles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/uk-unveils-first-locally-built-boxer-armored-vehicle/	2025-01-23T08:33:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-23-at-10.12.35-e1737637603661.png
LCS-10 to be first ship this year suited with lethality, survivability upgrade	USS Gabrielle Giffords in the South China Sea in 2020. (US Navy photo.) WASHINGTON — The Littoral Combat Ship Gabrielle Giffords (LCS-10) will be the first in the class to receive a series of upgrades this year focused on improving the ship class' lethality and survivability, according to the Navy officer overseeing the program. US Navy Capt. JJ Murawski told attendees last week at the annual Surface Navy Association symposium that the upgrade package, formally called LCS Lethality and Survivability, will initially only be installed onboard Independence-class variants. Murawski said that the second phase of the program will consider installing the package on Freedom-class variants but that funding has not yet been programmed into the future years. The upgrades include integrating the Naval Strike Missile onto the ship, installing a version of the service's electronic warfare program dubbed SEWIP Lite and a decoy-launching system called Nulka. The upgrade also includes a new common combat management system. The Navy's fiscal 2025 budget justification documents state the service will upgrade ships in the order they are scheduled for regular maintenance, meaning that Manchester (LCS-14) and Charleston (LCS-18) should also receive the upgrades in FY25. Lockheed Martin is the prime contractor working with the Navy to install the capabilities onboard the Littoral Combat Ships. While not formally listed as part of the L&amp;S program in the service's budget documents, some LCS have recently been spotted with the company's Mk 70 Payload Delivery Systems, a vertical launching system that allows the ship to expands the portfolio of missiles the ship can employ.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/lcs-10-to-be-first-ship-this-year-suited-with-lethality-survivability-upgrade/	2025-01-23T07:52:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/Giffords-e1640100556837-scaled.jpg
As Trump orders troops, airlift assets to border, long-term impact is unclear	US Army Reserve soldiers receive an overview of Washington D.C. as part of the 4th Annual Day with the Army Reserve May 25, 2016. The event was led by the Private Public Partnership office. (U.S. Army/Sgt. 1st Class Marisol Walker) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is sending 1,000 Army soldiers and 500 Marines to the Southern border, alongside military aircraft as the Pentagon moves out on its new orders to bolster its presence near Mexico. 'This is just the beginning,' Acting Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses wrote in an announcement. 'In short order, the department will develop and execute additional missions in cooperation with DHS [the Department of Homeland Security], federal agencies, and state partners to address the full range of threats outlined by the President at our nation’s borders.' There are already roughly 2,500 military personnel along the border supporting the US Customs and Border Protection mission, so today's announcement brings the total up to around 4,000 troops deployed on American soil. Following the announcement, a senior defense official and military official briefed reporters in the Pentagon on the plan. Those additional troops are already enroute, they said, and will be helping out with the ongoing missions and emplacing barriers. Aircraft including C-130s and C-17s are also on their way to help deport individuals being detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Other assets, such as drones, are also under consideration to be sent to the border, the senior military official added, as are additional troops. Several news outlets have reported that the number of personnel could soar towards 10,000, but the military official said no final decision has been made yet. Pentagon leaders have not yet had to pull troops away from other missions outside of the US for this one or trade future mission readiness, the military official added. However, if the Trump administration decides additional personnel are needed along the Southwest border, that may become a factor for consideration, the military official added. Today’s announcement comes as Trump begins enacting a series of campaign promises. Just hours after being sworn in as the 47th president on Monday, for example, he issued a presidential action declaring a national emergency on the Southern border and then an executive action calling on the Pentagon to clarify the military’s role 'protecting the territorial integrity of the United States.' In that order, he gave the secretary of defense 10 days to deliver a Unified Command Plan tasking US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) with the border mission. Then, following delivery of that plan, NORTHCOM head Gen. Gregory Guillot will be given an additional 30 days to craft a commander’s estimate of just what it will take to seal the border. 'President Trump directed action from the Department of Defense on securing our nation’s borders and made clear he expects immediate results. That is exactly what our military is doing under his leadership,' Salesses wrote in his memo.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/as-trump-orders-troops-airlift-assets-to-border-long-term-impact-is-unclear/	2025-01-22T16:50:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Pentagon-for-Aerojet-Rocketdyne-AUSA-2023.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: Viasat bid protest at heart of DoD investigation of SDA head Tournear	Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear (R) addresses the audience at the Space Foundation's 2024 Space Symposium. (Space Foundation) WASHINGTON — While the Department of the Air Force has not revealed the impetus behind its unusual Jan. 16 announcement that Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear has been placed on administrative leave, Breaking Defense has learned that the move is related to an ongoing bid protest by Viasat over an recent SDA contract award. According to several sources involved, Tournear allegedly stepped afoul of DoD contracting procedures in the runup to SDA's Aug. 16 award of two prototype agreements worth approximately $424 million in total to York Space Systems and Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems, a subsidiary of Terran Orbital, out of a field of eight competitors. For the award, each contractor was tasked with building 10 Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) – Gamma variant prototype space vehicles. (Terran Orbital was bought by Lockheed Martin in October.) SDA has explained that the Gamma satellites will not be part of the operational Transport Layer of data relay satellites, but instead are related to the agency's efforts to develop fire control capabilities for missile defense and the experimental FOO Fighter program. Viasat protested the award in September in the US Court of Federal Claims, alleging its offering was unfairly weighted and that its competitors were improperly given a helping hand in the bid process. The protest has resulted in a re-evaluation of the awards by the Department of the Air Force and SDA. The exact nature of Tournear's purported misstep is unclear, as is its precise relation to the protest case. He is not named in publicly available court documents reviewed by Breaking Defense, nor has there been any public indication that Tournear is being accused of any criminal violation of the Procurement Integrity Act, which lays out ethical constraints for federal government officials involved in buying goods and services. The Defense Department implements the act through the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), directives related to ethics and acquisition. Compliance is overseen by individual DoD agencies and the military departments that hold procurement authorities. An SDA spokesperson referred all questions to the Department of the Air Force. An Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Tuesday that the department had 'no releasable information' as to the reason for Tournear's administrative leave. The decision to place Tournear on administrative leave while an investigation is undertaken was made by then-Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli, the Air Force spokesperson said. Calvelli today declined to comment for this report. Viasat did not respond to request for comment about the proposed relook of the contract awards; both York and Lockheed Martin declined to comment and referred questions to SDA. A number of key members of Congress were also briefed on the issue, sources said, but the Hill has been basically silent about the issue despite long-standing support for SDA and Tournear personally among House and Senate Armed Services and Appropriations Committees. 'The Committee was informed that Dr. Derek Tournear has been placed on investigative administrative leave pending the results of an investigation. While this process plays out, we expect the Space Force and SDA will continue to fulfill its vital mission,' a HASC spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Tuesday. While the decision to sideline an official was not necessarily out of line with DoD precedent, the move to publicize the decision via a Department of the Air Force press release was highly irregular, according to a handful of former and current government officials and long-time industry players. And that has raised speculation about the possibility of politics at play as the change-over in administration begins. Two observers with no skin in the game called the timing of the announcement, coming on the last working day at the Pentagon before President Donald Trump's inauguration, 'suspicious.' It is an open secret in industry circles that Tournear was being considered for a role under the Trump administration, with sources saying he had been in the running for Calvelli's post — and, according to one source close to the deliberations, also was a contender for replacing Frank Kendall as Air Force secretary. (Trump on Jan. 16 nominated the second-in-command at the National Reconnaissance Office, Troy Meink, for the SecAF job.) Both Kendall and Calvelli were appointed by President Joe Biden but also have had long careers in government under administrations of both political stripes, and both had voiced a willingness to stay on in the second Trump Pentagon. Tournear was named SDA director in 2019, under the first Trump administration. Viasat's Sept. 23 protest was filed in claims court rather than with the Government Accountability Office because the award for prototypes was made under Other Transaction Authority, rather than the FAR, which governs acquisition of major DoD programs of record. The lawsuit alleges that SDA unfairly overvalued the bids from Tyvak and, in particular, York, while undervaluing Viasat's offer. Further, Viasat made a claim that SDA gave assistance that could be read as potentially unethical to its competitors. 'Indeed, SDA provided detailed comments to both Tyvak and York on how they could improve their proposals. Also, during their in-person negotiations meeting, SDA spoon-fed Tyvak the exact change it needed to make to receive an award,' according to a court filing by Viasat. On Dec. 2, the US Attorney General's office filed a document with the court saying that the Defense Department and SDA intend to take 'corrective action' regarding the award, including re-evaluating the bids. According to the document, the initial corrective option offered by DoD and SDA would: The document further stated that 'SDA will also mitigate any issues arising from ex parte communications between SDA personnel and bidders before establishment of the competitive range.' One of the ways a federal procurement official can violate the Procurement Integrity Act is by providing 'inside information' to one bidder that is not available to others. The government filing explained that should the re-evaluation result in a decision to re-award York and Tyvak, then SDA will 'lift the stay' on the current OTA awards, and issue any modifications deemed necessary. And if the decision is instead to make an award to another firm, then one or the other of the current awards would be terminated and a new one to the new vendor issued. The government on Jan. 3 provided the court with an update on SDA's corrective action plans, but the details were put under seal. A further update is due on Jan. 27. So, it's possible that a different course of action could be taken with regard to re-evaluating the earlier awards; for example, only re-evaluating one of the winners as opposed to both.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/exclusive-viasat-bid-protest-at-heart-of-dod-investigation-of-sda-head-tournear/	2025-01-22T13:32:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240411_space_symposium_tournear_space_foundation-e1712859283861.jpg
Japan inks deal with Shield AI for sea-based V-BAT drones	Civilian contractors embarked with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit conduct a V-BAT drone flight at Colonel Ernesto Rabina Air Base, Tarlac, Philippines, Oct. 4, 2022. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Manuel Alvarado) WASHINGTON — The Japanese navy has agreed to buy an undisclosed number of V-BAT drones from American firm Shield AI, bolstering the service’s sea-based awareness through what the company claims is Tokyo’s first maritime-based intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform. Inked as a direct commercial sale, the deal announced by Shield AI today does not include expected quantities or dollar values. The firm expects to deliver the first of the vertical takeoff and landing V-BATs 'later this year' as part of 'a planned multi-year buy' for the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF), a company spokesperson told Breaking Defense. 'Japan is a vital ally in the Indo-Pacific and critical to regional deterrence efforts, and this partnership strengthens Japan's ability to respond effectively to crises and ensures they are equipped with a reliable and proven platform for maritime ISR missions,' Shield AI President Brandon Tseng said in a company press release. The drone buy, which Shield AI claims will yield the first ship-launched ISR platform for the JMSDF, underscores an increased focus on the seas by Japan amid rising tensions with China. According to the company spokesperson, the V-BAT specifically is 'the first-ever Group 3 ship-based ISR platform that was awarded following a competition for procurement (i.e., not a company owned/company operated (COCO) deployment).' Shield AI has been marketing the V-BAT after acquiring the rights to the drone by buying a company called Martin UAV in 2021. The V-BAT drone has been selected by the US Coast Guard for maritime surveillance and has reportedly proved effective against dense electromagnetic warfare waged on the battlefield in Ukraine. The V-BAT now will even be manufactured abroad after Shield AI recently announced a joint venture with the Indian company JSW Group to build the drone in India. Shield AI currently manufactures the V-BAT at its production facilities in Dallas, Texas. The deal with the JMSDF announced today includes a partnership with an undisclosed 'local entity,' the company spokesperson said, though they noted that the drones will still be produced on American soil.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/japan-inks-deal-with-shield-ai-for-sea-based-v-bat-drones/	2025-01-22T13:18:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/v-bat-scaled-e1737578082522.jpg
Israel’s Chief of Staff Halevi resigns over Oct. 7 failure	Israeli army chief Herzi Halevi attends a ceremony marking Memorial Day for fallen soldiers of Israel's wars and victims of attacks at Jerusalem's Mount Herzl military cemetery on May 13, 2024. (Photo by GIL COHEN-MAGEN / POOL / AFP) (Photo by GIL COHEN-MAGEN/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) JEURSALEM — Chief of Staff of the Israel Defense Forces Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi announced his resignation in a Tuesday letter to Israeli Minister of Defense Israel Katz. Halevi will be leaving his role on March 6, meaning he will leave his command after the first phase of the recent hostage and ceasefire deal with Hamas, which began Sunday and is expected to last 40 days. 'I informed the Minister of Defense today (Tuesday) that by virtue of my recognition of my responsibility for the IDF's failure on October 7th, and at a time when the IDF has significant achievements and is in the process of implementing the agreement to release our hostages, I have requested to leave my role,' he said in a statement. 'Until then, I will complete the IDF’s inquiries into the events of October 7th and strengthen the IDF's readiness for security challenges.' Katz accepted the resignation and noted that he expressed appreciation for Halevi. Katz thanked Halevi 'for his contribution to the IDF throughout his years of service as a fighter and commander, and for his part in the IDF's great achievements in the difficult war that was forced upon us,' according to a statement from his office. Katz promised an orderly succession process in the coming month and a half. The selection of a chief of staff can be a complex process, and in the midst of an ongoing multi-front war in a politically charged atmosphere with ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, Israel’s leaders will have to scramble to complete the process. Halevi is the highest-ranking officer to resign over the Oct. 7 debacle in which more than 1,000 Israelis were killed and 250 taken hostage. Other officers who have resigned due to the conflict include the head of IDF Military Intelligence Maj. Gen. Haliva, who left in April 2024, saying he would always carry the pain of the war; Brig. Gen. Avi Rosenfeld, the head of the Gaza Division which was tasked with defending the border on Oct. 7, who resigned in June; and the head of the IDF’s Southern Command Maj. Gen. Yaron Finkelman who resigned Jan. 21, in an announcement that appeared timed with Halevi’s own decision. Further key officials and officers have left or asked to leave, though not in direct connection to Oct. 7. For example, Maj. Gen. Amir Baram, the IDF’s Deputy Chief of Staff had his tenure extended during the war, but asked to end his role in February. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant was fired by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in early November, but not because of failures on Oct. 7. The 23rd chief of staff, Halevi was tapped for the role in September 2022. His appointment was approved in late October 2022 and he assumed his role in January 2023. He came with an illustrious background, having led the Paratrooper’s Brigade during the 2009 war in Gaza and having served as the head of IDF Intelligence and Southern Command. At the time, it was assumed he would face tough tests in the new job because of Israel’s multi-front challenges facing Iranian-backed proxies. Halevi’s resignation was widely expected in circles that follow the IDF. Rumors that he would resign began spreading in the fall of 2024, though the war effort seemed to quiet that idea. Sentiment around his resignation is mixed. For instance, days before his resignation, Israel’s left-leaning Haaretz included an op-ed demanding the 'beleaguered army chief must not resign.' On Tuesday, however, Yaakov Katz, author of 'Israel vs. Iran: The Shadow War' and a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, wrote on X that 'IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi finally did what he should have done months ago — taken responsibility for the failures that led to October 7. His resignation will have political consequences but they are secondary. What’s important is the message he is sending to troops — the IDF code is based on personal accountability.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/israels-chief-of-staff-halevi-resigns-over-oct-7-failure/	2025-01-22T12:21:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/GettyImages-2152178444-scaled-e1737571629216.jpg
Army kickstarts possible recompete of Microsoft’s $22 billion IVAS production deal	The Army recently received the new IVAS 1.2 prototype for a series of tests. (US Army) WASHINGTON — The US Army is taking the next step in recompeting its multi-billion dollar mixed-reality goggle production contract with an official ask to industry to send in viable options. The service published its new Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next request for information today, giving interested companies until Feb. 26 to respond with their solutions for the combat-suitable heads-up display. 'IVAS provides soldiers and squads a single platform for increased lethality, mobility, and situational awareness necessary to achieve overmatch against current and future adversaries,' the Army wrote in the release. 'It is a ‘fight first’ system with the benefit of rehearse and train capabilities.' While the RFI doesn’t guarantee the service will recompete its current 10-year production contract with Microsoft valued up to $22 billion, it does kickstart such a process after surveying the market last year. Microsoft did not immediately respond to questions about the new RFI today but has previously said it will throw its hat in the ring. Anduril founder Palmer Luckey has also teased development of a new mixed-reality device, though it is not clear if this would be a partnership with Microsoft. Massachusetts-based Kopin has also said it's interested in completing, while companies like Palantir may also be eyeing a bid. One industry source closely following the program welcomed today’s RFI, saying it signals that the Army is ready for a new approach and has seen 'competitive/superior' technology on the market and is ready to move forward. Initially pitched as a game changer for the service, the current IVAS contract is based around Microsoft’s HoloLens 2 heads-up display. The idea was a single device soldiers could use both in combat (including under the cover of darkness) and for virtual training. However, reports began emerging in 2021 about problems with the device, followed by a scathing Pentagon inspector general report that detailed soldiers complaining of discomfort, dizziness, nausea, and system reliability. Service leaders publicly stood behind the program at first, before they began tempering expectations and splitting the program up into three initial versions — the 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 iterations of the goggles. (The service has acquired 5,000 1.0 units, with plans to acquire an additional 5,000 1.1 units for limited use.) It then billed the new 1.2 version as the make-or-break upgrade — an iteration to correct past problems, in part, by transitioning the device from a helmet-like display with a 70-degree field-of-view, to a hinged, flat design with a 60-degree field-of-view that soldiers can flip up. But while the service worked with Microsoft on the redesign and testing, it also began teasing an IVAS Next initiative. After attending Army-led industry days and one-on-one meetings with the government last year, a trio of industry sources independently told Breaking Defense they were preparing for a new open competition to decide who wins a lucrative contract to produce the headset. In tandem, Army leaders began taking inventory of all of their night vision devices to help decide just which units need what and help define IVAS Next requirements for an upcoming competition, one service official told Breaking Defense last year. Specifically, members of the from the 75th Ranger Regiment were tasked with running IVAS 1.2 through the ringer alongside dedicated night vision systems like the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENGV-B) and another system dubbed PVS-14, the official told Breaking Defense. 'They’re going to provide the best feedback in terms of, here’s what the ENGV-B can provide versus a PVS-14 versus the capability inside of IVAS,' the official said. The goal is for those Rangers to provide a 'more mature look' at how they use night vision while also answering questions about the ideal IVAS form factor, battery needs and more.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-kickstarts-possible-recompete-of-microsofts-22-billion-ivas-production-deal/	2025-01-22T12:04:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/7941063-scaled-e1691079418376.jpg
Trump says Europe should pay more for Ukraine. What if they bankrolled American weapons?

(Photo by Ignacio Marin/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON and BELFAST — In his first public comments on Ukraine since taking office, President Donald Trump said last night that he was still evaluating whether the United States will continue military support to Kyiv, but either way, Europe will need to step up its own contributions. But could more European defense spending mean investment in American weapons? 'We’ll look into that,' Trump said when asked whether the US would turn off the tap of weaponry to Ukraine. 'We’re talking to [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy. We’re going to be talking with President [Vladimir] Putin very soon. And we’ll see how it all happens. We’re going to look at it very soon. One thing I do feel, the European Union should be paying a lot more than they’re paying.' 'The European Union should equalize,' he added. 'We’re in there for $200 billion more than the European Union. I mean, what are we, stupid? I guess the answer is yes. Because they must think so.' Figures from the Kiel Institute, a German think tank, indicate that from the start of the conflict through to October 2024, the US lagged behind Europe on spending for Ukraine, by $37.5 billion. Even so, US spending is hugely significant and uncertainty leaves Kyiv waiting with baited breath for what the White House will do. But as recently as last week, an outgoing senior US official told reporters that there were people on Trump's team who supported continuing military support for Ukraine — if there was a way to save the US taxpayer from bearing the brunt of it. The now-former official offered a pitch that seems at first brush very on-brand for Trump: Call on Europe to pay for American support. The idea is that Trump can continue authorizing drawdowns of in-stock US military equipment such as munitions, vehicles and small drones, allowing the speedy transfer of materiel to Kyiv and sustaining pressure on Russia, the official said. But instead of using US funds to backfill Defense Department stocks, Trump can get European allies to foot the bill — a solution that benefits US defense contractors without raising the ire of voters who are skeptical of additional financial support to Ukraine. 'You get to go out and say, we're continuing to support Ukraine, and the Europeans are paying for it,' said the official. 'The Europeans have the cash. They don't have the stuff. That's the problem, is they've run their stocks down, and they don't have anywhere near the production capacity. … It's going to have to be the American defense industry who is continuing to power the fight, if Ukraine is going to stay in it.' Whether such an idea is feasible is unclear. Analysts Breaking Defense spoke with broadly agreed that US pressure could force European countries to bankroll additional military aid packages for Ukraine, but not all believe that US defense firms would be the major beneficiary of those deals due to global industrial base vulnerabilities and political pressures for Europe to fund domestic suppliers. 'It might not normally be realistic, but if the alternative is a cutoff of American support, then it becomes far more of a possibility,' said Jacob Parakilas, research leader for defense strategy, policy and capabilities at RAND Europe. 'As a function of geography and history, European nations — especially those on Europe's eastern flank — are more likely to see Russia's invasion of Ukraine in more existential terms than the US. So while the idea of sending money to a much richer ally in order to buy weapons for a third party might not pass the laugh test under normal circumstances, if the alternative is ceding victory to Russia, it might well become politically feasible (depending of course on exact terms and various other details).' Guntram Wolff, senior fellow at Bruegel, a Belgian based economics think tank, said that Europeans would have to 'step up their support of Ukraine if the United States wasn't there,' but also stressed that the size of the US defense industrial base poses a fundamental problem for the bankrolling idea floated by the senior official. 'People are starting to understand in Europe that the US defense industrial base would be way too small to rely on in case of peer conflict,' he explained. 'I think there's a strong sense emerging, I hope at least, that, Europe must further develop its domestic' industrial base. Wolff also said that when production of select weapon systems are considered, European output outpaces the US. 'If you take artillery shells for example, Europe is producing more,' he shared. 'My understanding is, even in the area of tanks, Europe is producing more than the United States, which still has relatively small capacities&#8230;.there's no reason to believe that Europeans cannot further increase their domestic production in other weapon systems, and that includes, of course, air defense missiles,' which Ukraine continues to plead with military aid partners to deliver urgently. Tim Lawrenson, a European defense expert, said that without having insight to the thinking of 'prime ministers and presidents' across Europe, it is difficult to offer a perspective on how realistic the European bankrolling US military aid for Ukraine plan might be, but it would certainly play into a narrative, striking a chord with 'some parts of Europe,' that Trump will work from a 'transactional approach' regarding transatlantic relations. The White House did not immediately return a request for comment. Trump has been critical of US aid to Ukraine and has repeatedly said that he would stop the war by brokering a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, raising concerns in Kyiv that it could be forced to accept unfavorable terms. However, since the start of the new year, there have been signs that the administration is not going to rush into a settlement right away. Two Trump advisers told Reuters last week that the administration now believes it may take months or even longer to negotiate an agreement. In a Truth Social post today, Trump threatened to impose tariffs and sanctions on Russia if Putin does not come to the negotiating table. Pete Hegseth, Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, has shed little light on what the Pentagon’s approach on Ukraine will be under his leadership. In written responses made in advance of his nomination hearing on Tuesday last week, Hegseth said he would 'ensure that the Department of Defense plays a key role in the whole-of government effort to support the President’s Special Envoy for Ukraine-Russia' but did not directly answer questions about whether the Pentagon should continue providing security assistance to Kyiv. During the hearing, Hegseth said he would provide his 'best guidance' to Trump matters such as Ukraine, but did not elaborate. RELATED: SASC pushes forward Hegseth's nomination for defense secretary Whether Congress moves forward with additional Ukraine funds will likely be determined by Trump’s approach, Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican on the House Appropriations defense subcommittee, told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. 'It's going to be up to President Trump, what he wants to do. He obviously wants to try to end this war, which obviously we would all like to happen,' he said. 'What I am convinced is that President Trump will not allow — not allow — Ukraine to be another Afghanistan.'

Goldwater-Nichols do-over? Mitchell Institute calls to reinstate service chief’s acquisition powers	A F-35B fighter jet assigned to Marine Medium Tiltrotor Squadron (VMM) 262 (Reinforced) lands aboard amphibious assault carrier USS Tripoli (US Navy) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department has been unable to adequately prepare for great power competition with Russia and China due in large part to the inability of service chiefs to prioritize funding and other resources away from today's needs to those of tomorrow, argues a new policy paper from the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. It's a problem that would require a significant restructuring of the Pentagon chain of command and one that the institute calls on the incoming Trump administration — no stranger to pursuing big changes — to fix. 'Deficiencies of the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Reform Act (GNA) are a root cause of under-resourcing our critical warfighting forces. This legislation restructured the DOD, resulting in a bureaucratic structure that severely restricts the ability of the services to prioritize long-term strategic threats in favor of the immediate, non-combat demands of the combatant commands and civilian defense bureaucracy. Consequently, there is a pervasive pattern within the military of neglect of long-term defense procurement strategies and requirements,' the paper, 'A Call for a New NSC-68 and Goldwater Nichols Reform,' states. In addition, the paper argues, 'organizational misallocation of priority is not only limited to short- versus long- term planning needs but also service equities.' The result has been that the Pentagon has not been able to properly fun its pivot to the Indo-Pacific theater, which the paper asserts requires a shift in resources from the Army to the Air Force, Space Force and the Navy. 'Instead, the service shares of the defense budget remain static, and DOD’s leadership continues to approve Army investments in duplicative capabilities — for example, the Army’s $60 – 70 million-a-shot long-range surface-to-surface missiles for long-range strikes, which the Air Force could conduct with far more cost-effective capabilities,' the paper says. The key to fixing the short- vs. long-term priorities problem is 'repositioning the service chiefs within the chain of command while taking steps to preserve the ability of U.S. forces to conduct joint operations.' Service chiefs need to be able to set future requirements and ensure that funding is allocated to fulfill those requirements with kit and personnel resources, the paper elaborates. The authors — Richard Andres, Mitchell non-resident senior fellow, along with retired Air Force generals Michael Moseley and Larry Stutzriem — further maintain another reason for the failure to reformulate US forces to face peer competitors is stultification and inefficiencies caused by 'over centralization' of the Office of Secretary of Defense (OSD). 'A full-scale review of the array of bureaucracies connected with OSD should be accomplished with an eye to shifting missions and authorities toward the services. Emphasis should be placed on enabling strategic decision-making that prioritizes the acquisition of capabilities based on an honest assessment of cost-per-effect and the deployment of forces geared toward addressing the challenges of great power competition,' the paper says. The paper makes four recommendations:	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/goldwater-nichols-do-over-mitchell-institute-calls-to-reinstate-service-chiefs-acquisition-powers/	2025-01-22T06:08:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/7394130-scaled-e1692372210861.jpg
Philippines to increase FA-50 fighter fleet, among moves analysts say complicate planning in Beijing	Two Philippine Air Force FA-50PHs in the 2024 US-Philippine joint Maritime Cooperative Activity in the West Philippine Sea. (Philippine Air Force) SYDNEY — The Philippines has decided to double the size of its FA-50 light fighter fleet, reportedly buying another 12 from South Korea, in a move that analysts told Breaking Defense won't get China off Manila's back but could complicate Beijing's plans. The additional fighters represent a significant leap in capability for the vast island archipelago, two analysts told Breaking Defense, but they are unlikely to pose a serious threat to China's most advanced fighters, such as the J-20. China has persistently and often daringly pressed Philippine forces to try and dislodge them from the Thomas and Sabina Shoals and other features in the South China Sea to which it lays claim. In addition to any complications for China, the purchase from South Korea's KAI, following an initial $420 million order placed in 2014, even more closely binds the Philippines to another US ally and highlights the costs to China of its bullying. 'This purchase marks a significant departure from past policy which allowed the Philippine Air Force capability to wither in the post-Cold War years. It marks a policy failure for China as well: the exercise of adversarial grey zone tactics with the maritime militia and coast guard as the vanguard for Chinese sharp power, has effectively backfired,' John Blaxland, head of The Australian National University's Washington office and China expert, wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. He said that, despite past concessions from the Philippines to China, 'persistent PRC assertiveness has generated growing Philippine resolve to push back and to work more closely with other like-minded powers, other US treaty allies, including not only Korea, but Japan and Australia, and the United States itself.' Blaxland added, 'The increased cooperation with South Korea is significant &#8230; but we shouldn't read too much into it. After all Korea is going through an unprecedented political upheaval that could lead to a significant shift in foreign and defense policy priorities for Korea.' In terms of the aircraft's technical capabilities, Malcolm Davis, a China defense expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense the FA-50 is 'a capable lightweight fighter, and if flown by a well trained pilot, would certainly pose a challenge for the PLAAF's older combat aircraft, or combat support assets such as maritime patrol aircraft, or airborne early warning platforms.' But going up against Chinese fighters such as the J-16, J-20 or J-35 would be problematic. 'At the moment they are only equipped with within visual range missiles, so the Chinese have a significant &#8216;first look, first shot, first kill' advantage. As the FA-50 is upgraded in the future, with AESA radars, and BVR [Beyond Visual Range] missiles, that advantage should become less apparent,' Davis wrote in an email. All this raises the bigger question, will China curtail or halt its persistent attempts to claim waters to which a UN tribunal ruled it has no valid claim? 'China will be watching closely to see if the purchase of these aircraft affect Philippine policy towards defense of their interests in the South China Sea,' Blaxland wrote. It will be years before that's known, 'as it will take time for the aircraft to turn up and crews to be fully trained and prepared to use them.' But he also said he thinks the purchase is especially important because the Philippines Air Force 'has long been one of the weakest in the region. Its capability is less than that that which defended the country during the Pacific War in 1942. So this additional capability is a significant leap, but from a low base and China likely won't be overly intimidated by this.' Davis also opined that he doubted the PLAAF will change their operational posture much as a result of the PAF getting another squadron of FA-50s. 'They may rotate some of the older aircraft (i.e. older J-10s, J-11s or Su-30s) away in favor of deploying newer platforms, but I'd say their overall day-to-day readiness and (force) posture will remain in place,' he wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/philippines-to-increase-fa-50-fighter-fleet-among-moves-analysts-say-complicate-planning-in-beijing/	2025-01-22T00:45:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Image-1.jpeg
India joins Eurodrone effort as observer nation	The Eurodrone MALE RPAS on display at the Berlin Air Show 2024 (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — Europe’s Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) today welcomed India to the multinational Eurodrone aircraft program, becoming the second Asia-Pacific country behind Japan to receive observer status. The agency said in a statement that Joachim Sucker, Director of OCCAR-Executive Administration (EA), had formally delivered the observer nation Letter of Approval to the Indian Embassy in Berlin. 'The OCCAR-EA Director congratulated the Government of India (GoI) on committing to commence this special relationship and expressed his hope that this first step will lead to a long, fruitful and mutually beneficial cooperation,' it added. OCCAR oversees a number of high profile European defense projects including the A400M Atlas airlifter, Boxer armored utility vehicle, Tiger attack helicopter and Horizon Mid-life Upgrade (MLU)/FREMM multirole frigates. India initially applied for Eurodrone observer status in August 2024 after Japan joined as an observer in November 2023. An observer nation typically receives access to technical information related to a given platform and can also place orders for it, but unlike full partners does not have a say over aircraft design, development or workshare decisions. The OCCAR statement did not disclose any details about the benefits India will gain, and the agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. India’s interest in Eurodrone builds off a joint statement signed with Germany in October 2024 to deepen defense cooperation and which includes a 'specific focus on technology collaboration, manufacturing/co-production and co-development of defence platforms and equipment.' Valued at an estimated cost of €7 billion ($7.3 billion) and first launched in 2016, the Eurodrone Medium Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Remotely Piloted Air System (RPAS) program, is led by the four partner nations of France, Germany, Italy and Spain. France's Airbus and Dassault along with Italy’s Leonardo comprise the major industry partners. The aircraft is under development to reduce European reliance on non-European solutions like the US MQ-9B. It is designed to support Intelligence, Surveillance, Targeting Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) missions, but has been troubled by delays and rising costs. Last year, a German Armed Forces annual armaments review criticized coordination difficulties between Airbus and Dassault, which it said caused delay to the drone’s preliminary design review. It remains to be seen if a first prototype aircraft flight, scheduled for 2027, will go ahead as planned. The development and production of 20 Eurodrone systems, split between 60 aircraft and 40 ground control stations, is tied to a 'global contract' signed between OCCAR and Airbus in 2022. On its website, OCCAR notes that 'delivery of serial items to PPS [Participating Partner States] is targeted by end of the decade' and the aircraft will become a 'key enabler' for the French, German, Spanish-led Future Combat Air System sixth generation fighter program.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/india-joins-eurodrone-effort-as-observer-nation/	2025-01-21T13:19:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/IMG_0448-1-e1737488658857.jpg
Trump’s Pentagon to begin task of crafting NORTHCOM plan to ‘seal’ US borders	Soldiers and retired Soldiers from the 89th Military Police Brigade participate in and watch the 64th MP Company, 720th MP Battalion, inactivation ceremony Jan. 16th, 2024, at Fort Cavazos, Texas. (U.S. Army photos by Sgt. Alexander Chatoff) WASHINGTON — Fresh into the White House, President Donald Trump has told the Pentagon to reassess its stance on homeland defense and reorient the US Northern Command to 'seal' America's borders. 'I will send troops to the Southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,' he said during his inaugural address on Monday. Hours after being sworn in as the 47th president, Trump began signing a flurry of executive orders and actions, including one presidential action declaring a national emergency on the Southern border and then an executive action calling on the Pentagon to clarify the military’s role 'protecting the territorial integrity of the United States.' In that second one, he gives the Secretary of Defense 10 days to deliver a Unified Command Plan tasking US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) with the border mission. Following delivery of that plan, USNORTHCOM head Gen. Gregory Guillot will have an additional 30 days to craft a commander’s estimate of just what it will take to 'seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States by repelling forms of invasion, including unlawful mass migration, narcotics trafficking, human smuggling and trafficking, and other criminal activities.' Historically NORTHCOM, along with NORAD, has been responsible for air and missile defense in case of an attack on the United States, but the Department of Homeland Defense is normally in charge of border security. The directives come as the Pentagon is temporarily under the leadership of Robert Salesses, formerly a relatively low-level official in an acting secretary of defense role as Fox News host Pete Hegseth’s congressional confirmation proceeds. The Pentagon previously told reporters that it is 'fully committed' to carrying out Trump’s orders. This specific executive order could potentially lead to an influx of troops along the southern border, adding to those already there as part of the Texas National Guard’s Operation Lone Star and the approximate 2,500 soldiers supporting the Customs and Border Patrol mission, according to one military official. A former senior military official told Breaking Defense today that while drafting such a plan is 'doable' in 10 days, it will be the implementation that proves tricky. 'It will likely challenge' the entire department, the former official said, as these 'are major decisions' that will 'require people.' The issue is that NORTHCOM does not have standing forces per se; rather troops are allocated to the command for exercises and any deployments deemed necessary. So shifting personnel from another military service or another combatant command 'is a zero sum game,' meaning that 'someone will have to pay in readiness or future response,' said the former official, speaking candidly on the condition of anonymity. This doesn’t mean that DoD should not shift the personnel, the former military official stressed. DoD’s job at this point is to 'provide options' to fulfill the president’s executive order in the best way possible for the mission and the US military. Interestingly, it is Indo-Pacific Command which has the bulk of US military forces within the United States — both along the West Coast and in Alaska. There are different ways to provide troops in an emergency situation: direct military forces to undertake law enforcement duties and thus temporarily override Posse Comitatus via the Insurrection Act of 1807; call up of the National Guard by governors, or use of Title 32 that allows federal activation of the National Guard for emergencies or national disasters with Department of Defense (DoD) covering the cost. Trump’s executive order calls on the secretaries of defense and homeland security to provide within 90 days a report detailing 'the conditions at the southern border of the United States and any recommendations regarding additional actions that may be necessary to obtain complete operational control of the southern border, including whether to invoke the Insurrection Act.' The Insurrection Act allows the president to both federalize the National Guard and call up military troops to restore civilian order and suppress an insurrection or rebellion. There is precedent for use of the Insurrection Act in a civil emergency. In 1992, then-President George H.W. Bush did so in response to the riots in Los Angeles over the acquittal of four police officers involved in the excessive beating of Rodney King. In addition, then-President Dwight Eisenhower used the Insurrection Act to send federal troops to oversee the desegregation of the schools in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957 over the objections of the That said, there are likely to be legal challenges to the president’s order, which may complicate any deployment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trumps-pentagon-to-begin-task-of-crafting-northcom-plan-to-seal-us-borders/	2025-01-21T12:51:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250121_DVIDS_northcom_soldiers_8833051-scaled-e1737492469253.jpg

Israel orders more Iron Dome interceptors, using new tranche of US funding	Rockets launched towards Israel from the northern Gaza Strip and response from the Israeli missile defense system known as the Iron Dome leave streaks through the sky on May 14, 2021 in Gaza City, Gaza. (Photo by Fatima Shbair/Getty Images) JERUSALEM — The Israeli Ministry of Defense said it signed its first procurement deal using a recent tranche of US aid funds to buy more interceptors for Israel’s Iron Dome batteries, one of the three tiers of Israel’s multi-layered air defense systems. It has been used widely in the last 15 months of war on multiple fronts to intercept rockets, drones and other projectiles. The new deal, announced last week with Iron Dome-maker Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, is to expand serial production of the interceptors. Israel Ministry of Defense Director General, Maj. Gen. (Res.) Eyal Zamir said that the signing of the Iron Dome contract 'is a central component in an unprecedented scope of effort, led by the IMOD together with Rafael and other defense industries, for force build-up and strengthening while fighting.' Rafael’s CEO Yoav Tourgeman praised the deal and noted Rafael’s close work with the US Missile Defense Agency. Tourgeman noted that 'the expansion of procurement represents another vote of confidence in the Iron Dome system and its continuously upgrading capabilities in the face of threats, and we at Rafael will continue to work decisively to fulfill our mission of being a significant pillar in the state's security.' Since Hamas's Oct. 7 attack on Israel, Iron Dome has contended with thousands of rockets from Hamas and from Lebanese Hezbollah to the north. It also faced Houthi and Iraqi militia drone threats in which the naval version of Iron Dome, known as C-Dome, was used to defend the coastal city of Eilat. In May2024 the IDF put into service a new Iron Dome battalion. The new contract was signed on Jan. 16. It is the first contract under a new US aid package that was approved by the US Congress in April 2024, the ministry said. That aid amount was for $8.7 billion and the ministry said that it includes a 'dedicated $5.2 billion allocation to strengthen Israel’s air and missile defense systems, including the Iron Dome Defense System, the David’s Sling Weapon System, and the high-powered Laser Defense System, currently in advanced stages of development.' The ministry did not specify how much of the funds would go to Rafael or how many interceptors were being purchased, but it did note that the funds are for a 'significant amount of Iron Dome interceptors.' The contract was signed after talks held by the Israel Missile Defense Organization and the US Missile Defense Agency, as well as Rafael. Iron Dome’s interceptors are produced in Israel and also in the US at a facility in East Camden, Ark., which is part of a partnership between Rafael and Raytheon called R2S. The companies broke ground on that facility in February 2024. 'The Iron Dome system has transformed the battlefield, protected critical infrastructure, and saved many civilian lives. The deal we signed today will further enhance and expand the system's capabilities,' Zamir said in the wake of the new agreement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/israel-orders-more-iron-dome-interceptors-using-new-tranche-of-us-funding/	2025-01-21T09:05:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220113_israel_iron_dome_GettyImages-1232873450-1-scaled-e1642095709377.jpg
Coast Guard’s Fagan, first female service chief, removed by Trump administration	Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan delivers remarks during the commissioning ceremony of U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Calhoun (WMSL 759), April 20, 2024, in North Charleston, South Carolina. (U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Brandon Hillard) WASHINGTON — The new administration quickly moved to fire Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan less than a day after President Donald Trump returned to the White House. A senior Department of Homeland Security official told Breaking Defense Fagan's firing was due to a failure to address border security threats; inadequate leadership in recruitment and retention; mismanagement of key acquisitions; 'excessive' focus on diversity, equity and inclusion policies, and an 'erosion of trust' due to the handling of Operation Fouled Anchor. (Operation Fouled Anchor concerned senior Coast Guard officials accused of covering up accusations of persistent sexual misconduct at the service's academy.) The DHS official also said Vice Commandant Adm. Kevin Lunday would serve as acting chief in the interim. Fox News first reported Fagan's ouster on Tuesday. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., today called Fagan's firing an 'abuse of power' and praised her record as the service's chief, citing improved recruiting numbers and championing the trilateral security agreement ICE Pact, among other things. 'The Commandant's outstanding record completely negates the President's demonstrably false claims and signals his enduring interest to put politics over the best interest of our servicemembers and national security,' he said. In a December interview with Breaking Defense, Fagan stressed she did not want to implement 'an artificial barrier' to serving when asked about rhetoric at that time about banning transgender members of the military. 'There are standards for service in the organization. You need to meet those standards, right?&#8230; You [have] got to have a certain level of fitness to graduate from boot camp,' she said at the time. 'And bringing anyone who has a propensity to serve that meets those standards makes for a more ready, more resilient workplace and work teams.' She declined to comment at that time about the impact mass deportations, something the new administration had been threatening, would have on the Coast Guard. Fagan entered the Coast Guard in 1985. She was nominated and confirmed to become the service's top officer in June 2022, which made her the first woman to lead a military service. Prior to Trump returning to the White House, there had been widespread speculation that the new administration was preparing to fire numerous military officers — most notably, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, who as of publication retains his position — but Fagan is ostensibly the first senior officer to be terminated. The administration announced Monday a slew of civilians taking over in acting positions as service secretaries at the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/coast-guards-fagan-first-female-service-chief-removed-by-trump-administration-reports/	2025-01-21T07:38:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250121_adm_fagan_COAST_GUARD-scaled-e1737473516858.jpg
Aussies announce $163M more for AUKUS initiatives, experts skeptical of ‘substance’	The crew of USS Asheville, a Los Angeles attack submarine during their visit to HMAS Stirling in Western Australia. Credit: Australian government SYDNEY — The Australian defense procurement minister announced today $262 million AUD ($163 million USD) to help the Lucky Country's companies get luckier as it tries to boost its business across the AUKUS enterprise. The new investment is meant to 'support local defence industry uplift and develop Australia’s AUKUS nuclear-powered submarine supply chain,' a Defence Ministry statement said. Specifically, it said the new money would go toward three initiatives: the Defense Industry Development Grants Program designed to give Aussie AUKUS-related businesses a 'timely uplight [in] funding,' the Global Supply Chain Program designed to 'increase Australian participation in trilateral supply chains,' and the Defence Industry Vendor Qualification Program designed to expand and accelerate the introduction of Australian products into American supply chains. Broadly speaking, the ministry statement said the government over the next two years will 'fund a range of initiatives to uplift our local defence industry, supporting around 125 businesses across Australia to invest in their own capabilities to meet the high standards of submarine build and sustainment activities in AUKUS nations.' The $262 million was included in the end of year budget announcement but received little attention. Today's announcement includes a link to a website where companies can register their interest. Three analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense were split on the value of the move, which could be important in building both popular and industry support for AUKUS, often described as a 'generational effort' for Australia as it considers spending some $368 billion to buy at least three US-built Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarines and a small fleet of Australian-built SSN AUKUS boats. 'Today's announcements are of little tangible substance. It's akin to the Australian Government having a ‘concept of a plan’ for pushing the AUKUS concept into another year. It is all good and well to signal commitment to local jobs and economic windfall as a byproduct of a net-security uplift in the Indo-Pacific (for which Australia will continue to prosper), but real actionable evidence is what is needed,' Elizabeth Buchanan, senior fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. 'Cut the steel.' 'The Albanese Government must not continue to treat the Australian public as bystanders in our own security dialogue, and repackaging or dusting off old announcements is borderline offensive. Of the businesses that have since qualified (a handful) there is limited evidence of their steps to become fully integrated into the US and/or UK supply chain. Instead, we have Australian defense industry sitting around waiting for evidence of real commitment to purpose for delivering on AUKUS endeavors,' Buchanan wrote. Marcus Hellyer, a top Australian defense budget and procurement expert, was similarly unimpressed by the announcement. Hellyer noted that Australia has contributed vast sums to the United States and Britain — $4.7 billion ($3 billion USD) to the US and $4.6 billion ($2.8 billion USD) over 10 years to the UK — to boost the nuclear-powered submarine defense industrial base. 'Looks like it's 1/18th of what we have put into uplifting each of the US and UK's industrial bases,' wrote Hellyer, 'or, put another way, we seem to be putting 36 times as much into other countries' industrial bases as we are putting into our own ....' The third analyst, Jennifer Parker, a top naval expert at Australian National University, however, said the $262 million 'does make a difference. It’s an important step in preparing Australian businesses to support the nuclear-powered submarine supply chain. An extensive effort that requires improving security and safety standards, including meeting ISO 19443 — the globally recognised nuclear safety standard.' Is it enough? 'It’s a good start,' Parker wrote, 'but only time will tell if it’s truly sufficient.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/aussies-announce-163m-more-for-aukus-initiatives-experts-skeptical-of-substance/	2025-01-21T06:12:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/20230314ran8562933_0001-scaled-e1687336869261.jpeg
SASC pushes forward Hegseth nomination for defense secretary	(L-R) Hosts Brian Kilmeade, Katie Pavlich and Pete Hegseth with Lee Greenwood (C) as he visits 'FOX &amp; Friends' at Fox News Channel Studios on May 27, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate Armed Services Committee has narrowly approved the nomination of Pete Hegseth to be the next secretary of defense, with Republicans using their single-vote majority to push the embattled nominee through to the next stage of the process. A source familiar with the vote said SASC members reported Hegseth out of committee along party lines in a 14-13 vote this evening. Hegseth’s nomination is set to come to the Senate floor later this week, where it is also expected to pass along party lines. Hegseth, a Fox News host and National Guard veteran, was tapped by President Donald Trump to lead the Pentagon in November. In the following weeks, allegations of sexual misconduct and whistleblower reports alleging that Hegseth abused alcohol while on the job at Fox News and as the former president of Concerned Veterans for America threatened to topple his nomination. Hegseth has denied all allegations of sexual misconduct and has pledged to stop drinking if named secretary of defense. RELATED: From firing generals to limiting women in combat, Hegseth hints at possible Pentagon shakeup During his confirmation hearing last week, Hegseth tried to make the case that he had reformed after making mistakes in his past, and that his combat experience would result in a Defense Department with improved lethality and readiness. He also tempered previous comments about women in the military by stating he would support women in ground combat roles if they could meet the same physical standards as men, though he noted the administration would conduct a review to ensure those standards had not been eroded. Republicans largely offered support for his previous military service and 'warrior ethos,' but Democrats questioned his character, his ability to lead a massive bureaucracy after previously managing a workforce of only around a hundred people, and whether his softened position on women in combat would hold after his confirmation. 'I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands of this job,' said Sen. Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the committee and the only Democrat to have been given a meeting with Hegseth prior to the hearing. 'We must acknowledge the concerning public reports against you. A variety of sources, including your own writings, implicate you with disregarding laws of war, financial mismanagement, racist and sexist remarks about men and women in uniform, alcohol abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and other troubling issues.' After the hearing, Hegseth finally secured the support of Sen. Joni Ernst, a sexual assault survivor and combat veteran who previously indicated she was unsure whether she help underwrite Hegseth’s nomination. 'As I serve on the Armed Services Committee, I will work with Pete to create the most lethal fighting force and hold him to his commitments of auditing the Pentagon, ensuring opportunity for women in combat while maintaining high standards, and selecting a senior official to address and prevent sexual assault in the ranks,' Ernst said in a statement last week. Also this evening, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to approve former Sen. Marco Rubio's nomination to lead the State Department. 'We are glad to have worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that one of our own, Senator Marco Rubio, could be positioned to quickly take the helm of the State Department,' said its chairman Jim Risch, R-Idaho, and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, the committee's ranking Democrat, in a statement. 'We believe that Senator Rubio has the skills, knowledge and experience to lead the department, and his unanimous vote in committee reflects that. We hope to see his nomination pass the full Senate without delay.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/sasc-pushes-forward-hegseth-nomination-for-defense-secretary/	2025-01-20T14:45:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241112_pete_hegseth_GettyImages-1399600200-scaled-e1737393007393.jpg
After inauguration, who is running Trump’s Pentagon?	Incoming President Donald Trump takes the stage during a campaign rally at the Santander Arena on November 04, 2024 in Reading, Pennsylvania. (Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As Donald Trump takes the office of the president, uncertainty is hanging over the Pentagon. With Pete Hegseth, Trump’s pick for defense secretary, still working through the Senate confirmation process, there is no clarity on who will lead the department starting today. And at the service level, the case is the same, with sources indicating that the uniformed chiefs of the military branches themselves may end up filling the role of their civilian leadership for an unknown amount of time. It has been traditional for some holdovers from the previous administration to be asked to stay and fill gaps. When Trump took over in 2017, for instance, then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Bob Work was asked to stay in place, and he held that role for the first six months of the Trump term. In 2021, then-deputy secretary David Norquist stayed on for a month to transition to the President Joe Biden team, and the three services were led by the comptrollers held over from the Trump team until officials were confirmed. Minutes after Trump was officially sworn in, a request to the Pentagon to identify who is the acting leader of the US military was directed to the White House. As of 10:00 am, the situation with the services was also uncertain. The Army said no one has been announced as its acting secretary, while the Navy said it had no comment on who is running the service. The Air Force told Breaking Defense on Friday that the service had not yet received guidance from the transition team and did not reply with any updates about new guidance by press time Monday. A new day at the Pentagon. pic.twitter.com/MeulqffZAv &mdash; Idrees Ali (@idreesali114) January 20, 2025 One military source said that transition team members working with the Army have been focused on 'lethality' and have been very 'technology minded.' 'They’ve been very easy to work with and inviting to the ideas and approaches we’ve had,' the source added. Now the defense community waits to see if Trump will act on calls from supporters — including Hegseth — to remove top general officers. Among the names being closely watched are Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. CQ Brown. In an unprecedented move, Brown’s predecessor, Gen. Mark Milley, today was given a preemptive pardon by Biden hours before leaving the White House to prevent him from being targeted for retribution once Trump took office. Milley, Trump’s choice for chairman, has emerged as a major critic of the new president. 'My family and I are deeply grateful for the President's action today. After forty-three years of faithful service in uniform to our Nation, protecting and defending the Constitution, I do not wish to spend whatever remaining time the Lord grants me fighting those who unjustly might seek retribution for perceived slights,' Milley said in a statement, according to NBC. 'I do not want to put my family, my friends, and those with whom I served through the resulting distraction, expense, and anxiety.' It is hardly unusual for nominees to take time getting to the Pentagon, although there is usually a push to get the defense secretary confirmed as quickly as possible to ensure continuity. For example, Jim Mattis was confirmed as defense secretary the same day as Trump’s first inauguration, with Lloyd Austin confirmed just two days after Biden took office. Hegseth, a Fox News analyst and one of Trump’s first cabinet picks, appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee last week for his confirmation hearing and could be in place at the Pentagon within days. According to SASC chairman Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., Hegseth will get a vote today out of the committee and likely a full vote in the whole Senate by the end of the week. It is expected Hegseth will be confirmed among purely partisan lines — a rare sight for a defense secretary nominee, who usually achieves an easy bipartisan vote. After Hegseth will come a series of hearings for other nominees. The first up appears to be Daniel Driscoll, an adviser to Vice President-elect JD Vance, to lead the Army in its top civilian spot. He is slated to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Jan. 23 for his confirmation hearing, a first step to getting that vote. Hearings have not been announced for any of the other top defense nominees: While not an official DoD position, Monday also brought news that Vivek Ramaswamy would not be co-running the DOGE effort with Elon Musk after all. Instead, Ramaswamy will be launching a bid for governor of Ohio, according to Politico. DOGE has been closely watched by the defense community, as it has been tasked to advise the Trump administration on how to cut significant chunks of the federal budget.

Inside the shift: Trump, defense, and the road to 2025	Big changes are on the horizon, but no one really knows what they will be. Talking with members of the national security community in the two months since Donald Trump won the November presidential election, that’s the clearest consensus: Trump and his team will be making major moves to the world of defense, but exactly what that’s going to look like is, for now, guess work. That uncertainty is reflected in the collection of pieces by the Breaking Defense staff, looking forward to 2025. But it also permeates the team’s reflections on 2024, which was a year in which the presidential election kept everything in limbo. That doesn’t mean there wasn’t news — we published almost 2,000 stories, op-eds and features on the site, and the editors have dark circles under our eyes to prove it. But 2024 felt like a transition year, and 2025 is going to be the payoff, in whatever form it takes. Each December, our team reflects on their coverage and identifies the key developments to watch in the coming year. This ebook contains a snapshot of 30 key pieces from the end of 2024.

New No. 2 House appropriator: Reconciliation bill going to be ‘heavy lift’	Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, a Republican from Florida, speaks during a news conference at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Tuesday, July 20, 2021. (Tom Brenner/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — On Wednesday Florida Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart was named the new vice chairman of the House appropriations committee, putting him in a key position to sort out how to both get the fiscal 2025 budget out of limbo and work out a major reconciliation package backed by President-elect Donald Trump. Those are challenges, he admitted to Breaking Defense in an interview earlier in the week, that are going to require a lot of finessing. 'Our margins are so slim that it is going to be a very, very heavy lift,' the 11-term congressman said of the slight Republican advantage in the House, 'and there are a number of people who have a history of voting against a bill, not because of what's in it, but because of what potentially is not in it. And that's a very difficult individual to satisfy, because there's always something that's not there that we want, right? 'And so, thin margins, a group of people that have the tendency to do that &#8230; I'm still optimistic that we'll get it done, but I just don't think it's as easy as some think it is.' However, the appropriator does hope to jumpstart FY25 negotiations ahead of the Continuing Resolution ending in mid-March, 'I actually am going to be pushing hard to try to get it done before the March deadline.' 'There's no reason why we have to wait to March,' he said. 'And I'm hoping that there's an agreement sooner [rather] than later on top line numbers so the appropriators can get to work, and as soon as we can get to work, we'll get it done in, I think, pretty short order. But it's not an easy task.' Diaz-Balart, who is also the chair of the National Security, Department of State, and Related Programs Subcommittee, as well as a member of the defense subcommittee, spoke on a wide range of issues. Below are some highlights, lightly edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: There’s a lot of chatter right now that defense could get a big plus-up through reconciliation. Sen. Roger Wicker, the Senate Armed Services chairman, has said he wants a $60 billion per year increase for FY25 and FY26. Is that something you support? REP. MARIO DIAZ-BALART: How we could get that done, the process to get that done, is one thing. I think that we are grossly underfunding defense, and we're doing so in a way that I think is putting our country and our future in jeopardy. And so I agree with Sen. Wicker that we have to do a lot more. I wish that every member of Congress got some of the classified, in-depth briefings that we get on defense, on appropriations and others. We do have the most powerful military, but I think we have a serious, serious, serious threat in communist China that is a mid- and long-term existential threat. I think we are dramatically underfunding defense. Now, is the number $60 billion, or is the process of doing reconciliation or [funding it] another way, the right way? That's subject to debate. But I do think that I agree with Sen. Wicker that we are dramatically and dangerously underfunding defense. And you think that's something that's possible, to get a big plus-up done? I think we need to figure out a way to it, because if you fall behind in defense, you don't catch up. Not when you have a Chinese dictatorship that is investing — they invest money, and they also steal technology, and they're continuing to do it. Their plans are very clear. They want to be the number one military power, the number one influence in the world, and once you fall behind, catching up is nearly, if not totally, impossible. So the sooner the better. And we definitely are underfunding defense, and I will tell you dramatically underfunding defense. The Army has requested a change in how it gets its appropriations, looking for pots of money instead of going line by line. We saw a similar idea floated by Wicker, in a recent reform plan. As an appropriator, what is your sense of the willingness members have to allow that to happen? I love that concept. I really do. Now, the flip side is, [DoD] can't even pass their routine financial audit. And that's a little worrisome, right? So I like the concept, but — BUT — because you're dealing with so much money, and it's the biggest bureaucracy in the world, how do you do that and still make sure that we don't have, you know, million dollar hammers or pick your example de jour. Again, I like the concept, but there have to be some very serious financial guidelines to make sure that money is [going to] the right place. What do those guidelines or controls look like? One of my frustrations is that, you know, we go from trying to get the appropriation bills and then — supplemental, and then another supplemental, and then a CR, and then another CR, then another supplemental — that I've had no time to do the following. I'd like to do, in essence, performance-based budgeting. I did that in the state level &#8230; I'd like to be able to not just know how much money we're putting in, but exactly what we're getting out of it. In some areas, we can do that. … And I don't know if it's totally possible to do with defense, but that's something that I want to do with my [subcommittee]. I agree with that [flexibility concept], but it's hard to argue when, you know, you don't pass your audits. How the hell do you want us to trust you with more flexibility? And so that's a bit of a challenge. That's a bit of a challenge — coming from somebody who, again, believes that we need to put a lot more money [into defense]. Have you talked with the DOGE team at all yet? I have not, but we need to. We need to. I'm actually really optimistic about what the DOGE can do. You know, just more eyes with a different perspective. These are folks who are highly successful. As of now, obviously they've been [set up] but there hasn't been a deep dive yet, and it requires a very deep dive. There’s been a lot of back and forth over the years about where security assistance funds should live. Both State and the Pentagon have parts of that, and both sides have argued over the years that they should be the sole controller. State falls firmly under your purview, but you’re also on the defense subcommittee, so where do you come down? Look, I think that's one of those areas that we that we need to spend some time looking at, [to see] if we can be more efficient or more effective. Because I have no — these turf battles, I don't play that game. If it makes sense for it to be in defense, it should be in defense. If it makes sense to be in someplace else, if it makes sense to share it, [fine]. So I don't have a real fixed feeling on that, but it's one that we need to look at to see if we can get efficiencies. And what makes sense is what I would support. Is this the kind of thing you want to see DOGE take a look at and weigh in on? The issue is that, these are issues that have to be looked at in a real detailed fashion. It can't just be the concept, you know, it's got to be [about] how does it actually work on the ground. And so I don't have a problem with [DOGE] looking at it, I actually think that they should be looking at all of this and coming up with the recommendations. But when you're dealing with something that is, you know, literally putting people at risk, it's got to be done in a real, real detailed fashion. And so I welcome DOGE, but I also think that it's going to require some very detailed analysis. Lebanon has a new government, one with the backing of Western nations that hope it can stabilize that country. Do you want to see more money flowed to the Lebanese Armed Forces to help support that? The Lebanese military has been one of the few stable things there. But having said that, I am also very concerned of the influence that Hezbollah has in the country writ large and potentially even in the military. And so to your question, do I support it? Maybe. Maybe, but with the very strong caveat that it just can't be a blank check. It's got to be very, very, very strongly limited to make sure it doesn't fall in the wrong hands, or it's not used for things that we don't want to be used for. And there are some good relationships there, right? But, even within the military, there are challenges. Lebanon is a challenge.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/new-no-2-house-appropriator-reconciliation-bill-going-to-be-heavy-lift/	2025-01-17T11:16:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/mario-diaz-balart-scaled-e1737046256581.jpg
Russia signs Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with Iran	Russian and Iranian flag pair on desk over defocused background. Horizontal composition with copy space and selective focus. BEIRUT — Months after the initial announcement, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian signed today the long-awaited Comprehensive Strategic Partnership Treaty. The agreement, inked in a ceremony at the Kremlin, 'covers all spheres, including defense, counter-terrorism, energy, finance, transport, industry, agriculture, culture, science and engineering,' according to Russian news agency TASS. 'I am very pleased that this work has been completed. It is important, because it will open up an opportunity to give an additional impetus to practically all areas of our cooperation,' Russian president Vladimir Putin reportedly said during the meeting with Pezeshkian. 'We continue our large projects, including those in nuclear energy,' Putin said, according to a readout on the Kremlin's website. 'There are also other emerging projects in the energy sector and good prospects in logistics.' Pezeshkian added, 'We believe that our bilateral relations with the Russian Federation are strategically important and comprehensive. We will continue our robust conversation and our dialogue with you.' In 2001, Tehran and Moscow signed a 20-year comprehensive agreement, and now, more than three years after that agreement expired, the two allies signed a new agreement, coming in the wake of already tightening defense cooperation between the two countries. For example, Iran exported Shahed suicide drones to Russia and even inaugurated a facility in Moscow to manufacture them locally, aiding Russian forces in the operations against Ukraine, the Washington Post reported in 2023. Iran also operates Russian air defense systems, such as the S-300. 'They’re cooperating to develop and produce more lethal loitering munitions for Russia’s use in Ukraine and for Iran to proliferate to partners and proxies throughout the Middle East,' Jonathan Lord, director of the Middle East security program at the Center for a New American Security, told Breaking Defense in July. While details about future defense cooperation of the treaty have not yet been revealed, Behnam Ben Taleblu, senior fellow at The Foundation for Defense of Democracies, also in July predicted that the treaty will go beyond deepening military and security ties. 'What Russia and Iran may cooperate on in the nuclear and space domains, where Iran has great interest and Russia has great aptitude,' he told Breaking Defense then. Iran could increasingly be turning to Moscow for support after its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was greatly weakened by Israeli operations, and its strongest ally in the region, the Assad regime in Syria, was toppled by rebels there. 'Iran is at its weakest point since the Islamic Revolution,' US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said during an event at the United States Institute of peace on Wednesday.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/russia-signs-comprehensive-strategic-partnership-with-iran/	2025-01-17T10:32:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/GettyImages-927165254-e1734638126397.jpg
Passing Trump’s test? Lithuania pledges 5 to 6 percent GDP on defense spending	A 1st Lt. with the Lithuanian KASP (National Volunteer Defence Forces) watches for enemy vehicles on a nearby road during Exercise Allied Spirit 22 at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center (JMRC) in Hohenfels, Germany (US Army) BELFAST — Senior Lithuanian military and political officials have agreed to invest 5 to 6 percent GDP on defense spending over the next five years; making it the first NATO country to make such a commitment since US President-elect Donald Trump lobbied for alliance members to hit the lofty 5 percent target. Lithuania’s State Defence Council, comprised of top defense leaders and lawmakers, met and agreed on the new 2026-2030 spending plan today, according to public broadcaster Lithuanian Radio and Television (LRT). The move, a direct response to Russian aggression, was confirmed on X by Lithuania’s President Gitanas Nauseda. He noted that the future funding uplift will enable 'a fully capable division by 2030 &amp; enhance our national defense capabilities,' adding, 'May we lead by example.' Similarly, Lithuania's Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys said on the social media platform, 'We call on our allies to follow this lead. The era of passive &#8216;sit-and-wait' strategies is over.' Dovile Sakaliene, Lithuania's defense minister, echoed that sentiment, claiming the 'historic decisions' taken with respect to the new defense plan and future establishment of a 'fully operational' NATO-backed national division 'will enable us to carry out weaponry procurements faster, pay in advance if the situation requires and rapidly develop military infrastructure.' She went on, via X, 'Our message is clear: Lithuania is ready to ensure the security of its citizens by all means. LRT reported that Nauseda said the increased spending will be delivered through state borrowing and public spending cuts, as opposed to raising taxes. Since taking office in December 2024, he has been vocal on the need for NATO allies to agree on an improved baseline of 3 precent GDP for defense spending, in a bid to replace the current 2 percent target. According to NATO figures for 2024 [PDF], Vilnius spent 2.85 percent GDP on military spending, ranking behind just five other allies. The Baltic state's long-term spending plan emerges days before Trump’s inauguration and second term that is expected to see a raft of changes to US foreign policy. One such expected change is policy surrounding Ukraine, where a 100-day plan to end the war has been floated by Ukraine peace envoy Keith Kellogg. Vilnius has committed to spend at minimum, 0.25 percent GDP on military aid to Ukraine and has previously supplied Kyiv with a wide variety of weapons including 155mm ammunition, M577 and M113 armored personnel carriers, counter unmanned aerial systems, and Carl Gustaf anti-tank recoilless rifle ammunition. It co-leads the Ukraine demining coalition capability group alongside Iceland, aimed at equipping Ukrainian armed forces with remote detonation systems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/passing-trumps-test-lithuania-pledges-5-to-6-percent-gdp-on-defense-spending/	2025-01-17T10:03:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/allied-spirit-2022-scaled-e1709054663158.jpg
With Airbus and Maxar deals, Dutch double up on space-based ISR business	Satellite imagery taken by Maxar on March 14, 2022, shows damage in the southern Ukrainian city of Mariupol. (Courtesy Maxar) BELFAST — The Netherlands has committed to modernizing its space-based sensing and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities after signing two contracts this month with Europe's Airbus and US-based Maxar. 'These contracts are established for the renewal and improvement of the current direct access satellite imagery platforms used by the [Ministry of Defense],' a Dutch MoD spokesperson told Breaking Defense. The new four-year partnership with Airbus, the value of which was not disclosed, covers access to the manufacturer’s OneAtlas satellite data platform that opens up an 'extensive suite of capabilities including optical, radar, and elevation data,' according to a company statement. It shared that from an optical perspective, operational benefits will include access to remote sensing satellite constellations SPOT, Pléiades and Pléiades Neo archive imagery, highly reactive tasking and high-resolution images in the range of 1.5m to 30cm 'native' resolution and enhanced visual rendering of Pléiades Neo HD15 images. Native resolution refers to image clarity before computer enhancement. Additionally, The Hague will also gain access to the Airbus Radar Constellation, delivering data from three satellites, ranging from 25cm to 40m resolution. 'Radar imagery can be collected independent of weather and daylight conditions over any point on Earth and is especially suited for increased acquisition capacity, improved global mean revisit time and a significantly reduced interferometric repetition cycle to support data-intensive, high-frequency surveillance applications,' added Airbus. In line with aiding information-rich activities like mission planning and disaster response operations, the Airbus package also includes digital elevation models, primarily optical-based elevation and 3D textured models. Elevation data is particularly critical for making accurate 3D terrain maps. 'The OneAtlas platform offers a global image dataset, satellite tasking options as well as radar, 3D and analytics, ensuring that military and civilian personnel within the Dutch Ministry of Defence have access to up-to-date, high-resolution satellite imagery and geospatial information for operational planning and mission monitoring,' noted the manufacturer. Meanwhile the Maxar contract, valued at €13.6 million ($14.4million), revolves around a four-year subscription to Maxar Geospatial Platform (MGP) Pro and supporting geospatial solutions, according to a company statement. 'Under the competitive framework agreement, Maxar will help the MoD’s Defence Geographic Agency (DGA) and its hundreds of users enrich the agency’s geospatial foundational data and derivative product portfolio in support of its mapping, intelligence and operational support missions,' the statement said. Maxar said that MGP Pro offers 'on-demand access to the world’s most recent high-accuracy, high-resolution satellite imagery and analytics in a single, powerful platform.' The geospatial solution also hosts a 125-petabyte imagery archive and end users can task satellites, access 3D data and use AI or machine learning tools for object detection. The Netherlands will also receive access to 'three million sq km of daily 30cm-class resolution image collections, in addition to over 6 billion sq km of archived imagery at up to 30cm resolution,' noted the US firm. As mentioned by the Netherlands MoD spokesperson, the development of 'sovereign capabilities' to strengthen space-based ISR capabilities remains a key priority for the department. 'The current focus is on those capabilities that are relevant for the Dutch armed forces,' that are aligned to 'cooperation in international partnerships, and where the Netherlands industry and knowledge institutes (already) have an advantageous international position.' At a more general level, Dutch space capabilities are developed around and delivered against NATO capability targets, or in conjunction with European Union and international partners. While the US currently provides most ISR imagery and data analysis to NATO, the 32 members states are in the midst of an effort to beef up capacity from other countries. 'In international cooperation, we are focusing on innovative space solutions for ISR and other space functional areas (such as space domain awareness or space-based early warning), with relevant partner nations,' added the Dutch MoD spokesperson. Space technology is listed as one of five key areas where Dutch defense companies 'excel' and has been selected for 'targeted' investment, under plans disclosed by The Hague, from within its Defence White Paper [PDF], published in 2024.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/with-airbus-and-maxar-deals-dutch-double-up-on-space-based-isr-business/	2025-01-17T09:23:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220406_maxar_ukraine_220314-e1649286434152.jpg
Allvin: It’s make or break time. America needs more Air Force.	Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin makes remarks before presenting Maj. Brady Augustin the 2022 Koren Kolligian Jr. Trophy during a ceremony at the Pentagon, Arlington, Va., Feb. 7, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) Last month, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) released videos of not just one, but two new sixth-generation aircraft. And while the US Air Force was not surprised by this development, it is my sincere hope that this got America’s attention and serves as a wakeup call, because we need the nation’s assistance advancing the Air Force with the sense of strategic urgency this moment requires. With the character of war changing before our eyes, it is more important than ever to provide the airpower America’s joint forces need to deter conflict and win the fight if called upon. But that’s easier said than done, because our service lacks the required funding and resources, even as the potential for near-term conflict grows. In short, America needs more Air Force and it needs it now. The PRC has invested in a first-rate Air Force and has instituted realistic training programs rivaling our own. The fact that these advances have been built on intellectual property stolen from our industrial base (and, on occasion, with the help of western-trained pilots-for hire) tells us we still maintain an advantage worthy of their dogged pursuit. But to leverage these advantages, we must invest in them. Today, our aircraft fleet is smaller and older than any time in history, and the gap between our high-end combat training and that of our pacing competitors has closed dramatically. As the arc of the threat increases daily, it is my assessment this risk is unacceptable and will continue to rise without substantially increased investment in airpower — one of our remaining sources of competitive advantage. This accumulating risk has been insidious in its growth. Decisions made since the end of the Cold War — weighed against other priorities of the moment — made sense one budget at a time, but the aggregate effect is the eroding advantage of American airpower. It’s past time to stop that erosion. More Air Force doesn’t just mean buying more expensive 'stuff.' It means an appropriate mix of exquisite and low-cost capabilities to provide dilemmas for adversaries and stay on the right side of the cost curve. It means funding a nimble force strategically postured on the doorstep of our adversary to asymmetrically deny its ability to rapidly seize territory. More Air Force means funding a family of medium- and long-range penetrating airframes coupled with modern munitions, survivable refueling, human-machine teaming, and a hardened warfighting network — a combination designed to protect American interests and capable of disabling our adversary’s ability to defend themselves. More Air Force means defending those systems and supporting them through a robust logistics chain. More Air Force means backstopping all these elements with a nuclear force that is modernized to surpass the rapid growth of the PRC’s nuclear arsenal and the reconstitution of Russia’s vast nuclear arms. These elements are a decisive combination, but to unleash them, we need the nation to invest in more Air Force — because we cannot do this as a service on our own, though we have tried. The US Air Force has a few key 'fiscal levers' we can pull to become more efficient and effective. Like any good corporate leadership team, we want to invest in a product that dominates the market, provides a strong return on investment, and does so at a level of risk we can justify. Unfortunately, my predecessors and I have been unable to make these investments because we are unable to move any of these levers in a meaningful way. For example, we have roughly 30 percent excess infrastructure across the enterprise, but we are prevented from seriously considering a meaningful reduction, as a needed Base Realignment and Closure effort has been politically unpalatable for decades. Imagine car manufacturers holding on to 30 percent unused manufacturing floor space — they would go bankrupt. I love our bases and the communities they support, but we need the ability to make tough choices and free up dollars where we can. We also lack control of our own force structure, which is the oldest in our history, as we are blocked from divesting aircraft and programs ill-suited for today’s threat environment and even more so for the one emerging. Our fleet today contains aircraft as old as if we had fought the Vietnam War with Wright Flyers. Meanwhile, we cannot reduce personnel as our overseas commitments and operational tempo remain high. Simply put, America’s Air Force has been on a war-time footing since Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The post-Cold War demands for efficiency, coupled with the effects of sequestration a decade ago and an inability to keep up with personnel costs which are rising faster than inflation, have left us with a force already 20,000-30,000 Airmen short of our requirements. Commanders rightly ask, 'Where are the rest of the Airmen I’m supposed to have in my unit to accomplish my missions?' My current answer, sadly, is 'They’re not coming anytime soon.' There is one remaining lever and we have pulled it year after year to mitigate the lack of action on the issues above. This lever is labelled 'Mission Readiness' and tugging it time and time again has put us where we are today. It has become the most 'convenient' of options because the cuts can be broken into smaller pieces, more digestible in the moment with fewer immediate political consequences. We know what a hollow force looks like — we’ve been there and should never go back. The solution is clear: We must be allowed to grow. That requires significant financial investment on behalf of the American people. Yes, major investments are a tough ask right now. But this is about the security of the nation, and as we saw last month, China is hellbent on lapping us in the skies. It cannot be allowed to do so. Moreover, America’s sons and daughters deserve the best training, weapons, and equipment we can provide so they can fly, fight, win, and come home. They don’t have all those right now. To fix that, our Airmen and America itself need more Air Force. Gen. David W. Allvin is the 23rd Chief of Staff of the Air Force.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/allvin-its-make-or-break-time-america-needs-more-air-force/	2025-01-17T07:50:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/allvin-scaled-e1718387249735.jpg
Army two-star general talks Watervliet expansion, finding secondary cannon tube producers	A 155 mm artillery tube enters a heat treatment furnace at Watervliet Arsenal in New York as part of a process called 'austenitizing.'(US Army/John B Snyder) WASHINGTON — Over the past three months, the US Army’s Watervliet Arsenal has been forging more cannon tubes at a rate not seen in 40 years, according to Maj. Gen. Michael Lalor, the commander of the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command. And while there is still room to grow inside the arsenal, he said, secondary sources could offer the service with a glidepath to quickly scaling production. As part of the service’s organic industry base, Watervliet Arsenal in Albany, NY, is the sole producer of cannon tubes inside the US weapons like M1 Abrams tanks, the M109 Paladin self-propelled howitzer, and the M777 lightweight howitzer. That meant there was a sudden production influx in 2022 when Washington began rushing howitzers to Ukraine to fend off Russian troops. 'Use of that [M777] howitzer and the volume it's been used definitely confirmed the accuracy, the precision of that system, and also its endurance that it could fire: Those tubes had longer life than originally expected,' Lalor told reporters on Wednesday after an Association of the US Army event. 'In terms of production, because you're firing at that rate … it drives a requirement for additional canon tubes at a rate we haven't seen in generations,' he added. While steering clear of specific numbers, Lalor estimated that Watervliet has likely tripled production over the past three years. To accommodate increased production, the service revamped its manufacturing processes and modernized the facility. Although the two-star general said he believes the facility still has capacity to grow, lessons from the war in Ukraine have showcased industrial base vulnerabilities and the need to have multiple production sources to avoid a single point of failure that could leave the service without a cannon producer. 'I think we can produce more,' he added. 'I also think it suggests that, you know, inside the army and industrial base, we're definitely looking at it that secondary sources are going to be helpful too in a future conflict that we may have to fight.' The service has begun examining its options for bringing on secondary sources, and Lalor said it has now identified 'multiple' sources that, if given the technical data to produce the tubes, could have production lines up and running within 12 to 18 months. 'That's if you're moving fast, because it's a unique capability,' Lalor said. 'But, like anything else in exigence, believe you can produce at a scale and rate faster.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-two-star-general-talks-watervliet-expansion-finding-secondary-canon-tube-producers/	2025-01-17T06:42:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/organic-industrial-base-e1692321928638.jpg
Air Force’s outgoing acquisition chief on NGAS, CCA and his biggest regrets	Andrew Hunter, assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition, technology and logistics, speaks during the panel discussion 'Answering the Warfighters’ Needs' at the Air and Space Forces Association 2023 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., March 7, 2023. (U.S. Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The US Air Force’s analysis of alternatives for a futuristic air refueler is wrapping up — but it’s not clear how much money will be available in future budgets to fund the tanker concept, according to the service’s outgoing acquisition chief. 'I think understanding what the [fiscal year 2026] budget is actually going to be is pretty significant to how the path forward' will play out, Andrew Hunter said in a Monday exit interview at the Pentagon. 'And that is ultimately in their hands,' he added, referring to the Trump team. Intended to perform refueling missions in contested air spaces, the Next Generation Air-refueling System (NGAS) has been envisioned with stealthy features to help it slip past enemy defenses, in contrast to current refuelers largely based on civilian aircraft designs. The Air Force updated its tanker strategy in spring 2023 to accelerate the NGAS platform, as well as craft a near-term buy for an interim tranche of refuelers until the NGAS aircraft can be fielded. But plans have been in flux since. The Air Force has delayed funding the interim tranche of tankers, mostly because officials have not yet set a timeline for NGAS to enter service. And no design has been selected: Lockheed Martin pulled out of a partnership with Airbus for the interim buy, leaving the European conglomerate to face off against Boeing's offer of more KC-46s and, potentially, Brazilian aerospace firm Embraer's KC-390. Officials have additionally sought to combine NGAS work with a review of the service’s separate Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, as the two platforms are expected to work in tandem. The fate of the NGAD fighter, along with the overall funding profile for the Air Force, have officially been left up to the Trump administration, although Breaking Defense first reported that an internal assessment of NGAD found the jet's requirements fit the service's needs. RELATED: New Air Force review supports manned 6th-gen NGAD fighter concept 'The realization that we had is, you can't look at these two things in isolation,' Hunter said. 'You need an approach to Next Generation Air Dominance that is supported by your approach to aerial fueling. And you need an approach to aerial refueling that complements the tactical force that you're buying, and enables it to carry forward the fight.' He then stressed that the service’s approach to NGAS is 'iterative' and constantly assesses trade-offs. He did not share details from the NGAS analysis of alternatives — which is still technically moving through final approvals at the Pentagon — but did say that the outlook for a near-term tanker deal is becoming more clear. 'It has substantially firmed up,' he said of the interim buy. 'The big remaining open question, though, is what's the budget?' Hunter came into his current role from the think tank world, but drew from extensive experience in government following stints on the Hill and at the Pentagon. And shortly after he took office in 2021, a crisis unfolded as inflation spiked in the wake of the pandemic, prompting widespread resistance among industry to contracts that could expose vendors to losses. Much of the industry consternation centered around fixed-price agreements particularly for development contracts, where Boeing has served as a poster child for ill-conceived deals that have forced the aerospace giant to hemorrhage billions of dollars. 'A lot of these fixed-price contracts came out of an era where cost was kind of the big focus for the department, and so we did achieve some cost control,' Hunter said. 'But there's been a trade-off for that, which is we kind of lost the ability to have direct control over when a capability was getting delivered.' Hunter said discussions will continue as a 'constant process of learning' with industry, but that the Air Force can still pursue 'big, fixed-price contracts' similar to those that govern programs like the troubled T-7A training jet — though only if the Air Force prepares for, and adjusts sufficiently to, the transition from development to production. A global environment characterized by rising tensions may also require different acquisition priorities as well, he said. For some programs, an approach could be 'we just have to field as soon as possible, and cost is secondary to that,' he said. 'I think that’s also very valid, and that may be a really appropriate choice to make in the current environment where the risk of conflict is high.' Ultimately, Hunter has come to believe, asking industry to commit to cost targets over a long period of time — as Boeing did on the T-7A in 2018, which entails 10 fixed-price production lots — is probably not reasonable going forward. '10 lots of fixed-price aircraft, in an environment which, when the contract was awarded, where inflation had been two percent or less for like a decade, probably seemed entirely reasonable,' he said. 'That's probably too much risk for anyone to take as we look at it today.' General Atomics Aeronautical Systems shows off its design for a Collaborative Combat Aircraft at AFA 2024 (Valerie Insinna/Breaking Defense) Under the leadership of Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, officials have sought to shepherd a number of changes for the Air Force and Space Force, from establishing certain 'operational imperatives' to a sweeping overhaul dubbed 'reoptimization.' There were plenty of new, acquisition-specific initiatives under Hunter’s remit as well, including what the weapons buyer calls 'next generation acquisitions.' A critical element of that approach is reaching deeper into the supply chain. For example, the Air Force previously released a request for information to potential mission systems providers for the NGAS platform, and Hunter said the service’s larger embrace of mission systems government reference architectures for newer acquisitions is not just a pathway for eschewing vendor lock, but also for gaining a better view into the supply base. 'It also has a business purpose, which is a more direct and insightful relationship between the government and those key mission systems providers,' he said. 'So we do understand where the money's going, how it's being used, and what the pace of technology development is and what the technology opportunities are directly.' He noted that’s especially true for Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), the Air Force’s budding effort to field drone wingmen that will join fighter jets in battle. Hunter considers the drone program as one of his signature achievements, which officials say will provide needed relief for an aging and shrinking fighter fleet that must be supplemented by an 'affordable mass' of uncrewed systems. By 'marrying' the approach for mission systems, much of it derived from the NGAD program, to CCA that are 'affordable, ab[le] to be produced in mass, and that we can sort of rapidly pivot and adopt new mission systems as they become available, I think that is something that is going to serve the nation very well. 'That is the new thing. Is DoD able to adopt the new thing?' he asked rhetorically. 'The answer to me is yes, and we've done it, and you see it there.' The Air Force has certainly hit rough patches in the acquisition world in the past few years, perhaps most notably represented by ballooning costs for a new ICBM. Reflecting on his tenure, Hunter said he’s the 'kind of person who has 1,000 regrets every single day,' but generally speaking, he wished he was more quick with decision-making. 'In every case where we do something good,' he said, 'I think to myself, ‘Well, why didn't I do that earlier?’' Set to leave office next week, the acquisition boss said he assumes the Air Force’s overarching strategy — defined by the 'pacing challenge' of China — will not change much even under the new administration. Additionally, he emphasized that it’s critical for even disparate elements of the service to remain tightly integrated if officials want to achieve their goals. And while he may 'technically' retire, he still plans to remain active. 'You’ll still hear from me. I’ll still be around,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/air-forces-outgoing-acquisition-chief-on-ngas-cca-and-his-biggest-regrets/	2025-01-17T05:45:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/andrew-hunter-scaled-e1694360542511.jpg
Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket reaches orbit in first test flight	New Glenn at liftoff during the NG-1 mission, Jan. 16, 2025. (Photo: Blue Origin) WASHINGTON — Blue Origin, the space launch company founded by billionaire Jeff Bezos almost 25 years ago, successfully tested its New Glenn heavy-lift rocket for the first time early this morning — lofting the company's Blue Ring Pathfinder demonstration spacecraft to orbit in partnership with the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU). But there's no doubt Space Force hearts have also been lifted by the simple fact of New Glenn's testing success, as service leaders see the launch vehicle as a future competitor to SpaceX's Falcon series rockets that currently have a lock on the most critical launches under the Defense Department's National Security Space Launch program. The giant two-stage New Glenn rocket — named after astronaut John Glenn — can carry more than 13 metric tons to geostationary transfer orbit (from whence the spacecraft will make its own way to geosynchronous Earth orbit) and 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit. It performed as expected, but the reusable first stage failed to make its landing on Blue Origin's capture ship called 'Jackyln' after Bezos's mother. Nonetheless, the NG-1 test mission is being hailed both inside and outside the company as a success. 'I’m incredibly proud New Glenn achieved orbit on its first attempt,' said Blue Origin CEO Dave Limp in a press release today. 'We knew landing our booster, So You’re Telling Me There’s a Chance, on the first try was an ambitious goal. We’ll learn a lot from today and try again at our next launch this spring.' Clay Mowry, CEO of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics that advocates for the space industry, echoed Limp's assessment. 'Today’s New Glenn test flight from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station marks a pivotal moment in heavy-lift reusable launch vehicle development. The team has made tremendous technical progress reaching orbit on this first attempt,' he said. And one happy DoD official summed up: 'They did great.' Blue Origin hopes to move quickly to get through two certification flights to be able to compete for the NSSL Phase 3 program's so-called Lane 2, which covers launches of critical payloads and those to more difficult to achieve orbits. At the moment, SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy are the only two launch vehicles certified for those launches. While United Launch Alliance (ULA) made the second certification launch of its Vulcan Centaur on Oct. 4, a nozzle on one of the solid rocket boosters fell off. So far, the Space Force has yet to sign off the company's effort to fix the problem and gain NSSL Lane 2 approval. Meanwhile, on Jan. 5, DIU announced that it is moving forward with three prototype contracts under its Orbital Logistics Vehicle Project to: Blue Origin with the Blue Ring platform, which is demonstrating a 'heavy utility m-OLV [multi-orbit logistics vehicle] capable of transporting (hosting) one or more mechanically-coupled payloads or spacecraft (500+kg payload capacity)' via the Blue Ring Pathfinder and Dark-Sky-1 mission payloads; Northrop Grumman's Space Logistics, which is providing a 'suite of in-space refueling technologies,' including its 'Active Refueling Moule (ARM) and Passive Refueling Module (PRM);' and Spacebilt (formerly Skycorp), which was awarded a contract 'for further validation of their approach In Space Assembly and Manufacturing for enabling their m-OLV product for DoD use cases.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/blue-origins-new-glenn-rocket-reaches-orbit-in-first-test-flight/	2025-01-16T13:16:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/new-glenn-1_01162024-e1737058479357.jpg
Trump picks NRO official Troy Meink as next Air Force Secretary	Troy Meink, principal deputy director for the National Reconnaissance Office, testifies before Congress on May 1, 2024. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has picked Troy Meink, currently the principal deputy director for the National Reconnaissance Office, to serve as the next secretary of the Air Force. 'Troy will work with our incredible Secretary of Defense Nominee, Pete Hegseth, to ensure that our Nation’s Air Force is the most effective and deadly force in the World, as we secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social, the social media app he owns. Meink comes with a deep background in government service, including in the Air Force, which he entered through ROTC in 1988. In contrast to some other service secretary picks, Meink is a well-known figure in Washington circles, including after having served as the deputy under secretary of the Air Force for space in the Obama administration. Meink was tapped for his current role at the NRO in 2020. Meink did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the NRO said the spy agency had 'no information to provide' when asked about Meink's nomination. Assuming all nominees will be confirmed, Trump has now completed filling out the ranks for service secretaries. The Pentagon is expected to be led by Hegseth, the former Fox News host and Army National Guard officer, despite a contentious confirmation hearing. As the top civilian overseeing both the Air Force and Space Force, Meink will inherit big decisions like the fate of a next-generation stealth fighter, as well as pressures to ramp up spending for space programs. He will also oversee lucrative contracts for critical space efforts where top Trump ally Elon Musk’s SpaceX dominates. Though Trump didn't announce it in the post about Meink, Aviation Week and Defense One reported today that the incoming president is eyeing Matthew Lohmeier to be the next Air Force under secretary. Lohmeier is a former Space Force lieutenant colonel who was fired from command in May 2021 after authoring a book that alleges 'Marxist' ideologies are spreading through the military. The firebrand lieutenant colonel's reported selection raises some questions about the longevity of the current commander of US Space Command, Gen. Stephen Whiting, who in his former role as head of Space Operations Command relieved Lohmeier of command of the 11th Space Warning Squadron at Buckley Air Force Base, Colo. Lohmeier would take over from Melissa Dalton, who was confirmed as the service's No. 2 official in May 2024.

Navy admiral ‘skeptical’ of Large USV’s future amid congressional scrutiny	The USV Mariner sits docked at the United States Naval Academy. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — A senior Navy officer overseeing the service’s investments into unmanned surface vehicles says he’s 'skeptical' of fielding the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel. 'Instead of different large and medium designs, we need one craft that is affordable, non-exquisite, and can come off multiple production lines in an identical manner and go towards one of two payloads — either the envisioned magazine payload of the Large USV or the envisioned ISR-related Medium USV payloads,' Rear Adm. William Daly, the Navy’s surface warfare requirements director, told attendees this week at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium. 'We can build this craft in numbers at many shipyards. Designs already exist. We must not over-spec this,' he continued. Daly’s job, which the Navy internally refers to as N96, is centered on directing the investments the service is making into its future surface warfare capabilities to include high-profile programs like the Medium and Large Unmanned Surface Vessels. 'The Large USV has a great purpose, but it has it has walked that path towards exquisite, expensive [and] unpalatable,' Daly told reporters on the sidelines of SNA. 'I’m skeptical about that landing in the fleet.' Daly said he would 'pay attention' to a handful of USVs that originated from a Strategic Capabilities Office program dubbed Overlord. He emphasized those craft allow for multiple containerized payloads. 'So now I'm getting back to the threshold levels of what the previous Large USV was envisioned to carry. It’s a very appropriate, inexpensive, feasible, producible, elegant solution to two problems that can come at speed,' he said. Daly’s remarks come just over a month after Breaking Defense exclusively reported on a letter sent to the service by two key senators that urged the Navy to back away from its original plans for LUSV. Elsewhere during this year’s symposium, Adm. Daryl Caudle, US Fleet Forces commander, told reporters he believes the Navy has become very capable at using individual unmanned capabilities for missions such as intelligence gathering and submarine rescue operations. How to take those capabilities and use them in a broader conflict, though, remains a struggle. 'What you really are asking me about is how I bring that and package it together to enable a navy to win against a peer competitor,' he said Wednesday. 'That’s what’s new, and that’s where we’re just in the nascent stages of thinking about how to do that.' As a fleet commander, officers such as Caudle have a direct impact on the investment decisions Daly and his counterparts for aerial and subsurface unmanned technologies will make moving forward. While speaking to reporters, Daly acknowledged this and foreshadowed that his predictions about LUSV may or may not come to fruition. 'Until one of these doors that I’m pushing on shuts or slows me down, that’s where I'm going,' Daly said. But 'I'm just a two-star on the [chief of naval operations’] staff. There are fleet commanders … they put out [the] signal, and I’m responding to demand signal. So, I can certainly be overrun.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/navy-admiral-skeptical-of-large-usvs-future-amid-congressional-scrutiny/	2025-01-16T11:58:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Mariner-Side-View-scaled-e1661283313758.jpg
Biden approves executive order to strengthen cybersecurity for commercial satellite systems	US President Joe Biden delivers a prime-time address to the nation in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Oct. 19, 2023. Photographer: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — In a final push to lay a strong cybersecurity foundation for the incoming administration, President Joe Biden approved an executive order early today that addresses lessons learned in the cyber realm over the past four years, distinctly calling for practices that would protect commercial satellite systems against cyber attacks. 'The goal is to better understand how to better protect and secure these systems and stay ahead of new threats,' Anne Neuberger, outgoing deputy national security advisor for cybersecurity and emerging tech, told reporters in a call prior to the order’s release. The executive order mandates the development of new cyber contract requirements for 'agency-procured' space systems, which include the protection of command and control space systems and the use of 'secure hardware and software development practices.' 'Russia’s attack of Ukraine’s commercially provided military satellite communications systems the evening before it invaded Ukraine demonstrated the devastating impacts disruption of space infrastructure can bring,' a fact sheet on the executive order sent to reporters read. 'Cybersecurity threats to space systems have risen dramatically, threatening global critical infrastructure and communications.' Additionally, Biden’s order calls for the National Cyber Director to perform inventory on space ground systems and give recommendations to improve cyber defenses, adding that the disruption of such systems 'can bring global commerce to a halt and seriously impact national security.' The mandates published today have long been seen as necessary by the cybersecurity and space communities. For example, just last month the head of the Space Force's Space Development Agency Derek Tournear said that one of his biggest worries is ensuring cybersecurity across interconnected mesh networks made up of large numbers of small satellites — such as the agency's planned data transfer layer and the increasing numbers of commercial internet mega-constellations in low Earth orbit. Last spring, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) published a white paper listing several recommendations for space commercial systems, contending that there is an increased threat to such systems as space becomes more integrated into daily life. The report added that if there are not appropriate cybersecurity precautions in place, 'adversaries can access vulnerabilities within connected space systems to degrade our critical infrastructure and place our nation at risk.' Some recommendations that CISA made included: protecting payloads using network segregation and segmentation principles; limiting privileges and securely authenticating users to reduce exposure to malware; ensuring that appropriate protections and controls are implemented in the design, operation and maintenance of ground segments; and design systems with 'multiple layers' of defense, which include technical capabilities such as an Intrusion Detection System. In the event that a commercial space system belonging to the federal government does undergo a cyber attack, the executive order calls for 'centralized visibility,' meaning that CISA has the ability to conduct searches on all federal networks to ensure the attacker is not living on any other systems. 'If we find one particular technique that a foreign government has used to hack one particular federal agency, this now tasks CISA and gives CISA centralized visibility to hunt across all agency systems to ensure we're defending against this attack broadly,' Neuberger said Wednesday.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — Frank Calvelli was appointed as the Pentagon's first-ever senior acquisition executive in charge of military space programs — a position first mandated by Congress in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act — on May 5, 2022. As Air Force assistant secretary for acquisition and integration, he has been responsible for all Space Force-related spending, which came to approximately $20 billion last year when one combines the activities of Space Systems Command, the Space Development Agency (SDA) and the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (SpRCO). In an exclusive exit interview, Calvelli discussed his legacy, including his nine tenets, lessons learned and advice on acquisition reform to his successor and the Defense Department writ large. He said that while he is proud of the success so far by SDA in showing the Space Force the way on speeding satellite development, he also is urging his successors to judge programs not just on accelerating schedules but providing results for the warfighter. Also, keep in mind that in the acquisition process, he said, 'industry lies.' The following has been edited for clarity and brevity. BREAKING DEFENSE: What are you most proud of from your time here? CALVELLI: I think establishing a culture of project management discipline. And what I mean by that is we really put an emphasis on on understanding our programs and overseeing them properly. We did an emphasis on delivering on cost and schedule; &#8230; the ninth tenet, which was execution, is the most important one. We started doing quarterly program reviews with the program executive officers and reviewing cost, schedule, performance of all the portfolio. &#8230; And we started doing bi-weekly tag ups with each PEO walking through the status of programs. What is your biggest regret? OCX [Next Generation Operational Control System] is still not in ops. MORE: Calvelli's biggest regret: New GPS ground system still non-operational From what I can tell, there's been kind of a whole revamp of ground systems, trying to reorganize how they're being developed and/or integrated. Could you talk a little bit about that? There's a real diverse set of [acquisition] strategies out there for ground right now. And you know, we know the one-size, big bang approach of a giant, monolithic ground system, with one vendor &#8230; typically doesn't work. We've experienced that across government for decades. If you look across the board, a lot of experimentation is going on. You know, there's contracts that have large amounts of ID/IQs [indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity awards] that are doing task orders and the government acts as an integrator. There's ground pieces where, like the Evolved Strategic SATCOM or even on FORGE [Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution] which is doing missile warning, where they've broken it up into decent sized pieces &#8230; three to five elements, as opposed to having a monolithic ground [system]. I really give a lot of credit to SSC and SpRCO and SDA and others who are trying new approaches to ground that are other than this giant, &#8216;let's go hand a billion dollar contract to a big prime' [approach]. But I think the jury still out as to which approach will work the best. You were successful in getting the Contractor Responsibility Watch List (CRWL) program elevated to the level of your office in the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act. What do you think is going to happen with that? And what are your hopes for that? I'm big fan of the CRWL. It started at the NRO [National Reconnaissance Office, where Calvelli spent much of his career]. It just something the NRO did on its own. It wasn't any kind of law, and they use it quite effectively. I don't know what's gonna happen with it. It was implemented the first time last year by SSC, and it's been on the books since 2018, right? I'm very fortunate to have had [Gen.] Mike Guetlein as a leader at SSC, who is a great partner, and Mike worked that hard. I honestly don't know what's gonna happen with it. I hope they use it effectively. I think it's an amazing tool to have. I think other organizations have used it effectively. I hope that the Space Force and the Air Force continue [to use it]. Has the company that's on it come off yet? [Big sigh and eye roll.] Still on. There is a Space Force issue with NRO, and that's the understaffing issue that has been raised on the Hill. Is that an issue that can be perhaps resolved, given that the Space Force is small, by spreading the burden? I hope it gets worked positively, because I think that the NRO is an amazing training ground for our folks. What I have found is that officers and even civilians that go out there and do three or four years of the NRO come back with some really great habits on project management. And they're much stronger project managers by spending that time at the NRO. As you know, program management and acquisition itself is not easy. If it was easy, the Department of Defense would not have such a poor track record. Any opportunity we get to get folks at the NRO to get that kind of experience and expertise on acquisition &#8230; I think is only going to help the Space Force in the future. Are you happy with the where the Space Force is with acquisition training? There has been some concern expressed about that on the Hill. The issues that bother me more are not just Space Force-related. It's just the experience base across the whole Department of Defense. &#8230; What makes a really good acquisition professional especially on the satellite side of the house is experience and and time. What I've seen is that we send folks for a lot of training, but then they may not necessarily get the experience or time on station to actually take advantage of that, unlike the NRO, where we leave people in place for large periods of time, like many many years. The Department of Defense has a whole different culture, where every two years to three years you move people. And I think when you do that, no matter how smart the person is or how good they are, you just really don't have that much time in the seat to get the experience that you need. The big push I had for &#8216;build smaller systems' was tied to that. Because when you take somebody and you put them on a program that's gonna be seven years, you gotta expect there's gonna be a high turnover and then what you lose is ownership. &#8230; What I really want is total ownership, the whole experience through. When you start building stuff like that, take three years to go a smallsat, then it's a lot easier to get somebody to be in the job three years from the beginning to the end. If you had a magic wand, what one thing would you do with it? Send my wife and me to the beach? I don't know, I guess I would deliver all programs on cost and schedule. Every time we overrun a program we just rob our future. Overruns are like the worst thing we could possibly do, and it all comes down to getting the program up front right. I'm not sure we spend as much time as we should making sure that that RFP [request for proposals], those statements of work and that source selection is going to lead to an executable program. I think we need to get better at assessing schedule and cost realism as part of source selection evaluation. We have to avoid Taco Bell Syndrome. [Note bene: Where despite lack of contractor expertise, the cheapest bid wins]. I think, on any cost plus contract that we do, industry lies, okay? I mean, they do, they lie. It's a known fact at least, least, I grew up at the NRO knowing that fact. I'm not quite sure the Space Force knows that fact yet. Or the Department of Defense. They seem to trust industry more than they probably should. Is there anything I should have asked but didn't or that you want to tell me? Something I may have missed and I think is important: I have been a staunch advocate and supporter of SDA. I protected them as they transitioned into the Department of the Air Force, and over the last few years made sure they kept all their authorities and delegations. Proliferated small satellites for many mission areas, that can be built rapidly is without a doubt the way to go, and SDA is showing that direction. However, the big test comes this spring as Tranche 1 starts to launch. It will be critical that these satellites are initialized quickly, work, and then actually get used by operations (i.e. the Joint Force). It doesn’t matter how fast we build them if no one uses them. The Tranche 1 launches this spring will be the make or break moment for the Space Development Agency. If Tranche 1 launches, the satellites work as designed, and the capabilities are used by the operational community, then it’s a success. If not, the issue will not be the use of small satellites, but something with the SDA acquisition approach that will need to be reassessed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/exclusive-calvelli-cautions-space-force-sda-to-focus-on-program-results-know-that-industry-lies/	2025-01-16T10:10:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240228_calvelli_afa_warfare_8238576-scaled-e1709151317344.jpg
L3Harris CEO offers advice, criticizes Biden administration in new letter to DOGE heads	L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik (L) and Embraer CEO Francisco Gomes Neto pose in front of a KC-390 model during the 2022 AFA Conference. (L3Harris) WASHINGTON — If the incoming Trump administration is serious about using the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative to drive cost savings and drill down on Pentagon bureaucracy, it should start by rolling back government accounting rules as well as requirements on defense contractors to serve up detailed price data, the CEO of L3Harris wrote in an open letter. L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik’s letter to DOGE heads Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, published on the company's website on Wednesday, marks the first foray by an executive at a legacy defense prime into the emerging discourse on how the incoming administration can revitalize the American defense industrial base — a discussion that has typically been largely dominated by leaders from defense technology startups eager to shake things up such as Palantir, Anduril and SpaceX founder Musk. 'America’s current defense acquisition system is slow and bureaucratic and does not provide our warfighters with new capabilities at the speed of relevance to the threats they are facing. It has a structure and a culture that stifles innovation and discourages risk-taking,' wrote Kubasik, a defense industry veteran with stints at Lockheed Martin. 'I write to you today to express my desire to help the DOGE make America’s national defense ecosystem great again.' Kubasik’s letter outlines four ways he believes DOGE could reduce burdensome regulations on defense contractors and increase efficiency in the defense acquisition process. First, he calls for the elimination of government Cost Accounting Standard (CAS) requirements, which Kubasik argues are duplicative of the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles that defense contractors are already required to follow and impose a 'significant labor and cost burden on defense technology companies.' Although CAS requirements were originally established to reduce the risk of companies overcharging the government, Kubasik argues that the Pentagon’s transition from cost-plus contracts — a form of contracting used on developmental projects, where companies are paid for all expenses on a project — to fixed-price contracts — which cap the government’s financial contribution on a project — have already remedied this issue. 'Because CAS is mostly duplicative of GAAP, reasonable accounting standards and practices will still be maintained while greatly reducing regulatory burden, including a significant number of government audits that often take years to complete,' he wrote, adding that contractors will be able to reinvest audit-related savings into developing new technology. Kubasik also suggests reducing requirements for defense contractors to provide certified cost or pricing data, stating that current regulations add up to two years to the acquisition process and that the DoD already has a base of cost data it can use. Specifically, he recommends mandating such data only for large sole source acquisitions of platforms like naval ships or aircraft, or to raise the threshold for requiring cost data from $2 million to $500 million. 'By eliminating this requirement for a large number of acquisitions and negotiating costs in a free-market way, just like a consumer would do with any other commercial business, we can deliver critical capabilities into the hands of warfighters significantly faster and at a lower cost,' he wrote. Kubasik’s third recommendation is to create a central contracting organization in the Office of the Secretary of Defense that would be responsible for managing joint procurement programs for portfolios such as Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2). By merging the requirements of the military services under a single umbrella, the Pentagon will be able to make acquisition decisions and tradeoffs faster and more effectively, Kubasik argues. Finally, he recommends limiting the number of times a company can protest a contract award to three times per year, with contractors responsible for paying for the Government Accountability Office review if the protest is denied. 'This would discourage the obstructionist behavior we have seen in recent years and force contractors to utilize the protest option in only the most egregious cases. Most importantly, it will help prevent significant delays in delivering crucial capabilities to our warfighters,' he wrote. In a Jan. 16 note to investors, Robert Stallard of Vertical Research Partners called Kubasik’s recommendations 'all very sensible and relatively boring — so we’ll see if the First Bro [Musk] sees these as splashy enough to pursue.' RELATED: Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon's DOGE to wow Kubasik's letter follows the October 2024 publication of Palantir CTO Shyam Sankar's blueprint for defense reformation, a Martin Luther-inspired '18 Theses' that posits that consolidation in the military industrial base during the 1990s and 2000s has resulted in five bloated and ineffective defense primes. In 2022, Anduril published its own mission statement and call for defense industry rehabilitation, Rebooting the Arsenal of Democracy. Regardless of whether Musk or Ramaswamy decide to follow up on Kubasik’s specific suggestions, the L3Harris CEO’s letter could be a signal that executives at major legacy defense firms may be growing tired of playing second fiddle to their upstart counterparts in Silicon Valley and are seeking a more prominent and visible positioning near President-elect Donald Trump and his closest associates. If that’s the aim, Kubasik’s letter breaks from previous statements of defense prime CEOs in a key way. While execs typically keep their public comments apolitical or broadly supportive of White House leadership — as defense spending and national security issues are backed by both Republicans and Democrats — Kubasik at one point in the letter criticizes the Biden administration by name. 'During his first term, President Trump released a visionary plan for a 500-ship Navy that would include hundreds of unmanned maritime vessels, an efficient action designed to expand defense capability and leverage technology without the concurrent addition of more costly naval personnel,' he wrote. 'The Biden administration curtailed these plans despite near continual harassment of our ships in open waters by our nation’s enemies.' In the end, it's unclear how much power DOGE will have in reorienting the Pentagon bureacracy. Lawmakers have previously made clear that while efficiency is always good, they're skeptical of handing too much authority to Musk and Ramaswamy. Speaking at the Reagan Defense Forum, Republican Sen. Deb Fisher and Independent Rep. Angus King both essentially said that dealing with programmatic issues was Congress's job. RELATED: Despite huge industry losses, Air Force &#8216;not getting rid of fixed price contracts': Hunter Kubasik's call for less regulation — particularly the recommendations that could reduce transparency into the costs of making defense products — also might not have as receptive an audience within the Defense Department or with oversight bodies, due to past cases of defense contractors overcharging the Pentagon. In an interview with Breaking Defense, Space Force acquisition czar Frank Calvelli said that industry is not always truthful about the costs incurred during a program. 'I think, on any cost plus contract that we do, industry lies, okay? I mean, they do, they lie. It's a known fact at least, least, I grew up at the NRO [National Reconnaissance Office] knowing that fact. I'm not quite sure the Space Force knows that fact yet. Or the Department of Defense,' Calvelli said. 'They seem to trust industry more than they probably should.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/l3harris-ceo-offers-advice-criticizes-biden-administration-in-new-letter-to-doge-heads/	2025-01-16T09:08:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/l3_embraer-CEO-scaled.jpg
Investing in critical infrastructure will be ‘longest pole in the tent’ for Navy, says CNO	Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) Adm. Lisa Franchetti participates in a Q&amp;A session moderated by Vice Adm. (Ret.) Richard Hunt, after she delivered the keynote address at the 37th Surface Navy Association National Symposium in Arlington, Virginia, January 14, 2025. (US Navy photo by Senior Chief Mass Communication Specialist Elliott Fabrizio) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said maintaining the service’s bases and critical infrastructure will be one of the hardest targets to achieve as she sets the Navy’s priorities moving forward. The 'longest pole in the tent is our critical infrastructure because we have more debt in that area,' she told attendees at the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium this week. 'Identifying that critical infrastructure and making those right investments [and] that they're committing to stay steady on those investments, it’s going to make a difference over time.' Prioritizing investments in the Navy’s bases and facilities is part of the CNO’s recently published 'Navigation Plan' and associated 'Project 33,' a targeted effort at preparing the service for a conflict with China over Taiwan in 2027. Franchetti’s renewed focus on base investment mirrors a similar effort by Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith who acknowledged to lawmakers this past year that his service had not invested in its bases for the past two decades. Smith added that he 'will not apologize' for that fact because those dollars ultimately went towards keeping Marines in Afghanistan well equipped. Asked whether the Navy was at risk of going down the same hole — increased operational tempos overtaking investments in critical infrastructure — Franchetti told reporters that base modernization was directly connected to the force’s readiness. 'If you think about [Naval Air Station] Sigonella [in Italy], which is an airfield&#8230; [it's] a joint airfield for NATO, for Italy, we fly out of there. And, in a big rainstorm one day, the entire airfield flooded out, and it shut down air operations for two days.' 'That was an aha moment for me that I need to treat that base and the infrastructure just like I would treat an aircraft carrier to get it underway,' she added. Franchetti said she has tasked one of the key senior officers overseeing the Navy’s logistics, who the service internally refers to as the N4, with prioritizing particular bases and facilities for investment. 'We have to commit to making some investment every year to be able to buy down this debt that we have accumulated in our infrastructure,' she said. 'Everything that we need to do [our job] is on our bases and places, and we need to have world class facilities that people can work from and really generate our warfighting advantage from every day.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/investing-in-critical-infrastructure-will-be-longest-pole-in-the-tent-for-navy-says-cno/	2025-01-16T07:50:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250116_franchetti_sna_2025_8831221-scaled-e1737037714873.jpg
How automation and artificial intelligence can help warfighters in high-stress situations	Air Force Special Tactics operators observe the range before conducting close air support training during Emerald Warrior 23 at Eglin Range, Fla., in 2023. Emerald Warrior is the largest joint special operations exercise involving U.S. Special Operations Command forces training to respond to various threats. (Photo credit: Air Force Staff Sgt. Jerreht Harris). What it means to be in-the-loop, on-the-loop, and out of the loop has significantly improved when it comes to decision making due to warfighters having access to automation and artificial intelligence. With those tools, they can keep pace and make sense of the ever-growing mountain of data so decisions can be made on accelerated timelines. Tim Heiser is director of defense programs at Teague. 'Today's threats are ever increasing, along with the number of decisions that need to be made,' said Tim Heiser, director of defense programs at Teague.'The challenge is in designing automation and AI systems that prioritize data that aligns with the values and priorities of the commands and their missions.' Effective user experiences (UX) and user interfaces (UI) make it possible for warfighters to strategically employ automation and AI, and Teague – a firm with 99 years of experience pioneering human-centered design within complex systems and emerging technologies – is making that possible today in aerospace and defense. In, on, and out of the loop The three levels of human involvement in autonomous systems are part of the control theory that governs machines and physical/engineered processes. Warfighters in the loop that have AI enablements to fuse data from multiple sensors, for example, have the option to use the software to improve their command and control decision-making process by proposing certain scenarios or battle plans. Here, commanders control the situation and would need to opt in to any of those battle plans and adopt it as a plan of record. Today, warfighters remain in the loop when there are ethical concerns, long-term implications, or lives at stake. Being on the loop, on the other hand, becomes more of a veto or opt-out scenario. In a time-constrained situation that a fighter pilot might encounter an incoming missile threat, for example, automation software activates defensive maneuvers and countermeasures, and if the pilot does not intervene or override that maneuver then they’re automatically executed. The pilot has enough visibility to veto the action, but the system will take action otherwise. This sort of automation has been in place for many years. Unlike being in or on the loop, out of the loop refers to complete automation, with no human approval process. This level of automation is rarely seen today, especially in military contexts. Regardless of the position of the individual within the system, automation and AI are here to stay and the human-machine interface will be a vital ingredient in accelerating all OODA (observe, orient, decide, act) loops. Clint Rule is principal director of design at Teague. 'That’s been happening in pockets for some time but more and more we are hitting a critical mass where many operations are experiencing at least some degree of autonomous operation or AI enablement,' said Clint Rule, principal director of design, Teague. 'There’s clear acknowledgement that these capabilities will transform doctrine.' It’s accelerated by the Defense Department’s embrace of commercial technology and best practices that bring industry knowledge and innovation to the challenges presented by adversaries such as China and Russia. Enabling architectures like Joint All Domain Command and Control demand that capabilities be developed with the speed and agility that’s seen in the commercial marketplace – where innovation is measured in months, not years. 'The threats of today and tomorrow are at varying levels of technology and speed,' said Heiser. 'Having the capability to quickly understand each threat and make the decision to engage or not is critical. Today, the decision loop can be quite long, with built-in checks and balances that don't necessarily add value to the task at hand. 'By simplifying the system to keep only the most important decisions in the loop and move oversight tasks to a more automated level, our warfighters will be more effective.' An XQ-58A Valkyrie launches for a test mission at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., in 2023. Artificial intelligence algorithms, developed and trained by the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Autonomous Air Combat Operations, were integrated into the XQ-58A. The algorithms used neural networks to fly the vehicle against simulated opponents using simulated mission systems and mock weapons. (Photo credit: Air Force 2nd Lt. Rebecca Abordo). Attention to design in autonomous tools In a defense world where automation and AI become increasingly relevant, improving the warfighter’s UX/UI will lead to prioritized and more straightforward decision making. Teague’s value in this respect comes in understanding norms and best practices on how humans engage with systems and data. 'We research the ‘people side’ of a problem first, before moving to a technology solution,' said Heiser. 'That’s because the real-life users should inform the design of the tech, not the other way around. It hasn’t typically been that way, in defense. 'Without user engagement up front during design, you’re going to lose the ability to create systems that work better for users in, on, and out of the loop. What makes Teague unique in this journey is understanding how people engage with data to make decisions and then designing for those situations specifically.' A growing acknowledgement of the importance of UX/UI in systems design is part of a broader disruption happening in defense where commercial best practices in software development, for example, has made the use of DevSecOps mandatory for defense systems that need to be updateable as threats evolve. Integrated air and missile defense fits that bill, as does Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2), as well as satellite payloads for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. 'With the current conflicts on different irregular battlefields, there’s a general sense that we have to move faster than we have in the past,' said Rule. 'Software is a very different beast than what the military has been dealing with when it comes to procurement and setting requirements.' There's also a growing sensibility around the tools that users and warfighters are required to engage with on the job. People are experiencing what some call the Sunday-Monday divide where the tools they use on the weekend are at a significantly higher level of capability with better ease of use than what they’re utilizing during their work week. By not ensuring a good UX/UI in the development of those tools – especially those used in kill chains where lives are at stake – warfighters can be hindered in their ability to take full advantage of the technology and the data it generates. Non-intuitive systems also take longer for warfighters to train on, with more personnel required for some tasks. 'Teague provides human-centered design for technology,' said Rule. 'We work on autonomous tech with defense suppliers, tech companies like AWS, and large automotive companies and startups.' 'Teague is able to bring in expertise from different organizations working across cutting edge technology to better understand how humans operate in complex environments. This is a perfect fit for the precipice that the military is currently at as technology, automation, and artificial intelligence explodes for them.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/how-automation-and-artificial-intelligence-can-help-warfighters-in-high-stress-situations/	2025-01-16T07:13:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/DoD-AI-230426-F-ZD833-1026Y.jpg
Nearly 100 countries have acquired cellphone spyware ‘and they’re using it’: Official	A phone with computer code. (Getty) WASHINGTON — While the exact number is likely classified, the head of the US government's dedicated counterintelligence organization said that by now 'nearly 100' nations have purchased advanced spyware designed to crack into cellphones, 'and they're using it.' 'I think what you see is an increasing number of countries investing in spyware, frankly, specifically targeted at cellphones and all that things we carry around with us and put information on,' said Michael Casey, head of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC). 'Everyone knows about the NSO Group, but there are dozens of these companies.' Casey said the tech is increasingly available not only to governments, but to non-state actors like criminal and ransomware groups — 'whoever wants to use it and get on your phone.' 'And so this is an increasing threat, and [it's] increasingly easy for people to use. Some of these products are plug and play,' he said in a Tuesday webinar put on by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. NSO Group, an Israeli software developer, was blacklisted by the US government in 2021 'based on evidence that' it was among entities that 'developed and supplied spyware to foreign governments that used these tools to maliciously target government officials, journalists, businesspeople, activists, academics, and embassy workers,' according to the Commerce Department. (In 2022, NSO Group defended itself in part by arguing that 'cyber intelligence technologies are necessary to address international threats of terrorism and other serious crimes' and said that while it has no visibility into how its customers use its product, the company 'has terminated contracts when a misuse by the customers was found.') But as Casey said, NSO Group is hardly the only player in town. Casey said the spyware market is a 'huge growth business.' 'There's a reason why there are dozens of companies selling this product now. It's very profitable for a lot of them,' he said. Casey's estimation that nearly 100 countries have purchased some form of cellphone spyware suggests the market has grown a bit since April 2023 when Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (another NCSC) said more than 80 capitals had acquired the tech. 'For dozens of states without a skills base, the commercial sector is almost certainly transformational, allowing cost-effective access to capability that would otherwise take decades to develop,' the UK NCSC's said in a report then. 'While these tools have been used by states against law enforcement targets, spyware has almost certainly been used by some states in the targeting of journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents and opponents and foreign government officials. This is almost certainly happening at scale, with thousands of individuals targeted each year.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/nearly-100-countries-have-acquired-cellphone-spyware-and-theyre-using-it-official/	2025-01-16T06:31:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250115_cell_hacking_GettyImages-1174418589-e1736967351377.jpg
Anduril picks Columbus for new ‘Arsenal’ factory, targets July 2026 to begin production	A sign for Anduril at the AFA 2022 Air, Space and Cyber Conference. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Anduril Industries has selected Columbus, Ohio to be home to a new, large-scale weapons production site, as the defense startup seeks to scale its production capacity for autonomous systems like drones. The facility, dubbed 'Arsenal-1,' will start by taking over an existing structure located next to Rickenbacker Airport, Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose told reporters in a Wednesday briefing ahead of the company’s announcement. In total, Anduril plans to invest $1 billion of internal funds to bring the factory to fruition, including future plans to expand the 700,000 square foot facility to five million square feet. Taking over an existing footprint means that by July 2026, the site can be up and producing weapons, Brose said. 'Arsenal-1 is going to be an operational facility incredibly quickly because of the timelines we have to deliver for the customers and the warfighters who are counting on the systems that Anduril is producing right now,' he said. Ohio is offering financial incentives, the state’s Lieutenant Governor, Jon Husted, said during the briefing. According to Husted, the expected 4,000 total staff — the facility will start at around 300 and grow its workforce over roughly a decade’s time — makes it the single largest jobs project measured by employment in the state’s history. The selection of Columbus gives Anduril the 15-member Ohio delegation as a champion in Congress, as the company seeks to gain a greater foothold at the Pentagon. However, Brose dismissed the idea that politics played a role in the selection, saying 'This decision was made on the merits of the state of Ohio, period. Full stop.' Arsenal will produce the majority of Anduril's product line, though Brose said the other company's production sites will not be impacted or moved to Arsenal. A few specific items will likely not end up in Ohio, however: The solid rocket motors the company currently manufactures in Mississippi will not be produced at Arsenal since energetics will need to stay separate, Brose said, and munitions probably wouldn’t be fitted to autonomous systems there either for the same reason. Through the Arsenal concept, Anduril says it is answering the call of government officials who have said the US needs more capacity for not just high-end items but also lower-cost weapons like the tens of thousands of autonomous systems the company hopes to eventually be capable of producing annually at the the factory. In a roundtable with reporters on Wednesday, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the incoming Trump administration should sustain US momentum on increasing munitions production and shoring up the defense industrial base, with investments needed for both exquisite weaponry traditionally made by the defense contractors as well as large numbers of simple, attritable systems that can expand magazine depth at low costs. 'What we have seen from the democratization of technology — the Shahed drones, the Houthi missiles — they can rapidly create things that are much simpler than what the United States produces,' Sullivan said. 'They're not as good, but are certainly good enough to have significant battlefield effect and with particularly secret technologies, getting advances there can be pretty precise,' he continued. 'That's a hard thing to get Congress interested in, or the Pentagon interested in. ‘Hey, why don't we actually build, in a way, less precisely effective missiles, but a whole lot more of them in addition to the super precise ones?’' &#8211;Valerie Insinna contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/anduril-picks-columbus-for-new-arsenal-factory-targets-july-2026-to-begin-production/	2025-01-16T02:00:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/220920_KATZ_Anduril_sign-scaled-e1709168149747.jpg
Chinese military delegation to make rare visit to Japan, experts see pre-Trump prep	Japanese and Chinese flag pair on desk. (Getty images) SYDNEY — For the first time in five years, China has sent a sizable military delegation to Japan for a week-long visit. The purpose of the visit by a delegation from the Eastern Theater Command, according to a Monday statement from the Chinese military, is to 'strengthen mutual understanding and trust, while advancing defense exchanges between the two countries.' Likewise, a senior Japanese official, Yoshimasa Hayashi, told reporters that the 'promotion of mutual understanding and trust through frank communication at [the] commanders' level will contribute to the building of constructive and stable relations between Japan and China. 'We think this visit contributes to the peace and stability of the region,' Hayashi, who serves as the chief cabinet secretary, told reporters in Tokyo. But analysts and experts told Breaking Defense that below the surface, the timing of the rare meeting could signal that Chinese leader Xi Jinping is attempting to improve relations with its Asian rival amid the transfer of power in the US, as both Beijing and Tokyo brace for potentially market-moving tariff's under incoming US President Donald Trump. 'This is a relatively big deal. Both Japan and China would be thinking about how to position themselves to best advantage in the face of imminent and probable tariff hikes,' John Blaxland, head of the Australian National University's Washington office, offered in an email to Breaking Defense. He said China and Japan have 'highly interdependent economies and have clear motives to look to calm things down and focus on managing Trump.' Bonnie Glaser, China expert at the German Marshall Fund, agreed that even though the delegation is a military one, economic issues are percolating in the background. 'For both economic and strategic reasons, China may hope to use the opportunity presented by the political transition in the US to stabilize ties with Japan,' Glaser wrote. In addition, she said China could be 'trying to drive a wedge between Japan and the US. Beijing likely hopes Tokyo will give [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] a state visit this year.' Hayashi's mention of communication at 'commanders' level' is noteworthy, as that's the level of communication US officials have long-sought with the People's Liberation Army despite an at-times icy reception. And though the US and Japan are close allies, Blaxand warned not to 'read too much into' the meeting as a sign the Chinese-US military relationship will improve. Malcolm Davis, a China expert at the Australian Strategic and Policy Institute, agreed, predicting 'there will be the usual regular contact between the two major powers on defense issues, but the relationship is still highly competitive and contested.' A recent sign of that competitiveness, China recently unveiled what appeared to be two new advanced aircraft, prompting a senior Air Force official to tell Breaking Defense that Beijing could 'beat [the US] to the punch' in the race for a sixth-generation fighter jet. On Wednesday Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Eric Smith mentioned another hot button issue: the presence of US troops in Japan and the agreement with Tokyo to move many of them from Okinawa to Guam in coming years — a move likley welcomed by Beijing as it lowers US troop presence closer to what Smith called the 'crisis theater.' 'That's obviously a domestic issue for the Japanese to decide, but what I do know is every time you give China a foot, they take a mile,' Smith told reporters at a Defense Writers Group event in Washington. Davis said competition between China and the US is 'only going to intensify with the Trump administration, particularly given Trump's determination to impose sweeping tariffs on Beijing,' Davis said. 'But even so, some sort of dialogue will continue, if only to minimise the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculation leading to a crisis or conflict in areas such as the South China Sea.' The bottom line for this week's series of meetings, on the national security side of the fence, may be whether China changes its behavior around the many islands that make up Japan. In late August last year, a Chinese aircraft briefly penetrated Japanese airspace, ringing alarm bells in the region. Chinese Coast Guard ships have often sailed close to the Japanese Senkaku Islands and its warships steam the waters close to Okinawa. 'I suppose what matters is whether PRC operations and deployments near Japan change and how,' Ian Chong, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore, wrote in an email. 'There is no information about the latter at the moment.'

Don’t blow the budget on ChatGPT: Army CIO sounds alarm on big bills for GenAI	U.S. Army Capt. Michael Holder, a military police officer assigned to V Corps, analyzes a computer during Allied Spirit at U.S. Army Garrison Bavaria Grafenwöhr on March 6, 2023. (U.S. Army photo by Pfc. Myenn LaMotta) WASHINGTON — The generative AI explosion that began with ChatGPT has led some Army organizations to run up big and unexpected bills, the service’s chief information officer told reporters Tuesday. Getting GenAI costs under control will be a major focus for a forthcoming rollout of best practices and new policies, expected by April, Leonel Garciga said. But in the meantime, said Garciga, maybe think a little harder before you click. 'Part of this is, let’s not have a bazillion flowers blooming in this space,' Garciga said. 'That gets expensive very fast and it gets really hard to protect our data. Let’s be a little bit more deliberate in our approach.' Garciga and his chief ally in the Army’s procurement shop, deputy assistant secretary for acquisition Jennifer Swanson, combined their previously separate generative AI pilot projects, #CalibrateAI and Athena, back in November. Now they’re analyzing those experiments and preparing comprehensive guidance for the Army: lessons-learned, best practices, and, in a cases, mandatory do’s and don’ts. What’s not coming, they emphasized: new money. The guidance package will be published by the time the Athena pilot ends in April, Garciga said. 'We’ve been hyperfocused on this idea of how we put out guidance across the force, in a bunch of different areas, to make sure that… we’re actually buying the right things and the right secure things,' he told reporters. Added Swanson: 'How we control costs is really important, because what we certainly don't want to end up with is a massive cloud compute bill. &#8230; That's a big part of what we're doing.' Different organizations within the service will use their own budgets and make their own choices about the best GenAI to buy — within the parameters of the guidance — rather than having a top-down mandate or Army-wide program everyone is required to use, she said. 'There isn't enterprise funding that we're applying to this. It doesn't exist,' Swanson emphasized. 'Everybody is gonna use their money. But we want to make sure that we're all using our money smartly and that we all understand what we're getting into before we go shopping.' There is a silver lining to this fiscal storm-cloud, Garciga and Swanson said. The good news is that the Army’s GenAI experiments have shown there are lots of commercially available tools, lots of Army organizations eager to try them out, and a growing list of promising applications. For instance, Large Language Models can help acquisition officers understand lengthy proposals from vendors, help counsel sort through voluminous regulations, or help public affairs officers keep track of social media. There’s also some promise for GenAI to help write software code, they said, although so far, said Swanson — an oldschool coder who cut her teeth on FORTRAN — it’s hardly ready to replace human developers. These near-term possibilities are overwhelmingly in 'back office' business processes that have lots of overlap with how private companies operate, Garciga noted. More military-specific applications, like sharing targeting data or controlling unmanned combat vehicles, tends to require other kinds of AI. Even where functions seems to similar, he said, civilian GenAI may not translate well to military contexts. When the Army looked at aviation safety software for its helicopter fleet, he said as an example, 'we just kept on getting responses from FAA stuff that had nothing to do with our rotary wings, or we started getting responses from all the work NASA’s doing.' That experience shows that whether GenAI is viable really depends on the particular problem you’re trying to solve, Garciga said. 'It taught us the lesson that that we really need to understand the data sets we're working with,' he explained. 'Sometimes people come [to the CIO] and they're like, ‘We're gonna throw an LLM at it!’' The other lesson is that not all GenAI products follow the (admittedly evolving) best practices on controlling costs. While limited versions of ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Twitter’s Grok, and so on are free for anyone to use, it takes expensive and power-hungry GPUs to run GenAI algorithms. When a private business or government organization signs a contract to use GenAI, some vendors have told Breaking Defense they offer paid models that include near-instant billing for each query and can automatically cut off a user if their activity gets too expensive. Most cloud service providers have been 'really good' at putting in 'hard stops' and other such 'guardrails,' Garciga said. But a lot of GenAI computing power is still paid for under more traditional cloud-computing contracts. Those arrangements may not send the customer a bill until the end of the month — long after a few overly broad queries or a few hyperactive users can burn through the budget for cloud services. 'If it’s Quarter One and you’ve spent 50 percent of your budget in cloud already, we’ve got to have a conversation,' he chuckled. The forthcoming guidance, Garciga and Swanson said, will help Army organizations sort through which GenAIs are best for what purposes and which vendors follow best practices on cost, billing, and cybersecurity.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/dont-blow-the-budget-on-chatgpt-army-cio-sounds-alarm-on-big-bills-for-genai/	2025-01-15T12:21:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/240620_DVIDS_nato_computers-scaled-e1718884824694.jpg
Calvelli’s biggest regret: New GPS ground system still non-operational	GPS IIIF (Lockheed Martin image) WASHINGTON — Frank Calvelli, outgoing assistant secretary of the Air Force for space acquisition and integration, says his biggest regret is that he was unable to shepherd the long-delayed upgraded ground system for the GPS satellite constellation. In an exclusive interview with Breaking Defense on Monday, he said the Next-Generation Operational Control System (OCX) program 'has made progress over the last two, two-and-a-half years, [but] it's not as fast as I had hoped it had been. 'I think they're going to get there, and it's probably within the next year, but I would like to have seen OCX get transitioned to operations during my tour,' Calvelli added. In a September 2024 report by the Government Accountability Office, Space Force officials said they now expect operational acceptance of GPS in December 2025 (if no new problems crop up). OCX, under development by RTX Space (formerly Raytheon) for nigh on 15 years, is needed to allow some 700 weapon systems across the US military to fully access the encrypted M-code GPS signal that will be harder for adversaries to jam. OCX Block 3F, which is the final planned version of the update, will be needed to allow Space Force Guardians to operate the GPS Follow-On, or GPS IIIF, constellation, currently expected to begin launching in 2027. GPS IIIF will sport improved cybersecurity, a laser retroreflector to increase tracking accuracy, and a nuclear detonation detector, among other enhancements. 'OCX is the lynch-pin. We can't really do anything [without it],' Calvelli said. On the upside, he said, Space Systems Command (SSC), the primary acquisition command for the Space Force, has 'accelerated' OCX operational testing after a program revamp in October. 'One of the things that I hated that they were doing from day one was, they were going to sign off and do what's called the DD250 before they really went hot heavy into testing with operators,' Calvelli explained — with DD250 being a form that signals government acceptance of a good or service. 'I'd never seen that before in my career, where the government accepts something that hasn't really been fully tested. &#8230;You never want to accept something until you've actually had the operators actually test drive it and find all the bugs' The October restructuring, Calvelli said, halted the acceptance process and instead moved forward operational testing. 'And so far, we're seeing the payoff,' he added. Calvelli stressed that GPS is vital not just to warfighters, but to the nation writ large — and advocated for continued financial support for both the main constellation of 35 satellites (31 active and four spares) in geosynchronous Earth orbit, as well as the planned 'resilient' constellation in medium Earth orbit. 'GPS is a fantastic system. We're always going to be building it. &#8230; And the Lockheed team is doing a wonderful job with the spacecraft. I would argue, though, that 35 spacecraft on orbit isn't that many, and that you would really like to make that [constellation] more resilient. You'd like to see a smaller set of satellites that could be proliferated,' he said. 'I mean, if you think about it, GPS is almost like national infrastructure, right?,' Calvelli added. '[W]e pushed really hard here for a resilient GPS program. We used the &#8216;quick start' authority to actually do some studies, that [now are] under contract, underway, today. And I hope that Congress will support the continuation of resilient GPS, because I think that not having a backup to GPS is is not a good thing for the nation.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/calvellis-biggest-regret-new-gps-ground-system-still-non-operational/	2025-01-15T10:59:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/44448277780_237ee249a8_c-e1736948804550.jpg
Pentagon needs to ‘divest to invest,’ embrace more nimble procurement: Defense Innovation Board	Defense Innovation Board chair Michael R. Bloomberg speaks at the board’s fall meeting, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Oct. 17, 2022. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — This week the Defense Innovation Board and other defense thought leaders released suggestions on how the Pentagon should rethink some of its major strategies related to innovation, warning that if it doesn’t, there could be severe national security consequences. 'The world is changing very rapidly, and if we don't do something, there's an awful lot of dangers, everything that we've built in the last 250 years can be thrown away,' chair of the DIB and former New York City mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said during a quarterly DIB meeting Monday. During the meeting and in a report that came out afterwards, Bloomberg and a few outside contributors urged the Pentagon, Congress and industry to divest from legacy systems and change procurement processes, especially when it comes to dealing with nontraditional companies. The report, titled 'A Blueprint for Breakthroughs in Defense Innovation,' outlined a handful of suggestions; one being to shift DoD resources to innovative programs. 'The Department of Defense’s nearly $900 billion annual budget is a massive resource, yet much of it is locked into maintaining outdated systems rather than advancing innovation. Budget documents show that nearly 40% of the DoD’s budget is allocated to operations and maintenance, much of which sustains legacy systems rather than modernizing critical capabilities,' the report reads. A more 'viable' option for the DoD, according to the report, is a 'divest to invest' strategy which calls to redistribute as much as 15 percent of current Pentagon budget resources from legacy systems to new capabilities. In terms of procurement, the authors of the report suggest that the Pentagon should treat nontraditional defense companies differently from traditional ones. Specifically, the report called the DoD to move its procurement efforts for innovative technologies out from under the planning, programming, budgeting, and execution (PPBE) system into an 'alternative pipeline' that 'prioritizes urgency and flexibility.' Though the report lacked details on what exactly such a pipeline would look like, the authors emphasized that the Pentagon will have to ditch its risk-averse attitude to make it happen. 'Despite having alternative authorities to accelerate processes, the default remains slow-moving, traditional programs of record that minimize risk and leave valuable solutions untapped. Combatant Commands depend on the Services which favor these incremental improvements aligned with entrenched doctrines and domains, resisting transformative changes that challenge the status quo,' the report stated. Similarly, DIB board member Gilda Barabino, who also serves as the president of Olin College of Engineering, laid out several of the board's suggestions for how the Pentagon should act on nontraditional companies to enhance innovation. One such suggestion was the creation of a nontraditional vendor investment review committee overseen by the Secretary of Defense’s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, she said during Monday's meeting. The board also recommended that the Pentagon should streamline security clearance requirements for nontraditional vendors, 'including establishing a central credentialing authority' which would allow vendors greater access to sensitive compartmented information facilities, commonly known as SCIFs. On a more granular level, Barabino said the board agrees that there should be a rapid integrated scalable enterprise program — a platform designed for small business to showcase their innovative tech and try to get it quickly integrated into acquisition programs — as a small business innovation research (SBIR) or small business technology transfer (STTR) permanent phase three fund. Phase three funds are provided to small businesses to deploy innovative tech by outside sources that do not qualify as SBIR/STTR vendors. Putting the rapid integrated scalable enterprise program in a permanent phase three fund would mean that the nontraditional vendors involved in the program would have a constant access to outside funds, which would come from a 'variety of sources, either additional appropriations or pooled funds from existing programs,' Barabino said Monday. In both the report and during the DIB meeting, Bloomberg acknowledged the hard work and time that went into the numerous suggestions, but said they are no good unless they are acted upon. 'We have a long ways to go, and it's a very dangerous world out there, getting more dangerous every single day,' he said. 'Somehow or another, we've got to find ways to deal with that and to not throw in the towel and make some terrible, tragic mistakes, which, in this day and age, could lead to calamity.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/pentagon-needs-to-divest-to-invest-embrace-more-nimble-procurement-defense-innovation-board/	2025-01-15T09:22:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/7467530-scaled-e1736885904170.jpg
State of Navy’s shipboard laser efforts is embarrassing, says top fleet commander	A concept drawing of Lockheed Martin's HELIOS weapon system for the US Navy. (Photo courtesy of Lockheed Martin.) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — A top Navy fleet commander says the service should be 'embarrassed' by the fact it hasn’t managed yet to scale directed energy weapons onboard its ships despite having experimented with the technology since the Reagan administration. 'There’s been many a thesis and dissertation written on building lasers on ships, but we’ve not transitioned that into a place where that’s an acceptable way to actually take out missile systems,' Adm. Daryl Caudle, commander of US Fleet Forces Command, told a group of reporters today at the Surface Navy Association's annual symposium. 'These things are based on renewable energy, so I can recharge the system &#8230; I don't have to worry about payload [or] volume with directed energy. All those things are appealing to a navy, [but] we just haven't really matriculated that into a place &#8230; that's ready for prime time,' he continued. Caudle is not the first admiral to sound off about his frustrations with the service’s progress on directed energy, but he may be the most senior. During last year’s symposium, Vice Adm. Brendan McLane, the top surface warfare officer, and Rear Adm. Fred Pyle, who was the surface warfare requirements director at that time, both weighed in with similar sentiments. 'Sometimes we have a tendency to over promise and under deliver,' Pyle told attendees then. 'We need to flip that to where, when we’re intellectually honest, when we’re honest with ourselves from a technology capability, that we have an agreed upon sight picture of what it’s going to look like to deliver that capability.' Indeed, the service has had a myriad of scattered projects that resulted in functional lasers and even a handful of successful demonstrations knocking out practice targets. But all those efforts either remain stuck in a laboratory or as a one-off effort only sent and deployed to a single warship. Pressed for what needs to change, Caudle was candid that it’s not clear to him what is continuing to go wrong. 'I just think sometimes something can stare us right in the face, but we just don’t go do it,' he said. 'Directed energy is one of those things that either industry, politically, leadership — we're just not on the same page of getting behind it with a sense of urgency and making it ready to go.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/state-of-navys-shipboard-laser-efforts-is-embarrassing-says-top-fleet-commander/	2025-01-15T08:24:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/HELIOS_For-Release-e1641933079131.jpg
Italy sets up $289 million Skynex air defense deal with Rheinmetall	Italy is set to become the first NATO country to acquire Rheinmetall's Skynex air defense system (Rheinmetall) BELFAST — The Italian Army has placed an order with the Italian branch of Germany’s Rheinmetall for a first Skynex air defense system, part of a wider contract that includes an option to acquire an additional three platforms, according to a statement released by the manufacturer today. Rheinmetall noted that the option 'could' be signed in 2027 and if finalized the entire acquisition will have a value of almost €280 million ($289 million). The Italian Ministry of Defence did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The initial system under contract, dubbed a 'pilot' platform, is worth €73 million and is scheduled for first delivery in Q2 2026. The deal also covers related items including ammunition, spare parts, training, and maintenance services. The Italian buy marks the first NATO country to buy the air defense system, which led the company to state 'The successful order is thus an important corner stone in Rheinmetall's strategy of establishing a new standard in the field of cannon-based air defence for international armed forces.' Each Skynex system comprises of a sensor and tracking unit for air surveillance, a control station and four Revolver Gun Mk3 35mm firing units. From a capability perspective, the automatic cannon boasts a rate of fire of 1,000 rounds per minute and a range of up to 4km. 'Skynex is based on the concept of separating the airspace surveillance from the effectors,' added Rheinmetall. 'Italy has opted for the configuration with the XTAR 3D radar from Rheinmetall, which can monitor the airspace in a radius of up to 50 km.' Skynex is already under contract with Austria, Romania, Qatar and, most notably, Ukraine. In the statement, Rheinmetall claimed Skynex systems 'are already proving their quality to the Ukrainian armed forces in the harsh conditions of war, protecting people and property from airborne threats.' Skynex, said the company, has delivered 'operational successes' over the course of the conflict with Russia, 'especially' against cruise missiles and drones. Defense cooperation between Rheinmetall and Italy is particularly robust as the two have also linked arms on heavy combat vehicle projects. In that regard, the manufacturer said it is 'expecting large-volume orders' corresponding to Italy's main battle tank and Lynx armored infantry combat system programs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/italy-sets-up-289-million-skynex-air-defense-deal-with-rheinmetall/	2025-01-15T06:55:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Skynex-ITA_2-scaled-e1736946171828.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: Air Force reworking approach for T-7A Red Hawk, delaying production by 1 year	APT-2, the first T-7A Red Hawk for the USAF, flies over Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. (Air Force photo by Bryce Bennett) WASHINGTON — The Air Force is changing course for the development of the T-7A Red Hawk training jet, delaying a key milestone by a year while offering new cash opportunities for prime contractor Boeing in exchange for changes to the aircraft, according to service acquisition chief Andrew Hunter. Under the new plan, the start of the trainer's production phase, or Milestone C decision, will be pushed back to 2026. To counter that delay, the Air Force will acquire four new production-representative aircraft to provide extra testing capacity, which Hunter said can help accelerate aspects of the program so that initial operational capability (IOC) can be achieved in 2027. Fielding the T-7A, meant to replace the service's fleet of T-38 Talons, is 'critical,' Hunter said in a Monday interview at the Pentagon. 'And the question is, how do we just make sure for AETC [Air Education and Training Command] that we deliver?' Steve Parker, the interim CEO of Boeing's defense division, said in a statement to Breaking Defense Tuesday that 'we appreciate the partnership with the U.S. Air Force and are committed to providing our warfighters with the safest, most-advanced training system in the world. This innovative approach allows us to provide a production-ready configuration to the Air Force prior to low-rate initial production, further reducing any future risk to production. This will accelerate the path to delivering the critical capability on the timeline the Air Force needs.' Pressure has been mounting on the Air Force and Boeing amid delays for the Red Hawk program that is already years behind schedule, forcing the service to rely longer on the aging Talon. Budget documents released last spring indicated plans to halve the jet’s procurement in fiscal 2025 and forecast that IOC would be reached in 2028, a delay of roughly two years compared to the program's original 2018 baseline. Under the new approach, IOC is instead projected in November 2027, and money previously planned for procurement in FY25 would be put back into R&amp;D to fund the acquisition of the four aircraft — as long as lawmakers sign off. Getting to IOC by that time ensures the program meets AETC's 'need date' for the Red Hawk, according to an Air Force official. The official said the four aircraft can help the test campaign with tasks like evaluating mission systems and participating in formation flying, but are not planned to be specially instrumented like developmental jets currently being used for flight testing. The new planes will count toward satisfying the program’s IOC criteria, consisting of 14 aircraft that can be used to begin 'curriculum development and training' for AETC, with deliveries expected in FY26. As part of a new 'active management' strategy, Hunter said the Air Force would allocate 'significant funds' toward incentive agreements with Boeing to address issues that were not originally envisioned when the plane’s fixed-price development contract was negotiated. He did not specify how much money the Air Force is setting aside for the purpose, though the trainer's overall budget for FY25 would remain the same at $362 million, according to the Air Force official. Hunter additionally indicated the money was not going towards fixes Boeing was supposed to have already done. 'It's not work scope that Boeing would have to do necessarily anyway in order to deliver the jet,' he explained. Instead, it’s items that 'in order for it to be an effective trainer for the Air Force, we need these things.' For example, Hunter said incentives could be used to boost the jet’s range. 'What we've determined as part of our testing process is there's actually significantly more range available, but it costs money to achieve that, and it's not required by the contract,' he said. 'So one of the things we want to incentivize Boeing is, ‘Hey, if you can make relatively simple changes and give us that additional range, we want it.’' The trainer’s fixed-price development contract Boeing signed in 2018 has left the aerospace giant on the hook for cost overruns since, leading to over a billion dollars in losses to date and what Hunter described as out of synch priorities between the Air Force and the company. 'The nature of the contract, it's not a bad contract, but increasingly, over time, as you get further and further from the center point of what the contract was designed to do, the incentives get more and more misaligned,' Hunter said. Previously, '[Boeing’s] incentive was to stop losing additional money and to reduce the risk of additional losses. And our incentive was, we want the airplane,' he said. Following the new agreement, as well as advancements in the test campaign and progress on Boeing’s end to mitigate supply chain issues, 'now we’re aligned, and that gives me a lot of confidence in the relationship [with Boeing] going forward.' The Air Force official added that the 'underlying fixed-price agreement still applies,' but that 'future requirements discovered during test not covered by the incentive agreement will be evaluated by the Air Force. While no specific incentive allocations have been made, incentives under consideration largely relate to on-time production' of the four test vehicle aircraft, 'EMD [engineering and manufacturing development] completion, and production readiness.' Despite challenges in the test campaign, Hunter said he is confident the T-7A’s overall design is sound and that the trainer will meet the Air Force’s goals. Following a visit with the test team at Edwards Air Force Base, 'the payoff line in that was, ‘We have a winner here,’' he said. 'If we hadn't had that solid understanding that, in fact, this is the plane that the Air Force needs, we wouldn't have been nearly as motivated to reach this understanding.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/t7a-red-hawk-trainer-delay-air-force-boeing-milestone-c/	2025-01-15T06:00:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/Red-hawk-edwards-scaled-e1700063262779.jpg
Australia acquires F-35 APEX armor piercing ammunition from Nammo	A Royal Australian Air Force F-35A Lightning II aircraft touches down at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales (Australia DoD) BELFAST — Australia has signed a contract to equip its F-35A jets with 25mm PGU-47/U APEX ammunition from Norwegian-Finnish manufacturer Nammo, according to a company statement. The deal is valued at approximately AUD $22.9 million ($14.2 million US), a spokesperson for Australia’s Department of Defence disclosed to Breaking Defense in a statement today, after Nammo recently announced the order. In December 2024 Australia received a final tranche of 9 F-35A jets to complete a fleet of 72 aircraft. 'This is the first major sale of the APEX ammunition,' a spokesperson for Nammo told Breaking Defense, adding that the company 'has made other sales in the past and there are other countries testing or using the APEX ammunition,' but it cannot disclose additional details related to those programs. APEX ammunition has been specifically designed for the F-35A GAU-22/A cannon. Production for Canberra is set to start this year with deliveries due to run through 2027. The new rounds offer 'a number of operational benefits including the ability to be effective against a range of targets and improved warhead performance and accuracy,' said the Australia DoD spokesperson. In its company statement, Nammo noted that APEX 'combines armor-piercing and explosive effects in a single round.' The manufacturer added that the ammunition can also be 'effective' against 'armored, semi-armored, and light targets.' The armor piercing capability is derived from a tungsten carbide penetrator, while the explosive warhead includes 'delayed initiation, delivering blast, fragmentation, and incendiary effects inside the target,' according to the company. Nammo and a number of key partners including the Norwegian Defence Materiel Agency (FMA) and the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) spent 'substantial resources' and close to two decades on research, development, testing, and qualification in order to reach APEX F-35A flight release. In practice, gun-to-gun and close-in combat engagements are unlikely scenarios for the F-35, which can rely on more lethal weaponry and advanced mission systems to deter or defeat adversaries. The platforms can also carry Aim-9X Sidewinder and Aim-120 AMRAAM air-to-air-missiles, GBU-31 Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) guided bombs and laser-guided bombs, according to a Royal Australian Air Force factsheet. The Lockheed Martin fifth-generation fighter is the backbone of Australian combat air power, alongside Boeing F/A-18F Super Hornets and EA-18G Growlers. As part of a Super Hornet replacement project worth up to $3 billion AUD ($1.9 billion USD), Canberra had planned on acquiring additional F-35s but that looks to be in doubt after Pat Conroy, Australia's defence industry minister, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation last year that, 'we can delay the replacement of the Super Hornet which frees up funding to invest in more long‑range missiles.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/australia-acquires-f-35-apex-armor-piercing-ammunition-from-nammo/	2025-01-15T03:10:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/RAAF-F-35-scaled-e1736856580985.jpg
What Pete Hegseth’s hearing tells us about Trump’s plans for the Pentagon	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth testifies during his Senate Armed Services confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill on January 14, 2025 in Washington, DC. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In an often confrontational hearing today, Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth went toe-to-toe with Senate Democrats over the role of women in combat, diversity initiatives and, possibly, firing top generals. And while Hegseth's testimony was largely about his personal defense over his ability to lead the nation's military, his written comments give hints as to how the Trump administration views a number of key policy and technology issues. Since President-elect Donald Trump tapped Hegseth to lead the Pentagon two months ago, he has faced questions about his lack of foreign policy and defense experience, as well as allegations of sexual assault and professional misconduct that he has vehemently denied. Today was the nominee's turn to push back against some of those concerns when he appeared before the Senate Armed Services Committee, an initial step towards getting a vote on the chamber floor. But the tone of the hearing was set from the start, with SASC Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., limiting the hearing to only one round of questions over opposition from ranking Democrat Jack Reed of Rhode Island. In turn, Reed, in a departure from the tone he usually takes at such hearings, came out hard at Hegseth. 'I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands of this job,' Reed said in his opening comments. 'We must acknowledge the concerning public reports against you. A variety of sources, including your own writings, implicate you with disregarding laws of war, financial mismanagement, racist and sexist remarks about men and women in uniform, alcohol abuse, sexual assault, sexual harassment, and other troubling issues.' By and large, his testimony today didn’t sway senators from their political corners, with Democrats filling in behind Reed’s critical opening statement and each picking a topic to focus on. As anticipated, Hegseth’s take on women in combat was a central topic, though he insisted it has always been about standards. Democratic senators hit back that his lack of experience running a large organization like the Pentagon is a bigger problem than current standards for military jobs. 'You talk about standards, but do you think the way to raise standards at DoD is to lower them for the secretary of defense?' said Sen. Gary Peters, D-Mich. Republicans cannot afford to lose a single vote in the SASC to push Hegseth forward. Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, a combat veteran and sexual assault survivor, is seen as a lodestar for whether Hegseth’s nomination moves through committee, but has not definitively said whether she will vote for Hegseth. During comments during the hearing, Ernst thanked Hegseth for 'productive' and 'frank' conversations over the past month and asked questions about his dedication to obtaining a clean Pentagon audit, sexual assault prevention, and whether he would commit that combat roles would remain open to qualified women who met the same standards as men. 'Women will have access to ground combat roles, combat roles, given the standards remain high,' Hegseth said. 'We'll have a review to ensure the standards have not been eroded in any of these cases.' Asked after the hearing whether Republicans had Hegseth’s nomination on a glide path, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., responded, 'You’d have to ask them.' Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, told reporters after the hearing that Hegseth’s focus on lethality and revitalizing the defense industrial base is 'what we have to have.' In a note to investors after the hearing, Roman Schweizer of TD Cowen said he anticipates Hegseth will be confirmed along party lines. 'We need to accelerate efforts to strengthen our force posture and increase operational capabilities in the Indo-Pacific, given China’s historic and rapid military buildup and the urgent need to reestablish deterrence,' Hegseth wrote in response to questions. 'If confirmed, I will review our posture in the Indo-Pacific and identify ways to prioritize such efforts.' At the same time, he made a minor gaffe during the hearing, answering Democratic Sen. Mazie Hirono’s request to name a single ASEAN country by talking about the US relationship with Japan, South Korea and Australia — all important allies in the region but not members of ASEAN. On topline defense spending, Hegseth told senators that falling below 3 percent GDP would be 'very dangerous,' but the nominee did not commit to any particular spending target. VIDEO: Sen. Deb Fischer on nuclear modernization, hopes for defense under Trump and Ukraine Asked during the hearing about the NGAD fighter, Hegseth responded that weapons acquisition is one place where he feels 'frankly, a little bit liberated,' because his lack of work experience in the defense industrial base means that he won’t feel tied to 'any particular system or any particular company or any particular narrative.' More broadly, Hegseth indicated a willingness to look at all options when it comes to weapon systems, saying, 'I want to know what works. I want to know what defeats our enemies, what keeps us safe, what deters them, what keeps our enemies up at night. Whatever that is, I want more of it. And I want to invest in it.' For the Navy, Hegseth said he will closely examine plans to reach a 355-ship Navy and work to accelerate growth.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/pete-hegseth-trump-nomination-weapons-women-senate/	2025-01-14T13:15:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/hegseth-confirmation-scaled-e1736870161374.jpg
As NATO beefs up Baltic defense, Rutte says alliance ‘cannot wait’ to increase defense spending	L-R Kristen Michal, Prime Minister of Estonia, Alexander Stubb, President of Finland and Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General, address media during the alliance's Baltic Sea Summit (NATO) BELFAST — NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte has called on alliance members to urgently agree on a new defense spending target above the existing 2 percent GDP floor, stating, 'we really have to get this done in the next couple of months.' 'This is urgent, it is urgent now,' he said today during the Baltic Sea Summit in Helsinki, Finland. 'This cannot wait until some summit somewhere.' Allies will meet in The Netherlands for the annual NATO Summit in June, where formal approval of an uplift in spending had been expected. But Rutte warned that NATO could get 'into difficulty' if spending and weapons production are not ramped up as soon as possible, especially because of Russia’s formidable military funding. Moscow is currently producing an equivalent number of weapons in three months as NATO does over a year, according to Rutte. Similarly, he said that China is 'investing heavily' in its defense capabilities and 'will have 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030.' Rutte did not offer a specific spending figure for NATO members to agree on, but his plea follows US President-elect Donald Trump calling for a target of 5 percent to be met. Trump's tactic could be a bluff to illicit a compromise from European allies on the road to shaking on a more realistic target. Reuters reported on Monday that Rutte is of the view that new military capability targets could require members to commit to 'as much as' 3.7 percent GDP, but a lower figure might be feasible once innovation and joint procurement are considered. Just 23 members of the 32 nation alliance met the 2 percent target in 2024, according to estimated NATO figures (PDF). Poland is expected to spend 4.7 percent GDP on defense this year — the most of any alliance member. The Eastern European country is an outlier, however. In July last year, Estonia’s Undersecretary for Defence Policy Tuuli Duneton said that there was a 'general understanding' that allies were not ready to commit to a 2.5 percent GDP spending target. As a result, discussion on the matter was effectively abandoned at the NATO Summit in Washington in an attempt to avoid splits emerging between allies. Trump’s return to power is expected to see a change of approach to Ukraine and defense matters more broadly, though a prior declaration of ending the conflict in 24 hours has been scrapped and replaced with a 100 day timeframe, according to various reports. Separately, NATO has launched a new maritime mission dubbed Baltic Sentry to increase its presence across the Baltic Sea in a bid to protect critical infrastructure amid Russian shadow fleet undersea cable sabotage incidents. Rutte said Baltic Sentry will involve the deployment of frigates, maritime patrol aircraft, naval drones and 'new tech.' The new mission arrives just a week after the multinational Joint Expeditionary Force activated operation Nordic Warden based around a UK-led and artificial intelligence assisted reaction system capable of assessing threats to undersea cables and monitoring movements of the shadow fleet. The Russian Eagle S oil tanker remains at the center of a Finnish investigation into damage of the Estlink-2 power cable between Finland and Estonia. Helsinki will share a 'step by step' report with allies on how it dealt with the incident, President of Finland Alexander Stubb said at the Baltic Sea Summit. 'They [Russia's shadow fleet] are running money for Russia to have this kind of hybrid war against Europe' and are also making an environmental 'bomb' a possibility 'in our seas,' said Prime Minister of Estonia Kristen Michal. The shadow fleet are a collection of primarily aging vessels typically transporting crude oil but operating under dubious ownership and often without insurance. Michal noted that since June, Estonia had inspected over 300 tankers, 62 of which did not have insurance.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/as-nato-beefs-up-baltic-defense-rutte-says-alliance-cannot-wait-to-increase-defense-spending/	2025-01-14T13:01:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250114a-023-e1736873926565.jpg
Outgoing Navy secretary criticizes ‘false accusations’ from Congress on transparency	Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro speaks at an all-hands call to officer candidates at U.S. Navy &#8211; Officer Training Command Newport (OTCN) on Aug. 08, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st class Jared Mancuso) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — Outgoing Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro had some sharp parting words for lawmakers today, saying he rejects their accusation that the service has failed to be transparent with Capitol Hill. Rather, he asserted the delays in communicating funding gaps can be traced back to the legislators’ own inability to pass an annual budget on-time. 'The bottom line is on this most recent issue where members of Congress have criticized the Navy about not being transparent. That’s just not true at all. It’s false is what it is,' the secretary told a group of reporters today. 'The fact is that Congress has an obligation to pass budgets every year. And for the past several years they have delayed passing those budgets and have had continuing resolutions that really have a negative impact on the military services’ ability to execute their programs across the entire threshold.' Del Toro was referring to accusations lawmakers made in their recent defense policy bill, which claimed the Navy failed to notify either Congress or the Office of Management and Budget about plans the service was developing with industry to rectify issues in the submarine industrial base. The secretary said his service has been 'transparent all along' and that lawmakers’ claims are 'false accusations.' 'The reason why the final gaps in funding were … discovered and actually reported to the Congress is largely because there was a six- to seven-month gap associated with the continuing resolution that the Congress imposed upon the executive branch, and their [Congress] failure to pass budgets on time,' Del Toro said. RELATED: New admin may be more &#8216;receptive' to Navy-industry plan to boost shipyard wages, HII CEO says Del Toro also took fire from Capitol Hill today, as Sen. Dan Sullivan took him to task for what he said was Del Toro's misplaced focus on 'climate change' over warfighting. 'This is killing our military readiness,' Sullivan, R-Ala., said at a confirmation hearing for Donald Trump's nominee for defense secretary, Fox News host Pete Hegseth. Speaking to reporters, Del Toro said Sullivan’s remarks were also 'completely false.' 'I’m proud of the actions I’ve taken to strengthen shipbuilding and the submarine industrial base. … That is where I spend the bulk of my time. People can continue to read the same talking point over again, but it’s just unacceptable when it’s devoid of the truth and it’s just not right to tell lies,' Del Toro said. 'People who just constantly are climate deniers. They’re just telling lies is what they are,' he added.

Navy’s SWO Boss says big changes are needed to meet CNO’s readiness goals	The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS McFaul (DDG 74) participates in a multinational military exercise with NATO allies as part of the Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Kerri Kline) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — The US Navy’s top surface warfare officer (SWO) says significant changes are needed across how his fleet trains, conducts maintenance and executes contracts if the service wants to be able to meet its latest readiness goals. 'We can’t continue to do things the way we have been. We can’t just work harder or try harder at the processes that we have so far,' Vice Adm. Brendan McLane told reporters last week in the run up to the Surface Navy Association’s annual symposium. His remarks come as the surface fleet has faced a challenging year and now awaits new civilian leadership come Jan. 20. Operationally, the Navy — especially the surface fleet's carrier strike groups — have been constantly fending off Iranian-backed Houthi attacks in the Middle East to protect international shipping lanes as well as US ally Israel. At the Pentagon, Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti has tasked McLane, and the other type commanders, to achieve an 80 percent surge-readiness goal by 2027 in her latest 'Navigation Plan.' McLane, whose command over all operational surface Navy forces means he’s also called the 'SWO Boss,' said that being surge ready means a crew has completed surface warfare and advanced tactical training. 'Once you finish that, you are ready to go,' he said. Generally ships will also go through a composite training exercise, dubbed 'COMPTUEX,' which gives the crew time training with the rest of its carrier strike group. In the interest of meeting that goal, the service plans to soon release an updated version of the strategy document the previous SWO Boss published in 2022, dubbed 'The Competitive Edge.' The newer document will focus on meeting Franchetti’s recently established readiness goals, according to a Navy statement. 'The key … the long pole in the tent, that’s maintenance. We know that we’re going to have to do things differently,' McClane said, adding that he has received the results of a study done last year focused on improving amphibious ship maintenance. 'We need to be, within the authorities that we have already, more nimble when it comes to contracting strategies,' he continued. 'We need a strategy of strategies, because the things that we need to be able to do maintenance-wise, can be different by ship, by home port, by what we want to accomplish and the same contracting vehicle is not going to be able to be applied universally to all of those situations.' Another obstacle, McLane said, was getting ships through prerequisite training cycles on time. He said the service’s goal of a ship clearing that training cycle in 10 weeks is 'achievable.' He added that one of the big hurdles to ships meeting that goal has been when specific systems are broken which prevents sailors from training on it. Vice Adm. James Downey, the chief of Naval Sea Systems Command and the officer responsible for overseeing fleet-wide maintenance, told reporters the Navy is examining the practices of merchant ships, cruise lines, airlines, nuclear power plants and offshore oil platforms as a guide for improving the Navy’s methods. That practice mirrors steps the naval aviation community took back during the first Trump administration when then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis tasked the strike fighter fleets with significantly improving their own readiness statistics. 'How do they &#8230; perform on time, what is it they value, and how do they prepare to achieve what they value?' Downey said, while speaking to reporters alongside the SWO Boss. McLane’s predecessor, then-Vice Adm. Roy Kitchener, back in 2023 set the surface fleet a goal to have 75 ships ready daily — a target the fleet failed to hit by last January. It was not immediately clear how that goal compares with the CNO’s new readiness targets or if it remains in effect. A spokesperson for the SWO Boss did not respond to a request for comment by press time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/navys-swo-boss-says-big-changes-are-needed-to-meet-cnos-readiness-goals/	2025-01-14T12:00:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240108_ddgs_surface_navy_7452490-scaled-e1704744273645.jpg
Army plans to award next gen C2 prototype contracts in May	Military service members assigned to the 7th Air Support Operations Squadron, Fort Bliss, Texas, and 729th Air Control Squadron, Hill Air Force Base, Utah, conduct warfare operations at the Tactical Operations Center-Light (TOC-L) on Oct. 14, 2022, during Project Convergence 22. (U.S. Army photo by Spc. Brenda Salgado) WASHINGTON — The Army announced plans to award initial prototype contracts for its Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) program by May and wants to deliver initial prototypes within six months of the award date, according to a request for information posted Monday afternoon. Though the NGC2 program was announced last May, Monday’s RFI marks the first time the service has given concrete details on when vendors can expect an initial prototype award for the program. As for the the current RFI, the Army said it is now 'seeking industry feedback as it prepares to rapidly and competitively award contracts for prototyping Next Generation Command and Control, a new approach to provide commanders and units at echelon an open and modular C2 ecosystem across hardware, software and applications with access to a common and integrated data layer,' according to an Army press release. The service reiterated the fact that the NGC2 will not have a lead systems integrator as 'no one company can provide a total solution for NGC2,' as previously reported by Breaking Defense. Today's announcement adds that the 'government intends to continue to onboard vendor teams for additional components and layers available after the initial prototyping awards.' 'We not only want to make sure we have the appropriate criteria to select the best affordable solutions, but that we are really keying in on post-award. By appropriately aligning incentives and disincentives to drive the right behaviors and competition from the awardees long-term, we’ll ensure that we’re not only getting the best deal, but the best solutions,' Executive Director of Army Contracting Command, Danielle Moyer, said in the release. The RFI was created by the Army’s Contracting Command and the Program Executive Office of Command, Control, Communications &#8211; Network (PEO C3N) in partnership with the service’s Command and Control Cross-Functional Team, as the latter two are leading the NGC2 effort. The document also provides details on the technology stack NGC2 will be built on and asks that interested vendors provide answers to a draft prototype statement of objectives and a draft indefinite delivery indefinite quantity performance work statement by Jan. 23. According to the press release, the RFI will be followed by a draft request for proposals 'tentatively' planned for the end of January, and a final RFP should be out in late February.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-plans-to-award-next-gen-c2-prototype-contracts-in-may/	2025-01-14T11:49:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240214_DVIDS_tact_air_ops_light_7467434-scaled-e1707951323568.jpg
Navy’s vice chief speaks out on friendly fire: ‘Committed’ to preserving investigations	The USS Gettysburg was involved in a friendly fire incident on Dec. 22 while conducting operations in the Middle East. (Photo courtesy of US Navy) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — Flanked by his surface warfare and air warfare type commanders, the Navy’s second most senior officer this morning started this year’s annual Surface Navy Association symposium off with a solemn message. 'On December 22, USS Gettysburg fired on US Navy F/A-18s. Thankfully, no one was hurt,' Vice Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Jim Kilby said. 'As a warfighting organization, we must learn from this, and we’ve got to take those real time-lessons and apply them. And I’m committing to you that we’re going to do that.' It was a drastically different tone than what usually begins this niche-yet-consistently packed conference held just a few miles from the Pentagon in Crystal City, Va., each year. Kilby was referring to the friendly fire incident involving a Navy cruiser that mistakenly downed an F/A-18 Hornet in the Middle East, where the service has been fending off Houthi attacks now for 15 months. US Central Command at the time said the crew safely ejected. Kilby said immediately following the incident, the service initiated three separate investigations. First is an inquiry into the incident itself, which the Navy calls a 'JAGMAN,' short for 'Manual of the Judge Advocate General.' A second review is being done to assess the deployed forces in the associated carrier strike group. These first two reviews are being led by flag officers, while the third review — compiling safety lessons learned — is being done by the Naval Safety Center, according to the VCNO. 'I am adamant that we will preserve this investigative process and get a deeper understanding of what's happening. Discussing the details of what the strike group commander did immediately following this event … at this stage is premature,' said Kilby. 'Facts are still being gathered. I do not want to risk this investigation by [having] a partially informed conversation today. I recognize that this is dissatisfying to many of you.' The remarks from Kilby represent some of the first that senior Navy leadership has made since the Dec. 22 incident. They follow months of operations involving the service’s carrier strike groups taking down hundreds of drone and missile threats — a point that service leadership back in Washington, DC, has been eager to praise. 'We’re all proud of our sailors. That’s not what I want to talk about today,' Kilby said at the start of the panel. What followed the VCNO’s remarks was a higher-level overview of lessons learned presented by the surface warfare boss, Vice Adm. Brendan McLane and the air warfare boss, Vice Adm. Daniel Cheever, as well as their respective subordinates, Rear Adm. Joseph Cahill and Rear Adm. Douglas Verissimo. Most of those lessons focused around moving data back and forth quickly between the fleet and ashore as well as the different communities — aviation, surface — training together more effectively. And as Kilby mentioned at the start of the panel, in the interest of the ongoing investigations, the flags declined to take any audience questions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/navys-vice-chief-speaks-out-on-friendly-fire-committed-to-preserving-investigations/	2025-01-14T10:12:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/gettysburg-scaled-e1736872146219.jpg
White House tries to tighten AI export controls amidst industry outrage	The whole world sits on a motherboard. (Getty graphic) WASHINGTON — Depending on who’s talking, the outgoing Biden administration’s recently announced 'Interim Final Rule' regulating high-tech exports will either protect America’s lead in AI tech from Chinese copycats or cripple the American AI industry by ceding the global market to China. Publicly announced on Monday after months of build-up and debate, the new rule divides the world into three zones with varying levels of access to US tech. It's an attempt to simplify routine exports of high-powered chips while simultaneously closing loopholes that China and other adversaries could exploit to steal cutting-edge AI components and know-how. RELATED: Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon’s DOGE to wow 'We have a national security responsibility to do two things,' National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters Sunday: 'First, to preserve, protect and extend American AI leadership, particularly vis a vis strategic competitors; and second, ensure that the benefits of American AI are spread to people around the world, including the global build-out of data centers to run AI applications.' Critics, however, say this will all backfire horrifically. They argue the rule will tie US exports up in regulatory knots so tight they won’t be able to compete for sales with China, whose industry will then get to dominate the international market in AI. (That’s arguably how Chinese drones flooded the globe after the US limited exports of unmanned aircraft technology). The draft AI rule 'will go down as one of the most destructive to ever hit the U.S. technology industry,' Oracle VP Ken Glueck seethed in a Jan. 5 blog post, evidently having read a near-final draft. '[It’s] a highly complex and wildly overbroad attempt to regulate Artificial Intelligence and GPUs [that will] shrink the global chip market for U.S. firms by 80 percent and hand it to the Chinese.' And as soon as the rule officially went public, the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation (ITIF) expressed 'serious concerns,' the Semiconductor Industry Association said it was 'deeply disappointed,' and leading chipmaker NVIDIA appealed directly to incoming President Trump. 'The first Trump Administration laid the foundation for America’s current strength and success in AI, fostering an environment where U.S. industry could compete and win on merit without compromising national security,' NVIDIA government affairs chief Ned Finkle wrote on Monday. 'In its last days in office, the Biden Administration seeks to undermine America’s leadership with a 200+ page regulatory morass.' (The actual PDF clocks in at 168 pages, suggesting Finkle, like Glueck, didn't see the exact same version). But the new rule says 'interim' in the title for a reason: The actual final rule on export of AI tech will be decided by the incoming Trump administration. So which way will the returning president likely jump? 'It’s very difficult to say,' UPenn professor and Council on Foreign Relations fellow Michael Horowitz, who served under Biden as senior Pentagon policy official with a special focus on AI, said in an interview with Breaking Defense. That's because of the competing factions in and around the incoming administration, rather than between political parties. As in the recent intra-GOP battles over H-1B visas, Trump could either side with the protectionist, anti-China instincts of his MAGA base or the deregulatory, globally-exporting agenda of tech-sector allies like Elon Musk. 'If Trump’s focused mostly on restricting [China], they’d probably be favorable,' Horowitz said. 'If they find industry concerns more persuasive, you could imagine them rolling back at least some of the regulations.' Apparently aware of worries from industry leaders — and having been publicly skeptical of export controls on China herself — Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo emphasized the 'very long' 120-day public comment period. 'We hope that the next administration takes full advantage of those 120 days,' she told reporters Sunday. That’s a much longer period for public comments than usual for such regulations, said Horowitz. 'My understanding is that comment period was lengthened given industry concerns, which means that the incoming Trump administration will have ample time to get industry feedback and decide if they wish to make changes,' said Horowitz, who wrote his own explainer on the interim rule for CFR. The draft regulation currently online [PDF] is168 pages. But what’s actually in it? In brief, the proposed rule divides the countries of the world into three concentric circles of ever-decreasing trust: Eighteen close allies and partners, like Japan and France, get to join the inner circle, judged not just friendly to the US but sufficiently disciplined in their own export controls that they won’t buy American tech only to let it leak to third parties like Beijing.* 'No restrictions apply to chip sales' to those nations, an official summary says. A company based in these inner-circle countries, or in the US itself, can also use those US chips to build data centers in other inner-circle or even second-tier states, up to certain relatively high limits — if the company can prove it follows National Security Agency 'best practices,' which qualifies it as a 'Universal Validated End User' (UVEU). The complex and binding nature of those requirements, however, is one of critics' greatest concerns. The vast majority of countries fall in the middle ring, which the rule subjects to additional controls on cutting-edge exports while trying to streamline existing regulations on routine commerce. Any given company, agency, or other organization ('end user') in such a country would now be allowed to import a substantial amount of computing power without restriction: It’s 'the equivalent of 1,700 of today’s most advanced AI accelerator chips (e.g. Nvidia H100s) each year,' a White House background paper says, '[worth] tens of millions of dollars of chips for each entity.' A company based in these countries can also use US AI tech to build data centers in any other such country, under strict limits, if it qualifies as a 'National Validated End User' (NVEU, a less privileged status than UVEU). Again, this requires following US security rules. Finally, 22 nations** subject to US arms embargoes fall in the outer ring, beyond the pale of acceptable importers. These countries would remain subject to all existing export controls, without enjoying any of the new exemptions. In addition they would now be forbidden from importing the most high-end closed-source AI models. (Open-source models are, by definition, freely available to all and their distribution can’t be controlled.) In effect, the Biden administration argues, the new regulation makes most AI exports easier for most buyers and sellers in most countries, exempting them from current export controls, while tightening safeguards on the most powerful technologies going to the most dangerous countries. One anonymous senior official told reporters: 'What we have done here is actually going to enable the build-out by removing what had been, you know, in many cases, fairly long delays in licensing for even smaller quantities of chips.' * The 18 trusted allies and partners subject to the fewest restrictions under the draft rule are Australia, Belgium, Britain, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, and Taiwan. ** Besides China, which includes Hong Kong and Macau, the 22 blacklisted states are Afghanistan, Belarus, Burma, Cambodia, Central African Republic, Congo, Cuba, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Lebanon, Libya, Nicaragua, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/white-house-tries-to-tighten-ai-export-controls-amidst-industry-outrage/	2025-01-14T09:39:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250114_globe_chip_graphic_GettyImages-1769933108-e1736872626296.jpg
Emirati shipbuilder launches first Offshore Patrol Vessel in the Falaj 3 program	A screengrab from a YouTube video posted by EDGE Group showing the first Falaj-3 vessel launched on Jan. 14, 2025. (YouTube) BEIRUT — Emirati firm Abu Dhabi Ship Building (ADSB) today launched the first of four offshore patrol vessels in its Falaj-3 program, the firm announced in a statement. 'The launch of the first FALAJ3 vessel reinforces ADSB’s expertise in shipbuilding and represents a major step forward in delivering cutting-edge, highly sophisticated vessels equipped with the latest mission systems and advanced armament,' said ADSB CEO David Massey in the statement. ADSB, a subsidiary of UAE’s defense giant EDGE Group, secured the deal for the four OPVs with the national ministry of defense in 2021 worth $950 million (3.5 billion AED), as first reported by Breaking Defense. The Falaj- 3 ships are 60-meter-long vessels, capable of littoral and blue water missions and are equipped with combat battle management systems and weapons for air, surface and subsurface missions. 'As we deepen this partnership, we remain focused on driving innovation and excellence to meet the evolving needs of the nation’s defence landscape,' Massey added. Beyond the UAE, ADSB has secured a number of export deals, including a $1.07 billion contract to provide a small fleet of new ships to the Angolan navy, specifically three BR71 MKII 71-meter corvettes. Today's Falaj-3 announcement came one month ahead of the largest biennial defense show in the UAE, IDEX/ NAVDEX 2025 where the country’s navy, neighboring and international navies exhibit their ships. With the first Falaj-3 in the water, it's possible the ship could make an appearance dockside.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/emirati-shipbuilder-launches-first-offshore-patrol-vessel-in-the-falaj-3-program/	2025-01-14T08:12:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250114_falaj3_ship_EDGE_YTgrab-e1736870101833.png

Lack of Space Force personnel support for NRO draws congressional ire	The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) Headquarters.

(Photo by Greg Mathieson/Mai/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Space Force for months has been dragging its feet to fulfill the longstanding agreement between the Department of the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) on the assignment of military personnel to the spy satellite agency, according to a handful of government and industry sources — resulting in a shot across the service's bow by lawmakers in the recently passed fiscal 2025 Intelligence Authorization Act. 'You know how this stuff works on the Hill: When stuff shows up in bill language, it usually indicates longer discussions behind the scenes. For it to finally end up in a bill, it means that they haven't had satisfactory meetings, or no answers to questions,' one congressional staffer explained. In a joint statement accompanying the FY25 intelligence policy bill, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), detail the negative repercussions for both the NRO and the Space Force from a lack of service support. 'The NRO is negatively affected — and its ability to meet warfighter requirements diminished — when the United States Space Force does not assign Guardians to the NRO at a rate that meets the NRO requirements; &#8230; The NRO and Space Force are negatively affected by the Space Force's uneven emphasis on developing space operators without similar emphasis on developing Guardians with space acquisition and engineering expertise,' the statement reads. And in an attempt to push the Space Force to act, the statement mandates that the Director of National Intelligence provide both the Intelligence and Armed Services committees with updates on 'the status of the Department of Defense fulfilling its commitment to assign uniformed personnel to the NRO.' The Space Force did not respond by press time to a request for comment. The issue is not trivial for the NRO, in that military personnel with space expertise previously from the Air Force and now from the Space Force traditionally have made up about one-third of the NRO's staff. An NRO spokesperson explained that there are 'agreements in place' between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and DoD 'to manage' Air Force and Space Force 'manning requirements' at NRO. 'The NRO in partnership with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Service Secretaries routinely monitor and evaluate the best mix of uniformed personnel at the NRO to meet mission needs, as well as the needs of other elements of the DoD,' the spokesperson said. 'U.S. Air Force personnel have historically represented the largest portion of the NRO’s workforce. With the establishment of U.S. Space Force in 2019, this distribution has shifted to Guardians representing the largest segment of the NRO's military workforce.' According to the spysat agency's website, the NRO workforce currently numbers about 3,000 with 27 percent provided by the Space Force. The service 'is a critical partner to NRO, particularly in space system development, operations, engineering, and acquisition. &#8230; [I]t’s important the NRO and U.S. Space Force receive the support necessary to advance our shared mission in space, ultimately safeguarding the U.S.’s national security space advantage,' the spokesperson said. However, sources were mum on exactly how many people, if any, the Space Force has offered for this fiscal year. Personnel seconded from the military services make up 35 percent of NRO's approximately 3,000-strong workforce, with the Space Force alone normally accounting for about 27 percent. (Graphic: NRO) There are several factors at play in the service's reluctance to provide Guardians to support the NRO's mission of acquiring and operating intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites, according to experts, current and former government officials, and Hill staff. First and foremost is that Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman is struggling to find enough personnel from his relatively small workforce — slated to hit just over 15,000 this year; 9,800 uniformed and 5,200 civilians — to fulfil growing service missions and ensure timely training, as well as support combatant commands, joint force organizations and interagency functions. Saltzman and other top Space Force brass have been advocating for the past year for more Guardians, and more funding for its burgeoning mission profile. 'Currently the Space Force is underfunded, undersized, and without the authorities necessary to consolidate DOD space agencies,' said David Deptula, dean of the the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies. But another, according to these sources, is Saltzman's own lack of interest in acquisition issues and building those skills within Space Force cadres — an issue that already has piqued concern from the House Armed Services Committee. NRO, while operating its own satellite fleets, is largely an acquisition organization. 'This is definitely a blind spot for Salty and the [congressional] statement is surprisingly direct,' said Doug Loverro, former head of Pentagon space policy who remains active as a consultant on Space Force issues. Finally, there is the fact of the long-running animosity between the Intelligence Community and the Space Force on the boundaries of each side's authorities, with the Space Force over the past year arguing to take over a number of missions previously considered within the remit of the NRO and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Those turf wars may get worse before they get better as Space Force advocates see opportunities with the incoming Trump administration to push for expanding the service's mission parameters even further. For example, there have been renewed calls among some service advocates for the Space Force to swallow NRO whole. 'Of course, this issue could be solved by placing the NRO into the Space Force to comply with the original rationale for standing up the Space Force — the need to consolidate the nation’s fragmented multitude of space organizations into one organization,' Deptula said. It is unclear, however, what affect the HPSCI-SSCI language will actually have in resolving the staffing issue, given that neither committee has direct oversight or budgetary control of DoD and the military services. And while HASC leaders are frustrated with the service with regard to the acquisition issue, neither committee has taken action on the question of NRO support — although a number of sources said staffers clearly are keeping an eye on the problem. One possible solution the Armed Services committees could put forward, according to a couple of sources, is to put language in the annual National Defense Authorization Act mandating that the Pentagon consider a more equitable sharing of the NRO support burden among the services. Currently the Army, Air Force and Navy provide only single-digit percentages of the spysat agency's workforce, and each of those services maintain space experts within their cadres. 'That makes great sense,' Deptula said. Meanwhile, NRO is having conversations among its various partners on the issue of keeping its desks full. 'NRO maintains a strong relationship with all of our partners including the U.S. Space Force and we have ongoing discussions to ensure agreed upon staffing levels are met,' the spokesperson said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/lack-of-space-force-personnel-support-for-nro-draws-congressional-ire/	2025-01-14T06:35:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/GettyImages-50684828-scaled-e1736795157290.jpg
China resumes work on Yellow Sea island, amid Korea’s political turmoil: Report	SOUTH CHINA SEA (August 20, 2020) Boatswain’s Mate 2nd Class Terry Schoenherr, from Mount Vernon, Ill., looks through binoculars on the bridge wing as the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Mustin (DDG 89) conducts routine operations.

(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Cody Beam) SYDNEY — As South Korea's political structure totters in the wake of former President Yoon Suk Yeol's removal, China is said to have built a large structure in a disputed area of the Yellow Sea. The South Korean daily Chosun first reported the development late last week, citing government officials, alleging that South Korean intelligence first detected the structure in December. A diplomatic source based in Canberra confirmed the outline of that report to Breaking Defense. The structure was installed in the Provisional Measures Zone of the Yellow Sea. Activities such as facility construction or resource development, except for fishing, are barred there by a 2001 agreement between South Korea and China. Chosun reported China has previously claimed other facilities were fishing support facilities. Representatives at the Chinese Embassy in Canberra did not respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment. 'This is a wake up call to the potential threat from China. Not even the North Koreans will be happy about this,' Chun In-bum, former deputy commander of South Korea’s First Army, said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'I guess China is not satisfied with just the South China Sea/ Phillipines Sea.' China and South Korea have a host of disputed territorial claims in the Yellow Sea and, although they have met reputedly since 2015 to discuss them, they have made little progress, according to experts. 'As you know, China keeps doing that kind of thing around Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Philippines. We are concerned and trying to know what is their intention,' a Canberra-based diplomat said on condition of anonymity. Two analysts told Breaking Defense it's likely that Beijing sees an opportunity in South Korea's political chaos. Yoon stunned the world when he declared martial law and was then impeached by Korea's parliament. However, he clings to office, backed by armed supporters who guard his residence. South Korea's Constitutional Court must decide Yoon's fate, and its hearings are expected to begin on Tuesday. This could 'well be China taking advantage of the political turmoil in South Korea to make moves Seoul has and will continue to object to. However, these moves are not new. Seemingly, as China-South Korea relations had been improving, China's construction in the West Sea had stalled,' Jenny Town, an expert on regional Korean and Chinese issues at Washington's Stimson Center said in an email. 'But with Yoon blaming Chinese influence as one of the key rationales for his botched martial law plan, Beijing may have decided there was no reason to refrain from further action.' Town said China's building 'isn't new behavior, but it seems increasingly clear that it's not a temporary strategy or that China will relent on the ambition anytime soon,' she wrote. 'It is something that China and South Korea will have to continue to contend with.' China has repeatedly attacked, bullied and threatened vessels belonging to Philippines and Vietnam, claiming jurisdiction over waters international law places under their — not Chinese — jurisdiction. There are many overlapping and conflicting claims in the South and East China Seas, involving Japan, Indonesia, Malaysia and others, but China presses on, claiming that its'historic' claims and Chinese law grant it control of those areas. 'We have seen similar behavior in both the South and East China Seas, and certainly we see a similar dispute between Japan and China in the East China Sea. This seems to indicate that the West Sea is not immune to this kind of behavior,' Town said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/china-resumes-work-on-yellow-sea-island-amid-koreas-political-turmoil-report/	2025-01-14T02:36:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250113_DVIDS_binoculars_south_china_sea-scaled-e1736795509667.jpg
