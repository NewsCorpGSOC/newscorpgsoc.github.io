Lawmakers introduce bipartisan SHIPS Act to boost commercial shipping	A container ship passes under the International Gateway Bridge at the Port of Long Beach in Long Beach, California, US, on Monday, June 17, 2024. (Tim Rue/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers today introduced legislation aimed at strengthening the American shipbuilding and commercial maritime industries following what they characterized as 'decades of neglect.' The bill in question, dubbed the Shipbuilding and Harbor Infrastructure for Prosperity and Security for America Act, is being sponsored by Sens. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Todd Young, R-Ind., as well as Reps. John Garamendi, D-Calif., and Trent Kelly, R-Miss. Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., who has been tapped by the new Trump administration to be national security advisor, has also previously expressed support for the bill. 'This historic bipartisan proposal would restore American leadership across the oceans by establishing national oversight and consistent funding for U.S. maritime policy, incentivizing domestic shipbuilding, enabling U.S.-flagged vessels to better compete in international commerce, rebuilding the U.S. shipyard industrial base, and expanding the mariner and shipyard workforce,' according to a written statement from the lawmakers. The bill would establish a maritime security advisor within the White House tasked with coordinating inter-agency decisions for how to implement a national maritime strategy. It would also create a 'Strategic Commercial Fleet Program' focused on expanding a US-flagged international fleet to 250 ships within 10 years. The four lawmakers said that fleet currently sits around 80 ships compared to China’s 5,500. The bill would also require that government-funded cargo be moved aboard US-flagged vessels as well as requiring a portion of imported goods from China to do the same, among other things. 'We’ve always been a maritime nation, but the truth is we’ve lost ground to China, who now dominates international shipping and can build merchant and military ships much more quickly than we can,' said Sen. Kelly. 'The SHIPS for America Act is the answer to this challenge.' Outgoing Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro has made commercial shipping and shipbuilding a focus area of his this year. During an event last week hosted by the American Society of Naval Engineers, he urged the new administration to continue his efforts, theorizing that the neglect the commercial shipbuilding sector has faced in recent decades presents an opportunity for the White House to boost the economy with new jobs. 'If we want to expand our economy, you've got to expand the supply chain. You’ve got to expand the number of companies that are participating in the growth of the economy itself,' he said. 'And there aren’t a lot of places where you could effectively do that here in the United States, [but] because we have abandoned the commercial shipbuilding industry since about the 1980s, that creates a new opportunity for growth in a significant way.' Given the limited time the current Congress has left in session, the bill will almost certainly need to be refiled next year before it can be considered by the relevant committees or the larger chambers. Legislation related to national security often doesn’t receive standalone votes, but rather is included in the annual defense policy bill.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lawmakers-introduce-bipartisan-ships-act-to-boost-commercial-shipping/	2024-12-19T02:30:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241218_container_ship_GettyImages-2157596020-scaled-e1734546315731.jpg
Navy picks Northrop to deliver nuclear command TACAMO aircraft	The Northrop Grumman-led industry team will deliver the E-130J for the U.S. Navy’s TACAMO mission. (Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Navy today awarded a $3.5 billion contract to Northrop Grumman to be the mission systems integrator for Navy's next-generation plane for commanding nuclear-armed forces in an emergency, beating out competitor Collins Aerospace. TACAMO is the acronym the Navy uses for the mission known as 'take charge and move out.' The new plane, dubbed the E-130J, will eventually take over that mission for the legacy fleet, the E-6B Mercury. Its purpose is to provide the chain of command a secure and reliable platform to communicate with any one of the forces encompassing the nuclear triad. 'Our TACAMO mission is foundational to our nation’s nuclear triad,' said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in a written statement announcing the contract award. 'The E-130J will carry on the proud legacy of Navy TACAMO aircraft and keep our nation safe.' Under the new contract, Northrop Grumman will integrate the mission systems needed onboard the E-130J, including the Collins Aerospace-made Very Low Frequency communications system, a critical component that allows the plane to communicate with subs deep below the ocean’s surface. The airframe will be Lockheed Martin-made C-130J-30s, a stretched version of the C-130J transport aircraft. 'The contract is for three Engineering Development Models (EDMs) and options for up to three System Demonstration Test Articles (SDTAs) and up to six aircraft in the first lot of production. Collins Aerospace and Lockheed Martin are directed subcontractors to support the integration and airworthiness,' according to the Navy statement. Northrop’s team for the contract includes Lockheed Martin Skunk Works, Raytheon’s Crescent Systems, and Long Wave Inc. 'Our performance on Navy programs like the E-2D and E-6B prove we deliver on what we promise, and we will bring this expertise in helping the Navy deliver the E-130J on time and optimized for this strategically important mission,' said Jane Bishop, vice president and general manager of global surveillance division for Northrop Grumman. As Breaking Defense previously reported, Northrop Grumman’s primary competitor for the contract was RTX-subsidiary Collins Aerospace. Collins could not be immediately reached for comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/navy-picks-northrop-to-deliver-nuclear-command-tacamo-aircraft/	2024-12-18T17:18:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/northrop-tacamo-e1734569548549.png
Providing an asymmetric advantage with quadcopters and fixed-wing VTOLs	Red Cat's Edge 130 vertical takeoff and landing drone is a Blue UAS approved military-grade system for longer-range high-endurance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. (Red Cat photo) Red Cat’s new family of systems includes a common ground control system for three aircraft: the American-made Teal 2 quadcopter and the Edge 130 Blue, a VTOL fixed-wing system – both of which are on the Defense Innovation Unit’s Blue List – and a new FANG line of first-person view (FPV) drones of different sizes and capabilities. We discuss the asymmetric advantage of these systems with Red Cat Founder and CTO George Matus. Breaking Defense: Tell us about Red Cat and its two main subsidiaries: Teal Drones and FlightWave. Red Cat Founder and CTO George Matus. George Matus: Red Cat is a drone technology company founded by our CEO Jeff Thompson in 2018. We develop robotic hardware and software primarily for U.S. government and NATO allies. Our mission is to provide critical situational awareness and enhance the effectiveness and safety of military and security operations around the world. Red Cat provides American-made technology products to the drone industry through its two wholly owned subsidiaries: Teal Drones and FlightWave. Red Cat acquired Teal in September 2021. Teal is a Salt Lake City-based drone company that I founded in 2015. Post acquisition, Teal started to evolve from our roots in consumer drones to address the needs of public safety and national security use cases. Our company built the first mass produced drone built entirely in the U.S., with Department of Defense compliant components, and today has a factory staffed with over 100 employees. In the summer of 2024, Red Cat acquired FlightWave Aerospace Systems. This was a strategic move to build out a family of small unmanned systems. FlightWave is an industry leader in Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) drone, sensor and software solutions. This acquisition brought the Edge 130, a Blue UAS approved military-grade system into Red Cat’s product line. The strategy was to expand Teal’s capabilities with extended range and endurance, additional payloads, and broader use in maritime environments. What’s the significance of being on the Blue List? Teal was one of the first Blue UAS-approved companies going as far back as 2020. The Blue UAS effort was started by the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) to establish a trusted supply of drones to the U.S. Government. This stamp of approval means being compliant in both supply chain and cyber security, and follows a regimented process to ensure a company and its products meet all of the associated requirements. Teal was the first U.S. company to ever mass produce this category of drone in America and was prepared to be part of Blue UAS as soon as the program was created. What’s driving the requirements for quadcopters? What are the missions and payloads they’re most suited for? Quadcopters are being used for many different use cases across enterprise, public safety, and defense. Teal’s products are dual-use such that they can be deployed across each of these verticals. Specific to defense, we’re now seeing that drones are currently the most impactful technology in war. When we consider what to design and build, we essentially combine three methods: first we listen carefully to end-users and their feedback, we design toward official requirements provided by our government customers, and third we use our experience to fill in any gaps we see to make the best product possible and delight our users. Our drones are fully modular, interoperable, and designed to be similar to smartphones, where they have powerful compute and sensors onboard that allow advanced software and applications to run on top of that. Our flagship product right now is the Teal 2 which is being deployed across the country and with allied countries around the world. For our new line of FPV drones, the most appropriate missions are short-range, any environment ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) with the option for delivery of kinetic effects. Now with Red Cat’s acquisition of FlightWave, we’re introducing a fixed-wing VTOL system into our product line. The Edge 130 is a longer-range high-endurance ISR aircraft and rounds out our family of systems. This is the world’s most affordable and first backpackable family of systems. Red Cat's Teal 2 quadcopter is an American made drone weighing under three pounds, and features a high-resolution dual EO/IR sensor, modular architecture, powerful onboard compute, and a variety of software integrations for autonomy and AI. (Red Cat photo) Describe this new family of systems that Red Cat announced at Eurosatory. In the context of defense, there is a paradigm shift underway on the architecture of battlefields. Increasingly, the U.S Department of Defense and ministries of defense globally are moving away from conventional platforms that are large and extremely expensive, and are beginning to adopt small, low-cost products that provide true asymmetric advantages. Red Cat is at the forefront of this sea change. Our goal is to give warfighters the tools they need to be successful on the modern battlefield. That was the genesis of the Red Cat Family of Systems. What we announced at Eurosatory includes three aircraft with complementary capabilities and a common Ground Control System (GCS). The core of the family is the Teal 2 quadcopter. It is an American made drone that’s designed to 'Dominate the Night'. Weighing under three pounds, it features a high-resolution dual EO/IR sensor, modular architecture, powerful onboard compute, and a wide variety of software integrations for autonomy and AI. It’s ruggedized to be used in any environment and harsh weather conditions, while also offering field repairability on all subsystems. The next entrant into the family of systems is the Edge 130 Blue, a VTOL fixed wing system that can be assembled and launched in just one minute by a single user to capture and stream high-resolution aerial imagery with long-range capability. Still weighing under four pounds and being backpackable, the Edge 130 can fly for over 2 hours, an industry-leading endurance among all Blue UAS approved drones today. Rounding out the Family of Systems is a new FANG line of first-person view (FPV) drones of different sizes and capabilities. The first in the line of FPV drones provides precision strike capabilities and gives warfighters the option to combine the ISR capabilities of the rest of the family. What is Red Cat’s ability to manufacture at scale? Our factory in Salt Lake City houses both our R&amp;D team and manufacturing team. We’ve designed our products and infrastructure to scale with demand into the thousands of drones per month. Our vetted supply chain vendors enable the company to source the components needed to build these drones at those large volumes. Having R&amp;D integrated very deeply enables for agile development and innovation. Our factory, with its state of the art tools and processes, combined with our world class team, is helping America to rebuild its drone industrial base which we believe is vital to our national security. Tell us about Partners and the consortium. We believe that no single company can protect this country alone. A few months ago we announced the Red Cat Futures Initiative to solve this problem. The RFI is a robotics and autonomous systems consortium designed to bridge critical UAS technology gaps for warfighters. It is an independent, industry-wide community of partners dedicated to putting the most advanced and interoperable uncrewed aircraft systems into the hands of warfighters. As a leader in the drone industry, we developed and launched this initiative to support the Pentagon’s desire to accelerate innovation for its Replicator Initiative and the need for low-cost, autonomous systems across air, land, sea, and subsea environments. The consortium will collaborate to ensure requirements based UAS production that meets the needs of specific missions, as well as reduce vendor lock-in and promote innovation and interoperability. The RFI will also engage in R&amp;D and government advocacy that accelerates technology maturation. The RFI brings together the most innovative UAS hardware and software companies focused on AIU/ML, swarming, FPV, command and control, charging/power, payloads and others based on the needs of warfighters. At launch in May 2024, the founding partners included Ocean Power Technologies, Sentien Robotics, Primordial Labs, Athena AI, Unusual Machines, Reach Power, and MMS Products. The shared goal of RFI is advocacy, integrations, and co-marketing that bridges considerable tech gaps in the UAS industry through modular open architecture. I am very excited to be partnering with so many amazing companies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/providing-an-asymmetric-advantage-with-quadcopters-and-fixed-wing-vtols/	2024-12-18T11:16:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Red-Cat-Edge-130-Blue-with-Overwatch-Gimbal-1.png
UK looks to protect funding for rapid Watchkeeper UAV replacement	British Army Watchkeeper Unmanned Aerial Systems are set to be axed from service next year as part of defense cuts. (UK MoD) BELFAST — The United Kingdom has learned from watching Ukraine that its Watchkeeper unmanned aerial vehicle is 'no longer fit for operational purpose,' but the ministry of defense is committed to protecting funding that will go towards its replacement, according to a senior official. 'We are working really hard with the army and ensuring they're funded to deliver the sorts of drone capability in 2025 to replace the drone [Watchkeeper] that's being retired,' Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Military Capability) Lt. Gen. Robert Magowan told lawmakers from the UK Defence Committee on Tuesday. In November, London said it had decided to scrap 46 of the British Army medium-altitude, long-endurance intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) drones as part of sweeping equipment cuts aimed at delivering savings of £500 million ($632 million) over the next five years. Magowan's comments on the lack of operational utility offered by Watchkeeper are in keeping with those of John Healey, UK Secretary of Defence, who justified the early retirement of the aircraft on grounds that 'technology has overtaken' it. Magowan did not elaborate further on the replacement effort but did note that the Watchkeeper retirement will allow the MoD to still save 'quite a lot of money' that would otherwise go toward support costs for the aircraft. Elsewhere in Tuesday's hearing, lawmaker questions prompted additional revelations from Magowan across a number of other key programs, including plans to replace 17 Royal Air Force-operated Puma medium lift helicopters, also axed under the latest round of military cuts. He said that a 'range of capabilities' are currently being explored that could 'plug gaps' when the rotorcraft, which are permanently based in Brunei and Cyprus, are retired in March 2025. The UK has already committed to the acquisition of six Airbus H145 Jupiter helicopters to replace the Puma's in 2026, so it appears that Magowan is suggesting an interim or stop-gap acquisition could be approved. He did not share additional details. The Puma's premature withdrawal from service from Brunei and Cyprus has previously drawn concern from Airbus. In November, the company noted in response to the move that, though it welcomes the H145 business, 'we regret the likely impact on the UK's defence industrial base, with the potential loss of skilled engineering roles and wider consequences for the aerospace supply chain.' Magowan also said that the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) New Medium Helicopter (NMH) program, designed to source a successor for a separate fleet of Puma aircraft, is 'playing out now,' adding 'there's one bidder left and that bidder has significant investment in the in the UK.' The single bidder is presumably a reference to Leonardo, the only manufacturer to put forward a bid after Airbus and Lockheed Martin both walked away from the competition in August because of requirement problems and fears linked to not receiving 'adequate long-term returns.' In a program update last week, Maria Eagle, UK minister for defence procurement, said that 'there are no plans to change the extant New Medium Helicopter procurement process.' She added, 'The New Medium Helicopter competition remains sensitive, and the evaluation and approval process must complete before further details, including aircraft numbers, can be confirmed.' The previous Conservative government had said the procurement could be 'up to' 44 airframes, but Breaking Defense has reported industry expects the real number to be around 30 platforms, and FlightGlobal recently reported it could be as few as 23. NMH contract award is set for next year, but the UK's Strategic Defense Review (SDR), due for release in mid-2025, could complicate matters because it has been designed to evaluate national defense priorities and equipment planning. Also in the hearing Magowan said that the BAE Systems Bofors Archer, an interim self-propelled howitzer, is set to enter service with the British Army in 'early 2025,' while the UK and Germany are in 'close negotiations' on the longer term solution, expected to be the KNDS Remote-Controlled Howitzer 155mm (RCH 155) 52 cal. Wheeled Artillery System.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/uk-looks-to-protect-funding-for-rapid-watchkeeper-uav-replacement/	2024-12-18T10:48:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/APOLOND-OFFICIAL-20221017-114-012.jpg.iCeJmdHrMWATAA.obsGvziWvx-e1734542025828.jpg
Senate passes defense bill despite Democrat concerns on transgender care ban	Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island and chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, left, and Senator Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, arrive for a hearing in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, May 2, 2024. (Photographer: Ting Shen/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Senate overwhelmingly passed the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act today, with Democrats coming out in droves to approve the $884 billion bill despite controversial transgender care provisions. The NDAA, which passed in a 85-14 vote, corresponds to a $895 billion topline for defense spending, adhering to the budgetary limits set in last year’s Fiscal Responsibility Act. That’s a departure from the Senate Armed Services Committee’s initial version of the bill, which would have broken the FRA and boosted the defense topline to $923.3 billion. The bill now moves to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has indicated he'll sign it into law. During a speech on the Senate floor ahead of the vote, SASC’s top Republican Roger Wicker, who spearheaded the push for additional funds, said the topline increases 'should have been part of the bill today.' 'Regrettably we missed an opportunity to strengthen the president-elect’s hand as he takes office in a precarious world situation,' he said. SASC Chairman Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the concern from senators who wanted to see a higher defense topline 'is well reasoned' given current threats, but noted that the creation of the FRA was demanded by House Republicans. RELATED: House passes $884B NDAA despite transgender care ban controversy The bill was widely adopted by Senate Democrats despite the last-minute inclusion of language that would block gender-affirming care that could potentially cause sterilization for the transgender children of servicemembers, which was inserted at House Speaker Mike Johnson’s behest. Only about half of House Democrats voted for the typically-bipartisan measure due to the Tricare restrictions. In remarks ahead of the vote, Reed said he 'disagrees strongly' with the inclusion of the provision and will continue to advocate for servicemembers and their dependents. However, 'we have before us a very strong National Defense Authorization Act,' he added. During a phone call with reporters ahead of the vote, Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., said Democrats successfully removed all of the anti-transgender provisions that were in earlier versions of the bill aside from the care ban for transgender minors and noted that he personally opposed that provision when it came before SASC for a vote. However, Kaine said the NDAA was ultimately 'very, very strong for every last member of the military and their families,' noting the 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers and other quality of life improvements. The bill authorizes $883.7 billion for fiscal year 2025, including $849.9 billion for Department of Defense programs. It also approves $33.3 billion for national security programs in the Department of Energy and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, and $512.4 million for defense-related activities. The NDAA permits the transfer of National Guard space units to the Space Force, restricts F-35 deliveries, imposes new design requirements for certain Navy ships, and allows the Air Force to retire aging A-10s, F-16s and F-15s. The bill also authorizes additional funds for a third Arleigh Burke destroyer and six more F-15EXs, among other plus-ups and spending cuts, but congressional appropriators will have the final say on approving the budget.

In deal with Portugal, Turkish naval firm STM signs first export contract to NATO nation	Turkish defence company STM General Manager Ozgur Guleryuz (R) signs an agreement during the signing ceremony for the construction of the Multifunctional Naval Platform at the Marinha Central Facilities on December 17, 2024 in Lisbon, Portugal. (Photo by Zed Jameson/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish naval defense firm STM signed a contract with Portugal for two Auxiliary Oiler Replenisher and Logistics Ship (AOR+) — the first contract for naval ships between Turkey and a NATO nation — the firm said in a statement Tuesday. 'Türkiye, which is one of the 10 countries in the world that manufactures its own warships, has now started to produce these products as well as export them to our friendly and allied countries,' Turkish Secretary of Defence Industries Haluk Görgün said in the statement. 'Developing strong defence and defence industry cooperation with our NATO Allies is a top priority for Türkiye.' The ships will be able to transport and resupply naval vessels at sea with fuel, drinking water, cargo and ammunition, according to a statement by the Portuguese navy, and if necessary could aid in disaster support. Specifically, STM said the two AOR+ vessels will be able to operate for 90 days at sea and 'have the capacity to transport armored vehicles, enabling them to support joint and amphibious operations. With an aft vehicle ramp, each vessel will be capable of carrying up to 20 light tactical armored vehicles.' Görgün added that the agreement is a step towards broader cooperation with the Portuguese navy in other areas, such as unmanned maritime vehicles, electronic warfare systems, and further shipbuilding and naval modernization projects. The contract was signed Tuesday in Lisbon, and work on the ships is expected to begin in 2025, and the Portuguese navy said they expect delivery by 2028. Turkey has been beefing up its naval defense sector and production capabilities in recent years with shipyards, floating docks and multi-purpose ships. In 2023, another Turkish firm, Havelsan, unveiled its unmanned submarine Caka, designed to perform infrastructure and naval protection missions. Earlier this year, Turkish Aksaz Shipyard command was inaugurated and launched the first national submarine floating dock with a 3,000-ton lifting capacity. In November, Turkish firm Baykar's unmanned combat aerial vehicle performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/in-deal-with-portugal-turkish-naval-firm-stm-signs-first-export-contract-to-nato-nation/	2024-12-18T09:36:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/GettyImages-2189881493-scaled-e1734535702223.jpg
The ‘Last Supper’ era is over — it’s time for the ‘First Breakfast’	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) In less than two months, President-elect Trump will take office facing significant national security threats to US interests — particularly from China. Unfortunately, he will also have to grapple with a Department of Defense (DoD) and defense industrial base struggling to overcome decades of neglect to meet our nation’s increasingly complex defense needs. The administration has a chance to take action early on. Within one month of taking office, the incoming secretaries of defense and state should sit down with key industry leaders for the 'First Breakfast' — a frank and overdue conversation between the government and industry on these threats, what the government needs from industry, and industry’s take on how the government can help it meet these needs. While the term 'First Breakfast' has been offered in this context before, what we propose is something more comprehensive — a path to the relationship reset between government and industry in order to confront our hardest national security challenges. In the twilight of the Cold War, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin and his deputy, Bill Perry, invited the CEOs of the nation’s largest defense companies to the Pentagon for a meeting in the Secretary’s dining room, now known as the 'Last Supper.' In that 1993 meeting, Perry presented the group with a tough message: Defense budgets would shrink and the industry would need to consolidate to survive. Industry took that warning to heart, with the number of prime defense contractors shrinking from 51 to 5 by 2003 as a result of rampant mergers and acquisitions. For much of the three decades since the Last Supper, the US enjoyed a period of uncontested military overmatch against our adversaries, unencumbered by the threat of a legitimate near-peer competitor. However, we now find ourselves in an era of historic uncertainty and international security challenges — a period in which Mara Karlin, a former senior DoD official, recently posited as a turn toward 'total war,' in which all elements of national power are leveraged against a broad array of targets to reshape the world order. After decades of industrial mismanagement by the government, we now find our national advantage eroded and in need of urgent reinvigoration. We are faced with the need to have a similarly urgent, but very different conversation to reverse the failures of the past — it is time for the 'First Breakfast’. But given the complexity and opportunity of the modern geopolitical and economic environments, this meal needs to look different. It should bring together not only the few remaining primes but also innovative new entrants, insurgent mid-sized companies, and national security-attuned private equity. Recognizing the modern focus on transforming conflict through automation and cutting-edge, rapidly evolving software, the First Breakfast should include our nation’s leading software companies. And given the inextricable synergy between diplomacy and defense in securing our national interests, the need to support partner and allied militaries, and the opportunity to leverage industrial capacity and capital abroad, the secretary of state should co-lead this discussion. (A disclaimer: Our employer, Beacon Global Strategies, represents a broad spectrum of clients, including defense and non-defense companies ranging from small startups to industry leaders.) The discussion should lead with a candid conversation about the myriad of strategic threats we face and the erosion of our industrial overmatch — in both technology and mass. The next administration should be transparent about the operational challenges our military faces and include industry as the essential ally required to overcome them. Foundational challenges such as workforce shortfalls, the reality of static defense spending, and the impact of increasingly expensive, but necessary, investments in modernization and personnel should be discussed frankly as realities that directly inform industrial investment. A successful First Breakfast would produce a path toward restoring trust, improving government-industry cooperation, increasing opportunities for new defense industry entrants and fostering competition, and reducing friction between industry and decisionmakers based on a shared understanding of each other's motivations and challenges. But crucially, this cannot kick off a two-year process towards the development of a new industrial strategy. Instead, within four weeks of meeting, the group should produce a list of guiding principles, detailing what government needs industry to do better, what the government can do to enable industry to meet government demand, and what issues the two need to continue working on side-by-side. The group should plan follow-on gatherings to develop and concrete actions and deliverables and track progress against the guiding principles for mutual accountability. Importantly, this must not be a partisan endeavor — congressional senior leaders must be allies in these efforts to invigorate defense industrial base innovation and production. For too long, Congress has abrogated their duties to pass timely and regular appropriations, instead relying on continuing resolutions that defer their constitutional responsibility to a later date all the while immobilizing the entire defense community, leading to additional costs to the taxpayer. Senior congressional leaders should understand the gravity of inaction and partisan brinksmanship, and resume their responsibility as partners, not parochialists. Of course, our military and industry have discussed many of these issues on the margins for years, particularly as our national security focus shifted away from counterterrorism and towards near peers. And efforts at all sorts of reform, from acquisition to foreign military sales to overcoming the 'valley of death' are vital. A clear, blunt and more strategic 'First Breakfast' conversation can push these difficult policy reforms forward. It's clear that our nation’s defense-industrial trajectory just isn’t sustainable. The 'First Breakfast' would be a significant step towards resetting the government’s relationship with industry and orient the full strength of American power and ingenuity toward the national security challenges of today and the future.

China’s nuclear arsenal keeps growing amidst leadership purge: Pentagon report	The Chinese military's new DF-41 intercontinental ballistic missiles, that can reportedly reach the United States, are seen at a parade to celebrate the 70th Anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, at Tiananmen Square on October 1, 2019 in Beijing, China. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — At a time when the Chinese government is purging its officer rolls and dealing with a slowing economy, it has continued growing its nuclear arsenal and conventional arms ambitions, according to a new Pentagon report. That finding is part of the Pentagon’s congressionally mandated 2024 China Military Power Report, an annual document providing US insights into the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) strategy and weapons development. This year’s report, largely covering 2023 activities, does not offer up any new bombshells about PLA weapon development or strategy, but still serves as a valuable window into the US government’s perspective on Chinese military activities. When it comes to the ongoing military purge inside China, a senior US defense official said, 'The PLA [People’s Liberation Army] continues to struggle with deeply rooted problems of corruption.' In the second half of 2023 alone, at least 15 high ranking military officials and defense industry executives were removed from their posts for corruption, the official told reporters Monday ahead of the report’s release. Several of those officials were directly responsible for overseeing equipment projects related to modernizing China's ground based nuclear and conventional missiles. For now, the Pentagon anticipates that this anti-corruption push will continue, in part, because Beijing believes that keeping weak or corrupt leaders in key positions inside the PLA, it could potentially slow China down from achieving its 2027 weapon modernization goals and, eventually, trying to reunify with Taiwan, the US defense official added. The official threw cold water on the much-ballyhooed fear that an invasion of Taiwan is on the calendar, saying 'On 2027, I would reiterate that we don't think that conflict [with Taiwan] is imminent or inevitable: We think that we have deterrence today that's real and strong.' Still, 'We do judge that that is a capability development milestone that could give the PLA greater capacity to be a more credible military tool for the Chinese Communist Party's unification efforts,' the official later added. When it comes to China's arsenal of weapons, the report doesn’t disclose any massive departure from previous predictions. The PLA is still on track to hit its goal of having 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, and as of mid-2024, that stockpile had surpassed 600 — roughly 100 more than was listed in last year's report. 'We're showing a rate of growth that is pretty well consistent with what we've described in reports over the past… few years, about their nuclear expansion and modernization,' the US senior defense official added. Also similar to last year’s report, the US assesses that the PRC has completed construction of its three solid-propellant silo fields, which will cumulatively contain at least 300 new intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) silos. And the PRC is also still interested in developing a new, conventionally armed, intercontinental range missile system that could strike targets in Hawaii, Alaska and inside the continental United States — an idea disclosed last year and not expanded on. The PRC’s space industry, meanwhile, is 'rapidly expanding' its intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, navigation, and communication satellite constellations, according to the report. 'Through 2030, the PRC will continue to leverage its nonmilitary and commercial space activities to expand its global influence,' it added. 'Beijing’s policies to encourage private investment in space activities have influenced a broad range of firms to enter the commercial space market.' The PLA Navy. meanwhile, has maintained a fleet of 'more than' 370 ships and submarines, while the PLA Air Force continued to modernize its aircraft and drones. 'The PLA transferred significant portions of PLA [Navy] shore-based, fixed-wing combat aviation units, facilities, air defense, and radar units to the PLA [Air Force],' the report said. 'Given time, this shift will probably enable better command and control over the PRC’s integrated air defense systems as well as the network of ground-based air domain awareness radars supporting the PRC’s national integrated air defense system network.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-nuclear-arsenal-keeps-growing-amidst-leadership-purge-pentagon-report/	2024-12-18T07:00:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/221129_china_icbm_parade_GettyImages-1172705774-scaled-e1669731562738.jpg
Autonomy changes everything about combat engineering	Combat engineering tasks are a significantly dangerous set of activities. Combat engineers, or 'sappers' as they're called, clear the battlefield ahead using explosives and machines with front-end equipment so maneuver forces can travel forward unhindered. For countermobility, their mission is to slow down opposing land forces with terrain-based effects like Dragon’s teeth. Deployment of robotic combat engineering assets will significantly reduce risk to exposed soldiers in the breach executing mobility/countermobility missions, while maintaining or increasing the tempo of movement for maneuver forces. In this editorial eBRIEF, Breaking Defense examines the challenges and opportunities associated with robotics and autonomy for combat engineering.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/autonomy-changes-everything-about-combat-engineering/	2024-12-18T05:23:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Breaking-defense-eBrief-Pearson-Engineering-Featured-Image.jpg
Raytheon, Ursa Major log successful solid rocket motor flight test	A solid rocket motor developed by Ursa Major is preparing to be tested at its Berthoud, Colorado campus. (Ursa Major) WASHINGTON — RTX weapons arm Raytheon and defense startup Ursa Major Technologies have completed two successful test flights of a missile propelled by a new solid rocket motor, the companies announced today. The recent tests mark a step forward in Ursa Major's path to become a third provider of solid rocket motors for the US weapons industry around 2026, when qualification of the technology is currently scheduled, the companies stated in a news release. 'There is a new player on the scene in the solid rocket motor industry,' Ursa Major CEO Dan Jablonsky told reporters during a roundtable. 'This is an Army program that we've been working on with Raytheon. In this particular program, we went from concept and design to firing and flight on the range in just under four months, which is lightning fast.' The two test flights, held at Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake in California, involved a Raytheon-made missile propelled by an Ursa Major solid rocket motor measuring less than 10 inches in diameter, Jablonsky said. However, much about the capability Ursa Major is developing — and the weapon that will use it — is shrouded in mystery. Jablonsky declined to comment on whether a missile from an existing program of record or a newly-developed design was flown during the tests. Nor did he comment on the range of the weapon involved or the exact size of the rocket motor. RELATED: Ursa Major takes aim at DoD solid rocket motor market A Raytheon spokesperson referred questions about the missile to the Army, adding that the company 'is working with several rocket motor suppliers to rapidly develop and deliver affordable solutions to the US Army at the speed of relevance.' Over the next year, Ursa Major plans to do more test flights with Raytheon, including with an extended range version of the weapon. It will also expand its facilities to enable the company to ramp up production when the design is fully qualified, he said. 'Not only do we expect to pick up programs of record in the vicinity of what we've just flown … but we used and proved out our agile manufacturing techniques in doing so,' Jablonsky said, adding that Ursa Major could provide surge capacity for other programs of record with Raytheon or potentially other weapons companies. The US solid rocket motor industry is currently limited to only two vendors: L3Harris’s Aerojet Rocketdyne subsidiary and Northrop Grumman, which acquired manufacturer Orbital ATK in 2018. The already fragile SRM industrial base was hit hard by supply chain constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and has struggled to recover as demand for weapons skyrockets due to the war in Ukraine. Executives from defense primes like RTX and Lockheed Martin have expressed frustration with current providers' production capacity and schedule challenges, and are injecting money and technical know-how with other companies interested in broadening the industrial base. But while several defense tech startups such as Ursa Major Technologies, Anduril and X-Bow Systems have announced plans to enter the market, it will take years for their designs to be tested and qualified. RTX Ventures, Raytheon's venture capital arm, has been investing in Ursa Major since 2023. In the 14 months since Ursa Major first stood up its solid rocket motor manufacturing cell, it has grown that unit to about 40 employees, Jablonsky said Ursa Major has developed configurations of motors from two-inch diameter — about the size used for shoulder-launched weapon systems, to 22-inch diameter motors that could be used for vertical launch systems. The company is also producing its own energetics — a decision that Jablonsky said will keep Ursa Major from having to rely on the same suppliers already working to their limits to support existing solid rocket motor requirements. Other major weapons makers are also engaged in partnerships with potential new motor suppliers. In August, Lockheed announced it would partner with General Dynamics Ordnance and Tactical Systems to develop the latter company as solid rocket motor manufacturer for Lockheed’s Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS). At the time, executives said the first motors would roll off GD’s production line in Camden, Ark., around 2025. If that effort is successful, GD-OTS could begin producing motors for additional systems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/raytheon-ursa-major-log-successful-solid-rocket-motor-flight-test/	2024-12-17T21:01:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/URSA_Solid_Rocket_Motor-scaled.jpg
Congress unveils stopgap funding bill with $5.7 billion for Virginia-class subs	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023.

(Photo by Tony McDonough / AFP) (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — After days of grueling negotiations, House leadership today released a stopgap funding proposal that would extend federal funding into mid-March and add $5.7 billion in emergency funds for Virginia-class submarine construction. Now Congress has until Friday night to pass the continuing resolution (CR) before federal spending runs out, giving lawmakers a tight timeframe to move through procedural hurdles and avert a government shutdown. Congressional leadership reached a deal on this evening after days of negotiations, which initially saw Republicans seeking extra funds for farmers and Democrats pushing for additional disaster relief to be included in the spending bill. Ultimately, the 1,574-page agreement expanded to include a laundry list of other issues, including public health and workforce programs as well as the future of Washington’s RFK Stadium. For defense, the most newsworthy item is the pot of additional submarine funding, which will allow the Navy to incrementally fund emerging needs on the Virginia-class submarine contract or 'other nuclear-powered vessel programs' until the end of fiscal 2029. Specifically, it would fund 'the improvement of workforce wages and non-executive level salaries,' the bill text states. The funds are classified as emergency spending — a critical designation that allows the Defense Department to sidestep current spending limits imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act, as well as any future budget caps. The funds could provide additional funding flexibility for the Navy as it tries to strengthen the submarine industrial base, which is struggling to hire and retain skilled technicians and boost small suppliers. Other defense related increases include the addition of disaster relief funding for military installations that suffered damages caused by Typhoon Mawar as well as various hurricanes. It also directs the Air Force to transfer the 113th Wing of the District of Columbia Air National Guard to the 175th Wing of the Maryland Air National Guard. While inserting language on various domestic issues was seen as critical for House Speaker Mike Johnson to win Democrat support — a key consideration, given the GOP’s razor-thin majority in the House and potential need to amass a two-thirds majority for bill passage — the accumulation of provisions unrelated to the CR itself could rankle hardline and fiscal conservatives who had pushed for a bare-bones CR. During a news conference this morning, Johnson said he is hopeful he can get House Republicans on board and defended the last-minute additions to the bill. 'It’s not a Christmas tree, it’s not an [omnibus]. … This is a small CR that we had to add things that were out of our control,' Johnson said, noting the need for additional aid for farmers and disaster relief funding. The CR would extend until March 14, ahead of an April 30 deadline to pass a full-year appropriations bill before across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration kick in, under the terms of the FRA.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/congress-unveils-stopgap-funding-bill-with-5-7-billion-for-virginia-class-subs/	2024-12-17T17:00:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/virginia-australia-scaled-e1723223982442.jpg

HASC leaders turn up heat on Space Force leadership over acquisition plans	House Armed Services Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., left, and ranking member Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., attend the House and Senate committee markup of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 in Dirksen Building on Wednesday, November 29, 2023. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The leaders of the House Armed Services Committee are hitting at Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman about whether the Space Force is adequately building its acquisition workforce, according to a new letter obtained by Breaking Defense. In the letter addressed to Saltzman, Rep. Mike Rogers, R.-Ala., and Rep. Adam Smith, D.-Wash., respectively the chairman and ranking member of the HASC, say they are concerned Saltzman and his team are too focused on boosting operators inside America's youngest military branch: 'We fear a divide that elevates operators at the detriment to other core functions of the Space Force will have negative impacts, potentially not immediately, but as we look to 2030 and beyond,' the duo wrote. The letter, which is dated today, calls out that acquisition issues were notably absent in Saltzman's presentations last week during the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference, something the members say is a disconnect from the CSO's earlier effort to bring together acquisition and operational experts via new organizational structures called Integrated Mission Deltas. 'As we received your remarks last week at the Spacepower conference, the omission of acquisition, training and testing has raised some questions as to the previous focus on maintaining alignment across these areas. We believe this is needed to not only be successful in developing the next generation space warfighter, but also to ensure that the Service will have the skillset and workforce to design, develop, and acquire systems that Guardians are going to need in the future,' Rogers and Smith wrote. The letter echoes remarks made by Rogers earlier today at a Space Force fifth birthday event sponsored by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) — likely a sign that the HASC leadership is comfortable making their frustrations with Saltzman's emphasis on operators public. To that end, the HASC leaders in the letter demand that the service provide answers to a series of questions about how acquisition expertise is being integrated into Guardian development and training. This includes providing a breakdown of what specialties are held by the officer corps by rank, 'to include operations (13S, 14N, 17X), engineering (62E), and acquisition (63A).' Further, the Space Force is tasked to describe how the new integrated deltas 'will be staffed with the required acquisition personnel beginning in 2026;' what acquisition training and development programs are being provided to junior officers; and how the service is planning to recruit, train and retain acquisition officials.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hasc-leaders-turn-up-heat-on-space-force-leadership-over-acquisition-plans/	2024-12-17T11:37:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/roger-smith-scaled-e1734463410948.jpg
Hanwha adds Coulter as global defense head	UKRAINE &#8211; 2024/05/12: In this photo illustration, Hanwha Group logo is seen on a smartphone and on a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As it works to expand globally, South Korea’s Hanwha is bringing over Michael Coulter from Leonardo DRS to take a newly-created role of Global Defense CEO. Coulter, in this new role, will 'be responsible for overseeing the global defense businesses of Hanwha Aerospace and its subsidiaries such as Hanwha Ocean and Hanwha Systems,' according to a Dec. 15 announcement. Hanwha 'aims to strengthen its strategic position by delivering integrated land, sea, and air solutions in key global markets, particularly the United States,' the announcement adds. Coulter recently was Leonardo DRS’s senior vice president of corporate business development. A Navy reserve officer, Coulter also held several Pentagon and State roles in the 2000s. 'Serving in the industry, I've been impressed by Hanwha’s continued growth as a leader in aerospace &amp; defense and the commitment to deliver for its customers,' Coulter said in a statement. 'As a combat veteran with a career devoted to security cooperation of allies and partners, I am committed to the mission of this great company to provide global security, industrial capacity, and solutions for the brave men and women who protect our freedoms.' Hanwha has been making global inroads in recent years, and has been eyeing expansion inside the United States as a priority. That includes buying Philly Shipyard earlier this year, with an eye on Naval contracts in the future.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hanwha-adds-coulter-as-global-defense-head/	2024-12-17T10:54:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240829_hanwha_sign_GettyImages-2152136253-scaled-e1724941769790.jpg
Hypersonic missile defense deserves predictable and sustainable funding	An early Glide Phase Interceptor design concept. (Missile Defense Agency) On Nov. 21, Russia’s Vladimir Putin gave the West a clear window into his strategic thinking and intent. By using the 'Oreshnik' missile against Ukraine — a weapon Putin claims is a 'hypersonic' threat, although analysts are mixed — he not only demonstrated his willingness to use the advanced parts of his arsenal, but also the unprecedented capability they represent. Afterwards, Putin bragged that the weapon is immune to missile defenses. Putting aside the question of whether this is a 'true' hypersonic weapon, his broader point is correct: As of this moment, the US has no real defenses against a hypersonic threat. Earlier this year, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) was forced to an unfortunate decision regarding its Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) program, which is supposed to provide America’s first defense against hypersonic glide vehicles. The reasons for and the consequences of that decision should serve as a cautionary tale for both the next Congress and incoming administration, especially if our country is to take serious weapons currently in the hands of adversaries like Mr. Putin. In the past, MDA had touted its commitment to its own 'best acquisition practices,' which included 'fly before you buy' and extending corporate competition deeper into the acquisition process. However, GPI had an early 'downselect' decision, picking one corporate contractor as the winner for the program and ending the competition. The decision came five years earlier than planned, before even an evaluation of the competing teams’ Preliminary Design Reviews. This is highly unusual. Lt. Gen. Heath Collins, the MDA Director, described the decision as 'resource driven.' This is Pentagon code for when the Department of Defense is presented with an arbitrary top line budget number — devoid of study, analysis, or overarching strategy — and then forced to fit its entire spending under that ceiling. In a recent interview, Collins stated, 'As we came into [FY] 25, the Fiscal Responsibility Act … put pressure on the entire department to make really tough prioritization and resource-informed decisions.' For GPI, a highly probable consequence of this early downselect decision is an unpredictable funding stream for the program. This, compounded with its relative programmatic immaturity and the potential for developmental challenges, raises concern about when the warfighter can expect GPI’s capability in their hands. As Masao Dahlgren from the Center for Strategic and International Studies has stated, 'downselecting so early in the development process adds risk — if any delays come up, there won’t be a competing design to choose.' This effort is currently represented by the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS) satellite capability, two of which were launched into orbit this past February. To ensure full and complete compatibility between the interceptor and the sensing and tracking system, these capabilities must be developed in parallel, so as to inform the design and final configuration of both. In the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, Congress mandated an early, terminal phase initial operating capability against hypersonics be provided by 2029. This interim solution is prudent, but this initial rudimentary system — aptly termed a 'gap-filler' — must not be allowed to compete for budget with the fully operationally capable GPI vehicle required by 2032. Two distinct and adequate funding streams are essential. Back in April 2023, Rep. Doug Lamborn, Chairman of the House Strategic Forces Subcommittee, spoke to the importance of these programs when he said, 'Given the rapid pace with which our adversaries are pursuing and fielding hypersonic systems, I am eager to hear ideas from DoD on how to pull both HBTSS and GPI to the left.' While that may no longer be possible given the fiscal realities forced upon MDA, Lamborn’s sentiments certainly describe the absolute need not to allow either program to languish. The incoming Trump administration has already signaled its desire to re-prioritize missile defense in a way the current Biden administration has not. Congress should make common cause with the new administration and breathe new life into missile defense of the homeland and forward-deployed US assets by providing a stabilized and predictable funding stream for GPI. The budget should be adequate for development and testing, and be resilient enough to weather the inevitable challenges any new program will encounter. Sufficient funding is the key to securing an acquisition timeline to field a fully operationally capable GPI by 2032. The stakes are indeed very high, and if Mr. Putin has shown us anything, it is that there is no time to waste. Major General Howard 'Dallas' Thompson (US Air Force – ret.) is a former Chief of Staff at NORAD and NORTHCOM.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/hypersonic-missile-defense-deserves-predictable-and-sustainable-funding/	2024-12-17T10:54:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-19-at-5.31.16-PM-e1734125879645.png
Rep. Pat Fallon introducing bill to block DoD IT contracts with Chinese entities (Exclusive)	Keyboard with China flag key (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Texas Republican Rep. Pat Fallon plans to introduce a bill today that will prohibit the Department of Defense from doing information technology-related business with Chinese entities, Fallon tells Breaking Defense. The bill, titled the 'Safeguard American Innovation Act,' would ban the Secretary of Defense from 'entering, renewing, or extending an IT contract' with companies that have specific ties with the People’s Republic of China, according to a preview of the bill sent to Breaking Defense before its release. 'The ‘Protecting American Innovation Act’ is vital to securing our nation’s technology and deterring foreign threats, particularly from China. Recent cyberattacks like SolarWinds and Salt Typhoon have shown how vulnerable our defense and IT systems are to foreign interference,' Fallon, a House Armed Services Committee member, told Breaking Defense in an email. 'This bill will take action to prevent this by blocking any Department of Defense (DOD) contracts with companies tied to China that could jeopardize our national security.' With the 118th Congress ending in just a few weeks, this iteration of the bill is effectively dead on arrival. But Fallon said he is introducing the bill now so it will be a priority in the next Congress, and a spokesperson said the plan is to reintroduce the language once the 119th Congress is up and running. 'Along with the return of President Trump’s leadership, Rep. Fallon’s intention going into the 119th Congress is to ensure US equities are protected from the PRC influence to prevent what we saw with Salt Typhoon and Solar Winds. Innovation is our main asymmetric advantage and Congress needs to protect that at all costs,' the spokesperson said in an email. According to the proposed language, the Secretary of Defense will be barred from doing business with IT companies that are characterized as the following: Fallon, who serves on the HASC's subcommittee for Cyber, Innovative Technologies and Information Systems, said that one major concern he has with the DoD doing IT business with Chinese entities is due to the fact that 'China’s laws force companies to share sensitive technology, including software source code,' adding that this 'poses a serious risk.' 'By banning contracts with companies that operate in China, are funded by the People’s Republic of China (PRC), or allow China access to critical code, this bill helps ensure our IT infrastructure remains secure and our technological advancements stay out of adversaries' hands. This legislation is essential to protecting American innovation, keeping our military safe, and maintaining US technological leadership,' he added. Related: Chinese sanctions on US drone firm were ‘signal’ about supply chain weaknesses: DIU official Fallon’s bill to address IT concerns comes after several years of rising anxiety from the Pentagon and lawmakers that the US supply chain is still interwoven with Chinese entities. There have been efforts to get at this problem. For example, in 2020 the Defense Innovation Unit launched its Blue UAS program, a 'holistic and continuous approach that rapidly vets and scales commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology for the Department of Defense (DoD)' in part to ensure parts don’t come from adversaries. And on the Congressional side, the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act states that beginning on Oct. 1, 2027, no funds appropriated or made available for the DoD can be spent to procure a battery produced by the listed Chinese-owned and -operated companies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rep-pat-fallon-introducing-bill-to-block-dod-it-contracts-with-chinese-entities-exclusive/	2024-12-17T07:59:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_cybersecurity_china_keyboard_GettyImages-184947489-scaled-e1677516091595.jpg
Lithuania agrees to purchase 44 Leopard 2 tanks in country’s largest-ever defense deal	An Leopard Tank of the Bundeswehr Panzerlehrbrigade 9 (9th Armoured Demonstration Brigade) during a presentation of capabilities by the unit on May 20, 2019 in Munster, Germany. (Photo by Morris MacMatzen/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Lithuania has signed off on plans to procure 44 Leopard 2 tanks, in what the Lithuanian government is calling the single largest defense acquisition project in the country’s history. Minister of National Defence Dovilė Šakalienė signed the documents on Monday while visiting with German defense minister Boris Pistorius in Berlin. While costs and delivery dates were not made public in the statement, Šakalienė told the Baltic News Service that the goal is to have the tanks by 2030. 'The agreement on Leopard acquisition is the largest contract Lithuania has ever signed. It is a pivotal stage of modernizing our armed forces and strengthening the regional security,' Šakalienė said in a statement, according to an online translation. 'The new tanks will facilitate integration and interoperability of [the] Lithuanian and German militaries.' The Leopard, produced by Franco-German conglomerate KNDS, has seen a resurgence of interest since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The company is pursuing new concepts for future Leopards, and won a large contract with Norway in 2023 — although that was scaled back months later. However, KMDS has seen strong competition in Europe from South Korean made vehicles. Lithuanian Minister of National Defence Dovilė Šakalienė and german defense minister Boris Pistorius signed an agreement on Leopard tanks on Dec 16 2024. (Lithuanian government) Lithuania, which shares borders with both Russian ally Belarus and the Russian territory of Kaliningrad, has increased its defense spending since the Ukraine conflict began. The previous government, which lost its election in October, promised to spend at least 3 percent GDP on defense starting in 2025, and Gitanas Nausėda, the long-standing Lithuanian president, was quoted by BNS as saying, 'I hope we can reach 3.5 percent, and in the near future, even 4 percent.' During her visit to Germany, Šakalienė also pledged that Lithuania remains committed to hosting a Germany brigade in Lithuania, near the Belarussian border. Lithuania is in the process of building out infrastructure for the 5,000 German soldiers and their families, something Šakalienė discussed with Pistorius, per the statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lithuania-agrees-to-purchase-44-leopard-2-tanks-in-countrys-largest-ever-defense-deal/	2024-12-17T07:25:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/germany_Leopard_2-scaled-e1694462454396.jpg
Rogers warns Space Force leadership not to overly prioritize operations	Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Ala., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. (Credit: Andrew Harnik/AP Photo/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — As the Space Force nears its fifth birthday on Dec. 20, one of its strongest proponents in Congress is warning the service has spent too much focus on training operators for a future fight at the expense of developing technology and acquisition experts within the Guardian cadre. 'The Space Force has to be led by more than just operator. A deep understanding and connection with technology is at the core of the Space Force,' said Rep. Mike Rogers, R.-Ala., in written remarks obtained by Breaking Defense ahead of his speech today at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'Operators, acquisition, intel, and cyber professionals must all be on equal footing,' While welcoming the push by Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman (and his predecessor, Gen. Jay Raymond) for 'building a warfighting culture and normalizing space as part of the joint fight,' Rogers stressed that at the same time 'the development of acquisition and other professionals is just as important. 'After all, what are those operators going to operate if acquirers aren’t acquiring?' asked Rogers, who chairs the House Armed Services Committee. 'The House Armed Services Committee is going to be keeping a close eye to ensure that the Space Force is paying adequate attention to imbuing Guardians with acquisition skills,' a congressional source told Breaking Defense. One of the primary reasons Rogers was an early proponent of the service's creation was the pressing need for space acquisition reform, the source noted. Indeed, Rogers and his former counterpart, now-retired Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., led a bipartisan effort to create the first civilian Space Acquisition Executive (SAE) at the Pentagon to help consolidate oversight of the myriad entities with space systems buying power. In his speech today, Rogers also advocated for growing the Space Force in order to meet the ever-increasing threats from China and Russia. However, doing so doesn't necessarily mean 'a wholesale increase in end strength,' he said. Instead, he suggested that both the Air Force and the Defense Department writ large 'transfer' some of their personnel billets over to the Space Force — a move that would surely cause push-back from the offices that would lose personnel. He also argued for more budgetary investment in the newest military service, citing both the growth in its mission areas and the highly technical nature of space operations that requires constant innovation. That said, Rogers cautioned that Congress does not want to be in the position of throwing good money after bad. 'We can no longer afford to wait 8-plus years to develop requirements, and conduct long drawn-out competition processes. Nor can we afford these endless cost-plus development contracts,' he said. Rogers praised the progress on this front made so far by Frank Calvelli in his role as the first SAE, but said it is not enough. 'The Department must be more agile and continue to use every lever that has been given to it by Congress to 1) increase competition on these programs; 2) minimize requirement changes; 3) buy commercial; and 4) find ways to partner and draw more non-traditional companies into the defense market,' Rogers said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rogers-warns-space-force-leadership-not-to-overly-prioritize-operations/	2024-12-17T06:17:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/rogers-scaled-e1692899918123.jpg
Portugal seals order for 12 A-29N Super Tucano aircraft	Concept art of a Portuguese Air Force A-29N Super Tucano (Embraer) BELFAST — Portugal has ordered 12 A-29N Super Tucano aircraft from Brazilian manufacturer Embraer, in a deal valued at €200 million ($210 million). The company announced in a Monday statement that it had signed an agreement with the Portuguese Ministry of National Defense for the acquisition and added Lisbon will become the launch customer of the NATO standard version of the light attack and training plane. 'This acquisition reflects Portugal’s commitment to modernizing its Air Force with a versatile and proven aircraft, ideally suited for Advanced Pilot Training, Light Attack, Close Air Support (CAS) and Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions,' said Embraer. The order for the aircraft sits under Portugal's Close Support Aircraft program, one of eight major equipment projects prioritized by the country's Military Programming Law, a multiyear defense spending plan. In line with operational requirements, Embraer stressed that the new Super Tucano's will be equipped with 'advanced avionics, NATO-specific communications systems and other non-disclosed new capabilities.' Embraer has been marketing a NATO-specific version of the A-29, a light- attack prop plane, for several years, but Portugal marks the first customer to sign on. The Portuguese Air Force has been left with an advanced trainer capability gap since retiring Dassault/Dornier Alpha Jets in 2018. Portugal's Council of Ministers officially approved the order last week and shared that the acquisition, as a whole, will also include 'a flight simulator, logistics, support, goods and services,' according to an online translation of a government statement. 'The project will involve a strong participation of Portuguese industry in highly technological areas, with a view to reconfiguring the aircraft to NATO standards and specifications,' added Lisbon. Foi hoje assinado o contrato de aquisição de 12 aviões #SuperTucano que vão no futuro equipar a #ForçaAérea. Esta aeronave será empregue em missões de apoio aéreo próximo bem como formação avançada de pilotagem.

A select group of local Portuguese aerospace companies are set to be involved in development and systems integration of the aircraft, based on a prior Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). That agreement was signed in April by Centro de Engenharia e Desenvolvimento de Produto (CEiiA), Empordef Tecnologias de Informação, S.A. (ETI), GMVIS Skysoft, S.A. (GMV) and OGMA S.A. The latest Super Tucano order also strengthens Brazilian and Portuguese defense co-operation, building on Lisbon's 2019 order for five KC-390 Millennium tankers, the second of which was delivered in June. Embraer on Tuesday also announced the establishment of a new Portuguese subsidiary, Embraer Defense Europe, aimed at supporting 'strategic objectives in creating relevant and cutting-edge defense and security solutions for customers in Europe and NATO.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/portugal-seals-order-for-12-a-29n-super-tucano-aircraft/	2024-12-17T05:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/A-29N-SUPER-TUCANO-FAP-scaled-e1734441846914.jpg
For artificial intelligence to be mission-critical, it must hallucinate less	The Air Force CIO and Air Force Research Laboratory are accelerating initiatives to provide Guardians, Airmen, and contractors the ability to responsibly experiment with Generative AI, with adequate safeguards in place. (U.S. Air Force graphic). The Defense Department has doubled down on a data-driven military empowered by artificial intelligence. The use of AI for mission-critical applications for national defense, however, has been hindered by one reason in particular – hallucinations. Hallucinations happen when large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect information. It’s not uncommon for LLMs to hallucinate as often as 1 in every 10 responses, according to a study by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. It’s that 10-percent error rate that’s slowed a fuller potential for AI in the DoD. Now, however, there’s a new software solution called Retrieval Augmented Generation Verification (RAG-V) that addresses hallucinations in LLMs by drastically reducing their occurrence. Introduced by Primer, which builds practical and trusted AI for complex enterprise environments, RAG-V nearly eliminates hallucinations by adding a novel verification stage. John Bohanon is vice president for data science at Primer. 'RAG-V makes it possible to take a Large Language Model and put it into a mission-critical setting so warfighters can rely on it; that's the heart of the matter,' said John Bohanon, vice president for data science at Primer. 'In some settings you want hallucinations; it's called creativity, such as when you want ideas for throwing a party. These models are very creative and come up with stuff out of thin air. 'The dark side is if you're using it in a setting where factuality matters in getting answers to questions, hallucinations can be bad – especially when they're subtle. When it's an obviously incorrect piece of information, it's easy for a human to catch it. The dangerous thing is when the model’s confident and it looks correct, but it’s a hallucination saying it in such a plausible, credible way that it can fool you.' Primer works by incorporating a verification step akin to fact checking that grounds the LLM's responses in substantiated data sources, reducing the above-mentioned error rate from around 5-10 percent – which is the state-of-the-art for leading LLMs – to just 0.1 percent. This dramatic improvement in reliability is critical for applications where factual accuracy is paramount, enabling warfighters and analysts to trust the AI-generated insights and make time-sensitive decisions with increased confidence. Beyond detecting hallucinations, RAG-V also provides detailed explanations of any errors, allowing the system to iteratively improve and further enhance trust. Primer's approach represents a significant advancement in responsible AI development, addressing key challenges around transparency and accountability that are essential for the adoption of these transformative technologies in the defense sector. RAG-V reduces hallucinations High-profile AI hallucinations have already made the news, especially in the legal profession where a lawyer submitted a court brief partially created with ChatGPT that invented case law. It’s not a mystery why hallucinations happen, though. They’re caused by the way LLMs are trained. Even though they seem to be a mysterious piece of new science, they're trained in a relatively simple manner that’s like a game of fill-in-the-blank. The LLM is fed text, for example, with some of the words hidden and the model fills in the blanks. Do that billions of times and the LLM becomes very good at putting words together – just not always the right words. What the model's trying to do is generate words that seem as high probability as possible, and read like they would’ve been written by a human. A partial solution for hallucinations came on the scene in 2021 called Retrieval Augmented Generation – without the verification part created by Primer – that mitigated hallucinations down to the level they’re at today. RAG works by retrieving relevant information from a trusted system of record and then including it in the prompt for the generative model. The prompt also instructs the model to answer the user’s question only on that retrieved data without filling in the blanks. Even with RAG, these models don’t always follow direction and still make errors and hallucinate. What Primer has done to bring down hallucinations to the point where trust can be restored on the part of the user is add a new, last step that fact checks the data against verifiable sources – hence the verification in RAG-V. With RAG-V, warfighters executing mission-critical applications can now add a trustworthy LLM capability to their toolkit in these times of great competitors also developing advanced AI capabilities where operations across multiple domains and at the edge are needed. Matthew Macnak is senior vice president of customer solutions engineering at Primer. 'In order for us to stay ahead of competitors like China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea – all of whom are using LLMs – our AI at its core is about helping the end users do something more efficiently by doing it with less effort in a faster manner,' said Matthew Macnak, senior vice president of customer solutions engineering at Primer. 'Primer is a full platform; it’s not just powered by an LLM so we can actually take a version of that into the field and still have the ability to process massive amounts of unstructured information with fewer personnel and more reliability due to RAG-V. 'Imagine that we can put our AI systems into something the size of a suitcase and then place it on an aircraft that's doing ISR missions. Now you have a few operators able to ingest, let's say, thousands of voice or text collects and analyze that information in real time rather than just collecting the data, going back, and waiting for the data to be analyzed. Now they can have a result in situ rather than waiting on someone else to tell them what to do.' More trust, fewer hallucinations Even with RAG, Large Language Models have error rates so bad – typically 5-10 percent of the time – that they can’t be trusted for many defense applications, as highlighted. The rate depends on the data and what questions are being asked of the LLM, but that makes them unacceptable for intelligence operations, for example. 'If you have something that's going to fib one out of every 10 times you ask it a question, that means that you have to check its work every single time,' noted Bohanon. 'You have to be hypervigilant and therefore that's a deal breaker in a setting where you're using this to actually augment a human. When the stakes are high, you can't afford to have to use a tool that you can't trust.' When it comes to LLMs, Bohanon suggests being a skeptical buyer. When an analyst’s need to brainstorm can be addressed with ChatGPT, for example, they’re likely in safe territory regarding hallucinations. But if the need is mission critical with high stakes, users should be wary of LLMs without a final step for verification and fact checking. 'Even when they're used with best practices like RAG and other guardrails for Large Language Models, they still have an unacceptable error rate. Potential users should come in with the mindset that this technology is new and there's only a few shops out there like Primer that are taking that problem seriously.' Added Macnak: 'We’ve all heard ‘trust but verify.’ The valuable part of RAG-V is that it allows the user to see exactly why it made a decision and more importantly how that output was verified. Our focus remains on the end user, whether that's an analyst, operator, or warfighter. 'To that end, we're building products and technology around those individuals that actually work in order to serve them. The 0.1 percent error rate we’ve reached with RAG-V is a great example of why we're doing this for users making mission-critical decisions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/for-artificial-intelligence-to-be-mission-critical-it-must-hallucinate-less/	2024-12-17T05:25:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/THEAIR_1.jpg
Poland acquires General Atomics MQ-9B SkyGuardian in $310M deal	Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, announces a deal to buy American MQ-9 SkyGuardian drones. (Poland's MND) WARSAW — Poland has signed off on a $310 million purchase of MQ-9B SkyGuardian drones from General Atomics. Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz, Poland’s Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense, signed the documents on Dec. 12. While the agreement is the first purchase from Poland of the SkyGuardian — the name for General Atomics’ Reaper — Warsaw has been operating similar drones since February 2023, when the country entered into a $70.6 million lease with General Atomics for MQ-9A Reapers. Warsaw didn’t initially disclose the number of systems purchased, but a Monday press release from GA-ASI announced Poland purchased three MQ-9Bs and two Certifiable Ground Control Stations (CGCS), as well as three years of GA-ASI’s SkyGuardian Global Support Solutions. Poland will acquire three #MQ9B SkyGuardians to serve as its primary intelligence, surveillance and recon capability, joining a growing network of operators that includes the United Kingdom, Belgium, Canada, Japan, Taiwan, India and the U.S. Read here: https://t.co/O6GXxUQYlv pic.twitter.com/ld4EXZ5iCD &mdash; GA-ASI (@GenAtomics_ASI) December 16, 2024 'This is a significant expense, but we are investing in the highest quality equipment,' said Kosiniak-Kamysz. He stated that the plan is for deliveries by first quarter 2027, 'However, we hope that this will happen sooner, which is what we are seeking from our proven partners.' A GA-ASI representative stressed after ceremony, 'It is possible that the delivery will be accelerated, because one of the first SkyGuardians intended for Poland has already been almost completed at the GA-ASI plant in San Diego.' 'This is an investment in Polish security and cooperation with a strategic partner — the United States. Poland is not only investing in the arms industry, but also strengthening economic relations with allies,' Kosiniak-Kamysz added.

The SkyGuardian comes with auto-takeoff and landing under SATCOM-only control, and can operate in unsegregated airspace. According to GA-ASI, the MQ-9B has seen contracts signed with 'Belgium, Canada, the Japan Coast Guard, the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force, Taiwan, India, and the U.S. Air Force in support of Special Operations Command.' The SkyGuardian purchase comes months after Kosiniak-Kamysz announced the creation of a so-called 'Drone Force,' following the model that Ukraine created earlier this year. (Earlier today, Russian defense minister Andrey Belousov also called for the creation of a drone-focused military branch.) 'A few months ago, I announced the creation of drone forces, which is becoming a fact,' Kosiniak-Kamysz said. 'From January 1, 2025, drone forces will no longer be a plan, but a real part of the Polish Army. […] Building drone forces is an absolute priority for us. 'An effective deterrence and defense policy requires investment in this type of troops. On the one hand, we have simple drones that can be mass-produced, even using 3D printers, and on the other – the most advanced drones, such as the ones we are currently buying.' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/poland-acquires-general-atomics-mq-9b-skyguardian-in-310m-deal/	2024-12-16T12:47:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_poland_buys_mq9_BART-e1734381773849.jpg
Following delay, congressional panel on future US Navy can start work	Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group in the Atlantic Ocean, April 2019. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Maxwell Higgins) WASHINGTON — After more than a year of delays, a congressional commission focused on outlining the optimal size and composition of the future US Navy is set to begin work, according to sources familiar with the panel. The commission, originally empaneled in the Fiscal Year 2023 National Defense Authorization Act, was tasked by lawmakers to 'undertake a comprehensive study of the structure of the Navy and policy assumptions related to the size and force mixture of the Navy, in order— (I) to make recommendations on the size and force mixture of ships; and (II) to make recommendations on the size and force mixture of naval aviation.' The body’s final work was due earlier this year, but ultimately delayed as key lawmakers who were required to appoint individual members had not made their selections. A congressional aide told Breaking Defense the panel is now able to begin working. A second source also confirmed that 'work is underway now' and that 'all 8 members have been officially appointed.' Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, was appointed by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and selected earlier this month to co-chair the panel, according to the congressional record. Breaking Defense previously reported Mitchell Waldman, a defense and aerospace industry executive, and Bryan McGrath, a retired Navy officer, were both appointed to the commission. A spokesperson for Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told Breaking Defense today the House Democrat tapped former Texas Congressman Filemon Vela as his pick. It was not immediately clear who else was appointed to the commission. Spokespeople for the relevant lawmakers did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Breaking Defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/following-delay-congressional-panel-on-future-us-navy-can-start-work/	2024-12-16T11:49:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/05/BigFleet-e1648482411758.jpg
First delivery for Air Force One slides to 2029, source says	Airman First Class Emily Albright (center) prepares to set chocks around Air Force One's landing gear Thursday, Jan. 30, 2014. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by 1st Lt. Nathan T. Wallin/Released) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s troubled project to provide two new Air Force One jets is facing new delays, likely pushing the delivery of the first jet out to 2029 or even later, a source told Breaking Defense. The Air Force is still working to validate the schedule for when Boeing can deliver the militarized jumbo jets, meaning they might arrive even later than 2029, according to the source, who requested anonymity to share non-public information. 'It’s an honor to be entrusted with this responsibility and we take pride in this work,' Boeing said in a statement. 'Our focus is on delivering two exceptional Air Force One airplanes for the country.' Negotiated under the previous Trump administration, the Air Force One deal has proved painful for Boeing amid massive headwinds, including over $2 billion in losses and years of delays. The jet’s first flight was last scheduled for March 2026, Breaking Defense previously reported, a setback of an additional 16 months. The Wall Street Journal first reported the new delivery date. An Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that Boeing is expected to provide a new master schedule in the spring. Once that’s delivered, the Air Force will then 'conduct a schedule risk assessment to inform establishing revised' dates for key milestones, such as when the aircraft could be operational. Officials expected the program to be about two-to-three years late under the revised 2022 schedule, which set the delivery of the first jet for September 2026 but with a year of schedule margin. The second was set to be delivered in February 2027, also with a full year of wiggle room. It’s not clear specifically when the jets would arrive under a revised plan. Boeing has faced a slew of challenges refurbishing the two 747s under contract for the program, ranging from supply chain to workforce. The new lags mean President-elect Donald Trump — who personally intervened in negotiations for the two jets — likely won’t be able to fly on a new Air Force One before his second term concludes. The first jet was originally expected this year. Trump’s return to the White House could also change the aircraft’s design once again, from a white and light-blue hue to his original preference for white, red and dark blue, Politico previously reported. The Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense that the aircraft’s 'livery options' were finalized last year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/first-delivery-for-air-force-one-slides-to-2029-source-says/	2024-12-16T09:52:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Air-Force-One-e1734368967339.jpg

PC-C4 is a U.S. Army-hosted Joint and Multinational experiment integrating modernization capabilities and formations through persistent experimentation at multiple echelons for the future operating environment being held from February 24 &#8211; March 20, 2024. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. Brahim Douglas) SAVANNAH, Ga. — The US Army has made upgrading its command and control capabilities a priority, but has shared relatively few details about how exactly they’re pursuing the sprawling project. But last week at the service’s biannual Technical Exchange Meeting, service officials dove deeper into plans for the next-generation C2 (NGC2) program, revealing among other details a tiered 'technology stack' the capability will be built on, and how industry can make it a reality. 'We're really, no kidding, trying to do this different[ly] than we've ever done it before without falling into some of the traps,' Mark Kitz, program executive officer of the Command, Control Communications-Network portfolio, told Breaking Defense. The plan can seem a bit complicated, as Army officials acknowledged, so they urged industry to keep an eye on the program’s ever-evolving characteristics of need (CON) document. 'It's not going to be one empirical document that drives us,' Gen. Patrick Ellis, director of the Army’s network cross-functional team, said on a TEM panel. 'There's going to be multiple in there. As we write those multiple documents, we're using that as our North Star to say, ‘Okay, this is what we're trying to design towards.’' (The document, first published in April, was last updated on Dec. 9.) The document won’t be the only thing that’s ever-evolving. Officials said they’re attempting to build as much flexibility into the acquisition process as possible, both to encourage creativity from vendors and to be able to drop those who aren’t cutting it. 'The government's actually not really good at building escape hatches into our contracts, and we need to be,' Alexander Miller, the senior advisor for science and technology and the chief technology officer to the Chief of Staff of the Army said during a panel. 'As much as we're talking about bringing on the right players, we're going to get rid of the wrong players. If we aren't being good teammates, and you aren't being good teammates, or somebody out there isn't being a good teammate, we don't want to team with them.' The technology stack, as described by Army officials and shown in a slide presentation at the TEM, was included in the CON document in order to 'drive home the importance that we have all of this in place,' Joe Welch, deputy to the commanding general at Army Futures Command, said during a panel. At the top of the stack is the application layer, which is responsible for user-facing applications like file transfer systems, web browsing, etc. — think anything that the user can see on the front end. Under the application layer is the operating systems layer, the software layer that underpins the user interface. Welch called this layer the 'integrated data layer' that’s responsible for 'the collection of services, data interfaces and data models that ultimately are supportive of those applications and allow applications to be built without having to rebuild services that other things may already be taking advantage of.' The third layer is the compute layer, which serves as the infrastructure layer that harnesses the processing power used to run the application and the operating systems layer. That may sound like fairly standard tech, but Welch said the compute layer 'is enormously more challenging when we start getting into the tactical operational environment.' Compute resources are not as readily available out in the field as they are at larger command posts or rearguard headquarters. 'It's a very hard optimization problem, and if it doesn't work, the applications and the services that I just mentioned, those top two layers, are not going to work either,' Welch said. The transport layer is at the bottom of the tech stack. This layer is responsible for managing the delivery of data between applications. It’s the way that data moves across the battle space, Welch said. As Breaking Defense has reported, battlefield bandwidth has emerged as an obstacle in data-rich and/or electronically contested environments. 'They could be WiFi. They could be radios, mesh networks. They could be pLeo [proliferated low-Earth orbit satellites]. They could be specially designed wave forms to minimize our electromagnetic signature. It could be all of the above, right? So that needs to work seamlessly as well,' he said. When finding the appropriate tools for the tech stack layers, Welch said the service needs to keep the standardization of application programming interfaces, or APIs, into account. 'A lot of the challenges we have with our systems today is that there is no standard way of communication between these layers. The layers are built in a disparate fashion, and there's also no communication between them. So that is a main focus area that we're going to have. The goal is open and standardized APIs, but the way that we achieve that is going to be very deliberate,' he said. The tech stack, as described last week, may not be the same one the Army wants next month or next year, however. Down the line, layers might be added as the service and its vendors establish what capabilities and requirements are needed through trial and error, Welch said. He emphasized that because of this, the service is going to write requirements that are less prescriptive, but still give industry enough of an idea of what the Army needs for NGC2. 'We're continuing to better describe the problem characteristics of the solution space, but still we are not getting prescriptive in a sense of, ‘This is the technology we need, this is the vendor we need to get it from,’ those types of things,' Welch said during an interview on the sidelines of the conference. 'It's still very much in the attributes of the solutions more so than the solutions themselves.' In another effort to create more flexibility in the program, the Army will not have one lead systems integrator for NGC2, but instead will have a few team leaders, Kitz said in an interview. 'Having competition and giving our users opportunities to prototype with more than one solution is potentially powerful, and it also stimulates industry investment, because there's more opportunities for industry. We certainly want to avoid this incumbency, right? We don't want an [integrator] who's going to lead us for the next 10 years, right? We want constant competition. We want constant new teaming.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-technology-stack-driving-the-armys-next-gen-c2-plans/	2024-12-16T09:43:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241216_DVIDS_george_c2_laptop_8298338-scaled-e1734368595302.jpg
Bring on the unstoppable rise of thinking war machines	GHWB Sailors perform a weapons trial on a Phalanx Close-In Weapon System (CIWS) on the aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush (CVN 77) during carrier qualifications. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Brandon Roberson) The war in Ukraine has demonstrated, once and for all, that drones are here to stay — but it has also underlined that battlefield communications are fragile and easily disrupted, leaving drones unable to receive their orders from their operators. The US military is developing ways to defeat pervasive signal jamming, but it should recognize there will be no silver bullet, and that there will be times when the jammers win. The solution: The military will eventually need more machines that can think like human soldiers, deciding autonomously what to destroy and who to kill in ambiguous battlefield conditions. And to secure future battlefields, the Pentagon, and the public, will need to get over its 'Terminator' fears and embrace reality. The Pentagon is working to mitigate the effectiveness of Russian signal jammers in Ukraine, trying to enhance the jam resistance of weapons systems provided to the Ukrainian military. As another method to defeat jamming, Ukrainian forces seem to be targeting electronic warfare systems themselves, using munitions that aim for equipment emitting jamming signals. The architecture of proliferated satellite constellations has offered some protection against jamming, but Russia is increasingly successful at degrading Starlink service and has consistently been able to disrupt many other signals — like GPS and drone command and control links. For navigation, military officials are also looking at GPS alternatives that do not use signals, like image-aided and laser scanner navigation technologies. This is a cat-and-mouse game between the jammers and the jammed, with both sides racing to develop technologies that defeat each other's latest and greatest capabilities. What works one week might be obsolete the next. And that means that human control — differentiating between enemy and friendly soldiers and civilians, enemy and friendly aircraft and civilian airplanes, among other battlefield variables in various weather conditions and during daytime and nighttime — can never be assured, even mission to mission. Hence, the need to limit direct operator control. Broadly speaking, automated decision-making for identifying and engaging targets is not a new concept. Existing weapons such as heat-seeking missiles, mines, torpedoes, as well as systems like the Phalanx radar-guided gun and Israel’s Harpy drone, make lethal decisions autonomously, albeit following a very tight script that probably falls short of being considered artificial intelligence. Though a magnetic underwater mine detonating is an automatic reaction to it coming near a metallic warship hull, the action — the 'decision' made — looks more like the instincts of a closing Venus flytrap than like human decision-making. For years, the United States has looked at ways to incorporate AI into weapon systems, but has shown hesitancy towards AI-enabled autonomous weapons making lethal decisions without a human in the loop. Improved electronic warfare techniques should create an added sense of urgency and a reason for US policymakers and military leaders to reassess that reluctance. Unlike the United States, neither Russia nor China appear to be circumspect about AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapons. Moreover, they are already collaborating on AI-powered weapon systems. Along with other weapons, Russia has been testing a tank-like robot which could conceivably one day operate autonomously, potentially making real-time decisions on the battlefield about what to shoot. China is developing a myriad of warfighting systems, like submarines and aircraft, that are designed to make decisions autonomously without a human in the loop. Other countries are taking a similar approach. For example, Ukraine is working to deploy swarms of automated drones that do not require communications with operators to identify and attack their targets. The Pentagon lags behind, despite the fact there are no laws [PDF] that prohibit the development or use of AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapon systems. Perhaps the best example is the Bullfrog counter-drone system, which would become the first publicly known AI-enabled autonomous lethal weapon used by the US military. This system is a leap beyond legacy ones like Phalanx, Harpy, or underwater mine because it's not just reacting to one input—like a radar signature, radio emission, or magnetic signature—but rather using sensors to comprehensively understand its environment, identify hostile drones, and make decisions based on its human-trained algorithms. But Bullfrog is the exception, unfortunately, and not the norm. The US military should focus more on AI-enabled autonomous lethal weapons, particularly ones focused on drones, developing the technology so that it meets military requirements and addresses ethical concerns. Like Bullfrog, such systems can be designed for two modes—one allowing a human in the loop and another with full autonomy—so that fully automated capabilities are only used when and where appropriate to battlefield conditions. It must be acknowledged that lethal autonomous weapons will make mistakes. But humans also make mistakes. And civilians, or simply the wrong targets, fall into the crosshairs of today’s weapons systems that are guided by humans. Whereas humans may be susceptible to emotions, such as revenge, in the heat of battle, a weapon system trained using machine learning would not. Arguably, this means that machines might even make more predictable and rational decisions than people on the battlefield. They will also have to operate 'alongside' human soldiers, so work will be needed to examine and optimize the human-robot battlefield relationship. And if the US develops these systems now, AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapon systems elsewhere are more likely to reflect American and allied respect and adherence to the law of war, not ceding first mover advantage to Russia and China. During a future war in which the US military may not be able to consistently access parts of the radio spectrum, it will still need to offensively use uncrewed drones and defend against them, probably in very complex and fluid environments. Possession of AI-enabled lethal autonomous weapons will probably make Russia and China more eager and willing to jam as much radio spectrum as possible, because they will not need it for the tactical fight on the battlefield. If human soldiers find themselves cut off from communications with commanders, they can survive and win. If remotely operated machines are cut off, they do not work. The United States should focus on developing AI-enabled machines, particularly aerial drones and counter-drone systems, that can think, fight, and destroy without human direction. There is no reason to delay efforts to design and build algorithms and autonomous lethal warfighting systems that meet military needs and adhere to US values and principles.

China’s remote sensing buildup risks US national security: Congressional commission report	A Long March-4C carrier rocket carrying a new Earth observation satellite blasts off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China on Aug. 21, 2023.

(Photo by Wang Jiangbo/Xinhua via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A new report for Congress's US China Economic and Security Review Commission warns that China's rapidly expanding remote sensing capabilities already have raised risks to US national security, as well as created economic challenges. The report, shared with Breaking Defense ahead of its formal release, is authored by the OTH Intelligence Group and entitled 'China's Remote Sensing.' The bipartisan China Economic and Security Review Commission was created by Congress in 2000 to provide recommendations to Congress on the security implications of the US-China trade relationship, and has been influential in shaping member concerns about Beijing's economic policies. The OTH report was designed as a discussion paper both for members of the commission and Congress, a commission spokesperson told Breaking Defense. And while its publication does not represent endorsement by the commission, recommendations from similar reports in the past also have found their way into the commission's annual report to Congress, the spokesperson added. The key findings of the report states that 'China’s development of advanced remote sensing poses current and long-term risks to U.S. security,' including: 1) 'continued advancement of PLA military modernization by strengthening its abilities to observe, detect, track, and target U.S. and allied assets and personnel through both dedicated military sensing and dual-purpose civil government and commercial remote sensing capabilities; 2) the potential for China to gain an entrenched advantage in remote sensing platform and technology areas vital to the growth of emerging market areas, such as electric and autonomous vehicles, commercial satellite remote sensing and the space economy, and small UASs [uncrewed aerial vehicles].' In addition, the report finds that 'China is currently leading the world in research impact in several remote sensing technology areas, including applications of multispectral and hyperspectral imaging sensors, radar, and satellite positioning and navigation.' Beijing also is streaking ahead in the application of machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance its remote sensing chops, the report added. For example, 'reporting from April 2024 revealed that China’s Taijing-4 03 satellite, which is equipped with AI processors for rapid detection and identification of targets at sea, captured detailed images of three U.S. aircraft carriers, two Arleigh Burke-class warships, and four other vessels at U.S. Naval Station Norfolk. Taijing-4 03 is part of a five-satellite constellation operated by Chinese commercial remote sensing company MinoSpace, reflecting the connections between the PLA and China’s emerging commercial remote sensing industry.' The findings echo concerns expressed by a raft of top Space Force brass at last week's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., that the PLA will use the growing number of Chinese military intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance satellites and commercial remote sensing satellites to target US terrestrial forces. Among the report's 12 specific recommendations is a call for Congress to 'consider regulatory and financial measures to support the domestic remote sensing industry and incentivize investment in areas such as small drones and LiDAR [light detection and ranging] for autonomous systems and higher-risk next-generation remote sensing technologies such as quantum sensing.' This could be done, it elaborates, by 'expanding targeted funding for the National Science Foundation, Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR), Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR), and Office of Strategic Capital (OSC) as well as investment credits.' Another recommendation is that Congress 'encourage' the Defense Department to work more closely with allies to better understand how China might use its improve remote sensing capabilities in crises and conflicts, as well as how to reduce US and allied vulnerabilities. Further, the report suggests that Congress 'support DoD efforts to accelerate the procurement of commercial remote sensing from both the United States and allied nations,' and 'consider funding in future defense appropriation bills for measures that would mitigate the effects of improved Chinese remote sensing, such as counter-intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) systems, electronic attack and cyber capabilities, antiradiation ordnance, base hardening, close-in weapons systems, and air defense capabilities.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-remote-sensing-buildup-risks-us-national-security-congressional-commission-report/	2024-12-16T05:45:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/china-space-gaofan-scaled-e1734130323506.jpg
DoD authorizes first C2 gateway to modernize and update on its own for CJADC2	The ADSI C2 gateway from Ultra Intelligence &amp; Communications can communicate over dozens of tactical datalinks from Link 16 and NATO Link 1 to distributed systems datalinks. (Graphic courtesy of Ultra I&amp;C.) One of the holy grails of Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) is having a C2 system that can be interoperable between all services and partners. That means having a C2 gateway with the ability to communicate over dozens of tactical datalinks from Link 16 and NATO Link 1 to distributed systems datalinks. It means accepting a wide range of radar and sensor inputs to build a single integrated picture. And, of course, it must be cloud enabled with a containerized architecture that scales, and be software defined so it can be upgraded remotely for years to come without incumbent hardware costs. Far from unattainable, though, these capabilities are all present today in the C2 gateway called ADSI. At 2,500 sites in more than 35 countries, ADSI is well-known for connecting the global multi-domain battlefield, translating and sharing diverse communications protocols and coalition partner data sources. Newly modernized by Ultra Intelligence &amp; Communications (I&amp;C) for software-defined cloud-enabled C2 at the edge, and with the ability to constantly enhance mission effectiveness and interoperability through a continuous Authority to Operate (cATO), the ADSI of today is specifically engineered to support CJADC2 initiatives, enabling seamless coordination across concurrent, multi-theater support operations. 'As we look at what's happening in places like Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific, it's an incredibly complex threat environment that’s quickly evolving,' said Ultra I&amp;C Chief Technology Officer Randy Fields. 'Today we’re still using all of the sensors that have been fielded for the last 30 years, while constantly adding new sensors, software, air platforms, and drones. 'Managing that level of data for multi-domain operations is going to require a resilient gateway that enables interoperability between those fielded systems and the new systems that come online. That's the sweet spot for ADSI because we maintain connectivity with all the legacy and fielded systems, while being able to adapt our platform rapidly to onboard new data types very quickly.' Configuring tactical datalink interfaces on the fly Integrated air and missile defense (IAMD) along with its associated sensors and effectors is one area where complexity is growing exponentially, especially in the collection and processing of data necessary to counter threats from drones, ballistic missiles, and hypersonics. 'We are a core component within major missile defense systems and applications, and ADSI is one of the primary data routers to support interoperability with their sensors,' said Fields. 'It’s a broker to take in any type of data we can get access to through a new front-end open API that enables us to be very extensible rapidly. That lets us continuously expand our full library with new messages and data types to continue to be that trusted broker between new types and fielded systems.' The continued and expanding value of ADSI for C2 in multi-domain operations was recently demonstrated during the NATO-led Coalition Warrior Interoperability Exploration, Experimentation, Examination Exercise (CWIX) in Bydgoszcz, Poland, in mid-2024 – which brought together fielded, developmental, and experimental systems under a coalition umbrella. ADSI participated in the exercise as part of the Marine Corps Forces Europe and Africa team. It demonstrated forwarding and interoperability across coalition C2 systems by rapidly configuring tactical datalink interfaces to multiple nations on the fly. An operator views C2 data from Ultra I&amp;C's ADSI gateway on an Android Team Awareness Kit, ATAK. (Image courtesy of Ultra I&amp;C) Other accomplishments included facilitating data type conversions to enable integration of disparate systems by leveraging existing protocols, such as Cursor on Target (CoT) integration, CoT to Joint Range Extension Applications Protocol (JREAP-C) translation, JREAP-C forwarding and digital warfighting platform demonstration. This was all done with the latest, modernized version of ADSI, which unifies the best of breed for the 21 different instances of ADSI created for different customers into a single baseline product. Originally called the air defense system integrator, ADSI in its earlier incarnations was a processor that stood about chest-high that connected to radars and sensors with long cables. That’s all been modernized to be just purely software, deliverable as containers to rapidly field and reprovision in modern cloud-native environments. 'We are flying inside surveillance platforms, we are inside of ships, we're inside missile defense platforms, and we're across air operations centers in a number of enterprise locations,' said Fields. 'We're truly edge-to-enterprise. 'What's in our 2025 roadmap is for ADSI to continue to get smaller for use on mobile devices. Now that we're on containers, it's easier to get to the mobile device. We’re continuing to refine ADSI to make it easier to take that incredible capability and get it into some of these small platforms.' For legacy ADSI, Ultra I&amp;C provides the SyncNet8 serial-to-IP conversion appliance that enables fielded systems that are running analog to operate in a digital environment. That lets users keep their existing systems and stay interoperable, and also scale up in the future for any new systems and sensors that are brought online. The importance of a continuous ATO Earlier this year, ADSI became the first operational C2 gateway to earn a continuous Authority to Operate (cATO), enabling customers to quickly deploy into operational environments and maintain cybersecurity. Today it remains the only C2 gateway with an active cATO. 'Cybersecurity threats are evolving every single day,' said Fields. 'If I'm worried about my connectivity and the data that's on there, I would want to trust a platform that is earning its ability every day to be cyber secure versus another that is scanned periodically.' Continuous ATO lets Ultra I&amp;C push validated code into production on an ongoing basis, resulting in shorter development cycles, quicker feature deployment, and reduced cost while providing a more secure capability for mission operations. This modernization milestone also resolves existing interoperability challenges among a large volume of datalinks, setting a new standard for data utilization in support of mission success. The accreditation was achieved following rigorous evaluation through Second Front Systems’ Game Warden platform on the Operational Environment Data Integration Network (ODIN). Ultra I&amp;C is on systems that use DevSecOps pipelines and as new cybersecurity vulnerabilities are identified, the company has a fixed amount of time to respond. This is accomplished through secure cloud computing, and the ADSI cATO is also a historic first for a Cloud Based Command and Control (CBC2) gateway system. This enables operators to rapidly field ADSI and related system upgrades onto classified networks for immediate use. Enabling digital workflows in CJADC2 objectives Ultra I&amp;C’s ADSI is a software first, highly capable and flexible C2 system designed to meet the demands of modern warfare through enhanced interoperability, connectivity, and adaptability. It’s poised to be the backbone for data-centric operations and multi-domain operations, and is enabling digital workflows in CJADC2 objectives. Key capabilities of ADSI include: seamless data translation and transport across disparate systems and domains, including legacy and emerging platforms; advanced data brokering and AI-powered sense-making to amplify critical information for warfighters; and containerized and cloud-deployable architecture enabling scalability from tactical to enterprise levels. Finally, the continuous ATO and focus on cost-competitiveness through a software-centric approach sets ADSI apart in the world of command and control. 'To attack those CJADC2 objectives, you have to be open, scalable, and truly cost competitive in this environment,' said Fields. 'By focusing on a software-first solution, we’ve streamlined operations, reduced complexity, and improved quality through standardization. We’re positioned to better meet the need for the user across any cloud and any hardware environment with a highly competitive and modernized product.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/dod-authorizes-first-c2-gateway-to-modernize-and-update-on-its-own-for-cjadc2/	2024-12-16T05:29:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/The-ADSI-C2-gateway-from-Ultra-Intelligence-Communications-can-communicate-over-dozens-of-tactical-datalinks-from-Link-16-and-NATO-Link-1-to-distributed-systems-datalinks.jpg
Israel’s Ministry of Defense quintupled start-up funding in last year	It was full house at the Defense Tech Summit at Tel Aviv University on Dec. 11, 2024. (Seth J. Frantzman) TEL AVIV — The Israeli Ministry of Defense has significantly increased its investment in small companies and start-ups, pouring in approximately $168 million over an 11-month period — five times more than the year before. 'The deepening cooperation between DDR&amp;D [Directorate of Defense, Research &amp; Development] and Israeli startups increases local manufacturing independence and strengthens the Israeli economy,' the ministry said in a statement, adding that it has worked with 86 Israeli startups and small companies over the last year, in addition to another 200 firms with whom DDR&amp;D already worked. Such a focus on startups and small firms was evident here at the Defense Tech Summit, held at Tel Aviv University last week. Over two days the auditorium was often overflowing, where officials perused the latest innovations from the Israeli tech scene — including several that focused on topics of keen interest since the war with Hamas began last October, like counter-drone systems, medical tech and artificial intelligence. 'Israeli defense tech is at an unprecedented time of growth, due to a sharp rise in global demand and defense spending as well as battle-proven momentum. We see a need for technology in many areas related to global security, in order to drive digitalization, automation and efficiency,' Ilana Sherrington, Director of Global Partnerships for an organization called Startup Nation Central, told Breaking Defense. 'The number of new startups is on the rise, as well as more companies developing dual use applications — and investment is following this. With top talent and deep tech expertise, Israel is a natural hub for solutions in this area.' RELATED: Israel seeks to defang Syria, as 350-plus strikes destroy military sites and equipment The defense ministry’s focus on this subject was clear from the long list of officials who spoke, including presentations by Eyal Zamir, the Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense; Daniel Gold, the head of Israel’s DDR&amp;D; Avi Berger, the head of the space office at DDR&amp;D; and Moshe Patel, the head of Israel’s Missile Defense Organization. 'We are constantly examining how to intercept drones with other drones and take down enemy drones using nets. During the war, we worked with dozens of startups in the field. We created a methodology for integrating a startup in the field — something the world is still trying to figure out,' Gold said. On the second day of the summit, several smaller Israeli companies presented their technologies. The counter-drone firm Regulus, for example, discussed how recent conflicts around the world have illustrated the need for counter measures against various types of unmanned systems. RELATED: New tech, including drones carrying blood, help injured Israeli soldiers survive Spear, which makes cannister-launched loitering munitions, also discussed its vision for using multiple loitering munitions to observe and strike targets. The trend with unmanned systems and also the need to counter them has progressed to smaller munitions and also smaller systems that can be put on vehicles. Israel’s experience in places such as Gaza and Lebanon have illustrated the need not only for drones that can be easily deployed, but also the need to be able to defend against a wide variety of drones. Another trend in the presentations was an emphasis on medical technologies that can help in the field. For instance Xmetix showed off its 'smart tourniquet.' This was designed to be deployed easily enabling the tourniquet to be placed on an arm or leg by putting it on, then pulling a pin and pressing a button. The summit also included a discussion of a recent 'hackathon' where dozens of teams had competed to solve several challenges identified during the war. One of the issues was making a system that could help carry stretchers over complex terrain. Another system addressed the need to help constrict blood flow in a wound that is not on an extremity, meaning in the neck or some other critical area, so that wounded do not bleed out. Elsewhere, Sequoia Capital Global Partner Shaun Maguire said he sees sensors and AI as an area ripe for growth. 'Looking to the future, I expect we'll see enormous sensors for various uses, and Israel can lead this field. Israel is also powerful in the quantum field,' he said. 'I don't think Israel missed the AI train, and the race is still ongoing. On the contrary, Israel is among the leaders in the field, and Israeli companies are among the most successful companies in the sector.' Zamir, from the ministry, also highlighted AI’s increasing role. 'It is a revolution that brings new knowledge to every aspect of life, including defense capabilities. Whoever adapts first gets a massive advantage. If you are not all in technology, you will fall behind. This may sound visionary, but the future battlefield will allow swarms of mixed combat units – men and unmanned systems fighting together or fully autonomous units operating as one, capable of making their own decisions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israels-ministry-of-defense-pours-money-into-start-ups/	2024-12-16T04:05:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241213_israel_defense_tech_summit_FRANTZMAN-e1734100990768.png
Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon’s DOGE to wow	In this photo illustration, the Elon Musk's twitter account seen displayed on a mobile phone screen with a Dogecoin logo in the background. (Photo Illustration by Idrees Abbas/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — At last week’s Reagan National Defense Forum, the Department of Government Efficiency was a hot topic. For some, the initiative — not, it should be noted, actually a department, but rather a backronym to get to DOGE, the favored meme of Elon Musk — is a curiosity, a group with unclear power or influence. For others, it represents a potential threat, either to their business or to their power centers — or a chance to make changes to a system that is designed to resist them. But with threats to make major cuts to the Defense Department, one thing is clear: There is an expectation that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, the two co-leads of DOGE, are going to try and shake things up. To get a sense of how the defense community views the effort, Breaking Defense has gathered a collection of notable quotes from last weekend’s event. The following have been edited lightly for clarity and brevity. Both Musk and Ramaswamy have indicated support for the idea that government can be run more like a business. But what do business leaders think about that? Industry figures were largely positive about the potential that the office could serve as a forcing function to make changes at the Pentagon. Chris Calio, RTX CEO: Efficiency is a good thing, I think. We're all looking for opportunities and I think that's got to be our general posture. I would balance it with capability — the capabilities that that we're all bringing to bear, you know, as well, given the threat environment that we're in. Dan Jablonsky, Ursa Major CEO: I was a lawyer at the Securities Exchange Commission, and they did a reform initiative, and one of those was to take out a layer and a half, almost two layers, of, sort of, bureaucracy in the middle layer. And it turned out we actually ended up bringing more cases faster. So I'm welcoming any targeted efforts to help make the US government more efficient. I know it's gonna be hard. Alex Karp, Palantir CEO: We have the world's most successful builder ever [Musk] looking at our institutions. Americans want to know institutions are efficient, safe, and correspond to their purpose. And you know there will be- I’m sure there'll be some rough patches, but I don't know how you do better than Elon looking at these things and, you know, I'm pretty supportive. RELATED: Elon and Vivek, we need to talk Defense Executive 1, speaking to Breaking Defense on background: I think generally, business-minded people driving outcomes is what we need in a lot of these organizations. So we'll see what Elon and Vivek do with DOGE. Whatever it is, it'll be fun to watch. Elon's generally pretty smart. He generally knows what he's talking about. Defense Executive 2, speaking to Breaking Defense on background: Nobody argues with the waste and the inefficiency of the Pentagon, right? You know, it's a long running joke. It's an organization that's got an $850 billion budget that has no money, right? You’re even seeing Democrats come out — Bernie Sanders was one who's like, I support DOGE for the DoD, right? There's just so much juice to squeeze for inefficiencies to open up, not just for [my company], but companies like this, that I am very excited about that. Because there’s just stupid shit that they do with no accountability to it. And specifically on like, the R&amp;D side of the services, it's really probably the worst. I think everybody wins. Including the service, because the service will be more streamlined and have faster outcomes. A number of lawmakers were asked about DOGE, either in interviews or during panels. What is interesting is that across party lines, the reaction was roughly the same: tentative hope that the office could help find real efficiencies or drive reforms, but also a clear concern that the two outsiders are going to be making decisions that fall more rightly into the hands of Congress, be they fiscal or policy. Sen Deb Fischer, R-Neb., Senate appropriator and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in an interview with Breaking Defense: It is always a good thing when an administration works with Congress. So I’m excited to be able to work with DOGE on the issues before us. But we have to be able to have, I think, a full understanding of what’s involved. So when I said ‘That’s our job to do that,’ it's because of all of, obviously, the classified briefings we participate in to be able to have the information, to understand the threats, to really understand what the needs are for this country to provide for our defense. So, once again, I look forward to working with the administration on that. I think there are ways we can find efficiencies. But I also will push really hard to make sure that we continue with programs we know work, that we know are necessary, that we know are necessary to defend this country. Sen. Angus King, I-Vt., member of the Senate Armed Services Committee: I think a program looking for efficiency is good. I think we should be doing that periodically, on a regular basis. My only concern is when you use the term 'efficiency' to talk about programmatic programs that may have a policy. In other words, efficiency is one thing, policy is something else. For example, what if they say, well, the Sentinel program is too expensive? There's a lot of thought and policy that goes into maintaining the three legs of the nuclear triad, and I'm not sure the cost should be necessarily the driving factor. Do you see what I mean? I don't mind Mr. Musk or others who are looking at efficiency and saying, Why do you have all those layers those kinds of things? That's fine, but I think there's a danger that they're implicitly, or maybe explicitly, going to be making policy decisions, [saying] 'we don't need to be doing this anymore.' I think that's a decision for Congress to make. Rep Adam Smith, D-Wash., ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee, on a panel: The problem with DOGE is it's two separate conversations that are being blurred into one. And the difference between those two conversations is profound. Conversation one is how can you make the government do whatever it does better and more efficiently. And gosh, that's important, and there's going to be a ton of bipartisan support for that. And I think that — I don't know anything about Ramaswamy per se — but Elon Musk, I know what he did at SpaceX. I think he's a well positioned person to have that conversation. How can you do think more efficiently and more effectively? The mistake is everyone's assuming that that is going to do anything to help us with our fiscal crisis. And that's the truly insane part of this conversation. You have to sort of forget basic budget math in order to believe that is true. … Maybe Elon Musk [has a magic wand], maybe he's going to save $2 trillion without hurting absolutely anything. No, he's not, sorry. I can stop that speculation. It's just not going to happen. I hope they make gov more efficient, the fiscal conversation is a hell of a lot more difficult. Smith, in a follow-up interview with Breaking Defense: The need for reform, and the fact that Elon Musk built SpaceX, and that was a company that really made a big difference in getting us to greater competition … He knows how to do it. But does the taking-vengeance-on-your-enemies and ego get in front of that? I don't know. I'm not optimistic. They seem to have pretty big egos about 'I spoke, therefore I'm right, and if you disagree with me, you will be purged.' I don't think that's an effective way to run something, certainly [it’s] not the way Elon ran SpaceX. So I hope that it's not the way that Trump and JD Vance and Elon and the others you know, choose to run the government at this point. But there's some bad early signs, and will they do it just to reward their friends and punish their enemies, as opposed to meeting the interests of the American people? American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Those least likely to dive into the DOGE debate? Unsurprisingly, it was Pentagon officials, who are preparing to navigate the next administration. Here, there seems to be tentative hope that change could be a good thing. Gen. Randy George, Army Chief of Staff: I'm all in favor of it. We've been on, we don't have a nickname for it or anything, but we've talking about process innovation in the Army for the last year. If it doesn't make us more lethal or our teams more cohesive, we have to be looking at, you know, should we be doing it? So I think we have to review everything that we're doing in that light. And again, I think that the tough thing is going to be, we also need to be flexible with our government workforce, and that has been, you know, that's going to be a challenge. We're going to have to make some adjustments on acquisition and how big those teams are, and as we give things to industry. And some of these changes are going to be hard, but I think we have to make them. Doug Beck, DIU head: You’ve been hearing from the guys who work at defense firms up here for the opportunity for rapid reform. And there are a few of those things that have to do with the intersection with Congress, between the administration and congress, where I think we could get to a lot more symbiotic relationship, for example with these portfolios of record, I’d love to go after something like that. And there are a whole set of places where there are silly, stupid, bureaucratic don’t-have-to-be there things that slow down a lot of what we’re talking about getting after that I think are ripe for someone going through and trying to clean that out.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/such-efficiency-very-defense-congress-industry-waiting-for-elons-doge-to-wow/	2024-12-13T12:01:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/doge-scaled-e1734035750743.jpg
Decentralizing battle data: CDAO, Anduril open tactical ‘mesh’ to third-party developers	Artificial intelligence AI research of robot and cyborg development for future of people living. Digital data mining and machine learning technology design for computer brain communication. (Getty images) WASHINGTON — As the US military embraces artificial intelligence and big data, the Pentagon is trying to wean itself from reliance on centralized mega-systems and instead empower frontline leaders at the 'tactical edge.' That’s why, last week, the Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Office (CDAO) awarded startup defense firm Anduril a $100 million, three-year contract to expand its Lattice Mesh. Lattice is a system that lets frontline forces rapidly access data from over a hundred different types of sensors — for example, to track incoming hostile drones — over existing tactical networks, without having to first relay that data through central processing hubs. Then, this week, Anduril released a Lattice Software Development Kit (SDK) that will allow other companies to build their own applications to run on Lattice Mesh, without having to get permission from Anduril. The company announced an initial list of 10 partners, ranging from startups like Apex (space systems) and Saronic (unmanned boats) to giants like Oracle and Textron. But in the future, an Anduril executive told Breaking Defense, any company can access the kit and write software for Lattice. 'We want to remove Anduril as any form of bottleneck … and allow anyone to be publishing [apps and data] to the Lattice Mesh,' said senior VP Thomas Keane. 'What the SDK allows is now for third parties to do it without relying on Anduril.' RELATED: Anduril could receive up to $100M for Space Surveillance Network upgrade It's a decentralized business model for a decentralized military system. It’s also a departure from traditional practice for both the defense industry and the Defense Department, which historically favor centralized mega-projects where a single lead contractor can achieve 'vendor lock' and keep competitors out for decades. But the recent Lattice Mesh announcements suggest the rise of a more open, flexible and adaptable approach. 'If we know anything about the future, it’s that we don't know that much about the future,' said CDAO Principal Deputy Margaret Palmieri. 'Technology is changing really fast, the mission space is changing really fast, and the combinations of capabilities that we need to bring together … require the Department to be much more agile than in the past.' In such an unpredictable world, Palmieri said, military programs must be able to bring on new capabilities quickly from whoever can provide the best tech in the least time. (CDAO’s acquisition model for this approach is formally called Open DAGIR). Releasing the SDK makes that adaptability possible for Lattice. 'We can use the data mesh back end that Anduril has, but we don't only have to rely on Anduril apps,' she told Breaking Defense. 'We can now invite other third-party app developers in from anywhere in the ecosystem that is our incredible advantage as a as a nation.' What’s in it for Anduril? While Keane didn’t say so outright, the firm is clearly betting that an open door on Lattice Mesh is good for business, much as Apple benefits from letting third parties develop applications for their iPhones: More third-party options make the underlying product more useful, so it sells better. Specifically, what makes Lattice useful to the military is that it lets frontline units access (or 'subscribe to') data feeds from a host of different sensors, Keane and Palmieri explained. Those sensors are operated by many different organizations, communicate over different networks, and use different, incompatible formats; so, historically, the intelligence they gather has to be sent back to a central hub for processing before it can be widely shared. But that process takes precious time that forces in combat may not have. It relies on long-range transmissions, communications satellites and other relays that a sophisticated adversary could jam or destroy. By contrast, Lattice Mesh gives a frontline unit its own digital 'translator' to talk to different sensors directly. It’s a bit like the golden droid C-3PO in Star Wars, 'fluent in over six million forms of communication.' That allows data sharing 'on the edge,' with many units talking to many sensors, without the delays and vulnerabilities of a centralized hub-and-spoke system. Today, after several years of closed-door experimentation with CDAO and limited deployments at operational Combatant Commands, Lattice Mesh now has translator algorithms for more than a hundred different types of sensors, Keane said, 'and we are adding new ‘languages’ every week.' But by releasing the Lattice SDK to third parties, he went on, Anduril lets other companies — drone makers, satellite operators, sensor manufacturers and more — build their own translators for their own products. The more companies do that, the more types of sensors the military can use Lattice for. This open-door, decentralized approach is not unique to Lattice Mesh. Indeed, Lattice is just one of several pieces of the military’s evolving capability to share intelligence and transmit orders across US and allied forces on land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace — known as Combined Joint All-Domain Command &amp; Control (CJADC2). Over time, the military has backed off from one-size-fits-all approaches to CJADC2. Instead of imposing a single universal data standard and a single mega-network, it’s moving towards a 'federated' approach that allows different systems for different niches but tries to make them all compatible. That wasn’t obvious from the start, Palmieri emphasized. 'When we started off in January of 2023, we thought … we could find one capability that would do all those things,' she told Breaking Defense. But through a series of quarterly Global Information Dominance Experiments, 'what we realized was that there wasn't a single data integration layer that you could select as best of breed across all those organizations and missions &#8230; What you needed at the strategic and operational level for data integration was different than what we needed at a tactical level.' When CDAO released the initial operational toolkit for CJADC2 — officially called the 'Minimum Viable Capability' and publicly announced in February — it focused on strategic coordination at the four-star Combatant Commands. But data-sharing tools for headquarters staff aren’t suitable for combat units, Palmieri said. Headquarters need huge amounts of information to produce detailed plans in hours or days; frontline commanders need much smaller volumes of data, but they need it right now. That second niche is where Lattice Mesh came in. 'The data mesh capability is not the answer for everything,' Palmieri said. 'What we found with the data mesh that Anduril provided was it was really good at that low-latency data exchange.' 'What CDAO asked us for is the ability to use this data in near real-time decisions at the edge,' Keane said. 'We measure time in seconds, not in hours or days.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/decentralizing-battle-data-cdao-anduril-open-tactical-mesh-to-third-party-developers/	2024-12-13T10:45:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_AI_robot_hand_laptop_GettyImages-1202870693-scaled-e1666716055157.jpg
Elon and Vivek, we need to talk about how to make DOGE successful	American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Dear Elon and Vivek, I know that many people want your ear right now. Your new commission, DOGE (very clever logo, BTW), has essentially carte blanche to propose reforms. Your teasers about major changes in the making are receiving a lot of attention. Here’s the challenge: History is littered with the wreckage of such commissions. Failure and irrelevance are the norm. If you want to avoid having your opportunity to reform the federal government become a punchline in the late-night talk shows, you need to be disciplined and systematic. So, here’s some advice from a long-time federal bureaucrat that might help you succeed. Schedule a briefing from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget … NOW. They would be delighted to share their expertise, because we are in a fiscal crisis. The deficit in fiscal 2024 was $1.6 trillion and is projected to rise steadily. Unfortunately, the recent political campaigns focused on how to spend more, not on fiscal sustainability. As a nation, we have decided to spend now and send the bill to our children and grandchildren. So, part of your job will be to create a sense of immediacy and convince Americans that it's worth making sacrifices today to safeguard their children’s fiscal future. You are throwing around huge numbers ($2 trillion in savings), which creates a lot of buzz but is red meat for fact-checkers. The brutal fact is that saving a lot of money in the federal budget requires going after entitlements. These, along with interest payments, comprise about 70 percent of the federal budget. If you want big savings, you need to follow the money, but entitlements are REALLY hard to change. Which means you need to remember that … It's all about trade-offs. In government, there are rarely pure wins. Someone or some group loses while another gains. Reforms are possible, but the constituencies will fight hard for their benefits. As we say in Washington, one person’s waste is another person’s vital national program. So be ready for bitter opposition. Fortunately, there are examples of successful reform efforts. For example, Congress agreed to five rounds of DoD base closures and realignments that reshaped the Pentagon’s base structure for the post-Cold War era and now save about $12 billion annually. This hurt the local communities in the short run. Most eventually recovered, but some never did. Not everyone benefits. In 1996, Congress passed welfare reform, which succeeded in reducing welfare rolls by encouraging work, supporting those transitioning to the workforce, and discouraging dependency. Your team should study these bipartisan successes. Don't expect much savings from cutting 'woke' programs. The president-elect and the Republicans in general campaigned against those programs. However, there's not much money there. Costs in DoD (which has about half the federal workforce) run about $100 million per year, with similar numbers in other agencies. That may sound like a lot, but it is a rounding error in a $6 trillion budget. Such cuts may be emotionally satisfying for conservatives, but they are not significant as a budget issue. 'Woke' is a policy issue. Focus on a few big things. You won't have time to dig into every corner of the federal operation. So, after your initial research, focus on a few big things that you want to change and go after them with specifics and in depth. Three to five is a good number for audiences to grasp without getting lost. Too many more than that and the effort loses focus. If you list 'the top 30 actions the government should take,' people’s eyes will glaze over by the time you get to seven or eight. Build a consensus and develop allies. I recognize that down at Mar-A-Lago, the talk is all about mandates and landslides. President-elect Trump's victory was impressive and much greater than had been expected; He won all the battleground states, and Republicans will have control of Congress. But the popular vote was only 51 percent to 49 percent. The Republicans did extraordinarily well in Congress but hold very thin margins in both houses, three in the Senate and about three in the House (depending on appointments). To put that in perspective, Obama had an eight-seat margin in the Senate and a 69-seat margin in the House when he rammed through his health and stimulus packages. You will not be able to make reforms with brute political force.

(Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue) Get tight with Congress. You need allies in Congress because Congress will need to authorize many of your proposals and can stymie most of the rest if it chooses. Make them an ally because you don't want them as an enemy. A strong congressional relations group in your organization will be critical, but members will want to talk to you directly. They like being consulted, so take time to build some relationships. You have already started that process — excellent. Getting tight with them is not just about establishing a close relationship. Hoisting a few drinks in a relaxed environment (juice for Vivek) will help discussions about difficult issues. Reach out to the broader community. Everyone in Washington LOVES to be consulted. It feeds our sense of self-importance. There’s also a lot of experience out there that you could harness. So have a series of lunches and dinners with former officials, academics, journalists, and think tank scholars. You will get a lot of good ideas and maybe avoid some pitfalls that hurt previous efforts. At the least, you will have a chance to lay out your vision and maybe co-opt some potential criticism. Remember — these people will be writing the op-eds on your efforts and shaping public opinion. Stay close to the president and the White House. Right now, you have his enthusiastic support, and that is critical for success. However, the tides of politics can shift. If you appear to be proposing ideas that the president opposes or that are causing too much political blowback, that support will fade. You have already had a peak at what presidential anger looks like. Reduce the federal workforce by eliminating the work. Making arbitrary across-the-board cuts is tempting because specifics get complex and controversial. However, arbitrary cuts will just shift the work to contractors. Government won't get smaller or cheaper, just less visible. If you want to shift work to the private sector, reestablish the A-76 process, which sets up a formal mechanism for moving work from government to private industry. It was widely and successfully used in the Clinton and Bush administrations until shut down by the Obama administration. Reducing regulations and eliminating functions will also eliminate work and, hence, workers, but you must be specific. There’s no budget line for 'waste.' Trying to make reductions through the 'Schedule F' proposed in the first Trump administration won't produce a smaller or better workforce. Instead, the workforce will be more cautious and less innovative as they hesitate to take action lest they displease the political establishment — the opposite of what you are trying to accomplish. Vivek Ramaswamy, chairman and co-founder of Strive Asset Management, arrives to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC, US, on Thursday, Dec. 5, 2024. Elon Musk claims he can cut $2 trillion from the $6.75 trillion annual federal budget, but in order to do that, he'd need to cut mandatory programs like Social Security or Medicare, something Trump has said he won't do. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images Disrupt the federal workforce? The federal government has formal rules for reducing the number of employees. Usually, that's done by attrition — not replacing workers when they leave, so headcount drops gradually. If the reduction happens too quickly for attrition, then it's done mainly by seniority. That’s what will happen if you succeed in making deep cuts. If you really want to shake up the civil service, have a one-time 5 percent reduction based on merit alone. Maybe make everyone reapply for their job. It would be traumatic since it breaks long-established expectations, but there's 5 percent of the federal workforce who should be doing something else. Beware the lethal embrace. Without specifics, the bureaucracy will respond by reshaping and then embracing any sufficiently vague reform. Many years ago, as a junior staff member, I was sent as an organizational representative to a meeting on how DoD would respond to an efficiency commission. A crusty old bureaucrat led the meeting. He said, 'The department's position is that these are all great ideas, and, in fact, we are already doing them or planning to do them. Now go back to your organizations and write up those responses for your section of the report.' Hire some people who know government thoroughly. You have started online hiring, and that's good. It will jump-start the commission. Your inclination will be to hire enthusiastic outsiders who want to apply their ideas from the civilian economy to government. That's fine for generating ideas. However, you need a cadre of inside experts who know how to implement those ideas. That’s how you escape the lethal embrace. An enthusiastic but inexperienced staff might produce a passable report using AI tools, but it will be totally useless. Don't create a permanent organization for reform. You won't be able to cover everything in the federal government the way you might like. That's an inevitable trade-off. Maybe recommend having a similar commission periodically to 'mow the lawn.' Maybe provide guidance for future commissions. However, the idea of creating a permanent bureaucracy in order to reduce bureaucracy is absurd. Disband DOGE when its work is done. Get moving. You may think you have four years to get initiatives done, but you may only have two years to get approval for proposals that need congressional authorization. There will be congressional elections in 2026, and historically, the president’s party has lost ground—on average, 26 seats in the House and four in the Senate. If that holds in 2026, the Democrats will take control of Congress. Hedging against that possibility is not pessimism or disloyalty, but realism. So get moving.

Rolls-Royce says future B-52 engine, the F130, passed critical design review	A KC-135 Stratotanker from the 465th Air Refueling Squadron assigned to Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, refuels a B-52 Stratofortress from the 96th Bomb Squadron assigned to Barksdale Air Force Base, Louisiana, during a cross country mission Sept 13, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by 2nd Lt. Mary Begy) WASHINGTON — The Rolls-Royce F130 engine is one step closer to powering the US Air Force’s B-52 Stratofortress fleet following a successful critical design review (CDR), the company told Breaking Defense. Held in October but not publicly revealed until now, the F130 CDR marks a key milestone in the engineering process that validates the maturity of a design. The company will still have to address some extra steps to fully close out the CDR — those should be taken within the next few months, a spokesperson said — but it can now turn its attention to additional testing and prepare for production efforts. Eventually, Rolls-Royce is expected to install the F130 across the Stratofortress fleet and replace the current Pratt &amp; Whitney TF33, in line with the $2.6 billion contract Rolls-Royce won in 2021 and as the central piece in the wider B-52 Commercial Engine Replacement Program (CERP). The CDR had been expected as far back as January, but the spokesperson said the October review was still within the Air Force's schedule. 'A combination of integration improvements and the desire to fully analyze results' from twin pod tests Rolls-Royce ran at NASA’s Stennis Space Center 'drove the timing,' the spokesperson said. B-52-maker Boeing leads the overall CERP effort as the prime integrator, which involves other changes to the decades-old bomber like upgraded avionics. The CERP aims to offer greater fuel efficiency and maintainability improvements, recasting the B-52H as the B-52J after the overall project is completed. It’s a big revamp for the Air Force’s fleet of 76 Eisenhower-era bombers, which each carry four twin pods for a total of eight engines each and will be expected to fly with the new F130s until the end of their service lives well into the 2050s, if not longer. A parallel effort, the B-52 Radar Modernization Program, will integrate a new RTX-made radar. Boeing will lead a separate CDR for the overall CERP effort, which the Government Accountability Office found earlier this year is planned for August 2025 [PDF], roughly two years behind schedule. The same report found that the program’s initial operational capability (IOC) may be delayed by as long as roughly three years, out to 2033. Air Force officials earlier this year told reporters they were working through ways to hold down costs and claw back lost time for the two B-52 upgrade programs, including by bringing on Shay Assad, the Pentagon’s former longtime director of defense pricing notorious for tough negotiations with industry. 'We are working very closely with our partners at Boeing and the Air Force to support the program, address any issues, and assist in any way we can,' the Rolls-Royce spokesperson said. Boeing referred comment for this report to the Air Force. A spokesperson for the service confirmed that the CERP's system-level CDR is planned for 'late summer 2025,' and that IOC is planned for fiscal year 2033. A formal cost baseline for CERP will be established at the program's Milestone B decision, set for 'summer 2025,' the spokesperson added. Rolls-Royce officials are now underway with new engine trials at the company’s Indianapolis, Ind., facilities after wrapping up crosswind testing, as a production decision inches closer. 'The F130 First Engine to Test (FETT) started sea-level testing in Indianapolis this fall, which included running the engine’s initial software release,' the spokesperson said. 'The FETT sets the performance baseline for the F130, supported by the over 30 million engine flying hours' from the company’s commercial family of engines the F130 is based on. Looking ahead, the engine will also undergo altitude testing at the Air Force’s Arnold Engineering Development Complex in Tullahoma, Tenn. The company will also conduct 'durability testing' in Indianapolis ahead of initial flight release, the spokesperson said. The CERP contract awarded to Rolls-Royce calls for 608 engines, as well as spares. By the early 2030s, the company 'expect[s] to increase production of our combat portfolio to over 100 engines per year,' according to the spokesperson. 'To date, our testing program confirmed our predictions and is allowing us to stay on track to deliver this fixed price contract for the Air Force,' the spokesperson said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rolls-royce-says-future-b-52-engine-the-f130-passed-critical-design-review/	2024-12-13T08:00:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/6834841-e1661267382116.jpg
Pentagon marks 2 long-range tests with Army’s PrSM and Army-Navy hypersonic missile	The PrSM is the next-generation, long-range precision-strike missile delivering critical capabilities to attack, neutralize, suppress, and destroy targets, supporting successful mission execution via combined Joint All-Domain Operations. (U.S. Army/Darrell Ames) WASHINGTON — The US Army has taken two new steps forward in its quest for long-range strike capabilities that will be able to hold threats in the Pacific at range. On Thursday evening, the Army put out two announcements: The service tested a conventional hypersonic missile, built in partnership with the Navy, and that it also successfully launched a pair of Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) Increment 1 weapons from a HIMARS launcher. Both systems fit into the Army's focus on increasing long-range fires, which is seen as vital for any conflict with China, given the much-ballyhooed 'tyranny of distance' any Pacific conflict would entail. The hypersonic test occurred at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Fla. Per an announcement from the Pentagon, this 'is the second successful end-to-end flight test of the All Up Round (AUR) this year and was the first live-fire event for the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon system using a Battery Operations Center and a Transporter Erector Launcher.' The Army and Navy are collaborating on the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon, which is designed to be launched from land or sea. Militaries around the world are in a race to develop hypersonic weapons, which, at least on paper, combine high speeds with maneuverability that should allow weapons to avoid air defenses. Meanwhile, the PrSM launch, which took place on Wednesday at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico, was deemed a success, with the Army saying the munition engaged 'four simulated rotary wing targets within a helicopter staging area.' PrSM Increment 1, produced by Lockheed Martin, is slated to replace the Army’s legacy ATACMS tactical ballistic missile, increasing range out to 500 kilometers. As part of the service's efforts to increase its weapon portfolio range, it plans to use that first PrSM increment to strike targets closer in, and the hypersonic weapon for ones further out. Then the new Typhon Mid-Range Capability, deployed to the Philippines this year, will be used for targets at distances in the middle of the two. But the Army is also hoping to develop multiple versions of PrSM going forward. Increment 2 is under development with a multimode seeker, known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and a PrSM Increment 3 seeks to add in enhanced lethality payloads. The Army has also tapped a Lockheed Martin team and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team to work on competing PrSM Increment 4 designs that can fly more than 1,000 kilometers, possibly double the range of the current version. A few weeks ago the service said it was looking at an Increment 5 for an autonomous launcher to hit targets beyond 1,000 kilometers.

GCAP partners form joint venture to deliver next-gen fighter for UK, Japan and Italy	The British, Italian and Japanese led Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) future fighter jet is slated to enter service in 2035 (BAE Systems) The UK's BAE Systems said in a company statement today that it had struck the agreement with Italy's Leonardo and Japan Aircraft Industrial Enhancement (JAIEC), which will act as the 'design authority for GCAP for the life of the product.' The manufacturer noted that the era of the future aircraft is 'expected' to last 'beyond 2070.' The JV, which does not publicly have a formal name, will serve as the prime contractor for the program, while subcontracting out manufacturing and final assembly of the next generation plane to the British firm, Leonardo, and Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, alongside other suppliers. GCAP aims to replace UK Royal Air Force and Italian Air Force Eurofighter Typhoons, as well as Japan Air Self-Defense Force F-2 combat jets. It is slated for entry to service in 2035. All three partners will retain an equal 33.3 percent shareholding in the JV and it will be headquartered in the UK, in order to 'ensure maximum alignment and collaboration with the GCAP International Government Organisation (GIGO),' which is also due to be based in the region. Joint teams from the JV will also work in each of the three GCAP partner nations. 'The [JV] agreement builds on the strong trilateral government, defence, and industrial cooperation between the UK, Japan, and Italy on GCAP since it was established in December 2022,' added BAE. Charles Woodburn, BAE Systems CEO said of the JV agreement, 'The new business will bring together the significant strengths and expertise of the companies involved to create an innovative organisation that will lead the way in developing a next generation combat air system, creating long-term, high value and skilled jobs across the partner nations for decades to come.' Roberto Cingolani, Leonardo CEO, echoed such sentiment, stating, 'Today, we are paving the way for the development of a new era in Aircraft Systems and Multi-domain scenarios, fostering long-term sustainable growth for the economies of the involved countries.' Kimito Nakae, JAIEC President, added, 'As we now embark upon the exciting and important journey towards the success of GCAP, I acknowledge that the way might not always be simple and straightforward. However, I believe that through continuing the strong spirit of trilateral cooperation and collaboration that we have fostered up to this point, we will not only deliver the GCAP on time but also at a level that exceeds all of our expectations.' The JV progress comes five months after the GCAP partners unveiled a new concept of the future crewed fighter jet, based around a conventional delta wing shape and featuring increased wingspan compared to previous iterations. The development phase of the aircraft, which is expected to operate alongside autonomous collaborative platforms or adjunct aircraft, similar to US Air Force Collaborative Combat Aircraft, is also slated to begin next year. Earlier this week, Breaking Defense reported that the UK's Excalibur flight test aircraft (a modified Boeing 757) had successfully completed its first phase of modification and flight testing, including integration of side and belly pods to accommodate Integrated Sensors, Non-Kinetic Effects (ISANKE) and Integrated Communications Systems (ICS) as part of Tempest — Britain's name for the GCAP jet. With a heavy focus on assessing Electronic Warfare capabilities, Excalibur essentially serves as a testbed for new technology that could eventually be fitted on the future fighter. Though GCAP partners have been briefed about its progress, they are not, strictly speaking, part of the effort. Even so, the 'expectation is that if they choose to work with us in the next phase, as the Team Tempest activity concludes, it would logically transition to GCAP,' said Andrew Howard, Leonardo UK’s director for GCAP.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/gcap-partners-form-joint-venture-to-deliver-next-gen-fighter-for-uk-japan-and-italy/	2024-12-13T05:49:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/RS179755_PMCS2620-FCAS-JPN-5A1x1-e1734095138256.png
MILSATCOM for the most critical no-fail missions	Leveraging proven technology was key to the recently launched Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission, a historic Northrop Grumman-primed international space mission that included both commercial and U.S. military payloads on the same satellite for the first time. (Northrop Grumman illustration). Satellite communication is so reliable and commonplace it’s easy for everyday users to take it for granted, whether watching live sports or checking email mid-flight. Since the 1980s, militaries have also migrated to space-based communications systems. Ensuring the U.S. military and its allies have continuous communication capability, however, is more complicated than providing cable television and internet service to consumers. Military satellite communications (MILSATCOM) systems need to fight through adversary jamming, operate despite ground station disruptions, withstand challenging environmental conditions, and mitigate an ever-growing set of attack approaches. David Doami is senior director of MILSATCOM and Sustainment at Northrop Grumman. In short, protected MILSATCOM systems need to be no-fail — and no company has more experience in delivering on these stringent requirements than Northrop Grumman, said David Doami, senior director of MILSATCOM and Sustainment at Northrop Grumman. 'MILSATCOM systems are used to communicate the highest priority messages that we have in our country including the president, as commander in chief, commanding the combatant commanders and our strategic forces,' said Doami, pointing to Northrop Grumman’s decades of designing and delivering strategic SATCOM for the U.S. military. 'During the Cold War, we had a single nuclear threat, and space supported the air, ground and sea domains. Today, we have multiple nuclear-capable threats and space itself is a contested domain. In this environment, survivable and assured MILSATCOM are more critical than ever before as a vital communications link for the warfighter.' Decades in the Making Protected MILSATCOM has evolved from the earliest Milstar satellites, through the Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites of the last decade, and now to new MILSATCOM systems in development, such as Northrop Grumman’s Evolved Strategic SATCOM and Protected Tactical SATCOM rapid prototypes, noted Terry Smigla, chief MILSATCOM engineer at Northrop Grumman. Terry Smigla is chief MILSATCOM engineer at Northrop Grumman. 'Northrop Grumman and our heritage companies laid the foundation for many of today’s critical MILSATCOM capabilities, including mission payloads for Milstar and AEHF, as well as the Enhanced Polar System and Enhanced Polar System-Recapitalization (EPS-R),' said Smigla. 'We know what it takes to keep protected MILSATCOM systems relevant, and we have taken advantage of technology advances to continuously improve capabilities. That’s what we’re doing with the current generation of protected MILSATCOM, as well, only we’re taking that capability to the next level. It’s a generational leap.' With each generation of MILSATCOM, capabilities have catapulted forward to address expanding coverage and capacity needs, as well as an evolving threat environment. For example, in the 1990s, Northrop Grumman introduced the world’s first onboard digital processing on the Milstar II system. These processors can be reconfigured and updated from the ground, enabling constant improvement even once the satellite is in orbit. The company has delivered this capability on every MILSATCOM payload since. The software that runs MILSATCOM systems such as the Milstar and AEHF payloads is just as, if not more, important than the hardware that goes on orbit. As demands have expanded, Northrop Grumman has continued to evolve the technology from the ground via software updates. Today’s protected MILSATCOM systems are more software-defined than ever, meaning they become more capable with each upgrade, Smigla said. 'The proliferation of warfighting platforms with advanced sensors and weapons systems and the need to disseminate information across the digital battlefield drives an ever-increasing demand for data bandwidth,' said Smigla. Protected MILSATCOM has evolved from the earliest Milstar satellites to new systems in development such as Northrop Grumman’s Evolved Strategic SATCOM and Protected Tactical SATCOM rapid prototypes. (Northrop Grumman illustration) Assured, Affordable Comms No-fail missions, like missile defense and protected MILSATCOM, require diverse architectures with powerful satellites, said Blake Bullock, vice president of Military Space Systems at Northrop Grumman. But those satellites must exist in sufficient numbers and incorporate resiliency features to ensure the architecture can take a punch and keep operating. That means keeping those systems affordable is a high priority. 'In many instances, we can upgrade or repurpose existing technology for the next generation of systems at minimal additional cost, saving our investment dollars for technologies — like cutting-edge, software-defined processing — that keep the U.S. and our allies ahead of the threat,' said Bullock. 'That’s the benefit of having performed this mission for so long; we understand what legacy technology continues to be relevant and where we need to invest for the future.' Leveraging existing technology was key to the recently launched Arctic Satellite Broadband Mission, a historic Northrop Grumman-primed international space mission that included both commercial and U.S. military payloads on the same satellite for the first time. This collaboration between the U.S. Space Force, Space Norway and Northrop Grumman resulted in the EPS-R program. The partnership delivered expanded protected MILSATCOM capability to the Arctic that, according to a public Space Force estimate, saved taxpayers around $900 million. As the company continues to advance MILSATCOM and find innovative ways of incorporating existing technologies — such as commercial spacecraft bus platforms and standards-based networking capabilities — Northrop Grumman’s decades of on-orbit experience are the key to rapidly and affordably providing our warfighters this vital mission capability, said Doami. 'It comes down to mission mastery. There is no substitute for the experience we’ve garnered performing the mission on orbit for more than 30 years.'

Saudi Arabia inks deal for 3 Avante 2200 Corvettes from Spain’s Navantia	The fourth Saudi Avante-class corvette goes into the water during production in late 2021. (Navantia) BEIRUT — The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has contracted three more Avante 2200 corvettes from Spanish firm Navantia to serve with the royal navy, according to the Kingdom's Ministry of Defense. The three new corvettes will join the existing fleet of five Avante 2200 corvettes already in service as part of the Sarawat project signed between KSA and Navantia in 2018. Navantia said in a statement Wednesday that work on the first new corvette will start later this year, and the delivery is scheduled to conclude in 2028. 'This second batch series of corvettes for Saudi Arabia will be similar to the first batch, with a design based on Navantia’s Avante 2200 model, which is a multipurpose vessel specially designed for patrolling and monitoring of the Exclusive Economic Zone, maritime traffic surveillance and control missions, search and rescue missions and assistance to other vessels, among others,' Navantia said. 'In addition, the vessels will have an important capacity for the defense of strategic assets, intelligence, and anti-submarine, anti-aircraft, anti-surface and electronic warfare capabilities.' Navantia said SAMINavantia, a joint venture between the Spanish firm and the Kingdom's Saudi Arabian Military Industries (SAMI), will install the Hazem Combat System for the ships. Hazem is the first-ever combat management system developed and produced inside KSA by SAMI. The installation, integration and trials of the second and third corvettes in KSA comes in line with Saudi Vision 2030, that target localizing 50 percent of defense production in the Kingdom.

SPACECOM and Space Force working to define ‘triggers’ for commercial reserve call up	US SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting addresses Space Symposium 2024. (Space Foundation via Flickr) SPACEPOWER 2024 — US Space Command is helping the Space Force figure out the circumstances under which firms participating in the service's fledgling commercial space reserve program would be called to serve, according to SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting. 'We're excited about the Space Force's work on the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve, or CASR. I think that's going to come online starting next year and into '26, and we're working with the Space Force to define the triggers for when we would want to activate the CASR to bring us additional capacity,' he told the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday. Speaking to reporters later in the day, Whiting explained that the idea is to follow the model of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF), managed by US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM), for leveraging commercial airlines to support military logistics operations when needed. 'There's various trigger points based on threat scenarios that might be happening, or world events where TRANSCOM can activate various stages of the CRAF to get aircraft to help with the US Air Force mobility, aircraft to move more equipment [and] people,' he said. 'So, as the Space Force contracts out CASR and we get the ability, let's say, to get more satellite communications in a crisis, or get more space domain awareness, or some other space-related capability like ISR [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance], at various points, when there's a global crisis or something's going on, I expect that these contracts that the Space Force will write to enable CASR will allow us to go the Space Force [and say], &#8216;Something's going on in the world. We need that additional capacity, and we want to implement a the starting phase of CASR,'' Whiting said. That would allow for additional capacity 'that we then can leverage for operations. And then, depending on that's how that situation evolves, there might be additional phases of CASR where we would continue to get more and more capacity,' he added. Col. Richard Kniseley, director of the Space Force's Commercial Space Office, said in October that the service expects to award its first CASR contracts by early next year — although he stressed that those first agreements would be baseline models that don't address thorny issues such as compensation for participants whose satellites become casualties of war. Whiting noted in his presentation that SPACECOM just last month updated its own 'commercial integration strategy.' The first version was published in 2022 and said 'it was very aspirational' in that it was a broad look at what the national security space community 'at large' needed to do to engage commercial vendors. By contrast, he said, the new version is focused on 'the real, core US Space Command tasks.' Whiting explained that there are three key action items in the new strategy. First is for SPACECOM to 'identify and advocate' for commercial capability. This means working to understand what industry is 'bringing to the table' and then going to the military services to advocate 'what capabilities should be brought online.' 'Secondly, we want to incorporate and operationalize' commercial capabilities, Whiting said. 'So, as the Space Force develops CASR, and that becomes real, we've got to figure out what the triggers are and the mechanisms where we can now take that added capacity that CASR could bring to us in various mission areas, and how do we operationalize that into our plan so that the joint force can take advantage of that.' Finally, Whiting explained that the 'third line of effort' in the strategy is to 'inform and protect' commercial partners — which is the raison d'etre of the Commercial Integration Cell at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., where space operators and industry operators share threat information with each other.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/preparing-for-crisis-spacecom-and-space-force-working-to-define-triggers-for-commercial-reserve-call-up/	2024-12-12T13:35:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240410_whiting_keynote_space_symposium_space_foundation-e1712757057987.jpg
DOE, Navy project for upgrading nuclear spent fuel facility is $2 billion over budget: GAO	The Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine USS Alaska (SSBN 732)(Gold) returns to its homeport at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Ga. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Ashley Berumen) WASHINGTON — A project to upgrade government facilities designed to manage the spent fuel from nuclear-powered US Navy warships is more than $2 billion over budget and three years behind schedule, according to a new report from independent government auditors. The project, known as the Spent Fuel Handling Recapitalization Project (SFHP), will be upgrading facilities at the Idaho National Laboratory. Naval Reactors, a joint Navy and Department of Energy office led by a four-star Navy admiral who oversees and advances the fleet’s nuclear propulsion technologies, has long used the site to prepare for the disposal of spent fuel — hazardous leftover materials generated by nuclear-power warships. At the direction of lawmakers, the Government Accountability Office assessed Naval Reactors’ ongoing plans for the recapitalization and found the project has significantly overrun its original cost estimate of $1.69 billion and scheduled completion in the third quarter of 2025. 'Since [September 2018], Naval Reactors has experienced challenges in executing the project, including rising costs for construction services and some construction work not meeting Naval Reactors nuclear facility quality assurance requirements. As a result, Naval Reactors has revised the cost and schedule baseline estimates for the facility several times,' according to the report. The latest figures — totaling $3 billion and a completion date in 2028 — were produced in 2022, according to GAO, and Naval Reactors was working through developing an updated baseline as of August 2024. A Navy spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. In a written response to GAO’s audit, Jill Hruby, the undersecretary of energy for nuclear security, acknowledged the project’s cost overruns and schedule delays. 'While factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic, volatile market conditions, and poor construction subcontractor performance have contributed significantly to these challenges, improvements in management of SFHP are required to meet the high standards of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program,' she wrote. GAO recommended Naval Reactors follows best practices for credible cost estimates; obtains an 'independent and objective analysis' of the root causes for the problems to date; and updates its implementation such that any future cost breaches will automatically trigger root cause analyses. Naval Reactors agreed with all of GAO’s recommendations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/doe-navy-project-for-upgrading-spent-fuel-facility-is-2-billion-over-budget-gao/	2024-12-12T12:45:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/uss-alaska-e1699388634104.jpg
New C2 software for mobile satellites will support future orbital warfare ops	Orion Space Solutions is building the Tetra-5 constellation for Space Force experiments to demonstrate autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations and docking for on-orbit refueling. (Credit: Orion Space Solutions) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The new command and control (C2) software developed by the Space Rapid Capabilities Office (Space RCO) for maneuvering satellites in the future will be used by Space Force spacecraft performing 'orbital warfare' missions, according to Space RCO Director Kelly Hammett. The Rapid Resilient Command and Control (R2C2) program is managed by the Combined Program Office (CPO), which was stood up in 2023 to combine legacy projects from Space RCO, headquartered at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico, and the Space Force’s primary acquisition unit Space Systems Command (SSC) headquartered in Los Angeles. The program is aimed at rapidly fielding C2 capabilities for use by systems performing what the service calls dynamic space operations, using a commercial cloud architecture. 'This fall, we have already established live contacts with flying satellites down in Kirtland through the experimental systems' operated by Space Systems Command's prototyping center there headed by Col. Joseph Roth, Hammett told reporters at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday. The 'intent,' he said, is to use R2C2 'to fly some of the further experimental satellites,' such as the Tetra constellation of small satellites being built for the Space Force by Orion Space Solutions, a unit of Arcfield, to demonstrate autonomous rendezvous, proximity operations and docking for on-orbit refueling. 'Eventually all the flying systems for Delta 9, the Orbital Warfare Delta, will use R2C2,' Hammett added, noting that Space Operations Command 'just signed out a minimum to that effect.' Delta 9 is responsible for 'protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter and, when necessary, defeat orbital threats. Additionally, Delta 9 supports Space Domain Awareness by conducting space-based battlespace characterization operations and also conducts on-orbit experimentation and technology demonstrations,' according to a Space Operations Command fact sheet. In particular, it operates the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites that keep eyes on adversary activities on orbit. &#8216;I think there [are] things that we will need to be able to, I guess I'll say, &#8216;dogfight' in space,' Lt. Gen. Doug Schiess, commander of Space Forces &#8211; Space, the Space Force unit that undertakes operations for US Space Command, told reporters on Wednesday. 'Kelly's point, I think, is he's looking to the future. He's looking to where we're going to go and, being a guy that's eventually going to get those systems, I'm hoping that we are continuing to do those kind of things so that we have the best space to learn. Because when we get to a conflict, we may need to, use systems to negate somebody else's ability to attack us. We're going to need that,' he added. In particular, Schiess cited the growing threat from China, which is increasingly deploying highly mobile satellites in geosynchronous Earth orbit where many high-value US military satellites are stationed. 'China is building a kill web, kill chain, whatever you want to call it, with 400 different ISR [intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance] satellites &#8230; to the point where they can effectively track target our forces almost all the way from Hawaii, maybe even all the way from the coast of California. And so then that puts those forces at risk. And so we need to have effectors that allow us to negate their ability to use them,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/new-c2-software-for-mobile-satellites-will-support-future-orbital-warfare-ops/	2024-12-12T12:09:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-6.18.39 PM-e1734014654326.png
‘Sanctuary’ no longer: New Air Force plan seeks to rejuvenate installations	A US Air Force F-22 Raptor assigned to the 27th Fighter Squadron arrives at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam in support of Valiant Shield 24, June 7, 2024. (US Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Brian Long) WASHINGTON — Half of the Department of the Air Force’s (DAF) installation infrastructure — composed of key features like airfields, munitions storage facilities and more across the Air Force and Space Force — is currently 'in a moderate or high-risk condition,' according to a new report. The DAF’s Installation Infrastructure Action Plan (I2AP), published Wednesday, sets out a 15-year roadmap to arrest the trend of declining facilities, which is only projected to get worse in the coming years without decisive action. The plan also seeks to ensure the service’s installations are prepared to withstand a range of threats, from natural to man-made, warning that they 'can no longer be considered a sanctuary' as the Pentagon strives to keep pace with China’s growing military prowess. 'We know that over the past decade, we have not paid attention to our installations the way we should,' Ravi Chaudhary, assistant secretary of the Air Force for Energy, Installations and Environment, said during a Wednesday discussion hosted by the Air &amp; Space Forces Association. The I2AP 'is designed to be the most comprehensive and focused initiative to get our installations ready for great power competition.' RELATED: &#8216;Everybody's going to have to figure this out': Army, Air Force debate base defense amid new threats Divided into four categories that each represent different elements of installation infrastructure, the I2AP sheds light on grim realities. The first category, primary and secondary airfields, fares better than others, though over 25 percent of the airfields are rated either degraded or failing. The outlook is worse for the 'mission critical facilities' category, made up of elements like fuel storage and fire and rescue stations, where over half of infrastructure is deemed degraded or failing. 'Mission generation facilities,' described as assets like munitions storage and aircraft maintenance shops, scored similarly to their mission critical counterparts. The DAF’s 640 munitions storage facilities, with an average age of 47 years, get a particular call-out in the report, as a '[a] growing number of storage facilities are unable to support advanced munitions and, in some cases, cannot be modified to meet the emerging requirements.' The worst-performing category, according to the report, is utilities, where nearly 75 percent are either degraded or failing. Pacific Air Forces (PACAF) utilities — which would be at the centerpiece of a conflict with China — were found to be 'severely degraded.' According to the report, 70 percent of PACAF utilities are at 'serious risk,' a problem magnified by challenging conditions like a 'highly corrosive' environment and 'limited availability of skilled labor.' The condition of DAF infrastructure. (Source: Air Force I2AP report) The I2AP sets out three 'objectives' to get after these challenges. The first broadly aims to ensure infrastructure is aligned to modern missions, setting out tasks from upgrading communications systems to improving dormitories and child development centers. Arguing that infrastructure hasn’t appropriately downsized since the Gulf War, the second objective aims to 'right-size' infrastructure — either by shrinking it or finding cost savings, including through new public-private partnerships or other arrangements. For spaceports in particular, the second objective also seeks to ensure adequate infrastructure is in place to support 'enhanced space launch and test operations.' And rounding out the list of objectives is to make installations more resilient, reducing vulnerabilities stemming from adversary attack or other events like energy shortages and natural disasters. For example, the objective calls for embracing microgrids across DAF installations 'to provide localized energy generation,' as well as shoring up systems against cyber attacks. Air Force Materiel Command will lead guidance for implementing the I2AP, according to the report, which adds that the overall plan will be governed under an 'Infrastructure Council.' 'I’m transitioning in January, and it’s been a heck of a run,' Chaudhary said, referring to the forthcoming Trump administration. 'But to me, I think marching down this pathway to ensure that our installation[s are] ready has nothing to do with politics. It has everything to do with warfighting and making sure we deliver resources and capabilities to our airmen and guardians that are befitting' of their roles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/sanctuary-no-longer-new-air-force-plan-seeks-to-rejuvenate-installations/	2024-12-12T11:22:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/F-22-Guam-scaled-e1734020063973.jpg

(Credit Dave Turnbull/QinetiQ via Leonardo UK) WITTSHITE, United Kingdom — The development of the UK’s sixth-generation Tempest jet took a significant step forward this week with the MoD and industry partners unveiling the latest version of the Excalibur flight test aircraft (FTA), complete with integrated sensor pods. At a media event inside the FTA’s dedicated 'Hangar 499' at a secretive airfield in Wiltshire on Dec. 9, Leonardo UK, 2Excel and the MoD confirmed Excalibur (a modified Boeing 757) had successfully completed its first phase of modification and flight testing, including the integration of side and belly pods to accommodate Integrated Sensors, Non-Kinetic Effects (ISANKE) and Integrated Communications Systems (ICS) as part of Tempest. Officials present revealed that Excalibur took its first flight with the sizeable sensor pods to confirm airworthiness on Nov. 26. According to an official statement published on Dec. 9, the sensor pods have been designed to host the ISANKE and ICS sub-systems which Leonardo UK and its international partners are 'developing as part of their work on GCAP.' However, the aircraft is not expected to begin flying with ISANKE/ICS payloads until 2026. 'Further modification to the Excalibur FTA aircraft will include a fighter jet-style nose cone to host advanced radar-based sensor demonstrators,' the statement added. According to the MoD, Excalibur is a 'flying laboratory for combat air technology' which falls within the UK’s Future Combat Air System (FCAS) program and includes Tempest as well as additional capabilities including uncrewed aircraft, information systems and weapon systems. In simplest terms, the UK is using it to test out the tech it might want on its next-gen aircraft. But for now, it’s just able to fly with UK-developed technologies, confirmed Andrew Howard, Leonardo UK’s director for GCAP, despite the presence of Japan and Italy as part of the GCAP team. 'Everything you've seen [so far] is UK Team Tempest work that was kicked off in 2018. We've obviously been briefing our [GCAP] partners about this now for probably the last 18 months, to a varying degree of detail. And the expectation is that if they choose to work with us in the next phase, as the Team Tempest activity concludes, it would logically transition to GCAP. So the first set of TDPs are UK TDPs, and we're progressively looking at international partnerships from 2027/28 — that type of timeline,' he explained. Japan is currently using a C2 aircraft to support its own ISANKE/ICS requirements for GCAP, which Howard said is 'very similar to our own.' 'Their ambitions are different to ours and the type of sensors are going to be different to what we're proposing. But that is a Japanese industrial decision linked to their work share that they are pursuing independently of us, which we're very happy with. And similarly, our Italian colleagues, who get test access as well.' Howard also confirmed there are no existing plans to modify an additional 757 to support Tempest or GCAP, despite what he called the 'massive risk' of something happening to Excalibur that sets the GCAP program back. In 2025, Leonardo UK and 2Excel will integrate the nose and chin section which will feature the new Multi Function Radar System (MRFS), wing pods, and additional centerline pod at the back of the aircraft as well as a 'load' of antennas around the aircraft, a 2Excel official added. The official also confirmed Excalibur must conduct a 'three-point landing' to ensure the integrity of a heavy nose and chin section and stated its next flight would take place in March 2025. In his concluding remarks, Leonardo’s Howard suggested he had not anticipated the size of the pods integrated on board the Excalibur. 'It really does bring it to life. We've all talked about this in the program over the last couple of years and spent a lot of time in meetings, and coming here today, seeing these things makes it very real. The ambition of what we're going to try and do behind those pods with these very complex sensors is really exciting, and obviously it's just another step on the journey. 'The aircraft isn't finished yet by any means. The sensors aren't there by any means, but to see the good work that 2Excel and the team have done, the progress that we've made, is really exciting, and I think it's building trust with our partners.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/inside-the-test-aircraft-for-uks-next-gen-fighter/	2024-12-12T10:14:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Leonardo-2Excel-Excalibur-Flight-Test-Aircraft-with-new-side-and-belly-pods.-Credit-Dave-Turnbull-–-QinetiQ-2-scaled-e1734015905294.jpg
Russian bases and Hezbollah weapons: Key questions follow fall of Syrian regime	A Russian navy officer salutes aboard corvette Velikiy Ustyug is picture at the Russian naval base in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartus on September 26, 2019. (Photo by MAXIME POPOV/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The dust is yet to settle in Damascus after the sudden collapse of Bashar al-Assad’s regime, leaving anxious officials and observers to watch closely for signs of what’s to come. There are a myriad of questions to be answered; among the most pressing occupying the minds of American and Middle Eastern officials is whether extremism will take root in the power vacuum. But several experts told Breaking Defense their eyes were on other key flashpoints that could affect the balance of power in the region for years to come, from the fate of Russian military bases in Syria to the potential collapse of an Iranian weapons pipeline to the Lebanese group Hezbollah. 'The fall of the Assad regime will have dire consequences for [Russia and Iran’s] regional influence,' Ali Bakir, professor at Qatar University and non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told Breaking Defense. 'The pressing question for the ordinary citizens in Tehran and Moscow is: What have we gained from propping up this regime for nearly 14 years? How can our leadership explain the huge political, financial, and military investment in this regime?' Before this week, Moscow in part projected power in Syria and beyond through two military installations: Hemeimeem air base near Latakia and Tartus naval base on the Mediterranean. But now, with the Kremlin’s benefactor reportedly having fled to Russia, the fate of the bases appears up in the air. 'Our top priority remains the safety of all Russian citizens within Syrian territory and the protection of Russian facilities and missions, including diplomatic and military installations, as well as those connected to Russian companies and organizations,' Russian Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday. Open source intelligence photos indicate that Russian military ships have departed from Tartus naval base, while only few aircraft were detected via satellite imagery at Hmeimim airbase. 'We’re seeing Russia consolidate assets and … some naval vessels are leaving that area,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters on Wednesday. 'Again, it remains to be seen what the path forward is in Syria; that is up for the Syrian people to decide.' Likewise Bakir said it makes sense for Russia to remove its vessels while there may be an 'imminent threat to its troops or military assets,' but it’s an open question if Russian ships will return. 'The military bases in question are owned by the Syrians. Whether Moscow will utilize them in the future depends on the internal situation in Syria and any agreements with the current or the future governing power or government,' he said. He said he believed that it seems improbable that 'whoever controls Syria would permit Russia to station its troops or military assets within the country. Regarding the mid-term and long-term, the situation will rely on numerous variables that cannot be fully accounted for at this time.' Kristian Alexander, a senior fellow at the United Arab Emirate-based Rabdan Security and Defence Institute, said there are essentially three options: Russia negotiates with the new Syrian government to keep use of the bases, the insurgents reject Russian presence altogether for its past support of Assad, or Moscow determines the situation is too 'volatile' to risk maintaining a military presence anyway and doesn’t attempt to return. 'It could abandon these bases altogether,' Alexander told Breaking Defense. 'This would mark a significant geopolitical shift, potentially ceding influence [to] Western or regional powers like Turkey.' Assad’s fall may be troubling for close ally Iran for a number of reasons, including a practical one: logistics. Officials and experts have long said that Syria, along with Iraq, acted as an overland route through which Tehran could supply and arm the Lebanese group Hezbollah. But with Assad’s fall has come rebel control of much of that route, including Al-Boukamal, a key border crossing between Syria and Iraq, in essence 'cutting off supply lines from Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon, according to retired Lebanese Armed Forces Gen. Wehbe Katicha. In a recent analysis, the Council on Foreign Relations said Israel had also reportedly struck Iranian missile facilities in Damascus 'that had nourished Hezbollah’s previously formidable array of long-, medium-, and short-range missiles and rockets.' 'The rebel victory in Syria … thus poses an existential threat to Hezbollah,' the analysis said. As Bakir told Breaking Defense, 'it’s only a matter of time before Hezbollah’s influence diminishes, even internally in Lebanon.' He added that Tehran may have to adapt to the new reality and become more pragmatic, 'or they might try to sabotage where they can, or they might opt to buy time, rebuild their regional position, and maneuver until [President-elect Donald] Trump’s term ends, at which point they could return with a new regional strategy. Whether this will happen remains to be seen.' Having lost its ally in Syria, Alexander said Iran may turn more of its attention to neighboring Iraq, where US officials say it already props up Shi’a militias. 'With the fall of Damascus Iran will likely reinforce its position in Iraq, maintain a base of operations and exert indirect influence over Syria through shared borders and cross-border militias,' he said. 'These groups are likely to intensify their activities along the Iraq-Syria border to ensure the continuity of supply lines and maintain a connection to remnants of pro-Iran factions in Syria.' But Bakir suggested Syria’s fall could, on the contrary, push those militias closer to the Iraqi government. '[Assad’s collapse] will shift the attention to them [Iraqi militias], and they will increasingly fall under internal, regional, and international pressure to join the Iraqi official institutions and bodies rather than to serve the Iranian agenda within the framework of Iraq or neighboring Syria,' he said. So, like the other questions on this list, the answers remain to be seen and may not be known for weeks or months. The only thing that’s certain is that power dynamic in the Middle East has already shifted for years or decades to come.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/russian-bases-and-hezbollah-weapons-key-questions-follow-fall-of-syrian-regime/	2024-12-12T09:33:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241212_russia_base_syria_GettyImages-1171379332-scaled-e1734024948180.jpg
Space Force operators get hands on ATLAS space monitoring software	US Space Force Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, Space Systems Command commander (left). (Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The Space Force's software-centric program, known as ATLAS, to modernize how it manages, processes and disseminates space monitoring data has been given over to the service's new(ish) space domain awareness delta that integrates operators and acquisition experts to wrap up testing and begin a trial period, according to the head of Space Systems Command. 'The integration testing continues to go well,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant told reporters at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla. — expressing optimism that the program will meet his expectations for achieving operational capability by the end of next year. The Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System (ATLAS) program is the Pentagon's latest effort to replace the 1980s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system for managing data from the military’s network of radar and telescopes that detect and track objects on orbit. The Space Force originally planned for ATLAS to become operational in 2022, but the program has been troubled by technical issues and schedule delays — to the point where Air Force Space Acquisition Executive Frank Calvelli has dubbed it one of the Space Force's three most troubled programs. 'Mr. Calvelli is really being aggressive in holding the program offices accountable and driving the tighter integration with the operators, which will also help us turn those capabilities on faster because it's not the traditional transition,' Garrant said. The Space Force in October announced the creation of Mission Delta 2 &#8211; Space Domain Awareness as one of its integrated deltas that bring together under one commander operators-in-training at Space Operations Command (SpOC) and acquisition specialists for maintenance and sustainment for each mission formerly under Space Systems Command. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman initiated the revamped structure for the deltas, which are the equivalent of Air Force wings, last September under two prototypes, called Integrated Mission Deltas — one for positioning, navigation and timing, and the other for electronic warfare. The service has accepted that most of SpOCs nine deltas will transition to what are now dubbed simply Mission Deltas, with four already stood up. ATLAS has now been moved from Space Systems Command, which is the service's primary acquisition unit, to Mission Delta 2 in large part because the Space Force has seen how well the new integrated structure is working. Garrant said the service has learned that the integrated deltas can actually get new capabilities and kit up and running faster because of the inclusion of operators. 'If we take something not quite traditionally ready for transition, but it's close, and we put it in tight concert with the operators, the operators can start training sooner. They understand the sustainment needs better, and we start to move on that,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-operators-get-hands-on-atlas-space-monitoring-software/	2024-12-12T07:56:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Garrant-left-e1734013079326.jpeg
US, allies must rebuild air forces, invest in drones to counter China’s missile threat to runways: Stimson	US Army Privates 1st Class Danica Sasakura and Dean Werner, 1-1 Air Defense Artillery, Charley Battery Patriot Missile operators, perform pre-launch checks on a Patriot missile launcher as part of a field training exercise on Kadena Air Base, Japan. Kadena hosts the largest combat wing in the Pacific. (U.S. Air Force Airman 1st Class Maeson Elleman) SYDNEY — The US, its allies and partners must change their air forces to cope with China's enormous missile force that could cripple air bases throughout the Indo-Pacific for up to 12 days in event of war, according to a new report by the Stimson Center. 'By denying the United States the use of runways and taxiways in the region, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) could gain air superiority without ever defeating America’s arsenal of advanced fighters and bombers,' says the think tank report, released today. 'No combination of U.S. countermeasures — including the greater dispersal of aircraft in the region, improved runway repair capabilities, and more robust missile defenses — is likely to solve the problem. There is a real and growing danger that Beijing might conclude that it could keep American airpower at bay long enough to accomplish a quick fait accompli.' Central to the analysis is US vulnerability to attacks on runways in Japan, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia and Palau. And it modeled how well missile defense, faster runway repair times and the dispersion of U.S. aircraft across the theater would perform against the Chinese threat. RELATED: Guam missile defenses conduct first-ever ballistic interception in test The three authors say initial strikes by China that close air bases could cripple US and allied forces for 12 days, especially at the Japanese bases. But it would be the loss of runways for airborne tankers; that would affect operations 'for over a month.' Without refueling, US fighters with relatively short ranges 'will not be able to put most of their weapons within range — much less fly a combat air patrol over Taiwan or the South China Sea.' With the stark challenge laid out, coming up with solutions is 'arguably the most critical and daunting task facing the U.S. Air Force today,' claims the report. 'The Air Force finds itself in danger of operating much less effectively than previously assessed, if at all, at the start of a military conflict when the Joint Force would expect it to quickly set up a combat air patrol or sink Chinese ships in the Taiwan Strait. Worse, Chinese military planners might calculate that they have a window of over 30 days — when American airpower would be largely sidelined — to accomplish a fait accompli.' That could make it very hard to deter Beijing should push come to shove. Buying more missile defense systems or more fighters or bombers is not the answer for the US and its allies, the authors write. It should instead build 'large numbers of long-range drones and missiles of all types to ensure that they can keep the skies contested and blunt Chinese attacks early in a war without massive support from American fighters and bombers.' To illustrate just how spare the US missile defense enterprise is for all its impressive results in limited conflicts, they note that in October this year, two US Navy ships fired roughly one dozen SM-3 interceptors at Iranian ballistic missiles headed for Israel — using a year’s worth of production in one day. The Stimson study predicts that the US 'would likely run out of Patriot and THAAD interceptors within the first 24 hours of a military conflict.' The inventory of 1,200 Patriot missiles would run dry within a few days. So positioning THAAD and Patriot batteries around US and allied bases won't be of enough help for long enough. They also recommend allies and partners should pick up 'the bulk of the burden for contesting control of the air early in a war.' For example, instead of allies buying what the report calls 'prestige weapons systems' such as Japan's upgraded F-16s and Tokyo’s plans to co-develop a sixth-generation fighter jet with Britain and Italy, which they argue 'will be of limited utility early in a war,' they should spend more on defense and, specifically, expanding training in drone warfare. In the end, the authors offer a grim reminder of the stakes. The United States, they write, 'should be under no illusions: there will be no refuge or rest from the long reach of Chinese missiles for U.S. air bases in a war. U.S. decision-makers should ask themselves the hard questions: whether — and when — paying that high price in materiel and human lives will be in the United States’ national interest.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/us-allies-must-rebuild-air-forces-invest-in-drones-to-counter-chinas-missile-threat-to-runways-stimson/	2024-12-12T06:28:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/211208_japan_patriot_kadena_478843-scaled-e1638991696715.jpg
Capability exists to simulate the future of kill chains at theater scale	The U.S. Army Futures Command is using Raytheon's RCADE simulation tool to conduct theater-level concept experimentation and mission analysis to support agile learning of the future battlefield. (Raytheon image) It’s one thing to describe in words a new defense system, and another to visualize it. Even better to demonstrate it in an advanced modeling and simulation environment so leaders can better understand risks, design trades and, most importantly, how it integrates with other systems across kill chains and domains. Such a theater-level modeling and simulation tool exists today in the form of the Rapid Campaign Analysis and Demonstration Environment (RCADE). Developed by Raytheon Advanced Technology, an incubator within RTX that is developing capabilities like the U.S. Air Force’s Hypersonic Attack Cruise Missile, RCADE is designed to help defense leaders determine the most important kill-chain attributes that will be needed in potential conflicts of the near future and in years to come. In mid-2024, the U.S. Army Futures Command-Futures and Concepts Center (FCC) awarded Raytheon Advanced Technology a contract to conduct theater-level concept experimentation and mission analysis to support agile learning of the future battlefield. Under the contract, Raytheon Advanced Technology uses RCADE to develop theater-level scenarios to help the Army assess concepts for joint multi-domain operations. The goal is to change outcomes for the positive through quantitative data and findings from demonstration scenarios that point to potential technical achievements and capabilities needed to succeed in future conflicts. A theater-level perspective of the kill chain As the complexity of battlefield scenarios increases, future defense challenges have to be approached from both a theater- and mission-level perspective. Having that vantage point has never been more important — or more difficult to come by. 'After several conversations with Army Leadership, it became clear that modeling and simulation, and more specifically the ability to do rapid, iterative turns, could expedite the process to identify where capability gaps may exist, and how to address them,' said Tom Goolsby, senior principal engineer, Raytheon Advanced Technology. 'We introduced RCADE as a way to augment, buttress and enhance their existing capability. With RCADE we’re able to help the Army see what an integrated solution might look like in terms of the full warfighting capability.' For senior leaders, in particular, RCADE analyses help them understand decision trade space and associated risk. When they're making hard decisions, and have to justify and defend those decisions, RCADE provides them with quantitative analysis they can rely upon. 'We're not trying to predict the exact future,' said Goolsby. 'With RCADE, we create a baseline for a certain combination of systems in a particular theater, and then try to understand trade-offs or deltas when we insert new technologies, capabilities, and alternate employment support structures. All those become new reference points that show us where the results from the model improved, or vice versa.' 'RCADE gives you a rapid ability to test concepts; is this a good or bad idea for this theater and use case,' said Goolsby. 'Our goal is to maximize the number of iterations as quickly as we can.' Understanding trade-offs in theater campaigns Computational theater-level analysis stretches back many decades, pioneered both within the government and private sector institutions such as the RAND Corporation. Today’s DoD has excellent tools and program offices for that purpose, and also modeling and simulation capabilities targeted at detailed system development and program execution. Sometimes, though, a theater-level situation arises where they can't cover a broad trade space in the time that a decision needs to be made. While Defense Department capabilities remain critical, RCADE’s role comes to the forefront when answers to questions are needed sooner than later or when more information is needed to know what to study in detail. This is where the 'R' for rapid in RCADE comes in. 'RCADE studies are not typically focused on integrating existing products for near term outcomes, but instead consider more ‘green space’ problems,' said George Blaha, a Raytheon principal engineering fellow. 'Our work with the Army Futures Command is looking out 10-15+ years. When we’re trying to figure out the big trade-offs in large-scale theaters like INDOPACOM or EUCOM for example, that complexity is what drives the need for a tool like RCADE.' RCADE’s versatility helps defense leaders see what an integrated solution might look like in terms of the full warfighting capability and visualize and quantify the impacts of different capability mixes and employment concepts. It provides insight into the key pillars of their acquisition process – cost, schedule, and performance – so they can shape their long-term investment strategies.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/capability-exists-to-simulate-the-future-of-kill-chains-at-theater-scale/	2024-12-12T05:25:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Raytheon-Insights-image-article-3-scaled.jpg
House passes $884B NDAA despite transgender care ban controversy	U.S Army Spc. Breyana Semans, a military police officer with the 46th Military Police Company, Michigan National Guard, secures an area near the U.S. Capitol in Washington, March 1, 2021. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class R.J. Lannom Jr.) WASHINGTON — The House passed the $884 billion National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2025 today, despite a sizable Democrat contingent opposing the typically bipartisan measure due to the last minute-inclusion of a transgender care ban. The bill was voted through 281-140, with 124 Democrats and 16 Republicans voting against the measure. The compromise NDAA keeps to the budgetary spending caps imposed by last year’s debt ceiling deal, which set a $895 billion limit for all national defense related spending for FY25. Some of that spending is not covered in the jurisdiction of the NDAA. The focal point of this year’s bill is a 14.5 percent pay raise for junior enlisted servicemembers and 4.5 percent raise for all servicemembers, as well as a laundry list of provisions intended to improve troop’s quality of life — a political slam dunk for both sides. However, Democrats were infuriated by a last minute addition of language by House Speaker Mike Johnson that would ban Tricare from covering gender dysphoria treatments 'that could result in sterilization' for transgender children of servicemembers. The House Armed Services Committee’s top Democrat, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, announced on Tuesday that he would vote against the bill despite having helped helm it, due to the anti-transgender provisions. During a Saturday interview with Breaking Defense, Smith said he would have been in favor of adding language to study the effects of medical treatment for transgender minors, but that 'it is not debatable that there are some minors with gender dysphoria who benefit from the treatments that this bill would ban.' 'You are denying health care to the children of service members that they need to serve a partisan agenda. And I think that's extraordinarily problematic,' he said. For a larger rundown of the bill’s funding recommendations and policy mandates, read this: What to know about what's in the compromise NDAA During a press conference earlier today, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he had not taken an official position on the NDAA and would leave it for each member to make their own decision on a case-by-case basis. In floor speeches ahead of the bill’s passage, most senior HASC Democrats expressed support for the bill. HASC Chairman Mike Rogers, R-Ala., told The Hill on Tuesday that Johnson did not consult him about including the care ban. Although Rogers said he agreed with the substance of the language, he sees the addition of the provisions as unnecessary due to the election of President Donald Trump. 'My preference would have been that we just let the president, on Jan. 20, deal with these [culture issues],' Rogers said, 'which he’s already indicated he’s going to do.' But in remarks ahead of the vote, Rogers said that the bill represents a 'bicameral compromise' and that 'each corner has some wins and some losses.' The Republican-controlled Rules Committee, which set the terms of the bill’s passage on Monday, voted against bringing an amendment to the floor that would have allowed members to reverse the transgender care ban, as well as another amendment that would have given governors greater control over the transition of National Guard units to the Space Force. The bill authorizes $883.7 billion for fiscal year 2025, including $849.9 billion for Department of Defense programs. It also approves $33.3 billion for national security programs in the Department of Energy and the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board and $512.4 million for defense-related activities. The bill now heads to the Senate, where it is expected to pass despite some Democrats’ concerns about the transgender care provisions, as well as disappointment from some top GOP defense hawks who had hoped the Senate’s version of the bill — which lifted the NDAA topline to $911.8 billion, pushing overall national defense spending to $923.3 billion — would ultimately prevail. 'The failure to include a topline increase is a tremendous loss for our national defense,' said Mississippi Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee who is in line to take the gavel in January. 'Many senior flag officers, defense strategists, and other experts continue to note that this is the most dangerous moment since World War II,' he said in a statement Monday. 'Not only does this NDAA thwart the bipartisan will of the Senate, but it signifies a profound missed opportunity to strengthen President-elect Trump’s hand when he takes office.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/house-passes-844b-ndaa-despite-transgender-care-ban-controversy/	2024-12-11T13:47:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/221116_DVIDS_capitol_soldier_6538166-scaled-e1668635639247.jpg
Space Force sees mutual benefit from new Japan component	The sixth and seventh satellites in Japan's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System constellation will carry US Space Force space surveillance payloads. (Credit: JAXA) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The head of US Space Forces Indo-Pacific sees his brand new field component in Japan as an two way opportunity — with the US side helping Japan flesh out its still nascent military space organization and the Japanese side using its planned investments to grow allied operational capabilities to face ever-increasing threats from China in the region. Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir told reporters at the Space Force Association's Spacepower conference in Orlando, Fla., that the new United States Space Forces – Japan at Yokota Air Base, stood up Dec. 4, 'is going to be really key as United States transforms US Forces Japan into an operational headquarters.' Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin announced in July plans to elevate US Forces Japan, also headquartered at Yokota, to a joint force headquarters which will report to the commander of the Indo-Pacific Command, Adm. Samuel Paparo. Mastalir said the newest Space Force component will be 'working very closely' with the commander of US Forces Japan, Lt. Gen. Stephen Jost, and Japanese forces at the Japan Joint Operations Center 'to fully integrate the space component. 'As we evolve that relationship back in Oahu, we continue integrating across all the other service components throughout the INDOPACOM headquarters and with allies and partners,' he said. 'And this is manifested in terms of better integration of space and space equities into our internal processes, &#8230; identifying exercise objectives as part of the joint exercise life cycle, and providing some joint training, because the joint force, in many cases, depends on the Guardians assigned to those organizations to help them understand the equities of space and how it impacts their war fighting capabilities.' Mastalir said that from the time Space Forces Indo-Pacific was activated, his intent was to 'have some organization in country' largely to focus on integrating with the Japan Self Defense Force as it builds up its Space Operations Squadron, which was launched in 2020. He noted that the Japanese military intends to first elevate the squadron to a wing, and 'eventually' to its own command. 'Additionally, Japan has in their defense spending plan allocated billions [of dollars] US to increase space capabilities, and to the extent that we're able to help shape and inform those investments in a way that makes the alliance [better], it makes working and fighting alongside allies more interoperable and more effective. And I wanted to have an organization there that could contribute to that solution,' he added. Mastalir noted that the US and Japan already are working closely on a number of space programs, including Tokyo's Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) constellation. The sixth and seventh QZSS satellites will carry Space Force space surveillance payloads, with the QZSS 6 launching early in fiscal year 2026 and QZSS 7 early in fiscal 2027. Further, the US last year agreed to use data from Japan's evolving deep space radar to improve its space domain awareness, and Mastalir expressed interest in the country's plans to also launch a 'free flying' space domain awareness satellite. Space domain awareness is one of US Space Command's top priorities, with a keen eye to the on-orbit activities of China that US military leaders see as a growing threat. 'We must protect and defend our blue space assets to ensure that the Joint Force can close the long-range kill chains that they intend to execute. Second, we must be prepared to challenge red space in order to break the PLA's long-range kill chains and protect the Joint Force from space-enabled attack,' Mastalir said. 'Those are themes that you heard earlier today from the [Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman], and they are absolutely 100 percent imperative when you look at the threats that we're facing in the Indo-Pacific,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-sees-mutual-benefit-from-new-japan-component/	2024-12-11T13:42:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Screenshot-2024-12-11-at-1.11.17 PM.png
Australia must increase joint training, build more together with US, Japan: Reports	Japan's Special Operations Group, JGSDF, conducted a field training exercise with the Special Operations Command Australia in September 2023. This photo was posted on social media by the Japanese Self Defense Forces. (SDF) SYDNEY — America, Japan and Australia know their national security establishments must work more closely together, as reflected by a number of signed agreements and commitments. But, a pair of independent studies have both concluded, the countries still have significant work to do on training and practicing how to fight together. The two reports focus on different bilateral angles. The first, from the University of Western Australia [PDF], is focused on Japan and Australia's relationship. The second, from the Carnegie Foundation, if focused on Australia and Washington. But taken together, they have clear overlaps and paint a picture of where trilateral cooperation may be going between the three Pacific partners. As mentioned, the UWA study is about Tokyo and Canberra. Author Tom Corben, of the US Studies Center at the University of Sydney, points to the close strategic relationship between the two countries, stressing that this must grow from its current focus on sharing intelligence assessments and declaring new policies to improving operational cooperation, giving Japan more access to Australia's vast training and testing facilities. He also calls for the recent agreement to regularly rotate Japanese marines in and out of northern Australia to be acted upon. Corben also notes that the two US allies are more closely bound to each other than to any other military except that of the United States. But much of this relationship is relatively new, and required casting aside more than 50 years of suspicion and anger borne of Japan's conduct during World War II. The long-term success of Australia-Japan defense cooperation 'could hinge greatly' on their ability to harmonize their modernization agendas, according to the report. While the AUKUS ITAR reforms, designed to smooth the sharing of information between the US, Britain and Australia, have eased Australia's ability to buy and sell weapons with the US, Corben raises the issue of whether the AUKUS reforms will pose 'legal disincentives for Japanese companies to work with the Australian government.' Corben recommends that Australia and Japan boost their submarine surveillance, including deployment of aircraft to each other's bases and increasing operational intelligence sharing. When it comes to the Japanese forces that will begin rotations to Darwin and its environs, Corben says the two countries should focus on their forces first, 'rather than simply focusing on trilateral activities with the United States.' The US Marines regularly come to northern Australia each year for training and exercises. Finally, Corben says Canberra should consider working with Tokyo to produce and develop long-range strike weapons, including producing Japanese-designed missiles in Australia to avoid possible US arms export restrictions that would affect Japan. Australia's Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordinance could be a good focus for this. The second report, edited by Evan Feigenbaum of the Carnegie Foundation, argues that Canberra and Washington 'have an unparalleled opportunity to fashion broader, stronger, and multilayered partnerships. 'But this, in turn, will require self-reflection,' he writes,' not just cheerleading. And that means undertaking an intellectually honest appraisal of the promises and challenges inherent to the alliance.' That means 'both countries need to undertake difficult reforms, forge new modes of cooperation, harmonize outdated regulations, better align national strategies, address acute Australian sovereignty concerns and associated questions around risk thresholds, and develop accelerated solutions to enduring alliance management challenges.' Time is short, with the loss of strategic warning time, so 'reforming the alliance is now an urgent priority.' Australian and American defense planners, he opines, have not fully confronted 'some thorny operational questions.' The two countries, he says, 'have very little history divvying up roles and missions in the manner that will be required for deterrence, defense, and ultimately warfighting in the context of high-intensity conflict in the Indo-Pacific.' They also need to better integrate and align their industrial bases. One of the chapters recommends that a 'cadre of contracting officers should meet annually to discuss contracting strategies for nontraditional commercial technology providers' and share acquisition lessons. This is all driven by China's 'growing military capabilities and hostile intent.' It also proffers the interesting idea of a 'Future Warfare Strategy Team' that would include strategists, uniformed personnel, researchers and investors to meet biennially. They would explore operational responses to different Indo-Pacific contingencies such as a Taiwan blockade or invasion, a Korean peninsula crisis, or an escalation in China's coercion of the Philippines. They also propose several ventures to improve the two countries' ability to tap entrepreneurs and venture capitalists to best identify and develop advanced commercial technologies, similar to the Defense Innovation Unit of the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/australia-must-increase-joint-training-build-more-together-with-us-japan-two-reports/	2024-12-11T13:01:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/japan-sof-e1715971028155.jpg
‘Never been done’: Army to test out new integrated data layer on classified networks at Convergence	Soldiers from U.S. Army Special Operations Command train with devices connected via the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Secure Handhelds on Assured Resilient networks at the tactical Edge (SHARE) system in preparation for their employment during Project Convergence 22. PC22 is an All-Service and Multinational campaign of learning featuring experiments on hundreds of different technologies and capabilities. (U.S. Army photo by CPT Alex Werden) SAVANNAH, Ga. — For the first time the Army plans to stress test its Next Generation Command and Control's integrated data layer on classified networks at the service's sprawling Project Convergence Capstone 5 event, according to two officers involved in the program. The Army demonstrated the integrated data layer’s abilities during the NetModX exercise in New Jersey back in September, but Convergence will be a bigger test. 'Our last demonstration ... was in New Jersey but that was more to push the data across tactical transport modalities. But this is going to be the first time we'll run on secure classified networks. We're pulling live data and then integrating it in all the different warfighting functions. So it's a pretty big, pretty big push,' Col. Matt Skaggs, director of tactical applications and architecture at Army Futures Command, said in an interview on the sidelines of the Army's Technical Exchange Meeting Tuesday. 'That's candidly never been done before,' he added. eBook: Project Convergence, the Army's tech showcase for the future 'The initial focus for our strategy is building an integrated data layer for our ecosystem, and that allows all the different applications that normally would be on a different data model to be on the same foundation. So everybody can have the same view of the operational environment,' Skaggs said. RELATED: Pentagon's CJADC2 dreams &#8216;very aspirational' right now, Marine Corps general says As a former intelligence officer, Skaggs said the process of making sense of data without an interface like the integrated data layer was much more complex. 'So as an intel guy, we would pull data off of all the airborne sensors and all the ground-based sensors, and it would give us a view of what the enemy is doing,' he said. 'But as you have separate data ingress and each of those data fields are getting processed differently, they're not compatible. So we would have five or six different views of the battlefield, and so what we're trying to do now by combining all that data and curating it all in the same place, that allows us to overlay all of those aforementioned fields at the same time.' Col. Mike Kaloostian, director of transportation and network security for Army Futures Command, said the integrated data layer is 'absolutely the focal point' of the Army’s Next Generation Command and Control initiative — the service’s plan to create an integrated C2 structure focusing on data centricity at all echelons. He said that with the integrated data layer approach, the service will be able to focus more on the interpretation of data instead of collecting it. 'If we're going to handle that type and process that type of data and push it all the way down to the edge, a tactical formation in the field ... we have to think about it differently, right?' Kaloostian asked. The new data layer will help the service to focus on three areas: edge computing, the diverse transportation of data and software defined networking, he added. 'Those are the three areas that we're really focused on,' Kaloostian said. 'Moving there, orchestrating all of that to ensure that we're getting data to the edge, and that data is flowing appropriately amongst the echelons before horizontally and vertically. That's the focal point.' But the colonels said the data transport layer won’t stop there. It will also have artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities baked in that will perform data correlation and normalization, Skaggs said. 'If we have an example of correlations, we have three different sensors up, and they're coming back with three slightly different views, or where an entity would be on a battlefield, the AI can infer where the correlation of that collection sigma is, and then put where that dot is.' He added that this can also help differentiate between enemy systems and the Army’s own systems. 'Machines have a hard time parsing that, unless you manually correlate it. So the AI will pull out different data fields and see where the overlap is and then render that into an object that's usable by the rest of the applications,' Skaggs said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/never-been-done-army-to-test-out-new-integrated-data-layer-on-classified-networks-at-convergence/	2024-12-11T12:06:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241211_DVIDS_army_convergence_tablet_7479423-scaled-e1733928484426.jpg
Pentagon launches new generative AI ‘cell’ with $100M for pilots, experiments	Staff Sgt. Tullis Moore a cyber operator with 175th Cyber Operations, Maryland Air National Guard monitors cyber attacks during Exercise Southern Strike at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, April 21, 2023.(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon today announced it's setting up a new AI Rapid Capabilities Cell meant to accelerate the military’s adoption of Large Language Models and other forms of generative artificial intelligence. The new AIRCC (pronounced 'Arc') will implement the recommendations [PDF] of Task Force Lima, which was created in 2023 to get a handle on the unexpected explosion of 'GenAI' and is now officially disbanded — although some as-yet unnamed members of the Task Force will move over to the accelerator cell, said outgoing Chief Digital &amp; AI Officer (CDAO) Radha Plumb. 'Over the course of 12 months, Task Force Lima analyzed hundreds of AI workflows and tasks, [from] warfighting functions like command and control decision support [to] enterprise management functions like financial management and healthcare information management,' Plumb said. 'AI adoption by adversaries like China, Russia, Iran and North Korea is accelerating and poses significant national security risks,' she warned. 'We are taking an all hands on deck approach to ensuring the US continues to lead the way and accelerate DoD adoption of these tools.' AIRCC will be run by CDAO but work closely with the Defense Innovation Unit, the Pentagon’s outreach arm to Silicon Valley and other centers of private-sector innovation nationwide, Plumb told reporters today. It’ll have $100 million in funding to launch efforts on four fronts: (Technically and confusingly, this funding comes from the budgets for federal fiscal years 2024 and 2025. However, Plumb said, all $100 million come from Research, Development, Test &amp; Evaluation funds, aka RDTE, which can be used up to three years after the end of the year for which it was appropriated). GenAI applications that prove successful in testing and get positive feedback from would-be users — whether military officers or civilian officials — will get further funding to scale up to widespread deployment. When will that happen? 'I can't give you a specific timeline, because it really depends on the performance of the technology,' Plumb told reporters. That said, she noted proudly, when Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks challenged CDAO and its partners to come up with a global data-sharing system for the Combatant Commands, known as Combined Joint Global Command &amp; Control (CJADC2), they got a 'Minimum Viable Capability' operational within a year. 'That was about a nine to 12-month cycle to get all the way to the MVC for a pretty complex technology,' Plumb said. The new GenAI effort will take the same accelerated approach, she said. Radha Iyengar Plumb, seen in a 2022 photo, has been tapped as the next Chief Data and Artificial Intelligence Officer. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) Indeed, she argued, the Pentagon is already moving quickly on generative AI, at least by its own standards. Today’s creation of the new accelerator cell comes two years after OpenAI unveiled ChatGPT and 16 months after the Pentagon stood up its Task Force Lima to figure out how to harness the explosion in 'GenAI.' 'Today the Department is officially sunsetting Task Force Lima and, to concretely implement their recommendations, we’re establishing the AI Rapid Capability Cell,' Plumb said. That’s ahead of schedule, she emphasized. 'Task Force Lima did an incredible job,' she said. 'We had slated it for 18 months, and within 12 months, they had made so much progress and had such concrete recommendations that we moved to stand up the cell for actual execution.' (That implies the Task Force submitted its recommendations in August and it’s taken the last four months to get the AI accelerator cell organized and ready for today’s official launch). Those recommendations go beyond the GenAI accelerator cell officially launched today. According to a four-page summary of Task Force Lima’s report [PDF], CDAO and other Pentagon agencies must work to safeguard the new technology. That includes researching potential security issues unique to GenAI, adapting government classification protocols and security standards, and potentially using GenAI itself to accelerate the notoriously cumbersome Authority To Operate (ATO) procedures. The Task Force also calls for DoD to 'develop and resource a comprehensive acquisition strategy for GenAI' — which would be difficult to figure out at any time, but especially on the cusp of a presidential transition. It’s worth noting TF Lima’s original 18-month deadline would have had it delivering its recommendations in early 2025 — after the Biden Administration and Biden appointees like Plumb had all left office. Once-and-future President Donald Trump and his advisors have publicly blasted the Pentagon for being too slow and bureaucratic to adopt new tech, while his inner circle includes tech enthusiasts and AI entrepreneurs who have called for a 'Manhattan Project'-style push on AI. So while specific Biden-era AI efforts may go under the axe, AI as a whole is expected to keep accelerating. 'I will transition at the end of this administration, but the rest of CDAO will still be here, and of course the mission continues,' Plumb said this morning. 'We've seen broad, widespread support in this administration [and] from the incoming team. We see it … across the aisle, bipartisan, in Congress; we see it bicamerally in the House and Senate. We see it here in DC and in Silicon Valley and internationally.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagon-launches-new-generative-ai-cell-with-100m-for-pilots-experiments/	2024-12-11T10:37:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241017_DVIDS_soldier_computers_7758907-scaled-e1729191253630.jpg
The Pentagon must build weapons differently to mobilize for the information age	M3 tanks under construction during World War II. (Detroit Public Library) The Pentagon’s depleted weapons magazines don’t look like those of a military preparing to fight China in two years. Facing shortages for training and future contingencies, Washington has constrained weapons shipments to Ukraine. At home, industry is unable to keep up with demand and the changes needed to counter GPS jamming. But the uncomfortable truth is this—today’s scarcity is self-imposed. With their custom components and bespoke integration, the DoD’s preferred munitions are more like the artisan products featured on Etsy than the mass-produced weapons that came off assembly lines during World War II. The Arsenal of Democracy turned auto plants into aircraft and bomb factories by designing—or redesigning—military hardware for producibility. To prepare for protracted conflict, the DoD needs to think like a manufacturer and pursue weapons that leverage existing parts and elastic production facilities. America has plenty of capacity for the Pentagon to tap. US manufacturing output rose during the last decade, and the $100 billion US electronics contract manufacturing industry already builds complex and competitive products from MRI machines to chip-making equipment. US production of semiconductors—the heart of any new weapon—is growing faster than any other country. But harnessing US manufacturing capacity demands a different acquisition philosophy. Program officials will need to avoid custom components that create artificial scarcity. Like Dell or General Electric, who maintain quality and control while designing around available commercial parts, the Pentagon needs to build weapons that can evolve with dynamic supply chains. This means moving away from rigidly specified configurations toward continuous testing and qualification processes that enable ongoing evolution. Three programs illuminate this new way forward: The Air Force/Defense Innovation Unit Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV) program shows how modern industrial approaches can enable adaptability at scale. The program designs cruise missiles using modular components and open architectures that decouple software-heavy guidance and sensing systems from physical structures. As a result, ETV can use faster modular production techniques and continuously evolve through software and component updates. Two other programs are focused on speed and price by taking advantage of existing components. The Navy's air-launched Multi-mission Affordable Capacity Effector (MACE) is designed to cost under $300,000 per unit at annual production rates of 500-plus while delivering ranges comparable to missiles costing ten times as much. The Navy hopes to achieve these characteristics by taking advantage of existing guidance and control systems, additive manufacturing for rocket motors, and modular designs. Like MACE, the Air Force's Extended Range Attack Munition (ERAM) program is planning to use available components and modular manufacturing to achieve high production rates. Intended for the tough electromagnetic environment in Ukraine, the Air Force wants ERAM to be adaptable and able to navigate without GPS. The normal Pentagon response to munition shortfalls—as urged by many defense analysts—is to try to build more of today’s weapons. But this approach is fundamentally flawed. Even adding a whole new production line at best doubles output, while depleting inventories of custom components and creating artificial scarcity. And as we saw in Ukraine, battlefield innovation can make stockpiles of exquisite weapons irrelevant in an instant. So, instead of continuing to stockpile obsolescence, the DoD should design a complementary family of weapons from the bottom up that could be built at multiple facilities in wartime. Requirements officials will need to prioritize adaptability and production scale over raw performance. Program managers will need to use open architectures that enable continuous evolution as technology and supply chains evolve. Most important, industry will need to create surge-able, mass-producible designs that align with existing manufacturing capacity. This bottom-up approach takes advantage of America's industrial strengths. The US contract manufacturing base that already produces precision electronics at volumes that dwarf military demands. These companies maintain sophisticated quality control and security protocols and offer elastic capacity that can surge when needed. The foundation they provide for weapons assembly could be complemented by component technologies for software, rocket motors, warhead chemicals, and automated manufacturing and 3D printing for structural elements being pursued by a new generation of US defense startups. Critics will argue that tapping into commercial capacity compromises performance or security. But that misses the point. A weapon in hand that can evolve with the fight is infinitely more useful to US troops than an empty missile magazine and an impressive PowerPoint deck. DoD acquisition officials should take four key actions to implement this new family of weapons. First, they need to remove policy barriers that hinder using commercial components such as outdated or inflexible technical standards. Second, they should accelerate ongoing efforts to digitize and make testing and qualification a streamlined and continuous process instead of a laborious one-time validation. Third, they will need to organize weapons programs to allow building and evolving mission systems from seekers to thrusters independently from physical structures. Finally, they should write contracts to reward a vendor’s ability to produce on time and at scale over its ability to meet arbitrary performance targets. None of these changes need new legislation or reorganization. They simply require program executives to direct a bottom-up approach driven by available industrial capabilities rather than arbitrary top-down performance specifications. The ERAM, MACE, and ETV programs prove this model can work. What's needed now is the will to fund and scale it. Like Freedom’s Forge during World War II, US mobilization in the 21st century should rely on fundamental American economic strengths like technological innovation, product adaptability, and market-driven solutions. The Pentagon can field a new generation of weapons that leverage these attributes. The question is whether requirements officials and program managers can start behaving like titans of industry rather than art connoisseurs before it is too late.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-pentagon-must-build-weapons-differently-to-mobilize-for-the-information-age/	2024-12-11T09:34:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/09/Tanks1Final.jpg.CROP_.original-original-e1637611292874.jpg
Coast Guard commandant praises ICE Pact’s potential, still needs icebreakers ‘now’	US Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw breaks ice in Whitefish Bay, Mich., in support of Operation Spring Breakout, March 16, 2009. (US Coast Guard/Petty Officer 3rd Class George Degener) 'My view on what ICE Pact will do for us is it creates broader synergies beyond just what US ship building capacity can do … [and] will allow us to leverage lessons and insights and capacity and expertise that the Finnish and the Canadians have alongside us,' Adm. Linda Fagan told Breaking Defense over the weekend on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'What that actually translates to in the future? It's so new. I don't know,' she later added. In July the three nations announced the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact, meant to speed the production of new vessels using Canadian and Finnish expertise along with America's larger industrial base. In November the countries inked a joint memorandum of understanding with key four elements: enhanced information exchange, workforce development collaboration, engagement with allies and partners, and research and development. But the US shipbuilding industrial base is already under strain, and ICE Pact is just taking its first steps. 'The challenge now is leveraging all the goodness that's in ICE Pact to actually begin to accelerate some of the icebreaker building and conversation in the country,' Fagan said. 'There's a defense industrial base reality to this, certainly as it pertains to shipbuilding and shipyard capacity.' RELATED: ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers The four-star admiral said that the nations have stood up working groups to look for collaborative opportunities and nail down just how each nation can contribute for 'actual effectiveness.' 'The ICE Pact doesn't impact any of the federal acquisition rules, the Buy American requirements, all of that is in place,' Fagan said. 'We're &#8230; sort of negotiating through this part of what the working groups are going to need.' 'Ideally, it does speed up delivery, lower cost, increase the pace of delivery but this … really is just starting,' she added. Part of that challenge stems from the Bollinger acquisition of the Halter Marine shipyard that held the previous heavy icebreaker deal. 'The contract that was negotiated with the previous yard is a firm-fixed price contract bid at a price… [and] the current reality is the ship can't be built at the original bid price,' Fagen said. 'What the additional cost is, is what we're working to definitize right now.' Complicating the matter further, Fagan said, is the fact that this deal is only for the first of three vessels, the most expensive, and there is a 'huge uncertainty' ensuring there will be a steady stream of dollars for the other two due the budgeting process and Congressional approval. While Fagan declined to disclose just what price tag that first vessel may now come in at, she said she hopes to get the deal inked in the coming weeks. 'The aim point,' she added, 'is I need the ship now, and we need it at a fair cost that reflects what it's going to take the yard to build it.' Once that full-rate production deal is in place, it will likely take the yard four-plus years to get it ready for water.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/coast-guard-commandant-praises-ice-pacts-potential-still-needs-icebreakers-now/	2024-12-11T08:10:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240711_DVIDS_icebreaker_1090563-e1720702863965.jpg
What Army officers hope C2 Fix will actually fix in the field	US Army soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division use SMETs during a recent training exercise. (Ashely Roque/Breaking Defense) But that's a good thing, one of the officers said, because that means the service is prioritizing the soldiers who will actually use the tech when it matters most. 'A big portion of the huge benefits of the program is the focus on the end user,' Lt. Col. Jon Nielsen, commander of the 2nd Battalion in the 101st Airborne Division, told the audience at the Army's 13th Technical Exchange Meeting today in Savannah, Ga. 'Something I've never experienced within the Army is that the actual process, the actual capabilities driven by the end user, the squad leader, the platoon leader, platoon sergeant, first sergeant, company level leaders that are utilizing the equipment or having feedback prior to each one of those major training exercises. Then [they] also follow up afterwards to adjust the things that we saw that didn't work, and then integrate them as part of that effort.' Soldiers from the 101st as well as the 10th Mountain Division have been called to participate in the service’s C2 Fix initiative — the Army’s strategy to make its current network operations more efficient so they can 'fight tonight.' C2 Fix is also part of the service’s larger transformation in contact project that the same divisions have participated in over the past year. According to Nielsen and two of his colleagues, end users are asking for: When it comes to edge computing, the Army has long acknowledged the modern battlefield is saturated with data from sources like high-definition drone video feeds, which has created a bandwidth bottleneck. One solution is to do more computing and analysis of that data 'at the edge,' or in the field, so it doesn't have to be sent off anywhere in the first place, or at least so that only key data must be transmitted. RELATED: Empowered edge vs. the centralization trap: Who will weild AI better, the US or China? Right now, Nielsen suggested current edge computing options aren't enough. 'We still have a reliance on the server stack, and I know that we're moving towards working towards finding an edge compute solution, but it certainly slows down the data transmission,' he said. 'We found that to be something that's hindered us in each one of our collective training exercises. So we need to find an edge compute solution that allows us to transmit data quickly.' Similarly, Nielsen bemoaned limited options for communication over embattled or disconnected networks. For that, he said, the Army needs more pLEO satellite communication solutions — especially useful in the face of electronic warfare. 'Our ability to have some pLEO solution on the move is something we need. There's a requirement to have mobile C2 [command and control] or mobile CP [command post] platforms at every edge, at every echelon. So whether that be company up to division, we're a lot lighter than we were when we went to JRTC [Joint Readiness Training Center] in January. Then when we went back again in August, some of our headquarters elements went from tents all the way down to vehicles,' Nielsen said. 'It certainly increases our lethality.' Related: Army using ‘transformation in contact’ to make case for new weapons, formation decisions Fellow panelist Col. David Lamborn, 2nd Brigade Commander, 25th Infantry Division, said that the biggest improvement he wants to see with C2 Fix is also radio-related: the need for more condensed radio equipment that doesn’t rely on connections through 'fragile' cables. 'What I am concerned about with our current C2 architecture is some of the complexity that exists,' Lamborn said. 'If you're moving into the environment, moving tactically, quite often, if you've got a radio and it's hooked up to a wedge and it's hooked up to a battery, those are connected with some kind of expensive and somewhat fragile cables. When those things are hooked up in series, all it takes is one of those components to break and the complexity of the the whole system stops working.' Lamborn added that it would be helpful for industry to develop such systems in a way that 'streamlines' and 'integrates' all of those components into one. 'As you design and deploy capabilities out to us, having them integrated so that they're not exposed and we don't have exposed cables that are inevitably going to get broken as soldiers move through the field,' he said. RELATED: Enough &#8216;one trick ponies': Marine special ops specialists want industry help to fuse tech Also on the topic of hardware, Lt. Col. Joe Kaminski, the G6 at the 3rd Infantry Division, said that one issue that he wants to see solved with C2 Fix is the incompatibility with older weapons systems with new technology systems. 'We all can agree that technology probably changes about every 18 months,' Kaminski said. 'One of the constraints we have with that transformative change is the weapons platforms for the armored elements usually doesn't change for about 30 years, and so we have integrated a lot of those capabilities within the systems, within these track vehicle platforms. 'The problem that we're running into now is the safety certification for any upgrades or changes that need to happen, and that can take a very, very long process and a very expensive process. So one of the things we're pushing back up and identifying is, how do we decouple actually, technology that would transform every three to five years on a platform that doesn't change for 30 to 40 years?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/what-army-officers-hope-c2-fix-will-actually-fix-in-the-field/	2024-12-11T07:15:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_6862-scaled-e1725888049132.jpg
Slovakia closing in on order for 3 C-390 transporters, says Embraer	Embraer showed off its C-390 Millennium carrier during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow. (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — Brazilian manufacturer Embraer said Tuesday that in the next month, Slovakia plans on making 'steps toward' the acquisition of three C-390 Millennium tactical transport aircraft. 'The Slovak Ministry of Defense will start formal steps toward the purchase of three C-390s in January 2025,' Embraer said in a statement. The company added that Slovakian defense minister Robert Kaliňák has stated that the aircraft is the 'best option' to fulfil the European country’s future military transport needs. It also noted that the Slovak Ministry of Defense (MoD) and the Brazilian Ministry of Defense (MoD) signed a Letter of Intent (LoI) agreement focused on renewed industrial cooperation between the two countries. The Slovak MoD website had not shared any information about the purported procurement, and the MoD did not respond to a request for comment by publication. But it would be extremely unusual for a company to make such a definitive statement without approval of its customer. The aircraft has been on a run of wins in Europe, with Sweden most recently selecting it. Additionally, Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands have all placed orders, while Hungary and Portugal currently operate the platform. Given that Slovakia shares borders with Hungary, Austria and the Czech Republic, Embraer noted that 'neighbouring countries' could find 'synergies in terms of training, logistics and cooperation in the future capabilities and growth of their fleets.'

'The change of the security situation after 2020 and the ongoing armed conflicts also have a major impact on the performance of the tasks of the air transport aviation of the Air Force of the Armed Forces of the Slovak Republic, including the requirements for their new capabilities,' reads an online translation of the documents. They were shared with lawmakers as part of a motion, since approved, to make the transport aviation effort a 'strategic investment' and shield it from scrutiny. Local media reported that the new status of the project protects it from assessment by Slovakia's Value for Money department. The documents also draw on concerns surrounding the operational utility of the C-27J, which looks set to be prematurely withdrawn from service after first starting operations in 2017. They state that C-27Js operated at 'the limit of their operational range' when conducting missions in Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. Additionally, 'due to their maximum operational range and on-board equipment' the two aircraft, 'could not be deployed in support of the operations of the Armed Forces in Central Africa, where Slovak soldiers were deployed in the Central African Republic and Mali.' As a third example, it was shared that 'capacity limitations' of the tactical airlifters were identified and 'current equipment' deemed 'insufficient' during Afghanistan evacuation flights that took place in the aftermath of the humanitarian crisis following the Taliban’s 2021 return to power. 'These capability shortfalls have been repeatedly identified as critical in the conduct of evacuation flights from the area of military operations in Lebanon in 2024, where repeated transports have been conducted from Beirut airport with available aircraft that do not have self-protection systems and have a low transport capacity for that purpose,' add the documents. Outside of the transport aviation recapitalization effort, Slovakia is one of nine NATO allies involved in the alliance’s Strategic Airlift International Solution (SALIS) program that entitles members to access fixed wing, excess cargo capabilities at short notice, by calling upon Antonov AN-124-100 aircraft.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/slovakia-closing-in-on-order-for-3-c-390-transporters-says-embraer/	2024-12-11T06:31:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
Emirate’s EDGE Group marks 5th birthday, from small disruptor to Middle East heavyweight	EDGE Group shows off some unmanned aerial vehicles at the IDEX defense expo in Abu Dhabi in 2023. (Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Five years after its establishment, UAE defense conglomerate EDGE Group is celebrating its growth with what it says is an order backlog worth $12.8 billion. 'Since its inception in 2019, EDGE has expanded its product portfolio from 30 to 201 cutting-edge solutions across air, land, sea, and cyber domains — a rapid growth of more than 550% in just five years,' the company said in an announcement Monday. EDGE said that its annual revenue amounted to $4.9 billion in 2024, and it now has products in 91 countries. 'In a constantly evolving and highly competitive international defence landscape, it was almost inconceivable that a new disruptor from the UAE could, in just five years, rise so rapidly to become a global industry player punching way above its weight across multiple domains,' EDGE Chairman Faisal Al Bannai said in the statement. EDGE is a state-owned defense conglomerate with more than 25 entities dedicated to developing and producing defense solutions in all domains. The conglomerate has consolidated a number of national defense firms and struck joint ventures (JV) with international firms to boost local production and decrease reliance on — and to better compete with — Western products. 'EDGE’s footprint is reinforced by a total of 13 international acquisitions and strategic investments, including stakes in key companies such as Estonia's MILREM Robotics, Swiss unmanned helicopter manufacturer ANAVIA, Brazil's non-lethal tech leader Condor, and Brazil’s smart weapons specialist SIATT,' the statement says. 'These acquisitions, along with nine others, have enhanced EDGE’s capabilities across land, sea, air, and cyber domains, unlocking opportunities in cutting-edge sectors and strengthening its competitive edge globally.' Additionally, EDGE has entered in 23 joint ventures to expand its production and development. The lates, dubbed MAESTRAL was inked with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri in February to produce vessels in Abu Dhabi. EDGE has also expanded its presence in emerging markets in Latin America where it launched its first international office in Brazil in 2023 and bought half of the shares of Brazilian SIATT smart weapons firm that same year. Following the normalization of the relationship between the UAE and Israel, EDGE had signed an agreement with Israeli Aerospace Industries (IAI) to codevelop counter unmanned aerial systems. It then invested in Israeli firm High Lander, the provider of an unmanned air traffic management in 2023. 'The setting up of joint ventures with top international original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and the acquisitions of majority shareholdings in small- and middle-sized companies in the defense and tech sectors are at the cornerstone of EDGE’s model of business growth and expansion,' Gulf State Analytics analyst Leonardo Jacopo Maria Mazzucco told Breaking Defense. He added that through the years 'EDGE has captured larger shares of the UAE’s procurement contracts awarded at [Abu Dhabi defense conference] IDEX and generated more significant revenues from export sales.' But Mazzucco said the sprawling firm still has work to do. 'While EDGE has proved capable of bringing to bear its entrepreneurial ambitions, it needs to ensure the long-term sustainability of its investments in R&amp;D, industrial partnerships, and localization efforts in order to fully affirm itself as a truly competitive global industrial player,' he concluded.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/emirates-edge-group-marks-5th-birthday-from-small-disruptor-to-middle-east-heavyweight/	2024-12-11T04:30:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/230223_IDEX_edge_drones_Ferran.png

Mastalir, Commander of USSPACEFORINDOPAC, officiating his assumption of command during the USSPACEFORINDOPAC activation ceremony hosted by USINDOPACOM. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Anthony J. Rivera) SPACEPOWER 2024 — Not only has China's space fleet ballooned over the past decade, but Beijing is increasingly using maneuvering satellites to crisscross geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) in order to keep eyes on, and potentially do harm to, their US counterparts, according to Space Force and industry officials. Chinese satellites are 'zigzagging' from altitudes above GEO, through the belt and then to slightly lower altitudes, often coming uncomfortably close to US satellites, Clint Clark of sky-watching firm Exoanalytics said today. 'China doesn't sit still. They're all over the sky. Why are they doing this? It's because they're coming for you. In their strategy documents, they will tell you, whoever controls space controls the Earth,' he told an audience made up largely of Guardians at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando. 'They go up and down the belt. They hold everybody at risk. Periodically, they do crazy stuff. They'll get on top of a satellite,' Clark said. 'And sometimes they'll pick it up and move it away. They're practicing those tactics.' US Space Force Chief Master Sgt. Ronald Lerch said that Chinese authors have openly written about imaging the Space Force's own eyes in the heavens, the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites, and the brand new SILENTBARKER inspection satellites the service is operating jointly with the National Reconnaissance Office. China's on-orbit fleet has gone from 36 satellites in 2010 to more than 1,000 this year, he stressed. Beijing's current space fleet includes 292 electro-optical and 43 radar satellites for imaging targets on Earth, and 74 signals intelligence gathering satellites, according to a slide he presented — along with a slide showing a Chinese rendering of a GSSAP bird and a synthetic aperture radar image of the US naval base at Norfolk, Va. Also included in the fleet are the 60 satellites making up the Beidou positioning, navigation and timing constellation, Lerch said. 'So, they went from no or barely any capability in 2010 to now they have their own [reliable] GPS. 60 of them — 24 in MEO [medium Earth orbit], three in GEO, and then another three in IXO or inclined GEO, and then one backup for each individual spacecraft,' he elaborated. Beijing's growing space capabilities have meant an increase in the PLA's ability to threaten US forces both in space and on Earth, according to Space Force and industry officials here. 'Norm-shattering behaviors have been enabled because of their ability to have space and what that's able to offer,' Lerch said, noting that Chinese behavior has been 'increasingly assertive' as their space power has grown. 'Their specific goals are to be able to track and target us high value assets at the time and place of their choosing,' Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of US Space Force Indo-Pacific, told reporters. 'We're seeing all signs pointing to being able to target US aircraft carriers, as well as high value assets in the air like tankers and AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft]. This is a strategy to keep the US from intervening, and that's what their space architecture is designed for.' Clark said China for the past 10 years also has 'been practicing' space-based methods for US space capabilities, with systems for rendezvous and proximity operations; docking and capture; characterization and inspection; and counter inspection; as well as developing co-orbital and direct ascent anti-satellite weapons. 'And it's not just that they've been practicing them. They've been doing them in very specific ways, with huge delta-v's relative to what we're able to produce, and they're doing them in ways that challenge our kill chains,' he said. Mastalir said that in order for the US Space Force to counter China's increasing threat, it is important for the service to 'scale our capabilities to meet and exceed what's required in the future, because the PRC is moving. &#8230; As they continue to evolve, we must be prepared to take on those challenges.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-space-moves-highly-mobile-satellites-stalking-geo-spook-space-force/	2024-12-10T13:40:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/7526919-scaled-e1733867404835.jpg
Israel seeks to defang Syria, as 350-plus strikes destroy military sites and equipment	Air defense radar burns at Mezzeh Air Base on December 8, 2024 in Damascus, Syria. (Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images) JERUSALEM — The Israel Defense Forces have carried out more than 350 strikes in Syria since Dec. 7, as Israel seeks to dismantle the Assad regime’s arsenal before it can be taken over by the rebel forces that shockingly took control of the country over the weekend. Dubbed Operation Arrow of Bashan, the Israeli strikes included attacks from the land, sea and air. According to an IDF statement, the strikes have destroyed 'Scud missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters, radars, tanks, hangars, and more.' 'I approved the Air Force bombing of strategic military capabilities left by the Syrian military so that they will not fall into the hands of the jihadists,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Dec 10. 'We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we do intend to do what is necessary for our security.' Netanyahu compared the large-scale precision airstrikes to the British raid on French naval ships in the wake of France’s fall to the Nazis in 1940s. England wanted to prevent the Nazis using French naval ships at the time to expand the relatively small German navy. The IDF said the Israeli Navy carried out a raid on two Syrian naval facilities at the Al-Bayda and Latakia ports, targeting fifteen naval vessels. In addition 'dozens of sea-to-sea missiles with ranges of 80–190 kilometers were destroyed. Each missile carried significant explosive payloads, posing threats to civilian and military maritime vessels in the area,' the IDF said. אריאל כהנא: שרידי ספינות טילים של חיל הים הסורי בנמל טרטוס. תמונות שמהדהדות את השמדת חילות האוויר של מדינות ערב במלחמת ששת הימים pic.twitter.com/J1O0ATz3Le &mdash; זירת החדשות (@ZiratNews) December 10, 2024 The Alma Research and Education Center, which focuses on threats to northern Israel noted that in the wake of the collapse of the Assad regime 'anything from basic military equipment to advanced conventional weapons, strategic capabilities, and even unconventional weapons, such as chemical weapons,' could be taken by various groups, something the group calls 'a clear and immediate danger.' Ksenia Svetlova, a former member of Knesset and Executive Director of the NGO Ropes, also noted this sense of concern in Israel in a conversation with Breaking Defense. 'When Israel pounds Syrian military objectives, this is because of the fear it might fall into the wrong hands — and there are many wrong hands in Syria as we know,' said Svetlova. 'There are no guarantees that the new rulers of Syria will be able to maintain control or be able to prevent from military factions that with them of doing something that can jeopardize Israel’s interests.' Yaakov Katz, who wrote a book called Shadow Strike on the Israeli strike on Syria’s nuclear program in 2007 and is a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense that 'Syria has amassed significant strategic weapons over the last few decades &#8211; ballistic missiles, chemical weapons and aircraft.' He agreed with Svetlova and the Alma center that there should be real concern that these weapons might fall into the wrong hands. The IDF 'is doing it to keep Israel safe, but this is a benefit for the entire world,' Katz said. The Syrian regime historically possessed a large arsenal of both conventional and, although its chemical arsenal was officially destroyed year ago, unconventional weapons. Many of the conventional weapons are of Russian origin, including Mig-23 jets and attack helicopter, plus air defenses systems. Syria’s main military arm was its ground forces, although these were badly damaged in more than a decade of intense fighting during the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. Photos and footage posted online showed a number of the sites allegedly struck, including military airfields. Because the strikes were carried out at night, it was not always possible to confirm which strikes were Israeli strikes and which may have been other incidents. Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan who led the international terrorism team at Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee, described the strikes in a post online as a 'strategic masterstroke by Israel. In perhaps the most intensive bombing campaign in its history, Israel has destroyed the Syrian air force, air defences, navy and army assets plus defence industries and C2I.' Svetlova noted that in the wake of the strikes it was interesting to see a lack of statement from the new rulers in Damascus about the attacks. The strongest faction in Damascus today is Hayat Tahrir al Sham and its leader Mohammed el Jolani. Mohammed al-Bashir, an HTS loyalist, was appointed the new Prime Minister of Syria on Dec. 10. Ksenia said she had seen criticism online among Syrian activists about the silence in Damascus. 'Some label it and frame it as support for Israel, or even cooperation or collaboration with Israel, which is of course not true. Israel was surprised by this development just like everybody else.' She noted the strongest reactions were condemnation by Iran and Hezbollah. Turkey, Qatar and other countries have also condemned the Israeli strikes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israel-seeks-to-defang-syria-as-350-plus-strikes-destroy-military-sites-and-equipment/	2024-12-10T13:05:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/syria-air-defese-scaled-e1733864604640.jpg
In NDAA, Congress aims to move ball forward on solving drone incursion problem	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019.(Photo by Staff Sgt. Mylinda DuRousseau) EDWARDS AFB, Calif.— Congress wants more information from the Pentagon on what authorities and technologies it needs to protect military installations from the threat of drone incursions, as a spate of high-profile incidents spark concerns that adversaries could use drones to exploit weaknesses in US base security. The compromise version of the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, released on Saturday, includes several provisions aimed at improving the US military’s response to potential drone threats to its installations, including the creation of a counter-drone strategy. In addition to the mandate for the strategy — which was originally included in the Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the bill — it requires that the department conduct an assessment of the existing counter-UAS enterprise. The bill also calls for the department to provide recommendations for how to change existing policy to reduce the requirements that the Pentagon coordinate certain responses to drone incursions with other federal organizations. Other language would compel the Pentagon to create and maintain a c-UAS threat library, which would include information on counter-drone solutions and catalogue all drone incursions that occur at US military installations. 'We agree that U.S. troops have the inherent right of self defense, including from UAS attacks, wherever they may be,' the explanatory statement accompanying the bill said. At the same time, the conference version of the bill did not include a Senate provision that would require the Pentagon to provide a plan to speed up the testing, demonstration and validation of technologies needed to support the strategy. The release of the new NDAA comes just days after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed off on a classified strategy on countering unmanned systems on Dec. 2, leaving it unclear whether the Pentagon has already done enough to satisfy Congress’s mandate. The classified strategy document lays out a roadmap for near-term and future solutions for mitigating drone threats, the department said in a news release. 'A critical portion of our efforts, particularly in the near-term, comes from improving our defenses, with an emphasis on detection as well as active and passive defenses,' said an unclassified fact sheet for the strategy. 'The Department will ensure our forces and priority installations have protection.' The Pentagon has documented hundreds of drone incursions over US military installations over the past few years, US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) leaders said in October. RELATED: NORTHCOM head wants new integration role in counter-UAS ops Those include multiple incursions at Joint Base Langley Eustis in Virginia in December 2023, which involved varying numbers of drones in different sizes and configurations, the Air Force said in a statement earlier this year. As a result, F-22 stealth fighters located at the base were forced to temporarily relocate and suspend nighttime training missions, the Wall Street Journal reported in October. Another acknowledged incident involved incursions at Plant 42 in Palmdale, Calif., — an Air Force installation where tenant contractors like Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works and Northrop Grumman develop and produce experimental, classified aircraft. The location is technically a component of Edwards Air Force Base, which is located about 20 miles northeast and provides base security. An Air Force spokeswoman told the War Zone that the service had 'observed multiple UAS [uncrewed aerial systems] activities over Plant 42 during the last few months,' and worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to impose temporary flight restrictions around Plant 42. So far, the drone incursions have been limited to Plant 42 and have not projected into Edwards AFB, Brig. Gen. Doug Wickert, commander of its 412th Test Wing, told reporters during a visit to the base last week. Wickert said he 'felt very supported' in the wake of the incidents by NORTHCOM, which is taking a leading role in synchronizing counter-drone activities across the department. Edwards is currently in the process of testing and deploying several additional c-UAS systems, he said, adding that the open desert skies of the base provides an easier detection environment than more urban, congested locations like Langley AFB. While he said he has the authorities to direct security forces to take action to protect the base against drones, he acknowledged that some situations require coordination with outside organizations like the FAA. The Defense Department is making an effort to tackle the incursion problem, but it’s difficult to solve, and particularly challenging to differentiate when a drone is flying near a US installation for nefarious purposes like spying, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'Some of it is hobbyists who lose control of their drone or decide to do something stupid and fly it over a military base to just take a look and see what's over there. I mean my mother-in-law gave me one, and what do you do with it? Fly it, take off, It's got a camera on it … [so] you’re going to go look at something, going to find interesting stuff to look at,' said Kelly, who leads the Senate Armed Services airland committee. 'But some of it, I'm pretty sure, is our adversaries. Why wouldn't they?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/in-ndaa-congress-aims-to-move-ball-forward-on-solving-drone-incursion-problem/	2024-12-10T12:33:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240322_cuas_army_5816892-scaled-e1711130176663.jpg
Army Material Command head relieved of duty following investigation	Then US Army Brig. Gen. Charles Hamilton poses for a command portrait in the Army portrait studio at the Pentagon in Arlington, VA, Sept. 05, 2017. (US Army/Monica King) WASHINGTON — Army Secretary Christine Wormuth has officially relieved Army Material Command head Gen. Charles Hamilton of command following an investigation into intervening with the selecting of senior commanders, the service confirmed. 'Based on the findings of a Department of the Army Inspector General investigation, the Secretary of the Army has relieved General Charles Hamilton of command,' service spokesperson Cynthia Smith wrote in a brief statement today. Military.com first reported on the decision, and wrote up the initial investigation into the allegations that Hamilton helped secure a leadership role for a subordinate officer that has previously been deemed unfit for command. After those allegations surfaced in March, the four-star general was suspended from his post overseeing the service's global supply chain, logistics, and sustainment. The command’s deputy, Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan, then stepped in to perform the duties of his boss and is still currently at the AMC helm. Meanwhile, the Army IG office got to work conducting an investigation into just what transpired and penned its finding. While Breaking Defense has not obtained that report, Smith said it found that the Command Assessment Program (CAP) 'withstood an attempt to interfere with its process' but changes need to be made. 'Secretary Wormuth will be issuing a directive that formally establishes CAP as an enduring Army program in order to reinforce the integrity of CAP and increase transparency,' Smith wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-material-command-head-relieved-of-duty-following-investigation/	2024-12-10T12:16:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Hamilton-scaled-e1733861396459.jpg
Ships for America Act coming ‘really soon,’ says cosponsor Sen. Mark Kelly	The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and Cavour Carrier Strike Group sail in formation on Aug. 9, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Daniel Kimmelman) RNDF 2024 — Rep. Mike Waltz is set to head the White House next year as President-elect Donald Trump’s national security advisor, but the pro-shipbuilding legislation he helped helm is still very much alive and will be introduced in Congress soon, the bill’s Democratic cosponsor told Breaking Defense. 'We’re really close,' Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of Reagan National Defense Forum. 'We've made, you know, just some recent little tweaks that my potential Republican Senate co-sponsor wanted, and we're about to announce something really soon, and we'll get the legislation introduced and then start working building support for it.' Kelly and Waltz, R-Fla., had planned to introduce their 'Ships For America Act' following the November election. While Kelly will have to find another House Republican co-sponsor to replace Waltz, the latter's advocacy for shipbuilding issues could be a positive for forthcoming legislation, Kelly said in an interview Saturday. The Arizona Democrat added that there’s a 'reasonable path' to passage if the Trump administration gets behind the bill. 'I know he [Waltz] really cares about it, and having him in the White House as the National Security Advisor, in my view is a very positive thing,' Kelly said. 'I look forward to continuing to work with him when he's in the administration on this issue.' During a September event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies where Waltz and Kelly laid out their vision for the bill, the duo said that they supported the creation of a maritime czar inside the executive branch who could oversee shipbuilding issues that touch both the Defense Department and the Department of Transportation. 'We need to make it more cost effective to operate US-flagged vessels with some cargo preference,' Kelly said then. 'We need regulatory reform and some financial support to the industry, like tax credits, and then building up our shipbuilding capacity to make sure that we’re going to be able to have more US-flagged ships here at home, and then the workforce [shortage] issue. 'This legislation addresses all [of] those areas extensively,' he continued. The Ships Act codifies much of what the Navy is trying to do with its Maritime Statecraft initiative, which focuses on expanding shipbuilding capacity by strengthening the government’s relationships with industry and boosting commercial shipbuilders, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said during a speech Monday at the American Society of Naval Engineers conference. Del Toro added that the Ships Act could he introduced as early as 'the next couple of days or the next week or so.' 'But another part of the equation that … probably isn't going to be addressed directly in the Ships Act, that I think our nation needs to address is the issue of blue collar workforce in this country,' Del Toro said. 'If you care about economic security across the entire threshold, if you care about having more workers in shipyards or more workers in all our industries, you've got to pay attention to immigration, and we have a requirement in, my humble opinion, to increase legal immigration to this country. … Unemployment is really low right now, and that's part of the problem that we all face, and it's why our shipyards, both commercial and private shipyards, have been struggling the way they have.'

What ‘really’ worries the head of the Space Development Agency	Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear (R) addresses the audience at the Space Foundation's 2024 Space Symposium. (Space Foundation) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The head of the US Space Development Agency isn't really scared of a potential anti-satellite attack by an adversary, given the large number of low Earth orbit satellites being planned for the agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. Instead, Derek Tournear said he's worried about two potential problems that could undercut SDA's primary goal to enable fast as possible sensor-to-shooter connections: weak cybersecurity across the constellation and shaky supply chains. 'There are two threats out there that I am really worried about. They're common mode failure threats,' Tournear said during a panel discussion during the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. 'Number one is cyber. If we have a cyber vulnerability. It doesn't matter whether I have two satellites or 2,000 satellites, we could be vulnerable to that. So it is a big deal. We take a lot of protections against that,' he said. 'The second one is, is supply chain — the ability to actually produce these satellites at scale — and then supply chain interdiction.' He explained that becuse of SDA's networked architecture, the agency needs to have 'assurance for the providence' of all the 'parts and pieces' that go into each one of the satellites being developed by different providers. The question of the provenance isn't only applicable to hardware, he stressed, but is also a critical question for software. '[We] also need a robust industrial base that can create software, test software, get the software ready to go and build that capability up right now,' Tournear elaborated. 'Our industrial base relies a lot on on foreign entities to write our software. It's one of the things that we've kind of said we were worried about that at the Space Development Agency. We want our flight software and our satellites to be written in the US, because that's one of the supply chain interdiction things that I'm worried about. So that's been a bottleneck.' Another key issue is the current fragility of the defense supply chain that Tournear said 'is always going to be a problem' and 'always going to cause delays.' SDA experienced delays in launching its initial prototype satellites due to supply chain woes during the COVID-19 pandemic, with resistors being a key problem, he noted. Further, the planned launch of its first operational set of data relay and missile tracking satellites, called Tranche 1, has been set back by about seven months to the spring of 2025 due to another supply chain problem — this time involving optical communications terminals needed to create satellite-to-satellite links. Gen. Michael Guetlein, Space Force vice chief, told the Reagan Forum panel that while SDA is 'the canary in the coal mine' with regard to supply chain woes, the problem is more widespread. James Taiclet, Lockheed Martin's CEO, chimed in that solid rocket motors are yet another commodity where there are only a couple of suppliers — to the point where the Defense Department weighed in with investment last year to bolster production. Guetlein explained that the defense supply chain issue is systemic, due to general industry push in recent decades for 'efficiency.' 'We have spent decades optimizing our industrial base for efficiency and consolidating, and we are single suppliers deep across multiple different fronts,' he said. 'We're going to have to start getting comfortable with lack of efficiency in the industrial base to start getting excess capacity so that we have something to go to in times of crisis or conflict. 'These challenges are significant, and we need to figure out how to get after them,' Guetlein said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/what-really-worries-the-head-of-the-space-development-agency/	2024-12-10T09:27:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240411_space_symposium_tournear_space_foundation-e1712859283861.jpg
What to know about what’s in the compromise NDAA	The early morning sun strikes the U.S. Capitol November 6, 2006 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Congress’s compromise fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act language, released Saturday, kept within the budget cap topline, which means there were few major movements compared to what had been requested from the Pentagon earlier this year. According to numbers compiled by Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners, the compromise language increases overall procurement and R&amp;E funding by roughly $2 billion over the Pentagon’s FY25 request. Army procurement is roughly equal, Navy procurement is down about $500 million, and the Air Force is up around $800 million. The House plans to vote on the bill on Thursday. But the NDAA Is primarily a policy bill, not, as any Congressional appropriator would be quick to tell you, the final funding bill for the military. As a result, a few highlights did stick out to the Breaking Defense team. Below is our roundup: The NDAA language moves to slow or block a series of retirements requested by the Air Force. While many divestments would largely be approved, the bill would reject F-15E and F-22 retirements while extending limitations on offloading the RQ-4 and C-130, according to an explanatory statement accompanying the bill. The legislation would also permit continued A-10 retirements alongside older models of the F-15 and F-16 and ensure the service maintains 16 E-3s until the radar plane can be replaced either by the forthcoming E-7 or other capabilities. Keeping with that theme, the bill would add in six F-15EXs, three C-130s — including an ski-equipped LC-130J — two C-40Bs and inject an additional $400 million for E-7 'acceleration,' which in the past has typically meant money funneled to long-lead procurement. The language also prevents the Pentagon from accepting more than 30 F-35As, nine F-35Bs and nine F-35Cs until the Secretary of Defense takes several steps to improve the program, like formulating a plan to address deficiencies identified in a recent testing report. It further calls on subcontractors to follow prime manufacturer Lockheed Martin’s lead and invest their own dollars to improve the jet, and slashes $345M from Air Force procurement for 'excess cost growth.' While cutting $102 million earmarked for the service’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) effort and $159 million from the KC-46 program, the language adds in a requirement that the Secretary of the Air Force develop a plan to establish 'air base air defense sites' at Air Force installations, as service officials fret whether their air bases can be properly defended against attacks from a peer adversary like China. The NDAA authors seem to enjoy tasking the Army with a series of reporting requirements. Among the must-dos: a requirement for the Secretary of the Army to develop and implement a 'plan for the procurement and fielding of additional kinetic effectors for low, slow, small-unmanned aircraft integrated defeat system.' Another provision requires a report on the procurement of energetic material — key components in bombs and missiles — from sources outside the US. It keeps going: There’s a mandate that the Army Secretary deliver a Black Hawk modernization report, as well as a report on the 'testing, procurement, integration, and fielding of vehicle protection systems on Army ground combat vehicles.' And finally, a reporting requirement means the Army provides an update on the service’s long-term Stryker investment plan. Lawmakers in the bill’s explanatory statement admonished Navy leadership for, what they called, a 'lack of transparency' and communication with both Capitol Hill and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. The controversy is centered on an allegation from lawmakers that service leadership negotiated a significant plan with industry to bolster the Virginia-class submarine program without informing Capitol Hill or OMB. Now, according to the statement, lawmakers are left with an expensive new supplemental funding request from the service and, they say, 'few options' that will truly resolve the problems at hand and its root causes. At the time of publication, a Navy spokesman had not yet responded to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. Related: Lawmakers admonish Navy for ‘lack of transparency’ on sub funding requests Elsewhere in the bill, Congress is poised to impose new technical and design requirements on the Constellation-class frigate and Medium Landing Ship programs before either can proceed. While the prohibitions are unlikely to halt either program, the detailed requirements reflect increased congressional interest in both endeavors. The Medium Landing Ship is a relatively new program that the Marine Corps says will be crucial to any island hopping campaign in the Indo Pacific. Constellation class is a more advanced program that has gotten the personal attention of the Navy Secretary — and numerous lawmakers — following significant delays that are already putting it years behind schedule. Lawmakers also appear to agree with the Navy’s move to delay spending for its next-gen fighter, as the bill would not alter the service’s funding request of $454 million — roughly a billion dollars less than previous projections. Asked last month about the status of FA/AX, a spokesperson said 'All we can comment on regarding this is that we have received proposals and they are being evaluated.' The biggest takeaway from Space is that the NDAA approves the Air Force’s plan to transfer Air National Guard members to full time Space Force, without seeking the approval of governors. The National Governors Association already is out protesting the move, which they describe as 'deeply concerning and breaks with more than a century of important precedent surrounding state’s rights – as well as a violation of federal law.' The NDAA also approves the creation of the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR), and gives the Air Force Secretary — and notably, not the National Reconnaissance Office — milestone authority for space-based ground moving target systems. It also elevates authority for the Contractor Watch List to Frank Calvelli, in his role as Space Acquisition Executive, and requires the Defense Secretary to designate a senior official 'to be responsible for a national integrated air and missile defense architecture for the United States.' Congress's plans to study a potential independent cyber force have been scaled back in the final NDAA language. Prior drafts of the bill called specifically for an evaluation of a separate cyber force conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine — shortened to the 'National Academies' in the bill language. However, Saturday’s compromise language was vaguer, calling only for the assessment of 'cyber organizations' instead of a separate cyber service — an important change, as advocates of a future cyber force had been hoping to hang their argument off of a report from the academies. The idea of an independent cyber force has long been a point of contention within the DoD, as the Pentagon formally requested that lawmakers shut down a legislative proposal that would mandate an independent assessment of the establishment of a separate cyber service back in September, three sources familiar with the matter told Breaking Defense at the time. The final draft language comes after Texas Republicans Rep. Pat Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell authored the amendment in a draft version of the 2025 NDAA that called for the independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. Fallon told Breaking Defense last month that the study could be cause for the upcoming administration to stand up a cyber force. 'Incumbent on the results of the commission, which I think will affirm the need for a cyber service, I believe there’s a good chance we will see [a cyber service] come to fruition in soon. The Trump administration has shown that they will not put up with the status quo, and will opt for bold action, if necessary, especially when US national security is at risk,' Fallon said.

Guam missile defenses conduct first-ever ballistic intercept	A Standard Missile-3 Block IA (SM-3 Blk IA) interceptor is launched from the USS CARL M. LEVIN (DDG 120) off the coast of Pacific Missile Range Facility in Kauai, Hawaii, as part of Vigilant Wyvern/Flight Test Aegis Weapon System-48, a joint test of the U.S. Navy Program Executive Office Integrated Warfare Systems and the Missile Defense Agency conducted October 25, 2023. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — The US military announced today the first-ever test intercept of a ballistic missile from its Guam-based missile defense system, in what a military official called a 'critical milestone' for what's seen as America's first line of defense in the case of war with China. The test just off shore from the US territory 'confirmed our ability to detect, track, and engage a target missile in flight, increasing our readiness to defend against evolving adversary threats,' Joint Task Force-Micronesia Commander Rear Adm. Greg Huffman said in a Missile Defense Agency (MDA) release. The release said that during the 'experiment,' the Aegis air defense system used a new AN/TPY-6 radar to track the target and a Vertical Launching System to fire a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA at an incoming, air-launched medium-range ballistic missile flying over the ocean near Andersen Air Force Base. 'The AN/TPY-6 radar tracked the target shortly after launch to intercept in the first end-to-end tracking use of the radar during a live ballistic missile flight test,' the Pentagon said. RELATED: Tying it together: Army eyes evolving test plan new capabilities bound for Guam The MDA described the event as a 'pivotal step' towards a larger, more holistic Guam Defense System designed to take on multiple threats at once — a 'persistent layered integrated air and missile defense capability.' According to CSIS missile defense expert Tom Karako, that will be where the rubber meets the road for an island that lies 9,000 miles from the California coast but a relatively scant 3,000 miles from mainland China. 'The defense of Guam is one of the most important and hardest missile defense development challenges underway. While these engagements are eye watering in many respects, today’s test was comparatively routine in terms of a single ballistic missile target,' he told Breaking Defense. 'The Guam Defense System will ultimately integrate multiple independent fire control systems into something that can cope with complex and integrated attacks with salvos across the air and missile threat spectrum.' RELATED: Army awards Raytheon $12 billion to begin LTAMDS production Such a robust defense would be necessary if war breaks out with China. Karako said Beijing can be expected to launch missile salvos that are 'an order of magnitude greater than what we saw in [Iran's] April 14 attack on Israel.' For several years, US military leaders from the Indo-Pacific region have emphasized the need to build up Guam as both a military staging point and an air-defense hub. However, the process hasn't been easy, and in October, the MDA proposed scaling back the number of missile defense sites on the island from 22 to 16 due to environmental impact concerns. In today's announcement MDA chief Lt. Gen. Heath Collins praised the 'tremendous group effort' and coordination between different Pentagon organizations, but the US military is still sorting out exactly who will be responsible for what when it comes to standing up the different elements of the broader, complex missile defense system on Guam. 'Not only do I have to get those individual programs across the goal line, they all have to work together,' Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army’s Program Executive Officer for Missiles and Space, said at a CSIS event in August.

3 immediate tasks for the secretary of the Navy nominee	Graduating Sailors stand in ranks during U.S. Navy Recruit Training Command's Pass in Review in Great Lakes, Illinois, Jul. 25, 2024. More than 40,000 recruits train annually at the Navy's only boot camp (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Christopher M. O'Grady) President-elect Donald Trump has recently announced his intent to nominate John Phelan to be secretary of the Navy. Phelan, a businessman with no military experience, is going to have his hands full trying to right-size a service that has been on the wrong track for almost thirty years. His lack of military experience should not be an inherent handicap in this job, because the role of the service secretary is to organize, train, and equip their respective services. But what will immediately trip him up is if he does not work right away to establish a good relationship with the legislative leaders who can make or break his plans going forward. While Phelan will be focused on the Senate Armed Services Committee because they will guide his nomination through the Senate, he should use this time to meet and engage with key members of the Senate Appropriation Committees, as well as the key committee members in the House — and come armed with near-term fixes that he needs Congress to make in order to enable him to hit the ground running. If he cannot convince Congress to act now, he will essentially spend the next year sailing in circles. Here are three areas he should ask Congress to help him out: recruiting, acquisition, and resources. Recruitment: One of the most important issues he will need to tackle are the shortfalls in manpower across the Navy. These shortfalls are so critical that failing to fix them may send the Navy into a near-term operational death-spiral, which would leave Phelan unable to meet the needs of the president should a crisis erupt. The multi-service recruiting crisis has been years in the making and therefore will likely take several years to fix. However, the incoming secretary can take a huge leap forward in fixing the problem by endorsing the House proposal to increase the pay of junior enlisted service members by 19 percent. Inflation, along with higher minimum wages and a looming demographic cliff that will result in fewer potential recruits, all point to the need for this very large pay raise. If not enacted in the 2025 NDAA, the incoming secretary will have to wait another year. Therefore, this is something Phelan should address with the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation prep. Acquisition: Phelan will need to move fast to change the acquisition paradigm of the Navy. The recent PPBE reform commission outlined key reforms that can only be implemented by the Appropriators; however, the current FY25 Appropriation bill reports contain language that essentially state that the committees will not provide additional funding flexibility. With the probable delay into March of the appropriation process, Phelan can work with the leaders of the Appropriation Committees in the Senate and House to create flexible funding lines to enable him to rapidly alter procurement within the Navy. For example, he can ask them to consolidate into one funding line the research, development, and procurement for all unmanned sea and air systems within the service. Failure to gain this flexibility will result in the secretary spending the next year fighting to align resources rather than improving the warfighting capabilities of the Navy. Resources: Perhaps the most important change he needs to ask the Congress for is to support additional time and resources for the National Commission on the Future of the Navy. As my colleague Mackenzie Eaglen has noted, Congress waited 439 days to seat the eight commissioners. Having the NDAA extend the commissions timeline and funding will be critically important as this Commission will need to work closely with the incoming secretary to align on the strategic shift for the Navy and more importantly, the decade-long resources needed to accomplish fix the Navy. If Phelan attempts to implement his strategic pivot alone, he will be forever inviting alternative plans from the Joint Staff, OSD, OMB, Defense Industry, and Congress. If, however, his plan for reforming the Navy aligns with the Commission, a strong case can be made that the plan will outlive Phelan’s tenure. During normal times, it is sage advice that the nominee should speak sparsely and get confirmed. These however, are not normal times. The Navy is broken, the President wants to disrupt the status quo, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are leading a government reform effort, and China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are actively fighting proxy wars with the United States. Phelan needs help from Congress, help that cannot wait until next year. He ought to walk in and ask for the pay raise for junior enlisted, acquisition flexibility from the appropriators, and an extension to the timeline for the National Commission on the Future of the Navy.

With first test fire, Aussies joins tiny Tomahawk club with US, UK	HMAS Brisbane fires a Tomahawk cruise from Hobart-class HMS Brisband off of the coast of San Diego. (ADF POIS Craig Walton) SYDNEY — Australia has joined the US and UK as one of the tiny club of countries that can launch the Tomahawk cruise missile, with its legendary accuracy and range of more than 2,500 kilometers. The Royal Australian Navy test fired the weapon for the first time from HMAS Brisbane, the second of three Hobart-class destroyers, during a test and evaluation event 'off the west coast of the United States,' according to a statement issued today. Defense Minister Richard Marles said the first Tomahawk firing 'demonstrates the strength of our alliance and defense cooperation with the United States, in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous region.' Canberra is investing $1.3 billion AUD ($830 million USD) to buy 'more than' 200 cruise missiles, which the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said is being 'introduced into service several years faster than originally planned.' They will be fired from Hobart-class destroyers, Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines and, possibly, the Hunter-class frigates. 'This Tomahawk firing follows the firings of the Naval Strike Missile and Standard Missile 6 earlier this year and is a practical demonstration of the speed at which the Albanese Government is delivering on its commitment to enhance the lethality of Navy’s surface combatant fleet,' added the MoD. 'The Tomahawk is the jewel in the crown and a step change in our firepower, deterrence and ability to strike land-based targets at ranges never before available to the Royal Australian Navy,' Pat Conroy, minister for defense procurement said in the MoD statement. 'This is about keeping Australians safe. But in conjunction with our other investments in long-range strike, as well as the decision to manufacture NSM in Australia, it’s also about delivering more jobs and a safer future made in Australia.' The US State Department notified Congress of the potential sale of Tomahawks to Australia in March 2023, at the time saying Canberra was interested in 200 Block V All Up Rounds, as well as 'up to' 20 Block IV versions. The sale includes the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) and the Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC). In keeping with most FMS sale, it will also include extensive support, including unscheduled missile maintenance; spare parts; training; communication equipment and operational flight test. The estimated total cost then was $895 million. Marles made clear that the cruise missile is being bought to deter countries that may pose a threat to Australia. 'By enhancing our own defense capabilities, and by working with partners, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor so that no state will ever conclude the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks,' he said. Following Australia, Japan plans to buy twice as many Tomahawks — 400 missiles, including 200 Block IV and 200 Block V — as well as 14 control systems, plus software, hardware, training and other add-ons. The cost for that program is estimated to be $2.4 billion.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/with-first-test-fire-aussies-joins-tiny-tomahawk-club-with-us-uk/	2024-12-10T06:10:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/20241203ran8611998_0235-scaled.jpeg
‘Eroding readiness’: US Coast Guard Commandant warns of looming crisis	The icebreaker USCGC Healy (WAGB 20) keeps station while conducting crane operations alongside a multi-year ice floe for a science evolution in the Beaufort Sea, Aug. 9, 2023. (US Coast Guard/ Petty Officer 3rd Class Briana Carter) RNDF 2024 — A multi-billion shortfall in operation and maintenance coffers is hampering US Coast Guard operations with a steep cliff looming on the horizon, according to Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan. 'I can feel it out there, but I don't know what that tipping point is where there's been some really profound sort of budget shortfall risk that we need to work to address,' Fagan told Breaking Defense Saturday on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. The four-star admiral estimated that her service funding really needs to grow from $13 billion up towards the $20 billion range, and that right now it could 'ingest' $3 billion for operation and maintenance accounts to keep helicopters in the air and vessels mission ready. That additional $3 billion, Fagan added, could be used to shore up infrastructure, buy additional parts, maintenance, and for command, control, communication, computer, cyber and intelligence (C5I) initiatives. As the service under the Department of Homeland Security umbrella moves to purchase and field new vessels, she said it's becoming increasingly challenging to keep the assets it has up and running. Part of that problem revolves around a part shortage requiring the USCG to regularly pilfer parts from three or four ships just to fix one. 'On the large ships, we've normalized taking good parts,' Fagan added. 'When a ship comes in from patrol, you take the good part off, you put it on the ship across the pier, so that that ship can get underway. We call it controlled parts exchanges. That's not okay that we don't have enough parts &#8230; and we're deferring on dry docks. That will all begin to compound for more costs, not less, and it is eroding readiness.' For example, in 2023 alone the service experienced a 200 percent increase in cannibalizing navigation and mission sensors, and there isn’t an end in sight. In fiscal 2025, a projected funding shortfall will mean the service is only able to do about half of its planned maintenance and inventory requirements. That burgeoning crisis, she explained, has already prevented the USCG from meeting its commitments — including to the Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) South — because too many ships are undergoing unplanned maintenance, and there are not enough helicopters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/eroding-readiness-uscg-commandant-warns-of-looming-readiness-crisis/	2024-12-09T13:22:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240711_DVIDS_icebreaker_7966479-scaled-e1720703191686.jpg
Lawmakers admonish Navy for ‘lack of transparency’ on sub funding requests	The Virginia-class attack submarine Pre-Commissioning Unit Minnesota (SSN 783) pulls pierside at Naval Station Norfolk from a scheduled underway. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Alex R. Forster/Released) WASHINGTON — Lawmakers are rebuking the Navy for negotiating a plan with industry to bolster the Virginia-class submarine program's industrial base without, they say, informing either Capitol Hill or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), potentially putting in jeopardy the service’s recent supplemental funding request. 'We are concerned with the lack of transparency that has occurred between the Navy and Congress over the last 18 months,' lawmakers wrote in an explanatory statement accompanying a compromise version of the next defense policy bill published over the weekend. 'The Navy negotiated a funding strategy with industry that would have addressed cost growth, future cost to complete, workforce wage increases and infrastructure investments at both shipyards,' the statement continues, referring to General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding, where Virginias are produced. 'The Navy did this in isolation and failed to not only inform Congress but also the Office of Management and Budget.' The statement goes on to reference the Navy’s $5.7 billion supplemental funding request to address shortfalls in the program that the OMB sent to lawmakers last month. That plan 'will require an undisclosed amount of additional appropriations above the future years’ estimates in the president’s budget for fiscal year 2025,' according to the explanatory statement. Lawmakers said the Navy failed to alert them to the 'large cost growth' on the submarines in question, and the service’s 'lack of communication' leaves 'Congress with few options to address this situation and likely none that will rectify it going forward.' Breaking Defense has reached out to the Navy for comment. As it is, the compromise NDAA language authorizes $3.9 billion for Virginia-class program procurement, $357 million above the president's budget request. That money will need to be matched by congressional appropriators before it makes it to the Navy. The statement’s inclusion in the explanatory text means it has the backing of both chambers of Congress and defense-oriented lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — a veritable warning shot across the bow for Navy brass who remain in place when the new administration takes power in January. It comes just weeks after OMB sent an emergency supplemental to lawmakers that would shore up the production for three Virginia-class submarines, as well as provide authorities to keep the Columbia-class submarine program on track in the event of a continuing resolution. 'Our Virginia-class fast attack submarine program is not where it needs to be right now. The program and the shipyards are not producing submarines at the rate that our national security strategy and the national defense strategy require,' a senior Navy official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters at the time. Additionally, that funding would be used to boost wages at General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lawmakers-admonish-navy-for-lack-of-transparency-on-sub-funding-requests/	2024-12-09T11:35:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/960845-1-e1717099304303.jpg
Sen. Deb Fischer on nuclear modernization, hopes for defense under Trump and Ukraine [VIDEO]	RNDF 2024 — Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on strategic forces and a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations committee. As a result, she is seen as a key advocate for defense on the Hill, particularly for nuclear modernization. In this exclusive one-on-one with Breaking Defense's Valerie Insinna, Fischer walks through the status of Pete Hegseth, Trump's defense secretary nominee; what she hopes to see on the nuclear modernization front under the Trump administration; and what the future of Ukraine might look like. One note: This interview was conducted hours before the National Defense Authorization Act was released, so the question about what the topline will look like has obviously been answered — we now know it conforms to the budget caps, a lower number than Senate leaders had wanted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/sen-deb-fischer-on-nuclear-modernization-hopes-for-defense-under-trump-and-ukraine-video/	2024-12-09T10:45:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/deb-fischer-scaled-e1733764088511.jpg
V-22 fleet operations restricted following new incident	A CV-22 Osprey assigned to the 21st Special Operations Squadron takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Jan. 8, 2021, during a training mission. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is once again pausing operations of the troubled V-22 Osprey after a recent incident involving an Air Force variant of the tri-service tiltrotor, officials confirmed to Breaking Defense today. In a statement, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) said that '[o]ut of an abundance of caution, NAVAIR recommended an operational pause for all V-22 Osprey variants Dec. 6, 2024' following a 'precautionary landing of a CV-22' that caused no injuries. 'The safety of our V-22 aircrew is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring our Sailors, Airmen and Marines are able to successfully complete their missions and return home safely,' NAVAIR said. The Associated Press first reported the pause. Osprey variants include the Air Force’s CV-22, the Marine Corps’ MV-22 and the Navy’s CMV-22B. NAVAIR hosts the lead program office for the V-22 across all fleets, though the individual services all make their own decisions for how to operate the Osprey. This is the latest in a series of issues that have plagued the V-22 over the last two years. In August 2022, Breaking Defense first reported that the Air Force was grounding its CV-22 fleet over safety concerns with the clutch of the aircraft. At the time, the Marine Corps did not follow suit, instead insisting their pilots could compensate for the issue and had been doing so for some time. While the Air Force returned to flight weeks later, the issue re-emerged and a Pentagon-wide grounding across a 'subset' of the Navy, Air Force and Marine V-22 models was instituted in February 2023. That was followed by a November 2023 crash off the coast of Japan that killed 8 airmen, with the Osprey only returning to operations months later. In a statement to Breaking Defense today, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the Air Force component that operates the CV-22, confirmed that its Osprey operations would be paused after AFSOC Commander Lt. Gen. Michael Conley ordered it for 'all CV-22 flight training operations.' The pause 'allows time and space for us to understand what happened in the most recent event before we accept risk with unknown variables,' according to AFSOC. A spokesperson for AFSOC said an initial investigation showed a 'material failure' precipitated the recent incident, which the Associated Press reported occurred in November. The spokesperson additionally clarified that for AFSOC V-22s, the pause falls short of a full grounding, as restricted flight operations may be permitted under certain circumstances. Representatives for the Navy and Marine Corps did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding the status of their Osprey fleets, though the AP reported the Navy is adhering to the pause. The Osprey is jointly manufactured by Bell and Boeing. Bell did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Boeing referred inquiries to the Pentagon. Ashley Roque and Valerie Insinna contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/v-22-fleet-operations-restricted-following-new-incident/	2024-12-09T09:26:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/cv22_2-scaled.jpg
UK joins US-Bahraini security agreement, as officials push for it to spread further	HMS Penzance leads HMS Shoreham out of Mina Salman Port in Bahrain whilst deployed on Op KIPION on Feb. 1, 2021. (UK MOD) BEIRUT — The United Kingdom has officially become the third member of a security framework with the United States and Bahrain, in what a top Bahraini official said was a step towards a broader 'multilateral framework' of nations 'with an equal interest in delivering stability and prosperity' to the Middle East. 'It is in this context that we will see the United Kingdom being formally invited by the Kingdom of Bahrain and the United States of America to become C-SIPA’s third member this weekend,' Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani told the audience at the Manama Dialogue on Friday, referring to the Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement. The UK parliamentary under-secretary of state for Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hamish Falconer, said on Saturday, 'Only together can we find ways to bring peace and stability to the region. 'That is why, earlier today [Saturday], alongside Bahrain and the US, I was pleased to celebrate the UK's decision to join the showing our resolve to work even more closely with partners in the region to contribute to stability and prosperity,' he said. Falconer said he hoped that the agreement 'will encourage others in the region and beyond' to keep working together toward such goals. C-SIPA was first signed on September 2023 in Washington as a cooperation framework between US and Bahrain. The agreement was relatively short on specifics, but mandated regular meetings and consultations on defense; deeper military, economic and tech ties; and an emphasis on deterring outside aggression, according to a State Department fact sheet. The agreement 'supports the goals of, but is distinct from' other security cooperation agreements like the Abraham Accords, the governments said. The UK's new participation is 'a major step forward in fostering broader regional security integration, bolstering mutual deterrence against external threats, and expanding cooperation in the fields of commerce, science, and technology with like-minded states in support of peace and prosperity in the Middle East,' the State Department said. Bahrain-based strategic expert and political researcher Abdullah Al Junaid told Breaking Defense that the agreement appears to build on significant UK security investments in Bahrain already. Britain has had a permanent naval presence there since 2016, and Bahrain serves as the headquarters of the Gulf Cooperation Council's Combined Maritime Forces, of which the UK is one of 46 members, he noted. 'The agreement will definitely represent a new security framework, and it could aid in fostering a wider or even serves as regional model,' Al Junaid said. Elsewhere at the event, a top Canadian official announced that Ottawa also signed a defense cooperation agreement during the Manama Dialogue, but it was unclear how that agreement relates to C-SIPA. The new arrangements came just days before the Middle East was rocked by the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The leader's departure sparked hope for many Syrians but also concern among officials in the region and in Washington about the potential for spiraling violence in the region and a resurgence of extremist groups like ISIS.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/uk-joins-us-bahraini-security-agreement-as-officials-push-for-it-to-spread-further/	2024-12-09T09:05:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241209_uk_ships_bahrain_UKMO-scaled-e1733763475719.jpg
ULA expects to be certified for national security launch ‘momentarily’	ULA’s first Vulcan rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex-41 at 2:18 a.m. EST on January 8, 2024.(Photo: United Launch Alliance) SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — United Launch Alliance (ULA) expects to gain Space Force certification for national security payloads within a few months, company CEO Tory Bruno told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. Speaking in California, Bruno said he expects certification 'momentarily,' though he noted that '’momentarily,’ in our world, that means this month, next month, next few months.' He added that no further testing of the Vulcan Centaur will be needed to meet certification, saying the company has met all the requirements from the Pentagon. Two well-executed launches are requisite to achieve certification for carrying payloads under the Space Force's National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. A January launch was deemed a success, but there was an anomaly during the second flight in October with one of Vulcan’s solid rocket boosters that currently is under investigation. Bruno also expressed confidence that ULA would meet two manifested launches scheduled for early next year for NSSL. Overall, he said, the company has 20 launches manifested for 2025, with 16 Vulcan rockets stored away for use, and no worries that production won’t be able to keep up with demand. The company also has 43 of the Blue Origin BE-4 engines tucked away; current production on those engines is one per week, with two needed to launch the Vulcan, the ULA boss said. While Bruno said he would love to one day have production at a higher rate, he stressed that the current pace is enough for ULA’s current needs. Looking forward, Bruno said he hopes to have 20-30 Vulcan launches a year, about 'half' of which would be for national security. He noted that 'When I got to ULA, I think we were less than a quarter commercial, and the rest was government, and now it's nicely balanced, half and half between the two markets…. It’s healthier.' Bruno declined to comment on reports that ULA is on the market. And while ULA is a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the executive said that the current troubles at Boeing — including plans to lay off 10 percent of the workforce — are not impacting the rocket firm, which operates independently. ULA’s largest competitor for military space launch is the Elon Musk-backed SpaceX, and the two companies have a rivalry dating back a decade to when Musk was the upstart trying to break what he described as a 'monopoly' on Pentagon launches. Now, Musk is in the lead, and is poised to have an outsized impact on the incoming Trump administration, both as an unofficial advisor and through his role with the DOGE government efficiency effort. Asked about concerns that Musk could influence ULA’s business prospects, Bruno said that 'It is great that the administration has a real focus on space, because I think it's vitally important to our national security, and I think that that [Musk] will help with that, and help keep a focus there. 'I don't know what he will do. I'll just reiterate that this is not the time when it would be healthy in the market or good for the government to have a monopoly in any of this stuff. There's plenty of work. There's multiple providers. That's the best place for the country to be. I hope he understands that as well.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ula-expects-to-be-certified-for-national-security-launch-momentarily/	2024-12-09T07:00:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/ULA-Vulcan-Certification-Flight_010824-e1704739766586.jpg
Anduril self-funds robot submarine testing to court US customers	Anduril's Dive-XL (Anduril) COSTA MESA, Calif. — Anduril is putting a new autonomous submarine known as Dive-XL through endurance runs off the coast of California, as it seeks to tap into what company executives tell Breaking Defense they see as a growing commitment from the Pentagon to use unmanned underwater vehicles. The first test vehicle — a non-missionized version of the Ghost Shark robotic submarine in development for the Royal Australian Navy — recently wrapped up a voyage where it spent 100 hours underway, a precursor to an upcoming demonstration where the Dive-XL will complete a mission in excess of 1,000 nautical miles while fully submerged. 'That's in the coming months — weeks, if you will. And that'll be the longest that we believe anyone's really done,' Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for programs and engineering, said during an interview at the company’s headquarters in Costa Mesa, Calif. So far, the tests around the California coast has allowed Anduril to pick up valuable data that will allow it to optimize Dive XL to operate in diverse undersea environments, where undersea terrain and water salinity could have an impact on performance, Arnott said. 'The coast here is kind of like the Grand Canyon of subsea,' he said. 'It is wild off California. Some of the terrain, it's like Star Wars.' Dive-XL is conceived as a modular uncrewed undersea vehicle (UUV) that can be purchased by both government and commercial customers and outfitted with payloads to serve various missions, whether that’s inspecting offshore oil rigs for energy companies or helping potential military users hunt down enemy submarines. A few sections of the vehicle are standard no matter the customer, including a nose section packed with avionics and sensing equipment that allows for autonomous movement, a tail containing the drive propulsor and a mast on top with communications gear such as acoustic and radio frequency systems. The middle portion of the vehicle, however, can be customized by the customer to house whatever payload they need, and can be configured either as a single extra-large container or up to three smaller ones. The smallest version of the Dive-XL can be housed in a 40 foot shipping container, which allows for it to be transported on roads or via a C-17 cargo plane, Arnott said. From there, it can be made bigger by adding additional payload compartments that stretch the size of the vessel, which Arnott said can be bolted on in a matter of hours. Anduril self-funded the construction of the first Dive-XL, as well as the ongoing demonstrations, due to growing confidence in a US market for the drone, including with the US Navy as a potential customer, executives said. 'We literally had to go to Australia to find an excited customer in 2022 who wanted to do this work,' said Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose in an interview on the sidelines of Reagan National Defense Forum on Saturday. 'At the time, the belief was that the United States was not that partner yet, but if we showed them a different way to do this, you know, they might be a partner in the near future.' Although the Navy has shown interest in underwater drones for years through programs like the canceled Snakehead large displacement UUV, industry has struggled to build affordable vehicles capable of autonomously performing missions while withstanding the harsh deep sea environment, leaving some of those efforts to wither on the vine, Brose said. 'They haven't generated a lot of systems that sailors can take out on and under the water and really begin to operate and start to understand capabilities and limitations, experiment with new ways of using them [and] beginning to build out how would we man units to operate these systems,' he said. One opportunity to break into the US market could arrive through a provision in the newly-released National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2025, which requires the Navy to conduct a competitive demonstration of extra large and large UUVs. The bill is set to be taken up by the House this week. 'I think that people are starting to realize that these technologies are available and I think that what we have been able to do with the Australian navy has begun to make believers,' Brose said, adding that the Navy will likely need a mix of capabilities to meet the threat. 'We're not trying to get the Navy or US government or anybody to pick us as the sole winner always and forever,' he said. 'We would like to be part of the winner's circle.' One extra-large UUV already in the hands of the Navy is Boeing’s Orca, which was delivered to the service last year. Lessons learned from testing that prototype will inform the development and build of five additional Orca production vehicles, the service said in December 2023. The construction of the first unit, known as XLE-1, is complete, and it is expected to be delivered in early 2025, the service said this month. 'Orca, and other platforms like her, are an important step forward as we drive towards our future hybrid fleet, which is going be composed of manned and unmanned platforms,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said in a statement after touring Boeing’s Orca manufacturing facility in Long Beach, Calif., on Dec. 6. Cost could be a deciding factor for whether the Dive XL finds a home with the Navy, as questions about price continue to dog unmanned programs. Arnott declined to give specifics on the price point for the Dive XL but said it would be available for a fraction of the price of other extra-large UUVs under development. RELATED: Top senators urge Navy to change course on large USV program 'Other companies building XLs are taking a different approach than us that are perhaps a bit more exotic in the capabilities. … They're fundamentally much, much more expensive. A lot of it came down to the philosophy,' he said. 'The problem is about numbers. … If we're going to be effective as the West against what China's doing, we need this many, and it’s a lot.' One advantage to the Dive XL’s design is that it is electric powered, which means that it does not need to surface to allow a diesel engine to 'breathe' and get the air necessary to function, Arnott said. It’s also 'free-flooded with all the electronics housed in protective containers — meaning water can freely flow inside the vessel, as opposed to having pressurized compartments — which helps drive down cost and complexity, he said. Anduril is establishing a 100,000 square foot manufacturing plant in Quonset Point, R.I., that would take on commercial and US government orders and produce up to 'dozens' of Dive XLs annually, the company said in a news release. RELATED: Anduril's Aussie drone sub &#8216;one year early and on budget,' heads to production Meanwhile, work also continues at a separate facility in Australia on the Australian navy’s Ghost Shark vehicles. The second of three Ghost Sharks ordered as part of the research and development program is currently under production, Arnott said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/anduril-self-funds-robot-submarine-testing-to-court-us-customers/	2024-12-09T05:00:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/2024-DiveXL-Hero-3-scaled-e1733708794177.jpg
Rounding up the big themes from the Reagan Defense Forum [VIDEO]	RNDF 2024 — Every year, the defense community performs a magic trick: lifting the Pentagon up from Virginia and transporting it to the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., for the annual Reagan National Defense Forum. Ok, maybe the Pentagon stays physically still, but it sure does feel like a majority of the key players from DoD, Congress and industry decamp for the weekend to California. The result: Some of the best, and often times more honest, conversations around defense and national security issues.

Islamist-led rebels captured the central Syrian city of Hama on December 5, days after seizing the country's commercial hub Aleppo in a lightning offensive against President Bashar al-Assad's forces. (OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT and WASHINGTON — As shockwaves from the sudden downfall of the Syrian regime reverberate throughout the Middle East and around the world, government officials in the region and in Washington appear to be taking a hopeful but cautious approach as they weigh what might come next. 'It's really &#8216;wait and see,'' Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the president of the United Arab Emirates, said at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, adding that 'ultimately salvaging the situation' would mean Syria emerges as a 'credible nation-state.' After over a decade of civil war, the end of Assad's regime came shockingly quickly. In just a few weeks, rebel forces swept through the country, and on Sunday morning local time captured Damascus. Per a Russian government statement, Assad had fled the country, and Syrian officials remaining inside the country have issued statements announcing they will work with the victorious forces to develop a new Syrian government. Gargash emphasized that 'it's still a very tense and difficult time in the region,' adding that sudden collapse of the Assad regime 'is a clear indication of political failure, and the destructive nature of conflict and chaos.' (Gargash also reportedly said he didn't know if deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, whose location is unknown, had fled to the UAE.) Gargash said the UAE was concerned about the future of Syria's territorial integrity, about more broadly 'getting out of this spiral of chaos and violence' since the Arab Spring in 2011, and about the potential rise of extremism in the power vacuum left behind. Saudi Arabia, the most powerful Sunni-dominated nation in the region, said in a statement that it 'expresses its satisfaction with the positive steps that have been taken to ensure the safety of the brotherly Syrian people, stopping the bloodshed, and preserving the institutions and capabilities of the Syrian state.' Qatar announced today that it is 'closely monitoring the developments in Syria, and underscores the necessity of preserving national institutions and the unity of the state to prevent it from descending into chaos,' according to a statement by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Qataris called 'upon all parties to engage in dialogue to safeguard the lives of the citizens, protect the national institutions of the state, and ensure a better future for the brotherly Syrian people and fulfill their aspirations for development, stability, and justice. Furthermore, the Ministry affirms Qatar's unwavering support for the Syrian people and their choices.' The ministry of foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain called upon all parties and components of the Syrian people to 'give priority to the best interests of the country and citizens, and to preserve the state’s public institutions and the safety of its vital and economic facilities.' A senior Turkish official, likewise, reportedly said the international community must help the Syrian people rebuild the nation, and keep extremists at bay. The caution was reflected among US officials as well. At the Manama event, Daniel Shapiro, the deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, said that 'no one should shed any tears over the end of the Assad regime' and said it was the 'direct result' of Assad's 'ongoing atrocities.' But he called on all parties in Syria 'to protect civilians, particularly those from Syria's minority communities, to respect international humanitarian norms and to work to achieve a resolution through an inclusive political settlement, consistent with UN Security Council at Resolution 2254.' Shapiro said the US will maintain its presence in eastern Syria, and 'as we watch developments in Syria change by the minute, we will continue to consult closely with regional partners who are affected by this crisis to support their security needs. Our commitment to them remains stronger than ever.' Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum the day before Assad's government collapsed, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the regime had been left 'naked' and unprotected by its usual backers: Iran, the armed Lebanese group Hezbollah, and Russia — all of whom have themselves been dramatically weakened by other conflicts. The US, however, has long been concerned about what happens next, and whether extremists could take advantage of the power vacuum. ISIS, for instance, was already attempting to 'reconstitute' itself in the Syrian desert. 'We are going to take steps ourselves directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to make sure that does not happen,' he said. Beyond containing ISIS, Sullivan said the US would work to protect allies in the region, like Israel and Jordan, from a spillover of violence and would do what it could to head of any humanitarian crisis that followed the change of power.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/wait-and-see-as-syrian-regime-falls-middle-east-and-us-officials-watch-warily-for-what-comes-next/	2024-12-08T09:52:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/assad-down-e1733680280194.jpg
$895.2 billion compromise NDAA released, sliding under Fiscal Responsibility Act cap levels	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) RNDF 2024 — The House and Senate today released their compromise version of the National Defense Authorization Act, with a $895.2 billion topline. The newly revealed topline means the NDAA will come in under the congressionally mandated budget caps imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), despite a push in the Senate to go over that number. The Senate had approved a total of $878.4 billion for the Defense Department and $33.4 billion for defense-related activities in the Department of Energy. When combined with an estimated $11.5 billion in non-NDAA defense activities, the total national defense topline sought by the SASC was $923.3 billion — blowing past the $895.2 billion defense bspending cap imposed by the FRA by a significant margin that staffers previously put in the range of $25 billion. In contrast, the House version put forth $883.7 billion, including $849.8 billion for the Pentagon, in numbers designed to squeeze under the FRA topline. Of course, the NDAA is the defense policy bill, not a funding bill. The ultimate topline will be decided by appropriators, and it is unclear when that will come. The expectation among attendees at this year's Reagan National Defense Forum is that the continuing resolution funding the government, which expires on Dec. 20, will be extended to March.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/895-2-billion-compromise-ndaa-released-sliding-under-fiscal-responsibility-act-cap-levels/	2024-12-07T16:17:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/congress_building-scaled-e1711030694393.jpg
Wilkie: ‘No reason’ not to seek Japanese help for ship repair work	The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), front, passes the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush (CVN 77) as it departs Norfolk Naval Shipyard after completing a 10-month regularly scheduled extended carrier incremental availability. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Steven Edgar) RNDF 2024 — The Pentagon should seek aid from the United States' allies in Asia for overseas ship repair and maintenance, given the American fleet's requirements and lacking capabilities at home, a senior official on President-elect Donald Trump's transition team said today. 'I think given the scope and the breadth of the Chinese threat — and I mentioned this earlier about knocking down some old Cold War barriers to cooperation — there's absolutely &#8230; no reason why we shouldn't be in shipyards in Japan for repairs, looking to expand that capability,' Wilkie said. Wilkie, who said several times throughout the event that he was not attending in his capacity on the transition team, added that the United States should also seek aid from Sweden for 'their ability to build icebreakers,' without mentioning the trilateral pact President Joe Biden announced several months ago with Canada and Finland, dubbed ICE Pact, which is focused on just that. Wilkie's idea — to outsource US Navy ship repair and maintenance requirements to foreign shipyards — is not new, but it is contentious on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers, particularly those lawmakers who represent constituents who work in American shipyards, are fiercely protective of the lost jobs associated with allowing ships to be serviced in foreign yards. Discussions of outsourcing work also trigger backlash from labor unions, as it did earlier this year when Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro floated such a plan.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/wilkie-no-reason-not-to-seek-japanese-help-for-ship-repair-work/	2024-12-07T14:23:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/210512-N-LX838-1230-scaled-e1659707922643.jpg
Austin announces $1B in new Ukraine aid, warns against abandoning Kyiv	Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin conducts a press briefing at NATO headquarters, Brussels, Belgium, June 16, 2023. (US Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders) RNDF 2024 — With major question marks lingering about the incoming Trump administration's strategy for Ukraine, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used his last speech at the annual Reagan National Defense Forum event to tout the importance of Kyiv’s success and unveil a new weapons package. 'This administration has made its choice. So has a bipartisan coalition in Congress,' Austin told an audience today at the defense gathering. 'The next administration must make its own choice. But from this library, from this podium, I am confident that President [Ronald] Reagan would have stood on the side of Ukraine, American security, and human freedom.' There is much speculation about President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to support Kyiv, as he has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past and on the campaign trail called to end the war quickly. That uncertainty has NATO members bracing for uncertainty over how Trump will approach the Ukraine war and if he could force a peace deal that would benefit Putin long term. (Hours before Austin's speech, Trump was in Paris and met with Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelenskyy.) Since the election, the Biden administration has rushed to provide as much aid as possible to Ukraine, including an announcement from Austin today of a new $1 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package with more drones, rockets and sustainment assistance. 'We understand that Putin’s assault on Ukraine is a warning. As I said in October in Kyiv, we are seeing ‘a sneak preview of a world built by tyrants and thugs — a chaotic, violent world carved into spheres of influence; a world where bullies trample their smaller neighbors; and a world where aggressors force free people to live in fear,’' Austin said in prepared remarks. 'So, we can continue to stand up to the Kremlin,' Austin added. 'Or we can let Putin have his way — and condemn our children and grandchildren to live in a world of chaos and conflict.' With concerns about Trump's plans permeating European capitals, there is a sense that NATO nations are scrambling to ensure Ukraine's survival. But they're having to be circumspect about it. Just two weeks ago at the annual Halifax International Security Forum, European defense leaders opted out of the doom and gloom scenario of Trump abandoning Ukraine or NATO itself, instead putting on a brave face when the topic was repeatedly broached. Tobias Lindner — Germany’s Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office and the Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation with the US — declined to offer up a 'self-fulfilling prophecy' that could hamper Ukraine. 'My prediction would be that any precondition to any agreement from the Ukrainian side would at least include security guarantees and a mechanism on accountability, both on war crimes as well as in reconstruction and on security guarantees,' Linder said. From his vantage point, the Netherlands Chief of Defence Gen. Onno Eichelsheim said other NATO members need to prepare to 'fill in the gaps' if Washington pulls back its support from Ukraine and the alliance. 'It is, once again, our continent. So, it's our safety first, and that's why, that's what we have to take into account, European nations, what we have to do, how we're going to deal with this,' he told Breaking Defense during an interview on the sidelines of the Halifax forum on Nov. 23. 'The US has been the best partner in this forever. So, I hope it will continue like this. But if not, then we have to have the discussion in Europe, how to pick it up.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/austin-announces-1b-in-new-ukraine-aid-warns-against-abandoning-kyiv/	2024-12-07T13:56:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/austin3-scaled-e1707770033173.jpg
Trump’s threat to abandon CHIPS Act ‘horrific idea’ Raimundo says	Gina M. Raimondo, United States Secretary of Commerce, speaks onstage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 19, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) RNDF 2024 — President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to abandon the CHIPS Act would be a 'horrific,' 'reckless' act that would only benefit China, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo warned today. During the campaign, Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, which seeks to fund domestic production of semiconductor chips that are now primarily produced in Taiwan, and indicated a desire to kill the effort. Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson had said the House would seek to follow through, but later walked it back. Raimondo, who is the lead on implementing CHIPS, didn’t hold back when asked about Trump’s threat during today’s Reagan National Defense Forum event in Simi Valley, Calif. 'It’s a horrific idea. It’s a reckless idea,' she said. 'Sometimes you say things on the stump, and I can only hope that was something to be said on the stump and won’t be acted out. 'It is untenable that the United States of America buys 100 percent of leading-edge chips used in fighter jets, AI technology, nuclear simulation, drones — a hundred percent of those chips are made in Taiwan and tested in China. Do something about it. Fix it. That’s what we’re doing, that’s what the CHIPS Act is doing. If you want to hold us accountable, say go faster, be clearer, do a better job, fine, I’ll listen to that. But if you want to say undo it, that’s not right. It’s reckless, its not fair, and it makes us less safe.' Part of Trump’s argument was to replace the CHIPS Act, which Raimondo said has allocated $35 billion in funding, with tariffs on chips coming in from abroad. While stating that tariffs 'have their place,' the commerce secretary emphasized that they are 'not a substitute' for what CHIPS is trying to accomplish. 'We need investments in research and development, in workforce, in infrastructure, so we can be great in the US,' she said. 'It’s a race. Tug on [China’s] shirt where you can to slow them down, but you better just be prepared to run faster.' 'Export controls matter. Sanctions matter. Holding China back matters. But it’s just a speed bump,' she continued. 'We are not gonna beat China by trying to slow them down. We’re going to beat them by going faster. So invest in America, invest in our technology, invest in our companies, invest in our infrastructure, invest in our talent, and do it with our allies.' Coincidentally, Raimondo’s appearance came days after Intel’s CEO was forced to resign by the board of directors. Intel has been a leading focus of CHIPS support, leading to a question about whether that is a blow to the efforts from the Biden administration. For her part, Raimondo conceded that 'There’s no secret Intel has struggled,' but said 'I believe they will come out of this' and be successful as a chip producer in the long run.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/trumps-threat-to-abandon-chips-act-horrific-idea-raimundo-says/	2024-12-07T12:52:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/raimondo-scaled-e1733599464537.jpg
NATO to launch new cyber center by 2028: Official	Navy Commander Kevin Blenkhorn, a computer sciences professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, works with his Joint Services teammates during the U.S. Army’s ‘Cyber Center of Excellence’, Fort Gordon in Augusta, Ga., hosted a multi-service ‘NetWar’ to show, and build, cyber Warrior capabilities Tuesday, June 10. (Georgia Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Tracy J. Smith) NATO EDGE 2024 — In order for the alliance to be better equipped at dealing with cyber threats, NATO is in the process of standing up a new cyber center — to go online by 2028 — that will meld parts of its various cyber entities into one, a NATO official told Breaking Defense this week. 'This center will allow us to better combine the way in which we are monitoring the threat, the way we are controlling the attack surface of the enterprise [and] the way we are managing the risk,' Stefano Piermarocchi, head of the Enterprise Cyber Risk Management portfolio within NATO’s chief information office, said in an interview. 'So it's a way to facilitate the conduction of certain processes and make sure they are at the pace of the security for the enterprise itself.' Coined the NATO Integrated Cyber Defense Center, the joint entity will combine NATO's Cyber Security Center, Cyber Operations Center and Cyber Threat Analysis Branch, as well as parts of the CIO’s office, Piermarocchi said. He added that the center plans to engage industry partners from across the alliance as well. 'The idea of the center is to facilitate the dialogue with the industry, and to be sure that we're able to speed up certain processes, to increase our ability to communicate &#8230; or to have a really more concrete dialogue with nations,' he said. Brig. Gen. Sam Raeves, who serves as the assistant chief of staff of J6 Cyberspace at NATO, also expressed the benefits of standing up such a center, saying that combining these existing cyber entities with industry will create 'cohesion' in terms of cyber operations. 'Putting all those elements together, instead of having them dispersed all over the alliance, it will really improve the situation and the cohesion of information sharing,' Reeves said during an interview on the sidelines of the NATO Edge 2024 conference. There will be multiple centers located across NATO countries, Piermarocchi said. But the headquarters will be in Mons, Belgium, NATO CIO Manfred Boudreaux-Dehmer, said during a panel at the event. 'It will be set up as a physical colocation space where people can sit together if an incident happens, people are working together real time,' Boudreaux-Dehmer said. 'That's a major, major building block in getting us working together more closely and supporting each other in this colocation place.' Related: US, allies warn of Russian cyber sabotage aimed at disrupting aid to Ukraine Though the idea to stand up such a center was approved by the alliance, Piermarocchi said the center likely won’t be stood up until 2028 as more logistics like hiring need to be sorted out among the 32 countries. 'There is a need to recruit other people, to have other people on board, because this is one of the challenges that we have, we cannot do all the work that the center has to do, including, for example, 24/7 capabilities without hiring additional resources,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-to-launch-new-cyber-center-by-2028-official/	2024-12-06T13:27:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/1398028-scaled-e1660682409929.jpg
Lockheed Martin shrinks F-35 simulator to squeeze more units into secure facilities	A pilot sits in an F-35 simulator. (Lockheed Martin) I/ITSEC 2024 — Lockheed Martin generally reserves plenty of floorspace at defense shows, but this year at I/ITSEC the aerospace behemoth is showing off a development in its simulation capabilities designed to save space as much as possible: a smaller, leaner F-35 simulator. The point, according to Lockheed’s Erik 'Rock' Etz, is to fit more of the simulators in secure facilities — the only places where F-35 simulators can be housed due to the plane’s still-sensitive nature — enabling more dynamic joint training. 'The MMRT [Modified Mission Rehearsal Trainer] reduces the overall hardware footprint of the platform and increases the options for high-fidelity pilot training,' said Etz, the company’s director of Strategy and Business Development. 'You can get more of these devices inside of a SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility], which affords the simulating of larger missions. In many cases this now means the ability to conduct a four ship versus eight ship training event,' which was not possible with the previous generation simulators. Lockheed began an internal R&amp;D project to develop the first of this newer, smaller simulator in 2021 that evolved into the current MMRT configuration. 'Growing the capacity for a greater number of sims creates the option to link more devices together. Recently at a final mission simulation at Luke AFB it was demonstrated that it is possible to datalink 12 devices together,' Etz said. 'Other than offering more sims in the same space, the MMRT also presents additional capability. The result is a holistic training capability.' Etz said Lockheed initially shrank the MMRT for the US Air Force but the 'requirement will undoubtedly grow with the export customers of the aircraft.' (Nineteen countries currently fly the plane.) RELATED: Romania signs LOA to secure entry to F-35 club Simulated training for the F-35 can be far more complex than for other airframes, as much of the fifth-generation jet’s selling point is not dogfighting, but battle management. The aircraft is sometimes given the nickname of the 'quarterback in the sky' as it can accept data from multiple sources — including satellites — and then hand targeting and other cues off to other aircraft, air defense batteries, ground forces and naval vessels. It’s a role that one Lockheed official said 'markedly increases the training burden.' At a Red Flag exercise more than two years ago, one of the F-35 pilots described the near sensory overload of being in the cockpit, saying 'we have so much situational awareness in the F-35 and there is a lot of information coming at you. From the radar and the sensors and the radio chatter is going crazy.' Simulators can also stand in for live training exercises, which may become more relevant with reportedly low mission-capability rates for the actual airframes. 'These stresses and complications with training are inevitably going to fall even harder on some of our export customers,' said one former US Air Force pilot now working at Lockheed, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'A bunch of these countries that have now signed up for the F-35 that are right on the border with Russia — or at least close to it: Poland, Finland, Norway, the Czech Republic, etc. Upping the game in the simulator business is probably the only way of keeping their pilots up to speed while the programmatic problems with the aircraft are sorted out,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lockheed-martins-shrinks-f-35-simulator-to-squeeze-more-units-into-secure-facilities/	2024-12-06T12:56:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241206_F35_sim_LOCKHEED-e1733514776351.jpg
House intel’s Himes: Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2027 would be ‘really dumb’	Chinese president Xi Jinping and a PLA Navy honor guard await the King of Bahrain (Photo by Feng Li/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee said today he doesn't buy that China will make a move on Taiwan in 2027, for several reasons, including his contention that it seems it would be 'really dumb.' 'I'm skeptical, frankly, of that statement, which is everywhere, you know, &#8216;Xi [Jinping] has ordered the PLA [People's Liberation Army] to be ready to invade Taiwan in 2027,'' Rep. Jim Himes told the audience a Brookings Institute and CSIS event. 'First of all, it may not happen.' 'It also feels like a really dumb way to go, right? You know?' he said later. 'There are islands that are claimed by Taiwan that are two miles off the coast of China, right? You could implement a blockade. You know, what? If you invade Taiwan, what happens? A. You may lose. B. You may reduce the place to smoking rubble, in which case, what have you really achieved economically? You know, you'd have incredible brain drain. You've risked a nuclear war with the United States, I presume. You destabilize the region for a generation.' The year 2027 has been referred to as the Davidson Window, named so after then-head of US Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Phil Davidson testified before lawmakers in 2021 that Beijing might try to annex Taiwan within six years. In 2023, CIA Director Bill Burns reiterated that timeline, saying US intelligence showed Xi had given the Chinese army a 2027 deadline to be ready to invade should he give the order. 'Now, that does not mean that he's decided to conduct an invasion in 2027 or any other year, but it's a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' Burns said then. Last month, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, said China did appear to be on track to meet Xi's 2027 preparedness goal, but it wasn't clear if Beijing had thought through a long-term invasion plan. Himes, who is briefed on classified American intelligence assessments, said today that while he wouldn't flatly 'reject' the contention that China could invade in the next three years, it would be impossible to know if China had achieved the 'objective' to be ready. And it probably wouldn't work out well if they tested it. 'You know, just ask Vladimir Putin how predictable invasions are, even of neighboring countries, much less across 100 miles of blue water,' he said. Himes said the 2027 warnings are the 'kind of thing that hawks in the House say and I'm supposed to be really scared by that, rather than by saying, &#8216;Okay, well how do we take the steps to make that eventuality less likely?' 'And those steps can range from &#8216;Let's keep or really accelerate deterrence by arming Taiwan' to &#8216;Let's stress those areas where there are deep common interests with the Chinese to make that less likely,'' he said.

Ukraine’s SKIFTECH went from paintball to battlefield simulation	Soldiers don SKIFTECH laser sensors for training. (SKIFTECH) I/ITSEC 2024 — Twenty years ago, the Ukrainian firm SKIFTECH focused on battlefield tech, but only the kind of weapons weekenders would shoot each other with for fun: paintball guns. But in 2014, the same year 'Russian-backed separatist' invaded eastern Ukraine, the company pivoted to the real thing, turning itself into a high-tech military simulation and training specialist. The company’s biggest customers are in Ukraine, but most recently the company has expanded into the US, according to Mikhail Obod, chief of the US branch. It’s a small footprint for now – just a dozen employees stateside — but Obod said the firm expects to grow here, potentially with the help of a US Army contract the company says is in the pipeline. Through its work, the company said it sought to address what it sees as flaws in current generation training simulations, including by failures to account for a high level of casualties within the first 30 minutes of a fight to a dearth of more detailed after-action feedback for soldiers. Obod claimed that the 'final results are that the current Ukraine commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, has told us that units completing the entire one month-long course utilizing the latest SKIFTECH hardware and methods suffer 30 percent fewer casualties.' Obod said the training system draws on the wide body of battlefield experience and the years of data accumulated since 2014. 'Rather it is our experience in this automated simulation technology — the ability to engage simulations in operating against drones, against aircraft and against ambush scenarios' he explained. Since the war in Ukraine became locked into a positional dynamic with limited movement in the lines, 'the ‘trench warfare’ dimension has also been embedded into the simulation software modules.' These real-world interactions are embedded in the software modules. Simulations include factoring in all kinds of weapons from tanks to small arms to drones – even hand grenades and anti—personnel mines. Obod also claimed the company’s tech is 'considerably more accurate' than other laser-based systems, built on a new 2024 design. 'It is not a two-dimensional training regime where if you are hit and there is a ‘beep’ that it means you are automatically dead,' he said. Instead, the detectors worn by servicemen and those used on vehicles are 'layered and graduated. A ‘hit’ registered by the laser sensor is not necessarily scored as a kill. The system calibrates the weapon used, the range, the velocity, the ballistic protection of the target, etc. to then rate the level of damage inflicted.' Obod said the company added Stinger MANPADs to a simulated environment in just five months 'not five years.' This truncated fast-track incorporation of real battlefield data to rapid prototyping to fielded product cycle is a competitive advantage for SKIFTECH. What the company lacks at present is a diversified portfolio. The company’s current contracted profile is a 90 percent Ukraine customer database, Obod said. 'We would like to sell to other nations outside of Ukraine,' he said, adding the company does work in a couple European countries and as far away as Malaysia and Ecuador. In the end, 'we are producing training using laser-based simulations which means not wasting a live round, which for tanks, armored vehicles, artillery is expensive. Our system does not conduct training against a target but against a simulated live-action adversary.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ukraines-skiftech-went-from-paintball-to-battlefield-simulation/	2024-12-06T11:32:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241206_skiftech_soldier_lasers_HANDOUT-e1733513163668.jpg
Denmark and Sweden sign $2.5 billion CV90 IFV joint procurement for over 200 vehicles	A CV-90 takes a shot. (BAE Systems Hägglunds) BELFAST — The Nordic nations of Denmark and Sweden have signed a 25 billion SEK ($2.5 billion) joint procurement contract with BAE Systems for the acquisition of 205 new Combat Vehicle 90 — CV9035 MKIIIC — Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). Sweden’s Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and the Danish Ministry of Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organisation (DALO) inked the deal today with BAE Systems Hagglunds, the CV90 manufacturer. Denmark will receive the majority of vehicles — 115 in all. Sweden will acquire 50 to replace vehicles supplied to Ukraine, while the remaining 40 units are bound for Kyiv 'and financed through previous donations from Denmark and Sweden,' said the Swedish Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a statement. 'These investments will enable more Swedish combat vehicles to make Europe — and particularly Ukraine — safer,' added Pål Jonson, Sweden’s Minister of Defence. 'The Swedish defence industry is a unique and strong asset to our national and collective defence capabilities.' In a supporting statement from BAE Systems, Chief of the Royal Danish Army Maj. Gen. Peter Boysen said, 'The infantry fighting vehicle is an essential component of the heavy brigade we are currently building. The 115 new vehicles will significantly enhance Denmark's contribution to collective security and international operations.' Boysen added that with '44 existing vehicles, we will have a total of 159 vehicles, providing us with substantial strength.' Stockholm also noted that the CV90 has proven 'highly valued' in Ukraine, highlighting the platform’s 'high level' of protection and frontline success, including saving 'soldiers’ lives in direct hits.' At a capability level, the new CV9035 MKIIC is fitted with 'the latest turret solution and gives its crew improved situational awareness and increased mobility, protection and effectiveness against enemy targets,' added the Swedish MoD. The new turret will be built to the same standard as that under development for the Netherlands as part of its CV90 mid-life upgrade program, according to BAE Systems. In Sweden’s case, the latest order builds off a prior contract signed between FMV and BAE Systems in May for new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles and integrated logistic support. In October, Breaking Defense first reported that Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden had entered talks to evaluate joint procurement of a future IFV. Should discussions progress as anticipated, the new platform could be acquired in the 2030 to 2040 timeframe. Each nation currently fields the CV90 and, at the time, Commander of the Swedish Army Maj. Gen. Jonny Lindfors told Breaking Defense it would be a 'natural development to buy more of them,' although other systems are under consideration. Across 17 different variants, 1,900 CV90 vehicles have been ordered to date and it has been selected by 10 European nations, according to BAE Systems. Alongside operations in Ukraine, it has previously been deployed in Afghanistan and Liberia.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/denmark-and-sweden-sign-2-5-billion-cv90-ifv-joint-procurement-for-over-200-vehicles/	2024-12-06T09:32:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/230131_cv90_bae_sweden.jpg
Bomber fleet size target ‘probably’ needs to be reassessed: Air Force Global Strike chief	A B-21 Raider conducts flight tests, which includes ground testing, taxiing, and flying operations, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. (Air Force photo) WASHINGTON — Amid a high tempo of operations and rising threats throughout the globe, the head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) suggested officials should take another look at a years-old, long-term target for fielding a fleet of 220 bombers. 'We have 141 bombers in the inventory between the B-1, the B-2 and the B-52,' Air Force Gen. Thomas Bussiere said during a discussion hosted by the Mitchell Institute on Thursday. 'The demand signal for the bombers is greater than any time I’ve seen in my career, across the fabric of every geographic combatant command.' The Air Force plans to retire the B-1 and B-2 as the new B-21 Raider comes online, and extend the life of the B-52 via a fleetwide overhaul. The service has stated it will buy at least 100 B-21s, which would be complemented by the updated fleet of 76 newly-designated B-52Js. According to Bussiere, previous Air Force officials have stated that once the long-range strike force drops to a two-bomber fleet, the service should aim for an inventory of 220 bombers. However, the general then said officials should consider reassessing that number, especially given the high demand for the bomber fleet from places like Europe to the Middle East. 'That data, and that fleet size probably needs to be reevaluated based on the world as we see it today,' Bussiere said. Though he did not recommend a specific number for the fleet or explicitly call to increase it, Bussiere said in a statement to Breaking Defense that '[a] bomber force of 220 has been a number suggested in the public sphere for a while. The number we field will be guided by the fact that no other U.S. ally or partner has an active bomber force, and our bombers provide the backbone of our military’s flexible global strike capability, which is also the foundation of our extended deterrence umbrella for our allies and partners. 'The number of bombers in the fleet will be informed by the threat, the National Defense Strategy, the budget, deployment/employment demand signals, and most importantly decisions by policy makers,' he continued. 'We will get at least 100 B-21s, modernize the B-52J and retire B-2s and B-1s as new platforms come online and are Fully Operationally Capable. We must have the number required to provide both strategic and conventional deterrence, and if our deterrence fails, we must have the number required to deliver a decisive response.' Upping the bomber force would likely entail buying more B-21s beyond the service’s minimum target of 100. However, officials this year testified that a decision to increase the Raider’s procurement won’t be needed for another decade, at which point an alternative could be available. The Air Force has limited resources to increase the Raider buy, though lawmakers, including incoming Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), have called for doubling the bomber’s procurement. And when asked, Air Force officials are hardly coy about wanting more, including by speeding up its current production rate so that more bombers are built in the short term. 'I think most national security professionals would look at the B-21 and the current production schedule and go, ‘We might want to consider evaluating whether or not we can accelerate that based on the age of the B-2 and the B-1 fleet.’ That's a prudent question in light of the threats that are out there and the demand signals for bombers,' Bussiere said. 'Normally, the answer is, &#8216;who would not want more long-range strike platforms?'' he added. 'And it really gets down to the fundamentals of the budget. It's a service budget issue, it's a department budget issue. It's a national budget issue. So I'm a firm believer that if the nation decides they need something, they'll invest in it and invest in it in an agile way to make something happen.' Northrop builds the bomber at its Palmdale, Calif., production facility. Buessiere said that if officials decide to ramp up production of the bomber, 'there’s some capability growth within the current complex.' Ultimately deferring to acquisition professionals, the general added that if the Raider’s production was supercharged in the near term, 'more than likely, it would require opening up another production complex if the nation decides to do that.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/bomber-fleet-size-target-probably-needs-to-be-reassessed-air-force-global-strike-chief/	2024-12-06T08:27:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/B-21-e1733497979392.jpg
BAE betting on AI to train imagery analysts	The Space Force sees digitization as fundamental to all of its operations. (Getty images) I/ITSEC — At this year’s I/ITSEC show, it was hard to miss that everyone seemingly wants in on the artificial intelligence craze. It’s easy to see why: simulation, after all, is ultimately about managing data, with machine learning or AI at the heart of those efforts. So it’s no surprise that companies are touting what they can do in the artificial intelligence space. One such firm is BAE Systems, which has zeroed in on the use of AI for image processing as a growth market. 'With the advent of so many unmanned airborne combat system concepts there are people who will declare ‘the last fighter pilot has already been born,’' Benjamin Kennedy, an account manager for BAE’s electronic systems division, said on the show floor. 'In the same vein of future requirements, we look at the functionality of our system for processing imagery we like to say that the last imagery analyst has been born.' High-resolution imagery, whether it is from commercial-based satellite systems or from airborne platforms &#8211; both manned and unmanned &#8211; can be processed at a speed far beyond that of that conducted by the individual imagery analyst using BAE’s SOCET GXP geospatial intelligence software, according to Kennedy. With this software users and operators can rapidly identify, analyze, and extract information on specific locations or installations to a level that supports action-oriented decision-making. Kennedy claimed that the package has been a successful property for BAE, and been provided to over 65 countries. There are several aspects to its functionality that make it attractive to numerous clients. One is that the program can run in a server-based environment or on a desktop. All the system requires is adequate graphics processing hardware. Secondly, the SOCET package is also not limited to imagery processing solutions. It has 'a myriad of functions, which include a learning process of how to convert imagery data to intelligence data and then form that processing imagery into simulator data,' per the company. And thirdly, the entire system can be operated on unclassified hardware as the software itself is also unclassified. 'This has supported situations where an allied or friendly was able to input commercial imagery and/or their own self-generated or collected data and use the SOCET software to analyze it in real time, said Kennedy. 'In this way we have been able assist our friends and allies' in certain theatres of operation. Data provided by a customer can be put through a long list of analytical process and moreover the type of formats of imagery that can be processed is not limited. The SOCET GXP program supports literally 'thousands of different sensors. The customer also does not have to purchase any minimum number of licenses or copies of the software – customers can have as few as two copies or thousands or any number in between.' 'The way to think about SOCET package is to look at it as the main weapon of an imagery analyst. It is to that analyst what the Smith and Wesson M-4 carbine is to a Marine infantryman,' explained Kennedy who is himself a former Marine. 'SOCET is that analyst’s version of an M-4.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/bae-betting-on-ai-to-train-imagery-analysts/	2024-12-06T07:35:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_map_ship_movements_GettyImages-875327078-scaled.jpg
Army’s new compact electronic warfare kit goes on everything from backpacks to balloons	A soldier tests out the Army's new TLS-Manpack electronic warfare kit. (US Army photo) FORT BELVOIR, Va. — The first two combat brigades to get the Army’s long-awaited backpack-portable electronic warfare kit are already experimenting with new tactics, officers and NCOs told reporters here on Tuesday. Formally known as the TLS-BCT (Terrestrial Layer System — Brigade Combat Team) Manpack, the system fills a longtime gap in the Army's digital arsenal: It gives frontline troops on foot the ability to detect enemy radio transmissions, pinpoint their sources for precision strike and, in some configurations, jam the signal. Such electronic warfare capabilities are more critical than ever on battlefields dominated by radio-controlled drones. 'I think that some of the soldiers were surprised by how they were able to use it at JRTC [the Joint Readiness Training Center] to identify enemy drones and things like that,' said Lt. Col. John Cross, the Army’s product manager for the system. 'It kind of has opened the minds of the commanders as to what's possible.' 'One of the units was able to actually take one of these systems [and] put it up on an aerostat' — that is, a tethered balloon — to expand its field of view beyond what they could scan from ground level, Cross continued. 'That's not something that we necessarily told them to do, that's something that they came up with. &#8230; We take that feedback and then we share it across the Army.' That approach embodies the Army’s new emphasis on what it calls 'transformation in contact': issuing new kit to combat units early on, often while it’s still in development, and incorporating real soldiers’ feedback on how it works in field conditions, or doesn’t, so improvements can be made. 'We're using this user feedback to inform our tactics, techniques and procedures … to understand how we need to drive new software development &#8230; [and] to drive our new requirements' for future systems, Cross said. Based on such soldier feedback, the TLS-Manpack program is already streamlining how it distributes software updates. Rapid updates are important for any modern weapons system, but especially so for electronic warfare: Combat experience in Ukraine has shown that a new technique can emerge, be employed to devastating effect against enemy drones or other radio-dependent systems, and then be countered, all within a matter of weeks. 'The evolving nature of the threat … is going to require agility and flexibility we haven’t seen,' said Brig. Gen. Ed Barker, the Army’s program executive officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO-IEW&amp;S). 'Whatever kit we’re providing to [units] now, it can’t be the same in two or three years. &#8230; We have to constantly evolve, based on all this feedback.' RELATED: Drones, jammers and big balloons: In Morocco, Army’s Multi-Domain Task Force tests EW tech But traditionally, the Army has distributed software updates for sensitive equipment by periodically sending compact discs full of new code to unit headquarters, with soldiers or contractors then bringing in each item to update it. The TLS-Manpack program started with that 'older model [of] let’s ship a CD,' Cross said, but 'we moved away from that.' Soldiers can now download software updates from an online portal, using the military’s secure but unclassified NIPR network, he said, then load the updates onto removable media to take back to their units. The service is even looking at the possibility of distributing updates 'over the air,' via wireless networks, the way commercial companies like Apple and Tesla do, although the military needs greater security for its software. 'We're moving toward the Tesla model,' Cross said. 'We're not there yet.' Meanwhile, as the program continues to evolve, production is kicking into higher gear. The first set of six TLS-Manpack systems went to a brigade of 10th Mountain Division in August, followed by a second set to a brigade of the 101st Airborne by the end of October. 'Now,' Cross said, 'we are on pace to field one brigade a month in FY [fiscal year] 25 and two brigades a month in FY26.' A soldier tests out the Army's new TLS-Manpack electronic warfare kit, showing the backpack configuration. (US Army photo) After years of experiments with different electronic-warfare systems and small-scale, ad hoc deployments abroad, the Army launched a formal competition in early 2023 and picked CACI Mastodon to build a prototype TLS Manpack with a $1.5 million award last September, followed by a $99.99 million award this July to begin production. 'In just under 18 months, we were able to buy a commercial off-the-shelf solution developed by CACI Mastodon and begin to field that,' Cross said, using streamlined processes such as Middle Tier Acquisition and Other Transaction Authority. The TLS-Manpack was designed, as its name implies, to be operated by a single soldier wearing it like a backpack. But the system is flexible and configurable enough to be used in other ways, explained assistant product manager Capt. Austin Knighton. Soldiers can strip it down to just the basic sensors — able to detect enemy transmissions but not to actively jam them — and get a handheld configuration weighing less than five pounds. They can also add additional sensors, extra batteries and electronic attack capabilities, with the maxed-out configuration weighing over 30 pounds — best suited for use at a static observation post or on a vehicle (or, apparently, in some cases, from a balloon). In a typical configuration, one Army sergeant told reporters, TLS-Manpack can operate for 72 hours without going back to base for more batteries, while being 'easily half the weight' of the portable systems the service has tried out in the past. A single system can operate on its own, but it can also share data over Army tactical networks. That lets multiple Manpacks work together to triangulate the precise coordinates of an enemy transmitter; future upgrades should let it share data and even take temporary control of other Army EW systems as a well. The Manpack's data can also flow back over the network to Army command posts, populating digital map displays — such as the widely-used Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) — with real-time intelligence on hostile, neutral, and friendly signals. 'It integrates very well with the TAK family of software, [so] this is very easy for the commander to understand,' instead of the data only being intelligence to EW specialists, the sergeant said. 'We’re getting a lot of capability out of this.' Manpack, in turn, is just one piece of a much larger renaissance in US Army electronic warfare. The Terrestrial Layer System, which combines EW and signals intelligence capabilities, is also being developed in much larger, vehicle-mounted versions: TLS-BCT for Brigade Combat Teams and the even more powerful TLS-EAB for divisions, corps, and other 'echelons above brigade.' Meanwhile, the much-delayed airborne Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) system is set to enter service as a pod for Grey Eagle drones in 2026. Electronic warfare 'requires a layered approach,' said Brig Gen. Barker. 'There’s not just a single silver bullet to solve the problem.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/armys-new-compact-electronic-warfare-kit-goes-on-everything-from-backpacks-to-balloons/	2024-12-06T04:58:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Army-TLS-Manpack-8771417.jpg
‘Campaign mindset’: Pentagon unveils new, formal strategy to defend against rising unmanned threats	A senior Observer Coach/Trainer fires a Dronebuster Electronic Warfare System at the Counter Unmanned Aircraft System Training in the Rotational Unit Bivouac Area on January 30, 2020. (U.S. Army photo by PFC Gower Liu, 11th ACR Public Affairs) WASHINGTON — Citing the growing threat of unmanned systems in the air, on land and at sea, the Pentagon today unveiled a new, whole-of-department strategy to shore up counter-drone defenses in the near term and to more thoroughly design future forces to fend off autonomous threats. 'These threats are changing how wars are fought,' the Pentagon said in the strategy's announcement. 'By producing a singular Strategy for Countering Unmanned Systems, the Secretary and the Department are orienting around a common understanding of the challenge and a shared approach to addressing it.' The strategy is classified, but its broad strokes were outlined in an unclassified fact sheet provided by the Pentagon today. Calling for a 'campaign mindset,' the document sets out five pillars, or 'strategic ways,' that the DoD intends to tackle the unmanned threat across different domains at home and abroad. According to the fact sheet, those are: Pointing to conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as an attack on an American installation in Jordan that killed three American servicemembers in January, the DoD recognizes an 'increasingly urgent and seemingly enduring threat that unmanned systems are posing to our people, to our facilities and to our assets overseas,' a senior defense official told reporters in a briefing today ahead of the strategy’s release. 'The real sort of emphasis of the strategy is to say, as we're taking on the effects of unmanned systems, we need to think about this temporally,' the official said, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the near term, the official said the strategy will focus on boosting counter-drone capabilities with 'a particular emphasis on detection,' including by ensuring installations have the active and passive defenses they need. Looking ahead, the strategy intends to 'mak[e] sure that we're developing and designing our future force to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience to threats,' the official said. As other Pentagon officials explained at a recent set of counter-UAS tests dubbed Falcon Peak, convened in the wake of hundreds of drone incursions over DoD installations on US soil, the drone threat can look very different in the homeland — not just because systems in question tend to be small, hobbyist drones, but also because policy constraints can limit commanders’ ability to respond. RELATED: ‘It’s not a war zone’: Pentagon ponders policy shifts to protect homeland bases from drones The new strategy is 'really trying to make sure that we are making a conscious effort to mitigate the threat in the homeland today in the unique ways in which it manifests in the homeland,' a second DoD official said during the briefing. Going forward, a formal part of the strategy will also ensure commanders and personnel are properly trained and equipped for the homeland defense task, including by educating them on authorities and improving interagency coordination, the official said. According to the first official, the ongoing initiatives like the Replicator 2 program are 'part and parcel with this effort.' Noting that the appropriate type of counter-drone capabilities depends on the operational environment, a third official who spoke with reporters today said that scaling up newer solutions like directed energy 'is probably closer to the mid- to long-term' to give officials more confidence in the systems’ performance and then integrate them into a layered defensive approach. RELATED: Pentagon homes in on counter-drone tech in Replicator 2 initiative With the reins of the Pentagon set to switch hands with the incoming Trump administration, yet another official said that 'any successor to [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin will undoubtedly have to deal with this challenge, and I think what we're seeing now is really just the beginning.' The strategy, therefore, is meant to 'lay a foundation for the Department to be able to get after this threat in a way that will be successful and get ahead of the evolution that we're seeing.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/campaign-mindset-pentagon-unveils-new-formal-strategy-to-defend-against-rising-unmanned-threats/	2024-12-05T13:45:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/counter-drone-scaled-e1733433091935.jpg
Saab unveils new counter-drone trainer, taking lessons from Ukraine	Sweden's Saab displays a new anti-drone training module at I/ITSEC 2024. (Reuben F. Johnson / Breaking Defense) I/ITSEC 2024 — Swedish defense firm Saab is stepping further in the realm of counter-drone capabilities with a new c-UAS training system, unveiled here at I/ITSEC in Orlando. The new trainer is designed to connect to Saab’s existing EXCON live tactical training system and involves putting a multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES)-type sensor array on a UAV so that it can simulate attacking and being attacked during training. 'Designed to replicate aerial threats from opposing forces, the Saab UAV trainer, utilising an ‘off-the-shelf’ UAV platform, can be engaged and defeated whilst capturing troop activity on video and is able to drop ‘virtual munitions’ on soldiers on the ground,' the company said in a press release this week. What is accomplished for very little expense is a system 'that can train soldiers in techniques of shooting down UAVs,' Saab spokesperson Magnus Palmer told Breaking Defense. 'This anti-drone module is an add-on to the base training system. We accomplish it by putting this laser sensor and targeting package on to a commercial UAV. This is now become a very critical functionality for training infantrymen — thanks to what has been happening in Ukraine.' There, Palmer is referencing the expansive use of small drones both by Ukrainian and Russian forces — a fast-moving evolution of tactics that has caused no small amount of alarm for international militaries who are now racing to find ways to counter the relatively cheap, flying robotic scouts and munitions. The US military, for instance, has held several exercises for industry to demonstrate ways to take out the aerial threats. Saab’s system appears to be designed to train soldiers to directly engage threats, what can be a tricky endeavor for frontline soldiers going against high-speed systems, as CNN reported. Electronic warfare has emerged as a potent option, at least for the time being. In recent Russian drone attacks, dozens of Iranian-designed Shahed and other attack drones used by Russia reportedly have been jammed or spoofed so that they turn around and either return to base or head off course for the neighboring nation of Belarus. (Jamming refers to severing the drones connection to its pilot, whereas spoofing involves feeding the drone incorrect location data so it goes off course.) 'In some situations where there is a live operator controlling the drone, we have been able to not only cause the Russian drone to return to base or veer off course into Belarus, but to crash into the site where the operator who launched it is located,' one company representative told Breaking Defense, speaking on the condition of anonymity. RELATED: NATO eyes solar-powered high altitude platforms to counter GPS jamming That, too, is a cat-and-mouse game as Russian forces have learned to dodge electronic warfare attacks by using different frequencies, and then Ukrainian forces have adapted to those changes to target the drones once again. The same process takes place in reverse for Russian forces. But it’s possible electronic warfare systems will grow so sophisticated that it will be impossible for drones to be flown remotely. 'If this trend continues, Putin’s troops will be unable to depend on these UAVs to terrorise the Ukrainian front lines,' said the director of one of Ukraine’s leading night vision and infantry weapons firms. 'The great terror that Ukraine troops at the front have been suffering under could be coming to an end before too long.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/saab-unveils-new-counter-drone-trainer-taking-lessons-from-ukraine/	2024-12-05T13:11:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_saab_cuas_trainer_REUBEN-scaled-e1733432252553.jpeg
NATO eyes solar-powered high altitude platforms to counter GPS jamming	The Zephyr high-altitude drone (Airbus) 'These are big, high-altitude planes that can stay for weeks in the air based on solar energy, and they can capture the GPS signal and send it down to earth with much more power that is more difficult to jam,' Brig. Gen. Sam Raeves, who serves as the assistant chief of staff of J6 Cyberspace at NATO, said in an interview on the sidelines of the NATO Edge conference here. Extremely high-altitude platforms (HAPS), which can come in the form of balloons in addition to light-weight drones like the spindly Airbus-made Zephyr, are not yet in widespread use by NATO, Raeves said. But their potential for them to serve as GPS relays comes as officials have grown increasingly concerned about electronic warfare, a now-ubiquitous feature of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. When and if NATO does actually start implementing these types of HAPS, it could help improve the situational awareness issues that arise with GPS jamming, Raeves said. 'So this is what we try to do, to have combined situation awareness fusion,' he said. 'This is really something that can solve it.' In a separate interview, Artem Martynenko, the deputy head of the Center for Innovations and Defense Technologies at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, bemoaned the constant need to stay ahead of Russian forces in the EW realm. Raeves acknowledged what he called the current 'cat and mouse game' in Europe. He said although NATO is not at war with Russia, the alliance still experiences jamming from the Kremlin. In May NATO publicly accused Russia of 'cyber and electronic interference,' among other acts of 'hybrid activity' — though it didn't appear to do much to slow Moscow down. RELATED: As Baltics see spike in GPS jamming, NATO must respond 'Of course, then we know where they are, but we can do nothing, because we are not at war with Russia,' Raeves said. 'So we cannot take them out. That's the big issue here. We can only geolocate them.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-eyes-solar-powered-high-altitude-platforms-to-counter-gps-jamming/	2024-12-05T12:20:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/ZephyrPRImage-e1634045291437.jpg
West drawing near to ‘third nuclear age,’ says head of UK armed forces	The UK plans on replacing Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) with a new fleet of Dreadnought-class vessels (UK MoD) BELFAST —The Western world is closing in on a new nuclear age, the third of its kind, because of malign activities carried out by Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, the head of the British Armed Forces has said. 'We are at the dawn of a third nuclear age … defined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before,' said UK Chief of the Defence Staff Adm. Tony Radakin, during a Wednesday speech in London hosted by the British Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank. 'From Russia, we have seen wild threats of tactical nuclear use, large scale nuclear exercises and simulated attacks against NATO countries, all designed to coerce us from taking the action required to maintain stability.' He said that China’s nuclear build up offers a 'two-peer challenge' to the US. Further afield, Radakin labelled Iran’s failure to engage with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a 'concern.' He also accused North Korea of 'erratic behavior' and said such action, in conjunction with its ballistic missile program, 'presents a regional and increasingly a global threat.' Radakin strongly defended the UK’s nuclear deterrent amid criticism over high costs and claimed it alone 'has more impact on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin than anything else.' For that reason, 'successive British governments are investing substantial sums of money to renew both our submarines and warhead and to recapitalize our nuclear enterprise after decades of underinvestment,' added Radakin, 'and this is even though the real benefits won't be realized for another decade, at least.' A wise general once told me that the role of senior leaders at points of tension is to reassure the nation &amp; stiffen our resolve Global power is shifting &amp; a third nuclear age is upon us. My RUSI Lecture explores how Britain stays safe in dangerous timeshttps://t.co/Ylgo2xVzAS &mdash; Chief of the Defence Staff 🇬🇧 (@AdmTonyRadakin_) December 5, 2024 The UK’s Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD) is overseen by Royal Navy Vanguard-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) fitted with Trident 2 D5 missiles. The aging vessels are set to be replaced by four BAE Systems Dreadnought-class types from the early 2030s onward, with each capable of carrying up to 12 Trident munitions and four Spearfish medium-range torpedoes. Overall, the Dreadnought program has an estimated through life price tag of £31 billion ($40 billion), excluding a £10 billion contingency fund. Parliamentary figures [PDF] also indicate that by March 2023, £15 billion had been spent on the 'concept, assessment, and early delivery phases' of the effort. In a November report on UK nuclear modernization, the Federation of American Scientists said that Dreadnought delays 'could threaten the [Royal] Navy’s ability to maintain their Continuous At-Sea Deterrent (CASD) as it would put additional stress on the Vanguard fleet that has already been pushed past its service life.' It also noted that the UK holds an estimated stockpile of 225 nuclear warheads, which is forecast to increase long term, 'based on shifting posture to counter Russia, modernization, and alliance efforts.' Radakin also said there is only a 'remote' chance that Russia attacks the UK — a projection that is also true for NATO as a whole — while Moscow understands that a retaliatory response would be overwhelming, 'whether conventional or nuclear.' Radakin also urged the MoD to consider a two tier equipment and acquisition approach, distinguished by opposing 'fail safe' and 'safe to fail' systems. Fail safe systems would see major projects delivered in much the same way as they are currently, but safe to fail systems would prioritize an 'investor' style whereby, as an example, nine out of 10 projects might end up failing but the remaining one would offer a 'step change' in capability.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/west-drawing-near-to-third-nuclear-age-says-head-of-uk-armed-forces/	2024-12-05T11:17:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/45159434.jpg.iCeS4I3rMWATAA.bg5Be7PyCV-e1733414373997.jpg
NGAD’s fate in Trump’s hands as Air Force punts decision to next administration	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — The US Air Force today announced that the incoming Trump administration will officially decide the fate of a planned sixth-generation stealth fighter, which has been on pause as officials reevaluate the platform’s design and requirements. 'The Secretary of the Air Force will defer the Next Generation Air Dominance way ahead decision to the next administration, while the Department of the Air Force continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program,' Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement today. Stefanek added that the Air Force 'is extending the current Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction contracts for the Next Generation Air Dominance program to further mature designs/systems while ensuring the industry teams remain intact.' To reflect the impact of delays with the program, the Air Force has also requested that bidding vendors 'update their proposals,' Stefanek said, noting that they are a 'schedule/milestone update only.' Observers expected such an announcement after weeks of non-committal statements from Air Force officials all the way up the Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has said a decision on NGAD would need to be made in time for the fiscal 2026 budget. That budget will now be crafted by Trump-appointed officials following the November election. The Air Force in 2023 set a target to award the NGAD contract to a winning vendor this year, though that plan hit a rough patch this summer after officials announced a pause in the plane’s development process to ensure they have the right design, as well as to attempt to bring its cost down. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are believed to be in a dogfight for rights to build the stealth fighter after aerospace prime Northrop Grumman publicly exited the competition last year, though Northrop has recently entertained the possibility of reentering the fray if the jet’s requirements change.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ngads-fate-in-trumps-hands-as-air-force-punts-decision-to-next-administration/	2024-12-05T10:28:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
‘Too early’ to rule out China-Russia cooperation in Baltic seabed cable incident, says Pentagon official	The Chinese ship, the bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 is anchored and being monitored by a Danish naval patrol vessel (unseen) in the sea of Kattegat, near the City og Granaa in Jutland, Denmark, on November 20, 2024. (Photo by MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A Pentagon official said she's unsure whether the recent damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea was the result of an intentional act and part of a broader Russian-Chinese plot, but the circumstances are suspicious enough to raise questions. 'I think that even a rational person, though, would say ‘Why is a Chinese vessel doing this and operating in this area?’ Some of our partners I've heard say this potentially leads back to Moscow,' Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for arctic and global resilience, said during an event with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'It's still too early to say, obviously, investigations are ongoing, but these are the kinds of dual use of one another's assets that I think we need to just be mindful of.' The incident in question took place in mid-November, when the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3 reportedly dropped its anchor and dragged it across a stretch of the Baltic seabed, in the process damaging undersea cables near Sweden and Denmark. While US and European officials have expressed confidence the ship is responsible for the damage, what is less clear is whether the act was deliberate. Soon after the incident, the Swedish government declined to directly assign blame but said that 'situations like these must be assessed with the growing threat posed by Russia in our neighbourhood as a backdrop. This includes an increased number of hybrid activities in Europe.' China has rejected accusations of sabotage. 'I would like to reiterate China's consistent support working with all countries to maintain the security of international submarine cables and other infrastructure in accordance with international law,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters last month, Reuters reported. Russia has also denied involvement. Since the incident occurred, Danish navy ships have been monitoring the Yi Peng 3, while Sweden and other European countries have sought the crew’s cooperation. Because the ship is in international waters, authorities are unable to force it to come into port. The incident is one in a series of events in recent years featuring European officials discovering damage to seabed cables running between their countries — sometimes the causes are known and other times they have been a mystery. RELATED: UK Naval Chief On Threats To Undersea Infrastructure: &#8216;We Don't Fully Understand' Solutions Regardless, the Pentagon has taken notice and made defense of underwater infrastructure a priority area for the trilateral security pact AUKUS. Equally, American officials and Ferguson in particular, have warned about Russia and China’s increasing cooperation. Just this year, Ferguson spearheaded a new arctic strategy for the Defense Department. 'Increasingly, the PRC and Russia are collaborating in the Arctic across multiple instruments of national power,' according to the document. 'Russia’s isolation as a result of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has made it increasingly reliant on the PRC for financing energy export infrastructure in the Arctic. Over 80 percent of Russia’s natural gas production and nearly 20 percent of its petroleum production comes from the Arctic, and Russia is increasingly turning to the PRC to fund this extraction and purchase these resources.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/too-early-to-rule-out-china-russia-cooperation-in-baltic-seabed-cable-incident-says-pentagon-official/	2024-12-05T09:42:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_yi_peng_3_GettyImages-2185111873-scaled-e1733418510214.jpg
Anduril, OpenAI enter ‘strategic partnership’ to use AI against drones	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019.(US Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — Defense startup Anduril is teaming up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in a 'strategic partnership' that Anduril says will 'develop and responsibly deploy advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for national security missions' — particularly in countering drones. 'By bringing together OpenAI’s advanced models with Anduril’s high-performance defense systems and Lattice software platform, the partnership aims to improve the nation’s defense systems that protect U.S. and allied military personnel from attacks by unmanned drones and other aerial devices,' Anduril said in a press release Wednesday. 'The Anduril and OpenAI strategic partnership will focus on improving the nation’s counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) and their ability to detect, assess and respond to potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time.' The collaboration comes as the Pentagon is racing to find ways to defend its troops and facilities, both abroad and at home, from the threat of drones of all sizes, a threat that's come to the fore rapidly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, especially. RELATED: Hundreds of drone incursions reported at military installations over past few years, NORTHCOM says Breaking Defense recently observed a military exercise in the Colorado mountains during which different companies demonstrated their own counter-drone solutions for the homeland, from cyberattacks to nets. In July, the Pentagon conducted a similar experiment, this time attempting to defend against drone swarms. 'No one capability, whether kinetic or non-kinetic, in itself could really just beat this kind of [attack] profile,' Col. Michael Parent, chief of acquisitions &amp; resources at the Army-led Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft System Office, said at the time. 'What we saw was they really do need a full system of systems approach, a layered approach.' Officials and experts have held up AI as a potential key aid in defeating drone swarms, allowing much faster identification of several threats that would otherwise overwhelm current systems and their human operators. In October, defense industry giant Northrop Grumman announced it was adding AI to an Army command system to better defend against the drone threat. However, the Pentagon is also grappling with the policy and ethical considerations of integrating AI into its operations, especially any missions involving kinetic fires. In other applications, like chat programs, the DoD has shown it's especially wary of potential mistakes current popular AI systems can make. Anduril appeared to acknowledge that concern, and in its release Wednesday said the two firms' 'shared commitment to AI safety and ethics is a cornerstone of this new strategic partnership.' The collaboration, Anduril said, will be 'subject to robust oversight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/anduril-openai-enter-strategic-partnership-to-use-ai-against-drones/	2024-12-05T08:53:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1733415596741.jpg
And then there were 3: NRO extends contracts for radar imagery to Capella, ICEYE, Umbra	Umbra SAR satellite image of Cannes, France (Umbra) WASHINGTON — The National Reconnaissance Office has granted new two-year contracts to three providers of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery: Capella Space, ICEYE US and Umbra, an NRO spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Wednesday. 'NRO's Commercial Systems Program Office provided a two-year period of performance extension under NRO's Strategic Commercial Enhancements Broad Agency Announcement (SCE BAA) which were initially awarded on Jan. 20, 2022. The period of performance extension for SCE BAA Stage III &#8211; Commercial Radar Capabilities is from July 2024 through July 2026,' the spokesperson elaborated. There were five SAR-sat firms in the original set of study contracts — the three Stage III winners, plus the US arm of European aerospace behemoth Airbus and Florida start-up PredaSAR. Airbus in October announced it had plans to cut up to 2,500 staff due to losses primarily in its Space Systems business. Reuters reported Wednesday that the firm announced 2,043 job reductions, more than half of which came from the Space Systems business. PredaSAR's parent company, Terran Orbital, in October 2022 abandoned plans for its SAR satellite constellation, and NRO dropped PredaSAR from its roster when the contract lapsed in September 2023. After a year of struggling with debt, Terran Orbital was acquired by Lockheed Martin on Oct. 30. The new Stage III contracts are expected by industry officials to be the last of the short term, relatively small dollar awards under the SCC BAA — with senior NRO officials pushing to create a longer term program of record in the fiscal 2026 budget. NRO's budget is classified, but it is an open secret that the agency has been slated only about $10 million a year for about 15 study contracts with providers of SAR, radio frequency geolocation and hyperspectral satellite imagery. 'From our perspective, it's another sign that the Commercial [Systems Program Office] is committed to supporting SAR, and that they're serious about it,' Joe Morrison, Umbra's vice president and general manager for remote sensing, told Breaking Defense on Tuesday. 'And despite the fact that, to date, they have not yet been able to stand up a program of record, they are very concertedly, explicitly working to transition the study. In the meantime, they're creating these additional phases that are substantive and very meaningful for the industry,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/and-then-there-were-3-nro-extends-contracts-for-radar-imagery-to-capella-iceye-umbra/	2024-12-05T07:18:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Umbra-SAR-sat-photo-e1685046168368.jpeg
