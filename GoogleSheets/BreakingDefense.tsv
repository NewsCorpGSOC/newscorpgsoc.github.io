DISA: DoD to achieve federated ICAM connection across all military services by end of fiscal year	Airman 1st Class Gerald Mack, cyber operator with 175th Cyber Operations, Maryland Air National Guard, monitors cyber attacks during Exercise Southern Strike at Camp Shelby, Mississippi, April 21, 2023. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense plans to achieve federal identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) connection on unclassified networks across all military services by the end of this fiscal year, according to a Defense Information Systems Agency official. ICAM — the practice of performing constant checks to ensure that users are allowed to access the information they are trying to access — is essential to the DoD’s larger zero trust 'never trust, always verify' philosophy that operates under the assumption that the network is always compromised. Federated ICAM allows one organization to accept another’s identity processes and procedures to gain access to each other's data on an existing platform. It’s a vital part of information sharing, Brian Hermann, the program executive officer for PEO Cyber at DISA said during a media roundtable today. 'ICAM is how we work across the department, as well as how we work with our mission partners. Enabling our work with allied and coalition partners means we have to have some connectivity and understanding of who we're working with in that coalition, to make sure that we have an understanding of their access rights and grant them access to DoD resources,' he said. Hermann explained that at the beginning of this fiscal year DISA stood up a federation hub that allows the agency to be able to have a 'total picture' of all the information an individual has access to, basically guaranteeing that ICAM is working the way it's supposed to. With this hub, DISA started working with the Army to get its ICAM solutions federated. He said he expects the Army’s ICAM federation solutions to be completed by the end of March. 'Then roughly about three months later, be done with the Navy, followed by the Air Force by the end of the fiscal year,' Hermann said. 'We're going to use the lessons that we learned out of [the services] to go ahead and do the federation across all the other ICAM solutions that exist within the department,' he added. When asked the reasoning behind the order in which the services were attaining federated ICAM, Hermann explained that it was mostly due to 'deconfliction of timing' concerning other 'activities' that the services had going on. 'I can't really say for example, that the Army's technical solution was more advanced or more mature than any of the others. I think it was just a timing issue,' he said. Related: ‘A light bulb moment’: US, Canada achieve ‘vital’ federated ICAM connection through joint pilot Once the services have achieved federated ICAM connection, the next step is to work with the Defense Manpower Data Center to help it achieve federated ICAM followed by other components of the DoD, which Hermann did not expand on. Throughout this process, DISA will also start working toward federated ICAM with allies and partners — something the department piloted in December when it announced it had achieved federated ICAM connection with Canada. However, before the DoD begins widely establishing federated ICAM access with other nations, Hermann said it needs to speed up the process of federation, which he said will be possible through lessons learned from the services. 'When we start to federate with external partners, allies &#8230; ad hoc kinds of coalitions that we might fight with, we have to be able to move very quickly to make sure that we can continue to work and collaborate with those mission partners,' Hermann said. 'I think speed has to get down to days, not months, is my observation, if we're going to be a supportive part of providing that warfighter support.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/disa-dod-to-achieve-federated-icam-connection-across-all-military-services-by-end-of-fiscal-year/	2025-02-21T11:55:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/7758909-scaled-e1740165576715.jpg
Saltzman bars Space Force staff from Mitchell Institute events	CSO Gen. Chance Saltzman offer remarks during the Mitchell Institute Spacepower Security Forum in Washington, D.C., March 27, 2024. (DoD photo by Joseph Clark) WASHINGTON — Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has barred all Space Force personnel from participating in any events sponsored by the Mitchell Institute, pending further instructions. The ban was conveyed to Space Force and US Space Command leaders in a Thursday evening email blast signed by Maj. Gen. Steven Whitney, Space Force staff director. 'CSO has directed that all Guardian participation with the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies is stopped until further notice. Instructions will follow when he clears future participation. This does not affect participation at the AFA's Warfare Symposium, only Mitchell Institute sponsored events,' the email states. 'I ask that you disseminate this guidance to your teams.' The email does not list a reason for the decision. However, it follows hard on the heels of the Feb. 19 release of a new Mitchell report calling on the Defense Department to more clearly define the Space Force's role in warfighting. The report, which was based on a workshop attended by Guardians, also found that Saltzman's overarching theory of space power, dubbed 'Competitive Endurance,' gives the impression of being weighed toward defensive operations rather than offensive actions — and that there continues to be some hesitancy within the Guardian corps about warfighting in space. A spokesperson for the Space Force was unable to respond by press time. While maintaining 501c3 status as an independent think tank, Mitchell traditionally has advocated for the importance of US military air power and the US Air Force, and increasingly in recent years for space power and the Space Force. Indeed, it was named for Army Brig. Gen. William Mitchell, who according to the organization's website, 'was a visionary of early airpower and the importance it would play in post-world-war global security and future wars.' In response to a request for comment from Breaking Defense, retired Air Force Lt. Gen. David Deptula, Mitchell Institute dean, said that Saltzman 'is dedicated to infusing a warfighting attitude in the Space Force.' Nonetheless, he said, 'for decades, military personnel were prohibited from saying ‘warfighting’ and ‘space’ in the same sentence. Circumstances are far different now given adversary actions. The Space Force leadership knows this and is pressing hard to evolve the service. 'Mitchell Institute will continue to advocate for the Space Force, and the absolute need to increase their resources, personnel, and authorities that are all essential to realize &#8216;peace through strength' for our nation,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saltzman-bars-space-force-staff-from-mitchell-institute-events/	2025-02-21T09:54:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Salzman-at-Mitchell-scaled-e1740143242552.jpeg
Saab CEO floats Euro defense ‘coalition,’ plans to fly unmanned combat demonstrator	Saab CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense that the company hopes to generate interest from Germany in the GlobalEye spy aircraft. (Saab) BELFAST — Swedish manufacturer Saab is one of Europe's largest defense companies, famed for the development and manufacture of Gripen fighter jets among a wide variety of other major platforms across air, land and sea domains. The company also has a special interest in the US, largely due to it supplying aft fuselages for the Air Force's T-7A Red Hawk advanced trainer program, while a new Michigan-based shoulder-fired munitions final assembly line is scheduled to begin production next year. US and European security ties are beginning to fray, however, as new leadership in Washington insists the continent drive up defense spending, tells the Munich Security Conference that Europe's primary threat rests 'from within,' and looks set to be much less of a reliable ally going forward. Against such a backdrop the implications for Europe's defense industry could be profound. Breaking Defense sat down with Saab CEO Micael Johannson on Sunday on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference to discuss transatlantic tension, the potential for a European 'coalition of the willing' to fund major, collaborative defense projects, the state of Saab's weapons production and plans to flight test optionally manned and unmanned Swedish future fighter demonstrators over the next four years. This interview has been edited lightly for length and clarity. MICAEL JOHANSSON: First of all, I do think that a strong transatlantic link is still important, and I don't think we should sort of jump into too many conclusions [or] we should give up on that obviously. Since we have operations in the US I don't think that is so much affected by this. This is a local business. Locally perceived, important stuff for the US DoD and the defense forces in the US, and we are still pushing to grow that. We're building a new facility in Michigan to manufacture munitions and support weapons, of course, that's still absolutely in play. It's more on a political level, to decide, okay, 'how strong do we have to be in Europe?' We come from a peace dividend and if we didn't sort of hear the wake up call a number of years ago, when the [Ukraine] war started, or even back in 2014 [when Russia invaded Crimea] I mean, now we should sort of understand that we need to do more in Europe, nation by nation, of course, but also as part of the alliance, being a strong pillar in NATO. I think [this is] important and I wish that we could sort of get our act together to do a few more things together in Europe, to create scale and identify a number of flagship projects that we need as capabilities [from the] European perspective, and also being aligned with what NATO needs going forward for a regional defense, but also as a strong sort of deterrence capability [in] Europe. We can identify those projects. We all talk about integrating air and missile defense systems. We have great defense industries that would support that. We have unmanned, collaborative combat aircraft. We have all these things with critical underwater infrastructure [threats] that we have to manage somehow. We can do more on the sensor side, on [the] space side, we could do more on sovereign security of supply when it comes to munitions and powder factories and stuff like that. How do we get there is the problem. A British Army Pathfinder Regiment soldier test fires Saab next generation light anti-tank weapon or NLAW (UK MoD) The European Commission was talking a couple of days ago about having a deficit break by triggering an emergency clause [effectively allowing governments more flexibility over defense spending]. Is that the right path to take? If this sort of triggers nations within Europe to take the next step to spend more then I think that is probably a very good way to go, nation by nation. I'm not sure that will help the collaboration issue. I'm more looking at our Commission having defense and security really high on the agenda. We have a new defense commissioner [Andrius Kubilius] that is writing his white paper together with Kaja Kallas [European Commission vice president] and [come] 14 March, we will see what that includes. I think theoretically, these are good initiatives to try and create some sort of European defense industrial program, with those flagships, the projects that I mentioned as examples. But then of course we need all the countries agreeing, by consensus, 27 of us, that we want to put money into this, substantial money. We are not talking about €1.5 billion ($1.56 billion) in Europe [the proposed budget of the European Defence Industry Programme]. We're talking hundreds of billions of euros, I think, over a time period to do this. Will that happen? I don't know. But if that is not manageable from an EU Commission perspective, we need to see a coalition of the willing, because when I look upon this, it seems countries have different views of the threat environment. I mean, it's obvious in the Baltic states, in Poland, maybe Germany, Sweden, Finland, maybe a few others that really want to, sort of step up and do things. (Days after Breaking Defense spoke with Johansson the Financial Times reported that the European Union is considering reallocating €93 billion of unused COVID recovery funds to the defense sector.) Saab has shared plans to hit a production target, across all of its ground combat weapons, of 400,000 units per year from 2025. Is that on track? Yes, we are on par with what we expect in terms of output, and we have a huge backlog now to execute also and so that will come into play at the end of this year. Are you able to give a figure for 2026, will it level out or increase? It will go beyond [the 2025 production rate] but I won't specify a number It will happen when our [Carl-Gustaf M4 shoulder launched recoilless rifle] facility in India comes into play in 2026 and also in the US [Michigan munitions facility] at the end of 2026. Production increase is also planned with our missile capability, short range air defense capability, and also sensor capability. That's why we opened a new [Giraffe 1X air surveillance radar] facility in Fareham to be able to manufacture, or start to manufacture the 1x at large scale. So we are investing heavily, a bit more front loaded than we assumed a couple of years ago, but it's the right thing to do. Pal Jonson, Sweden's defense minister, has said the government expects to launch a future fighter 'inquiry.' Is that a good step politically to also tie in with future fighter activities from the Swedish Armed Forces and studies already underway? It's public news that there is a concept program ongoing where the alternatives are, continue the way we do it today which is in itself, of course, an ecosystem of companies joining to support us as the prime. The other option is to join, and I am not saying SCAF [Future Combat Air System] or GCAP [Global Combat Air Programme] but finding an international partnership, but it is very important to retain the OEM [Original Equipment Manufacturer] capabilities that we have. I can't foresee that we will throw that out the window after nine decades of cost efficient, highly performing platforms being developed and manufactured. The third alternative would be to buy something off the shelf, which I have a hard time seeing, that Sweden would actually turn that way because that would mean lots of cost and infrastructure effects and stuff like that. They will do some sort of assessment on the three alternatives. I don't know when exactly they will come to a conclusion. Sweden could decide on which procurement path to take for a future fighter designed to replace Saab's Gripen fighter jet earlier than expected, company CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense (Saab) We are supporting the program. We're doing concepting and we will fly things over time and they stated between 2028 and 2030 they have to take this decision. I think it will happen a bit earlier, but that's my personal view, we need to settle which way we go because that's good for us, that's good for Sweden, good for the [NATO] alliance. Of course there will be assessments, but I cannot see that there will be a request for information or something like that, sent out [to industry]. Do you think we will see anything flying soon [from Saab on the future fighter concept phase]? Absolutely we will definitely fly things. Manned or unmanned? Unmanned [flight testing around] 2027-2028. Before that, we will probably fly something optionally manned, and maybe partly show off some mission sort of capability that would be more AI than pilot-oriented. The AI package would be developed in-house or from a start up? We have a collaboration with Helsing. We work with them, and we also have an equity stake. So of course, we will use AI from the company broadly. But of course, we're looking into what can support more efficient missions when using AI agents. I won't go into details around that. Are you happy with the level of funding provided for future fighter related activities? We are on contract for lots of these things. There will be more to come. Touching on the GlobalEye joint Nordic purchase idea, do you think there will be an agreement soon? I hope so. It's mainly sort of a discussion between the politicians, MoDs and defense forces, around [the question of] what sort of capability do we need? Do we need to add one or two platforms and/or if Finland or Denmark would join that to start with. Of course, that would be great and I think we need that capability, not only for the Nordics, but also the Arctic perspective, to be able to cover that. As the UAE deal is complete, what are your GlobalEye export priorities? I think there's an interest from France. Hopefully we can get the Germans interested. I'd love to see it as an interim solution at least for the NATO iAFSC [initial Allied Future Surveillance and Control] as they call it. I know the E-7 has been selected, but there's some sort of schedule problem there, I think, so we are offering [GlobalEye] if there's an interest, but then we go nation by nation. We have some interest or potential customers that are interested in Asia-Pacific region, but also Middle East. There are quite a few sort of leads or campaigns [happening]. Has Saab made first Gripen E deliveries to Satenas air base yet? We have delivered [aircraft] to the FMV [Swedish Defence Materiel Administration] test center. Given news around a possible F-35 sale to India, do you see that as a competitive issue for the Gripen campaign? We have a very competitive opportunity. We've said to them that we're prepared to more or less build a small Linköping [Gripen's Swedish manufacturing base] in India, to transfer technology, build production, and also knowledge transfer for a platform like Gripen [is important]. It has to be a highly performing platform, which it is and I think it's suitable for what they need. But then again, I can't judge politically how discussions are going. Is there a commensurate type loss on T-7 for Saab, in line with Boeing's losses? It's not proportional at all to what Boeing has written off, which is public information and I won't give you a number, but is that substantial? Absolutely not. I think the investors have sort of understood that if you look upon the combination of aerostructures which has not been giving us black numbers over the last few years, but will go into a positive sort of scenario now — [when you consider] T-7 and then Gripen — we've always said that it should be sort of high single digit numbers [for profitability]. They're now being pushed down a bit, and you are roughly at 6 percent I think, 5.9 percent last year for aeronautics. So that gives you a feeling.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-ceo-floats-euro-defense-coalition-plans-to-fly-unmanned-combat-demonstrator/	2025-02-21T01:05:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/11/20210220-en-3896563-1-scaled-e1637694229726.jpg
As ‘dome’ air defense discussions rage, Turkey’s Aselsan sees an opening: CEO	Aselsan showcases its wares at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — As the US is sorting out what exactly an American Iron Dome will look like, Turkey is forging ahead with its own Steel Dome — and eyeing potential exports for such air defense systems to both NATO allies and eager Gulf customers, according to a senior Turkish executive. 'The Steel Dome is very promising system. All nations want to have this kind of system,' Ahmet Akyol, president and CEO of Turkish electronics giant Aselsan, told Breaking Defense here in Abu Dhabi. 'We are a member of NATO. These are our allies. Also we have got many brother countries in this [Gulf] region and all around the world. So the decision is [a] government decision, but we are ready to contribute [to] peace and prosperity of all brother and allied nation nations.' Announced in August 2024 and with a name that invokes Israel's multi-layered defense system that includes its Iron Dome platform, Steel Dome is meant to be a network-centric air defense system equipped with artificial intelligence and is expected to protect Turkey’s entire airspace from 'very low altitude to very high altitude' and 'very short range to long range' threats, according to a statement issued at the time by the government’s Presidency of Defense Industries (SSB). Aselsan is one of a handful of Turkish firms, including ballistics maker Roketsan, charged with making the concept a reality. Akyol said there is no projected end date for the Steel Dome to be complete, as it's a layered system that's continuously updated. 'We can provide this solution for Turkey and for allied countries right now,' Akyol said. 'So in Turkey, this is in progress. Every year we are delivering new systems of the Steel Dome concept, and it will be beneficial for our region.' As for the name, the American plan has come under no small amount of criticism since Iron Dome refers to a layer of Israel's overall system that would not be practical for many US air defense needs. Asked whether Steel Dome was a better fit for Turkey's needs, even if it echoed the Israeli original, Akyol said, 'The name is not important the concept is important,' adding the name was chosen by the government not the firm. Akyol's mention of the potential to deliver air defense systems to partners in the region will likely be welcome news to Gulf militaries. Other defense firm executives told Breaking Defense during IDEX 2025 that the region is eager for air defenses following the rash of missile and drone threats in recent years. 'Especially after drone and kamikaze attack attacks in the region, [in] Yemen and other conflicts, there is a huge demand for air defense systems and also guidance kits,' he said. More broadly Aselsan is making a push into the Gulf, to deepen ties here. 'We are opening new entities in this region. Just last week, I was in Oman and opened a new entity in Oman. And also we have got some production facilities like in Jordan,' he said. 'So in this region, the trend and the demand is to increase local contribution.' Akyol said that Aselsan is open for technology transfer. He added that the firm will convert its office in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to an excellence center. 'We will have design capabilities in house, in these offices. And also we have got some discussions [for] new joint ventures. Saudi Arabia is one of the key countries for our activities. And day by day, we are increasing activities in Saudi Arabia,' he told Breaking Defense. After mending ties between Riyadh and Ankara, Turkish firms started to have increased cooperation opportunities in the Saudi market, the largest importer of defense platforms in the Gulf region. That included another Turkish firm, Baykar, selling its AKINCI drones to the Kingdom in 2023. Akyol added that with Abu Dhabi there are 'some technology of transfer and production opportunities are also on the table.' He saw increased regional demand in the following areas: radars, air defense systems, electro-optics and naval platforms. But Aseslan is also eyeing expansion far from the Gulf, including further into Western Europe, the Far East and Latin America. 'We will have additional capacities and new partnerships, and we will have a more presence in these regions in 2025, and other upcoming years,' he said. 'We will be one of the 30 largest defense companies in defense 100 list in 2030,' Akyol predicted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/as-dome-air-defense-discussions-rage-turkeys-aselsan-sees-an-opening-ceo/	2025-02-20T23:07:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250221_aselsan_booth_AGNES-scaled-e1740120506769.jpg
DoD reviewing ‘non-essential’ consultancy contracts for termination	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department has ordered all acquisition shops to review consulting service contracts to determine whether they are essential to Trump administration priorities, and terminate those deemed not to fit that bill. 'To ensure we are accountable for every dollar we spend and that we are aligned with the President of the United States’ America First priorities and Secretary of Defense [Pete] Hegseth’s direction, Component heads will conduct a comprehensive review and validation of existing contracts for consulting services,' states the Feb. 18 memo [PDF] memo signed by Steven Morani, who is performing the duties of DoD's undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment. The memo mandates an assessment of 'the essentiality of contracts &#8230; for the purpose of terminating or descoping contracts for activities that are not essential for the Department to fulfill its statutory purposes.' Components are organizations within the Pentagon that have acquisition authority. Morani's memo, first reported by DefenseScoop, is addressed to 'senior Pentagon leadership, defense agencies and DoD field activities directors.' The DoD review is taking place in two parts: first looking at contracts let under the General Services Administration vehicle, then other types of contracts. Component heads have until March 19 to submit to the results of the first review and until April 19 for the second. The memo doesn't define 'consulting services,' so it is unclear what exactly will fall under the review and how much money is currently being spent on these types of contracts. However, according to a 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, DoD spent between $184 billion to $226 billion from 2017 to 2022 on all types of 'service contracts,' including administrative and technical support. That said, the report noted that data is hard to collect as the various offices within the DoD do not use the same criteria to keep track of such spending. Morani explains that if certain consultancy contracts are found to be 'essential,' then a 'short justification' including a validation of the requirement by 'a General Officer/Senior Executive Service member' should be provided. The memo comes against the backdrop of Hegseth ordering Pentagon leaders to redirect roughly $50 billion planned for the fiscal 2026 budget request towards a set of priorities that better align with Trump's goals for the department, as well as the arrival of Elon Musk's DOGE team at the Pentagon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-reviewing-non-essential-consultancy-contracts-for-termination/	2025-02-20T15:31:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/hegseth-confirmation-scaled-e1736870161374.jpg
GE, Pratt clear key design milestone, begin building next-gen engine prototypes	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — Engine makers GE Aerospace and RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney have both formally passed a key design milestone for the Air Force’s Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion (NGAP) program, paving the way for the two companies to begin building their respective prototypes. GE Aerospace said in a statement Wednesday that its prototype design, dubbed the XA102, cleared what’s known as Detailed Design Review (DDR), the final step before work to construct the engine can commence. In a statement today, Pratt similarly announced that its NGAP offering, called the XA103, has also cleared the DDR milestone. 'GE Aerospace is making great strides with model-based engineering, which has been instrumental in the success of the XA102 engine design,' Steve Russell, vice president and general manager of Edison Works at GE Aerospace, said in the company’s press release. 'As we transition into the procurement and build phase, we will continue to incorporate this innovative approach while working closely with our supply chain partners to advance the engine toward a full-scale demonstration.' In its announcement, Pratt asserted that the company completed the 'first fully digital' DDR for its NGAP candidate, emphasizing the growing importance of digital design tools that support weapon systems development for the Pentagon. 'For decades, propulsion has been a key differentiator for the United States, and we are working with the US Air Force to make sure it stays that way,' Chris Flynn, Pratt vice president of Military Development Programs, said in a statement. 'Collaborating with the US Air Force, we have supported every generation of jet engine development since World War II. XA103, our adaptive engine for the future, will continue to advance our digital and agile design and development capabilities while advancing the propulsion capability for the warfighter.' The announcements follow a new round of contracts issued by the Air Force in January for the NGAP program, which raised the total award ceiling for each vendor to $3.5 billion each. The Air Force is expected to assess the performance of each prototype once they begin testing later this decade, and make a down-select decision from there. The 'adaptive' engine technologies underpinning the NGAP program could herald a leap in military propulsion, Air Force officials have said, because they can change the characteristics of a jet engine in flight to enable features like more fuel efficient cruising or increased thrust. The designs for both companies draw heavily from work previously conducted under the Air Force’s Adaptive Engine Transition Program, which constructed a new, prototype engine for the F-35 but was ultimately passed over due to budgetary constraints and other logistical concerns. The NGAP engines have principally been intended to power the service’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter, though the sixth-gen jet is currently in limbo after being paused by the Biden administration and awaits a review by the new Trump team. NGAD is now the only publicly known potential recipient of adaptive engine technologies for the US military, following a disclosure last year by the Navy to Aviation Week that its own next-gen fighter in the works, called F/A-XX, will instead rely on more traditional propulsion designs. The exquisite NGAP powerplant has also been identified by former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall as a potential source of cost savings for the NGAD fighter, whose projected price of several hundred million dollars per copy could prove prohibitive. Among other changes that could be made to the fighter, reducing the complexity of its engine could be one option to make the aircraft more affordable, Kendall said. Internal Air Force analysis recently validated the requirement for a manned, sixth-gen fighter, Breaking Defense previously reported. It’s not clear what the Trump administration may decide, though the fighter was notably not exempt from an order by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to pare back about 8 percent of projected spending for the next five fiscal years, which will free up money to shift toward the administration’s priorities. A project to field a fleet of drone wingmen known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft, however, was expressly put off limits, according to a memo from Hegseth and obtained by Breaking Defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/ge-pratt-clear-key-design-milestone-begin-building-next-gen-engine-prototypes/	2025-02-20T12:38:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
Denmark to pass 3 percent GDP on defense over fear of Russian rearmament	Danish officials address media regarding an increased defense spending plan (Danish MoD) BELFAST — Based on a strategic assessment that Russia could rearm faster than NATO should the war in Ukraine end or turn into a frozen conflict, Denmark says it plans on injecting an additional 50 billion DKK ($7 billion) to its defense budget over 2025-2026. The uplift will see the Nordic nation exceed 3 percent GDP on military spending. In a translated statement from Wednesday, the government said the extra money will speed up the 'building of the Armed Forces' combat power,' and be drawn from an 'Acceleration Fund.' Copenhagen did not specify which weapon systems the new fund will be used to acquire, but laid out its security fears in clear terms. The Danish Ministry of Defence 'assesses that when the war in Ukraine stops or freezes and NATO does not arm itself at the same pace, Russia will be able to free up significant military resources and, within about 2 years, pose a credible threat to one or more NATO countries in the Baltic Sea region, if the US does not get involved,' it said. The warning that Russia could rearm within two years is not out of step with comments from other regional officials. During a recent trip to Washington, Lt. General Carl-Johan Edström, Sweden's Chief of Defense Staff, told Breaking Defense that it will take only a few years for Russia to rearm itself if the Ukraine conflict freezes. RELATED: Ticking clock: Northern NATO defense chiefs see ever-closing ‘window’ to prepare for Russia 'If you're a country with the border to Russia, then you say two to three years. And if you're really far away, then you say maybe five to 10 years,' he said. 'You have to look at that perspective, maybe five years, maybe less. Not more.' European powers are still struggling to come to terms with the reality of urgently having to do more to protect the continent without relying on the US for renewed support. US President Donald Trump labelling Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a 'dictator' and speculating that 'he is not going to have a country left' have only heightened concerns in the region that Washington is prepared to negotiate a peace deal along pro-Russian lines and without any involvement from Kyiv or NATO allies. 'The current security situation demands political action from European allies,' Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen said during a Wednesday press conference, according to a post on X. Washington also continues to test bilateral relations with Copenhagen through its push to buy Greenland, which has included hints from Trump that he would be open to military action to take it over. The island is a self-governing territory that remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark. In January, Denmark’s Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen quashed the US military takeover idea, telling local broadcaster TV 2 'I don’t have the imagination to imagine us getting there.' Copenhagen's latest spending pledge comes after it also committed last month to spend $2.04 billion on new naval vessels, long-range drones and improved space capabilities in a bid to strengthen Arctic security.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/denmark-to-pass-3-percent-gdp-on-defense-over-fear-of-russian-rearmament/	2025-02-20T12:03:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/pressemode-stm-2025-artikel-e1740080003703.jpg
Trump administration weighing C-UAS role in Iron Dome for America, two-star general explains	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. (US Army/ Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — Pentagon officials are crafting a plan to expand the United States’s missile defense system under the 'Iron Dome for America' initiative, and grappling with whether new tech to down aerial drones should also be included, according to a two-star Army general. 'There's talk about does that involve counter-UAS [unmanned aerial systems] or will counter-UAS be established [separately],' Maj. Gen. David Stewart told Breaking Defense earlier this month. Stewart — dual hatted as the director for the Joint Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office and Army fires — said he and his team are working with Pentagon leaders and other agencies to determine just what route to take. In late January, President Donald Trump issued the Iron Dome for America executive order calling for greater investments for a multilayered homeland air defense system, including a requirement for the development of space-based interceptors. That order started a 60-day clock for Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to develop a plan to defend the homeland against 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.' 'What do we have right now that gets out [to] the cutting edge [and] is that the right capability, versus what do we need to invest in,' Stewart later added. The proliferation of aerial drones on the battlefield has been pushing the services to focus on new counter-drone weapons for years to varying degrees of success. More recently, though, there have been a plethora of reports of drone sightings and incursions on military installations throughout the US. 'I have no doubt that there’s significantly more incursions that we don’t see, either with a system or with our eyeballs,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told reporters in October 2024. At the time, the four-star general speculated that those events are gaining more attention due to the spread of systems that are able to detect and track UAS with greater 'fidelity.' And while drone sightings at locations with highly classified programs have prompted questions of if adversary nations are behind the operations, Guillot said that he has not yet seen evidence of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus' and that the 'overwhelming majority of them are probably local hobbyists that are just flying too close to the base.' Regardless of if many of those incidents are from hobbyists or not, Stewart said the new administration is taking the potential threat 'very seriously' and pushing the DoD and other entities like the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration and local law enforcement to work together. But red tape abound. US regulations and policy, for example, limit just which C-UAS systems can be used on the homeland. While there are expectations depending on the location, by and large, only 'low-collateral effectors' are used to down drones inside the continental US — think jamming or spoofing the radio frequency link between the controller and the drone, a net to capture the drone or using one drone to ram the other drone. This has meant that the military services have had to find innovative ways to test out new C-UAS against real threats. When the Army wanted soldier feedback on its new Stryker-mounted 50-kilowatt laser weapons against drones last year, it sent the four prototypes into the Middle East. In a similar vein, the service is also planning to test new high-powered microwave C-UASs over there. 'The full breadth of capability is not authorized to be used in the United States, in the homeland,' Stewart said. Ultimately, though, that may need to change under a more comprehensive C-UAS plan that is either part of the Iron Dome for America umbrella or a standalone. 'There is no single silver bullet,' Stewart added. 'We have to look at is a layered approach that we look at both really exquisite capability to get after a threat, but also trying to get after more affordable capability, and just trying to make sure that we use the right tool and provide the warfighter the right tools to get after this mission.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-administration-weighing-c-uas-role-in-iron-dome-for-america-two-star-general-explains/	2025-02-20T11:15:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/5356116-scaled-e1738101657589.jpg
Navy relieves captain of carrier that hit merchant vessel	Exterior damage of USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) viewed from a ship’s rigid-hull inflatable boat following a collision with merchant vessel Besiktas-M, Feb. 12. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Cody Beam) WASHINGTON — The captain in command of the US Navy aircraft carrier that collided with a merchant vessel near an Egyptian port last week has been relieved by the head of his carrier strike group, the service announced today. Rear Adm. Sean Bailey, commander of Carrier Strike Group 8, relieved Capt. Dave Snowden on Feb. 20 due to a 'loss of confidence in his ability to command,' according to the statement. The Navy rarely divulges specific reasons why commanders are relieved, opting instead to use the phrase 'loss of confidence' as a catchall explanation. But in this instance, the service directly attributed Snowden's firing to last week's collision. 'The relief occurred after Truman was involved in a collision with the merchant vessel Besiktas-M on Feb. 12, while operating in the Mediterranean Sea in the vicinity of Port Said, Egypt,' according to the statement. 'The U.S. Navy holds commanding officers to the highest standard and takes action to hold them accountable when those standards are not met. Naval leaders are entrusted with significant responsibilities to their Sailors and their ships.' Snowden will be temporarily re-assigned to Naval Air Forces Atlantic. Capt. Christopher Hill, commander of the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower, will temporarily serve as Truman's commander, according to the statement. The Truman reportedly pulled into port for repairs associated with the collision, and the Navy said Snowden's relief will have no impact on the ship's schedule.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/navy-relieves-captain-of-carrier-that-hit-merchant-vessel/	2025-02-20T10:38:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8871530-scaled-e1740076408529.jpg
Trump ‘clearly not happy’ with delivery schedule for new Air Force One jets, Boeing CEO says	US President Donald Trump gestures with a saber after cutting into a cake representation of the new Air Force One design during the Commander-In-Chief inaugural ball at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, DC, on January 20, 2025. (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Lengthy delays with the delivery of two Boeing 747 jumbo jets outfitted to serve as flying White Houses has drawn the ire of President Donald Trump, who is 'clearly not happy' with the lagging schedule to deliver the planes, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said today. 'I think he’s made that well-known,' Ortberg said during the Barclays Industrial Select Conference, referring to the commander-in-chief’s widely publicized dissatisfaction with Boeing’s management of the Air Force One program. The two jets, dubbed VC-25B, are set to replace older 747 models currently in service that regularly shuttle the US president around the globe. Trump personally intervened in the contract negotiations for the deal in 2018, and the ensuing work to modify the planes with features like a secure communications suite and the ability to survive a nuclear detonation has proven difficult for the beleaguered aerospace giant. Amid other woes like workforce disruptions and a fixed-price development contract that has forced Boeing to lose billions of dollars on the Air Force One program, delays have piled up, and now the first of the two planes may not deliver until 2029 or even later, Breaking Defense previously reported. The first jet was originally expected to be handed over in 2024. An updated schedule assessment from Boeing is anticipated in the spring. To help speed things up, Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) chief Elon Musk has now been tapped to intervene, a move Ortberg said he welcomed. 'Elon Musk is actually helping us a lot in working through the requirements on VC-25 to try to help us get the things that are non-value added constraints out of the way, so that we can move faster and get the president those airplanes delivered,' Ortberg said. 'He's a brilliant guy, so he's able to pretty quickly ascertain the difference between technical requirements and things that we can move out of the way, and he's helping us in a big way,' he continued. 'So I'm embracing that, working with the DOGE team to help us improve the delivery.' Noting that an accelerated schedule can help reduce the risk of further cost overruns, Ortberg concluded that he is 'all in on trying to pull these airplanes up and get the president his airplanes delivered to him, which is what he wants.' Vexed by the schedule setbacks, Trump has openly mused about finding alternatives, telling reporters flying aboard Air Force One on Wednesday that he was considering buying other used Boeing aircraft from a foreign seller. It’s not clear how that plan might work to potentially save time, as any other jets will need to be acquired and retrofitted similar to the work Boeing is doing. But other companies could theoretically compete for such a deal: In April 2024, the Air Force awarded the mid-size firm SNC a contract worth $13 billion to convert used 747s into the service’s next fleet of 'Doomsday' planes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/trump-clearly-not-happy-with-delivery-schedule-for-new-air-force-one-jets-boeing-ceo-says/	2025-02-20T09:34:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2194465096-scaled-e1740070941499.jpg
Air Force awards Pratt $1.5 billion to keep F-22s flying	An F-22 Raptor takes off from Al Dhafra Air Base, United Arab Emirates, Feb. 21, 2022. The F-22s were rapidly deployed to the base earlier in the month on order from the U.S. Secretary of Defense in coordination with the Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and join a range of joint, coalition and allied and partner combat airpower capabilities already based in the region. (U.S. Air Force (photo by Master Sgt. Dan Heaton) WASHINGTON — The Air Force has awarded RTX subsidiary Pratt &amp; Whitney a contract worth up to $1.5 billion to continue sustaining the F119 engine that powers the service’s F-22 Raptor stealth fighters, the company announced today. The sustainment contract for Pratt’s F119 spans three years, according to the company, covering more than 400 powerplants. The single-seat F-22 flies with two engines and is often hailed for its ability to 'supercruise,' or soar at supersonic speeds without using afterburners. 'The F119’s readiness and reliability rates have never been more important, and we are improving both while lowering lifecycle costs,' Jill Albertelli, president of Pratt’s military engines business, said in a statement. 'We are committed to helping our U.S. Air Force customer maintain the F-22’s combat edge.' In a briefing with reporters ahead of the announcement, Caroline Cooper, Pratt’s executive director for the F119 program, reiterated past projections that the company’s Usage Based Lifing effort launched in 2022 — which essentially leverages flight data and engineering algorithms so that maintenance isn’t performed until it’s actually necessary — will save over $800 million across the engine’s lifespan. Asked about assumptions underpinning that forecast, such as fresh uncertainties concerning the longevity of the F-22 fleet given questions about its planned replacement, Pratt said in a statement that the 'constant flow of data' collected from ongoing flight operations 'is continuously re-analyzed and allows the customer to take advantage of the full life of the engine parts while reducing risk to the fleet.' (Company executives have previously explained that the $800 million prediction means that the Air Force can continue operating the fighter the same as it has in the past, but save money by running parts longer, or harness the greater durability of parts to squeeze more performance out of the engine.) Additionally, according to Cooper, Pratt is exploring how to incorporate additively manufactured, or 3D printed, parts into the F119, but deferred on specifics until an announcement is ready at a later date. 'I can say with certainty that we're looking at leveraging additive across Pratt,' she said. RELATED: Turbine ‘fatigue’ issue forced F-22 engine retrofit, Air Force says The Raptor’s development began near the end of the Cold War and continued through the 1990s, though the cessation of superpower competition drove a decision to limit production to 187 copies of the fighter. The airframe itself is built by Lockheed Martin. The Air Force’s Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) fighter was originally envisioned as a direct replacement of the F-22, though the sixth-gen jet is currently in limbo pending a decision by the Trump administration. While NGAD was planned as an air superiority fighter like the F-22 that precedes it, former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall said in January that as officials weigh alternatives for the platform, one option could be developing it as a multirole fighter tasked with quarterbacking a forthcoming fleet of drone wingmen. '[T]o keep the industrial base going, to get the right concept, the right mix of capability into the Air Force, and do it as efficiently as possible, I think there are a couple of really reasonable options on the table that the next administration is going to want to have to take a look at,' Kendall said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/air-force-awards-pratt-1-5-billion-to-keep-f-22s-flying/	2025-02-20T06:00:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/7063324-scaled-e1660672633444.jpg
What’s new in naval tech? Highlights from WEST 2025	Every year, luminaries from the naval community gather in San Diego for the annual WEST conference. Yes, San Diego in February. Never let it be said the sea service isn’t clever. This year’s show was a little different, however. Because the Trump administration is only a few weeks old and no civilians have been confirmed to top navy roles, there was a bit of a leadership vacuum. But that worked out just fine for Breaking Defense reporters Justin Katz and Carley Welch, who were on the ground digging around for the latest naval technologies.

Papua New Guinea, Australia begin hammering out first defense treaty	Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles with Papua New Guinea Defense Minister, Billy Joseph, in Brisbane on Feb. 20, 2025 where they announced the two countries hope to draft and sign a defense treaty. (ADF) TOKYO — A half-century after gaining independence from Australia, the Pacific island state of Papua New Guinea (PNG) and its giant neighbor are negotiating what the two sides hope will become a defense treaty, elevating their security relationship at a tense time in the region. 'This will be a treaty with ambition. It will be the most significant defense agreement between our two countries since Papua New Guinean independence,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles told reporters in Brisbane today. It will be 'really fitting' if this country signs a defense treaty with Australia, 'because we got independence from Australia, and, at the same time, we are very close to each other,' PNG's defense minister, Billy Joseph, said at the press conference. Australia created the first Papuan defense force in 1943 to help drive the Japanese out of the Pacific islands during the Second World War and now regularly trains with their forces. Marles said the pending agreement would be 'a pathway of increasing integration and increasing interoperability' with its neighbor just three kilometers to the north. The two countries came close to signing a treaty in December last year but it foundered due to criticism from some PNG politicians. 'The Bilateral Security Agreement that came into effect last December was originally intended to be a treaty-level document, but the PNG side pushed back on that because of perceived legal hurdles with respect to the PNG Constitution,' noted Mihai Sora, a Pacific Islands expert at Sydney's Lowy Institute, international think tank. The treaty is likely to focus on the 'traditional and non-traditional security cooperation where Australia is already a key partner for PNG: military, police, cyber, climate, and so on,' Sora said. But there will probably be more, if not quite a NATO-style pledge that all will come to the aid of any state attacked (Article 5), he said. Sora expected it to likely be an exclusionary pact, one focused on PNG not entering a defense or security agreement with a country, like, say, China. Australia has already forged such agreements with the tiny island states of Nauru and Tuvalu. They allow Australia to veto agreements the islands might try to make with any other country. Australia isn't alone in its focus on PNG. The United States signed an agreement with PNG in May last year. Perhaps the biggest benefit of the deal in the long run for the United States is that it gives US forces access to the joint Australian-PNG facility on Manus Island, where the US built facilities during World War II. Australia is spending at least $175 million AUD ($112 million US) to improve the port. That signing was followed by the first visit to the island state by a US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin. But there are questions about whether these bilateral agreements are the best approach to take with the Pacific Islands. 'Australian governments have been quick to claim these bilateral arrangements as diplomatic wins. But they are the diplomatic equivalent of a Mars Bar: the government gets the sugar-rush of making an announcement, but there is no guarantee that these arrangements will deliver long-term outcomes,' argued Joanne Wallis, a professor in Pacific studies at the University of Adelaide, and her colleague, Salote Tagivakatini, a former Fijian diplomat, in a recent paper for the Australian Institute of International Affairs. They point to the decision by the minuscule Cook Islands, whose residents are citizens of New Zealand, to sign a 'comprehensive strategic partnership' with China as proof this bilateral approach might not be as effective as hoped. The Cook Islands leadership, which is supposed to consult with New Zealand on security and defense issues, failed to do so recently when deciding to sign a strategic pact with China, according to the New Zealand news outlet RNZ. Wallis and Tagivakatini argue the unique culture of the Pacific islands, where governments regard themselves as a 'family' and try to work together on the basis of consensus, runs counter to the spirit of what they call 'transactional' bilateral agreements. The authors say this approach 'risks undermining the Pacific Islands Forum and other regional agencies. Pacific leaders have made clear their desire for Pacific-led regionalism.' But John Blaxland, an Indo-Pacific expert at the Australian National University, said he believes that 'great power competition is more acute today than it has been for generations.' Papua New Guinea is now as important to Australia as it has ever been, and he stressed competition for access and influence has intensified in recent months and years. 'Consolidating and formalizing a defense treaty makes sense in view of the shifting security and defense dynamics,' Blaxland told Breaking Defense. This treaty, should it be signed, 'can't be taken for granted,' he wrote in an email. 'This is a time of what can be described as unrestricted competition in the legal, media, psychological and economic domains. Australia cannot afford to rest on its laurels about maintaining deep, trusted and effectively collaborative relations between Australia and PNG.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/papua-new-guinea-australia-begin-hammering-out-first-defense-treaty/	2025-02-20T04:03:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250220adf8671822_6893-scaled-e1740052603340.jpeg
Hanwha’s new global defense chief eyes aggressive expansion in every direction	A Hanwha K9 howitzer on display at IDEX 2025. (Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — On the job for less than two months, the new head of global defense business for Hanwha Aerospace has his sights set on helping to make the South Korean defense firm a major industrial player worldwide. Just don't ask him to prioritize one market over another. 'So to be a global leader we need position in the largest defense markets in the world &#8230; [the] United States, Europe, Middle East, Asia. So I would say you have to be focused on all of them,' Michael Coulter, who was appointed to the role in December, told Breaking Defense in an interview from Hanwha's expansive floor space at IDEX 2025 here in Abu Dhabi. Encouraged in recent years by a more defense export-friendly government in Seoul, Coulter said Hanwha made significant strides before his tenure to go global, including major contract wins in Australia, Poland, Romania and Egypt. But he said the company now aims to use each as a springboard to more business in each region. 'We've been doing export for 15, 20 years, but it's just been in recent years that we've really been reaching out to create [a] global defense industrial base, creating global partnerships, partnerships in local countries,' he said. Coulter, who was at Leonardo DRS before joining Hanwha, described the US as a key market, but acknowledged the firm has a 'modest' presence there so far. A 2023 rejection for the Optionally Manned Fighting Vehicle, he said, has not stopped the company's 'commitment' to the American military market, and there are discussions with the US Army about 'various capabilities.' (Coulter did not identify any specifically, but Breaking Defense has reported that Hanwha's howitzer was among those recently observed when Army officials went on a global evaluation tour.) Michael Coulter, head of global defense at Hanwha Aerospace, speaks to Breaking Defense at IDEX 2025. (Courtesy Hanwha) Naval systems could also be a significant opportunity for Hanwha in the US, as Coulter said there have been discussions with the Navy about leveraging Hanwha's recent takeover of Philly Shipyard to eventually bolster the service's fleet. Coulter said Hanwha is keeping an especially close eye on Europe, where Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and the expected shift of US military support away from the continent under the Trump administration have spurred European nations to race to shore up their own capabilities. 'As European defense budgets increase, its important for us bring the strength of Korea but also to be European,' Coulter said. 'So we are investing in partnerships and facilities and workforce in Europe.' The deal with Romania in which Hanwha will build a facility to be a 'production house for land force capability' is also meant to give the firm 'really a domestic industrial base in Europe,' Coulter said. 'We're having similar conversations in Poland and in other countries in Europe as well.' As for the Middle East, Hanwha took the opportunity at IDEX to bring in a full-sized K9 howitzer, showing publicly for the first time a version of the platform that used a Korean-built engine. The first Korean-made K9s are expected to go operational with the Egyptian military later this year, a Hanwha spokesperson told Breaking Defense, with locally produced versions expected in 2026. Beyond Egypt, Coulter said there are 'very active' conversations in the Gulf with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Regionally, he said, there's 'sincere' concern about the threat of ballistic missiles and therefore there's an appetite for defenses against them — another investment area for Hanwha. Finally in the Indo-Pacific region, Coulter highlighted Hanwha's expected outsized presence in South Korea, but also its victories in Australia in competitive infantry fighting vehicle and howitzer programs. The Lucky Country could be, Coulter said, another springboard to larger markets. 'We're producing those in Australia for use by the Australian military, but with an eye to being a global supplier out of a domestic presence in Australia,' he said. 'So, very strong support from the Commonwealth for not just further capabilities in Australia, but then to using that hub in Australia as a global supply chain platform.' But with all that said, Coulter said Hanwha is interested in expanding not just in a geographical sense, but a 'functional' one too. 'And that means building up partnerships around the world, be those partnerships with militaries and governments, to partnerships with technology companies, to partnerships with industrial partners to grow capacity around the world,' he said. That kind of 'functional growth,' Hanwha is 'very focused on.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/hanwhas-new-global-defense-chief-eyes-aggressive-expansion-in-every-direction/	2025-02-20T00:35:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250218_104955-scaled-e1739970691806.jpg
Saab unveils UAE-developed Coast Control Radar at IDEX 2025	Saab's UAE arm showcases a new radar at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — Sweden's Saab unveiled a new radar at the Abu Dhabi defense show IDEX, this one developed in the United Arab Emirates through the government-affiliated Tawazun Industrial Park. The next-generation Coast Control Radar, which was on display at IDEX 2025, is a static, non-rotating system that uses phased-array software. 'It's crucial to have this kind of new technique, [with] low maintenance [requirement], as it's a non-rotating radar. That is kind of the key features that takes this radar into the kind of next generation,' Saab’s UAE managing director Heléne Bittmann told Breaking Defense in an interview at the show. The new radar is designed to safeguard territorial waters and to detect smaller vessels at a time when maritime security poses a big concern in the Middle East region, especially in light of continuous attacks on shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Arabian Gulf. 'I think for the UAE, it's really important to be indigenous, having their own kind of securing and defense capabilities, making sure their people and society are kept safe,' Bittmann said. She added that Saab UAE is in continuous discussion with Tawazun, the governmental entity charged with procurement and development, to align with the country’s vision. 'Designed for easy integration into infrastructure such as buildings, towers, and waterway bridges, the Coast Control Radar ensures flexible installation and can offer comprehensive 360-degree coverage. Its modular design minimises installation challenges while also offering routine software upgrades for continued exceptional detection and performance,' the company said in a statement. The coast guard radar is the second system developed by Saab UAE and uses Emirati intellectual property. The other was DeployNet, a portable 5G network provider column that the company says can be easily deployed to provide network services in rural or remote environments. DeployNet was also on display at the firm’s exhibition display. 'We see that there is a global need for this [radar]. The [need] for this kind of radars for the Coast Guard, and even more so now securing waterways will become more and more important. So we do see a genuine interest,' Bittmann said. She expected that Saab UAE 'will have the opportunity to grow even more. That's my ambition. And they have invested a lot in the UAE, and we're here to stay and to continue to drive that.' Bittmann concluded that the firm’s next five-year plan is to continue to focus on the sensor software and radar capabilities.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/saab-unveils-uae-developed-coast-control-radar-at-idex-2025/	2025-02-19T22:51:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250220_IDEX_saab_radar_AGNES-e1740032823193.jpg
Pentagon seeks to shift $50B in planned funding to new priorities in FY26	Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is greeted by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, Jr. at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Jan. 27, 2025. (DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth has ordered a review of the department's fiscal 2026 budget plans in order to shift funds from legacy programs towards President Donald Trump's priorities, including border security and the Iron Dome for America. The goal: Find roughly $50 billion, or 8 percent of the FY26 plan, and reprioritize it. 'Secretary Hegseth has directed a review to identify offsets from the Biden Administration’s FY26 budget that could be realigned from low-impact and low-priority Biden-legacy programs to align with President Trump’s America First priorities for our national defense,' acting Deputy Secretary of Defense Robert Salesses said in a Wednesday night statement. 'The Department will develop a list of potential offsets that could be used to fund these priorities, as well as to refocus the Department on its core mission of deterring and winning wars. The offsets are targeted at 8% of the Biden Administration’s FY26 budget, totaling around $50 billion, which will then be spent on programs aligned with President Trump’s priorities.' While not noted in the Salesses statement, the Washington Post earlier today reported that the 8 percent shift would not just be for FY26, but for each year of the five-year long Future Years Defense Program (FYDP) that accompanies the annual budget request. After the statement was released, Breaking Defense obtained a portion of Hegseth's memo, which lists 17 'offsets' which 'may not be included by services and component in their eight percent decrease' recommendations. Those are: It's unclear what kind of programs will be targeted outside this list, although Salesses in his statement said the department will target 'unnecessary spending' like 'so-called &#8216;climate change' and other woke programs, as well as excessive bureaucracy.' It's also unclear if the decision not to exempt support for EUCOM, AFRICOM, CENTCOM or SOUTHCOM is a sign that those regions may be downplayed as priorities. It's not unusual for a new administration to take a look at the previous administration's planned budget, though the statement tonight would seem to indicate a greater shift than previous teams go for in their first budget request. This effort would seem to be a parallel but different one from the cuts expected to be pushed by the Elon Musk-led DOGE office, which arrived this week at the Pentagon. Those in defense circles are bracing for a wave of personnel cuts, perhaps as soon as this week, as probationary employees in the civilian workforce have been early targets of DOGE during their other stops. How the idea of cuts lines up with proposals in Congress to increase the department's budget by either $100 billion or $150 billion through the reconciliation process is unclear, nor is it clear how members of Congress will react to having programs — potentially major ones — in their districts impacted. It's also uncertain when the FY26 budget might actually be delivered to Congress.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-seeks-to-shift-50b-in-planned-funding-to-new-priorities-in-fy26/	2025-02-19T15:38:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/hegseth-brown-scaled-e1740007139471.jpg

(Photo by U.S. Army Network Enterprise Technology Command) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense is 14 percent of the way on its goal of having all enterprise networks zero trust compliant by the end of fiscal year 2027, a key official said Wednesday. 'Fourteen percent is a good start, but far from being done,' Col. Gary Kipe, chief of staff of the DoD’s zero trust portfolio management office, said during a panel at a CyberScoop event. He added that the 14 percent constitutes areas specifically where 'we could stop adversarial lateral movement within our network.' Kipe said there are two major deficiencies in the DoD’s zero trust capabilities keeping it from achieving that 100 percent readiness. The first is the lack of identity, credential, and access management (ICAM) tools — which perform constant checks to ensure that users are allowed to access the information they are trying to access. The second is the lack of automated data tagging that helps label and categorize data based on sensitivity, importance and other standards to facilitate better data management and protect the data from unauthorized users. 'We do have an optimistic but reasonable anticipation that we're going to have both of those by the end of this FY, which is critical,' Kipel said of the deficiencies. 'Then we'll be able to plan around it, resource it, proof of concept it and develop it further until we get to [20]27.' Kipe particularly harped on the important role data tagging plays in creating data centricity, which ultimately allows the DoD to share information on threats with the broader intelligence community, allies and partners, he explained. RELATED: Katie Arrington to head back into Pentagon as new CISO 'It's got to be interoperable between the DoD, [civilians in the federal government], the IC [intelligence community] and Five Eyes and other mission partner environments. We're not the only target that damn communists are trying to overcome,' Kipe said. 'They're trying to overcome freedom loving people around the world, and all of us are using the same data.' If such data tagging standards are not implemented, Kipe said 'it won’t matter because we will have lost the broader fight, and that is defending liberty around the world.' John Sahlin, the vice president of cyber solutions at General Dynamics Information Technology, echoed Kipe’s statements on the importance of data tagging leading to data centricity during the panel. 'Zero trust is about enabling a mission, and ultimately, we need to use that data collectively to pursue mission objectives, and those mission objectives include dangerous stuff,' Sahlin said, referencing Kipe’s anecdotes about the risk adversaries poses to democracy. He added that once the DoD can implement the 'basics' of data tagging and implementing zero trust at the enterprise level, it can start to more widely implement zero trust at the tactical edge — something the company demonstrated back in 2023. 'We need to be able to enable the mission commanders with the ability to make changes on the fly under what conditions and with whom we're sharing data, so that we can execute the mission,' Sahlin said. 'That's where it gets really interesting. If we get the basics right, then we could really do some cool stuff at the tactical edge.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagon-14-of-the-way-to-zero-trust-compliance-faces-challenges-with-icam-data-tagging/	2025-02-19T13:54:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/7974050-scaled.jpg
DoD needs to clarify Space Force roles and missions: Mitchell workshop	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon urgently needs to clarify the roles and missions of the Space Forceand how it relates to US Space Command, the Intelligence Community and the other military services,according to a new report from the Mitchell Institute. Only then will the newest military service be able to successfully articulate and advocate for its long-term needs to deter China with the US Congress, the executive branch and the American public, the report concludes. Those needs, the report stressed, include an explicit mandate and funding to develop and deploy 'offensive' weapons, as well as increased resources across the board. The report — 'Ensuring a Spacepower Advantage in Prolonged Competition: Findings and Recommendations from the Space Endurance Workshop' released today [PDF] — was the result of a two-day workshop involving 55 space experts from diverse backgrounds 'to examine how the United States, its allies, and partners can maintain an enduring spacepower advantage,' according to institute's website. The workshop also focused on a review of the 'theory of competitive endurance' put forward by Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman in 2023 to guide Space Force operations against six futuristic scenarios where US space power was challenged, and found it somewhat wanting. Charles Galbreath, one of the two Mitchell authors along with Jennifer Reeves, explained today that the problem with Saltzman's theory, identified during the workshop, is its focus on 'enduring' — resisting attacks via deterrence and resilience — rather than on 'winning.' 'The tenets of competitive endurance — responsible counterspace campaigning, domain awareness, resiliency in the architecture — those are solid lines of effort. It's kind of the wrapping, though, of competitive endurance, as opposed to a war winning concept, a war fighting strategy, that we think needs to change,' Galbreath said in response to a question from Breaking Defense during Mitchell's online rollout of the report. Key findings of the workshop included: The US Space Force Must Clearly Explain Its Roles and Missions. 'Failure to establish and convey these roles and missions could lead to confusion among the services, reduced funding from Congress, and a deterioration of national will to maintain leadership in space,' the report says. Thus, it adds, 'the Department of Defense needs to clearly define the roles and missions of the Space Force. Once defined, Space Force must pursue an aggressive and persistent campaign to communicate them.' Space Must Be Normalized as a Warfighting Domain. 'Normalizing space as a warfighting domain necessitates changes to policy, funding, understanding, and operational capabilities,' the report says. 'While some fear such developments could drive a destabilizing arms race in space, it is important to recognize that credible deterrence is the only viable path given adversary decisions. Peace through strength needs to become the new mantra for twenty-first century spacepower.' An Overreliance on Commercial Space May Be Detrimental. 'On one side, commercial space greatly expands access to rapid innovation and an increasing set of services available for integration. On the other, an overemphasis on the capabilities commercial entities can ostensibly provide detracts from the critical roles of the Space Force, which is dedicated to national space security in ways private entities are not,' the report explains. Guardians Must Adopt a Space Warfighting Mindset. 'The lack of defined and clearly articulated roles and missions, the lingering view of space as a benign domain, and the encroachment of commercial entities in space security roles have a compounding effect' on the way Guardians perceive themselves and their missions that undercut their ability to advocate the Space Force's criticality to future warfighting, the report finds. Improved Space Domain Awareness Is Critical. The report notes that each of the scenarios ran during the workshop 'underscored the importance' of space domain awareness, as well as the need to lower classification barriers to sharing space data with allies and partners. Allied and Partner Cooperation &amp; Integration Are Essential. 'Like the discussion on commercial space capabilities, workshop participants asserted that the Space Force needed to take a proactive leadership role in defining what effects and necessary contributions each ally and partner could provide,' the report says. Further, it recommends that the service expand force integration beyond the current 5 Eyes partners (Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom), up the number of Guardians working on partnerships, increase combined force exercises and 'enable' more space-related foreign military sales. Improved Space Warfighting Training Infrastructure is a Critical Enabler. Not only do the Space Force and SPACECOM need improved training capabilities and infrastructure, including 'advanced simulators,' for their own use, but also require the ability to allow allies and partners to train in tandem with Guardians. International Norms Are Key to Responsible Space Behaviors. 'By proactively defining which actions in space are acceptable and which will lead to the escalation of tensions, the United States will be positioned to rally international support to counter hostilities,' the report asserts. Reeves told Mitchell's online audience today that the institute will follow-up with another workshop in the October timeframe focusing specifically on what conflict in space might look like. Galbreath elaborated that the workshop will be held at the unclassified level, even though that will 'create some some tension for many people.' Doing so, he said, will allow 'thorough discussions' about, &#8216;What does space conflict mean? Where do we draw the line between competition and conflict? &#8230; Is there a tripwire for space'?' The goal, he added, is 'expanding the the field of thinking in that area, and looking at how if we ever do go to conflict, can we end it as quickly as possible on terms that are favor favorable to United States and our allies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-needs-to-clarify-space-force-roles-and-missions-mitchell-workshop/	2025-02-19T13:00:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240717_DVIDS_saltzman_speech_8238081-scaled-e1721238990255.jpg
Securing data at rest on Edge devices with layered protection	Keeping sensitive and classified mission data safe isn’t optional—it’s essential. Cyber threats are more sophisticated, compliance requirements are stricter than ever, and organizations must secure data across a growing mix of traditional and unconventional devices. From endpoint systems, including PCs and servers, to industrial control systems and unmanned vehicles, every device that collects, processes, and stores sensitive information is a potential target. Without a multi-layered approach to security, organizations risk unauthorized data access, potentially exposing critical mission information. To meet compliance requirements effectively, organizations must adopt an integrated security framework that protects data at rest while the device is in operation and at end of life. The White House, NSA, NIAP, and DISA have implemented requirements for encryption and secure authentication and access controls to meet compliance requirements, including CSfC for DAR, FIPs and EO 14028. However, compliance is only part of the equation—security measures also need to be practical, ensuring personnel can work efficiently while keeping data protected. Unfortunately, many traditional security methods fall short against today’s evolving threats. Risks include: To address these challenges, agencies must ensure data security at every layer, leveraging software and hardware-based solutions. The first line of defense in securing data at rest is ensuring that encryption and authentication mechanisms are robust and tamper-proof. Other data security products’ protection ceases once a device is activated. But mission data needs to be protected when a device is operational with capabilities to mitigate risks, including unauthorized data extraction, data tampering and malicious insiders. The development of quantum-computing capabilities makes effective data sanitization a necessity Cigent offers a comprehensive solution that secures data at rest throughout its entire lifecycle.

In response to Viasat suit, SDA will recompete 10-satellite award to Tyvak	Space Development Agency graphic WASHINGTON — As a result of a lawsuit by Viasat, the Department of the Air Force has agreed to revoke a Space Development Agency award to Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems worth $254 million for 10 experimental fire-control satellites, and reopen bidding. Documents filed on Feb. 14 in the US Court of Federal Claims by the Air Force, first reported by Aviation Week, further state that SDA's companion contract to York Space Systems — worth $170 million for 10 Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) Gamma variant prototype space vehicles — will not be affected. The court filings do not provide a proposed schedule for the new bid process, but do reveal that it will be managed by officials who were not involved in overseeing the original contract awards. Neither the Space Development Agency nor the Air Force responded by press time to inquiries about the proposed resolution of the protest. As first reported by Breaking Defense, the Viasat bid protest filed in September was the trigger for the Air Force's Jan. 16 decision to place SDA Director Derek Tournear on administrative leave. The Feb. 14 court documents state that an internal Air Force evaluation determined that an unnamed 'SDA employee,' in advance of the Gamma contract award, revealed to Tyvak that its bid price 'was the second highest and would not be selected for award.' This action was determined by the senior Air Force official in charge of the review, Maj. Gen. Alice Trevino, to be a violation of the Procurement Integrity Act that regulates government contracting practices. The documents note that the rebidding process was deemed necessary by SDA because the requirement for the 10 Gamma vehicles awarded to Tyvak, now a subsidiary of Lockheed Martin, remains crucial to the success of its Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture of low Earth orbit satellites — but with the caveat that a substantial delay in the process and/or increased costs could cause a reevaluation of that requirement and the need for a new competition. While SDA has explained that the Gamma satellites will not be part of the operational Transport Layer of data relay satellites, the agency has said that they instead are part of its efforts to develop fire control capabilities for missile defense and the experimental FOO Fighter program. Further, such fire control capabilities could be a key part of SDA's contribution to the Trump administration's newly planned Iron Dome for America missile defense shield. Attorneys for Tyvak and York have accepted the Air Force's plan, the Air Force court filings state. However, the documents add that Viasat had not responded to the proposal as of the time of their filing. 'Viasat does not comment on ongoing filings and litigation as matter of policy,' a spokesperson for the company told Breaking Defense today. 'York is a strong supporter of transparency and the integrity of the USG’s selection process. We are glad the investigation made public some of its findings that clearly show York was not involved in any wrongdoing, and support the integrity of our award on merits,' a spokesperson for the company said today. Lockheed Martin did not respond by press time to a request for comment.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/in-response-to-viasat-suit-sda-will-recompete-10-satellite-award-to-tyvak/	2025-02-19T11:17:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/09/Screen-Shot-2021-09-07-at-1.42.29-PM.png
Katie Arrington to head back into Pentagon as new CISO	Chief Information Security Officer for Acquisitions Katie Arrington delivers a keynote speech during the Military Satellite Communications Digital Week, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Dec. 8, 2020. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — Former chief information security officer (CISO) for acquisition and sustainment at the Department of Defense is headed back to the Pentagon — this time as DoD's CISO — following her previous suspension from the department for allegedly disclosing classified data. Katie Arrington served as a state lawmaker for South Carolina and had an unsuccessful bid for Congress before taking her post in 2019 as the chief information officer for A&amp;S during President Donald Trump’s first administration. She played an active role in standing up the department’s Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program before she was put on administrative leave in May 2021 after the National Security Agency suspended her security clearance for allegedly sharing top secret information to a defense contractor. Arrington announced her new role on Tuesday night with a LinkedIn post. Following Arrington’s suspension, she resigned in February 2022 because of the DoD’s decision to move the CMMC program from the office of acquisition and sustainment to its Chief Information Office, according to a resignation letter obtained by SC Media. She contended in the letter that her suspension was 'politically influenced' and maintained that such claims of disclosing classified information were false. The day after Arrington resigned from the Pentagon, she announced a second bid for Congress which she subsequently lost to Republican South Carolina House lawmaker Nancy Mace. The DoD did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding the status of Arrington’s ability to obtain a security clearance or the status of the investigation into the accusations that she shared classified information. The department also did not respond to comment on Arrington’s claims that the investigation was 'politically influenced.' The NSA deferred to the DoD for comment. According to a 2022 report from Federal News Network, Arrington’s attorney, Mark Zaid, said Arrington was, as of then, still challenging the government’s decision to suspend her security clearance and the following effort to permanently revoke it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/katie-arrington-to-head-back-into-pentagon-as-new-ciso/	2025-02-19T09:55:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/6447505-scaled-e1739982663234.jpg
DARPA plans ‘major expansion’ of quantum computing push next month	A graphic concept of quantum technology depicts two ships at sea in the background and a large, stylized molecule in the foreground. (U.S. Navy illustration by NIWC Pacific/Released.) WASHINGTON — The self-proclaimed 'quantum skeptic' heading DARPA’s Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI) tells Breaking Defense he is 'pleasantly surprised' by how many companies’ quantum computing plans look feasible — and as a result, he’s weeks away from announcing a slew of new awards. The point of the QBI program is not to pay the private sector to develop the tech, which they’re already doing on their own, according to program manager Joe Altepeter. Instead, in essence, a company that wins a QBI award gets access to DARPA’s interagency team of expert testers and devil’s advocates, serving as an independent outside check to make sure that they’re on a practical path. Tech titan Microsoft and specialist startup PsiQuantum have already won contracts for the initial, pilot-project version of the program, known clunkily as Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing or US2QC. ('You can tell why we changed it to ‘QBI,’' Altepeter said). Two other companies, Atom Computing and QC82, also won preliminary, short-term grants in 2023, but their proposals didn’t survive subsequent rounds of more intensive scrutiny. So only two of four competing firms made it all the way through the three-phase process to win one of the long-term 'Stage C' contracts announced Feb. 6. That 50 percent success rate is actually much better than Altepeter expected. 'That was definitely surprising,' he told Breaking Defense. 'I didn't think anybody was going to make it to Stage C. But that's why we do this, to get surprised.' So a 'major expansion' to 'bring in many more companies' is now underway, Altepeter said. 'We've gotten finished with source selection [and] sent out letters inviting all the companies who've made it into stage A to negotiate a contract…. My best guess is late March, we're going to have the vast majority of those contracts signed.' RELATED: Pentagon info officer’s top priority: Upgrading cryptography ahead of quantum-enabled hackers In this new round of competition, once again, Altepeter said many competitors exceeded his expectations for how far along their tech is and how feasible their plans are to build reliable, practical, and usefully powerful quantum computers. As a result, 'we'll have the chance to kick the tires on a lot more companies,' he said. 'A year from now, we’ll know a lot more about if this industry is for real or not.' How does that timeline work? The process is meant to be flexible, with the schedule accommodating what companies think is required, and companies that fail at one stage of the evaluation — like Atom and QC82 — are welcome to come back for a second shot. But overall, Altepeter said, QBI goes like this: At each stage, the size and cost of the DARPA team roughly doubles, Altepeter said. Currently, it consists of roughly 200 quantum experts from across the government — including Energy Department labs like Los Alamos as well as Defense Department labs like the Air Force Research Laboratory — and government-funded research centers, such as Johns Hopkins. (These personnel will remain with their home organization but spend roughly 60 to 70 percent of their time on DARPA quantum work). The idea, he said, is to get independent, expert feedback from professionals with no financial stake in the outcome either way. With new technologies, it’s all too easy to get sucked in by hype cycles and impressive statistics, Altepeter said, so it’s critical, and difficult, to figure out the right way to measure progress. Track the wrong metrics, he warned, and you end up with the equivalent of assessing a space-launch program by highest altitude achieved to date, a superficially reasonable approach that ends up grading grifters who can climb a ladder over professionals conducting static rocket-motor tests. 'We are building by far the best, largest test and evaluation team for quantum computing on the planet,' Altepeter summed up. '[We’re] planning for this to be a $1 billion-plus program.' This kind of careful evaluation isn’t cheap, he acknowledged, and if too many companies prove qualified, he may not have enough funding to give all of them awards. 'It’s a double-edged sword,' Altepeter said. 'I'm pleasantly surprised that these companies were doing so well. I also worry that we couldn't eliminate as many companies, because we're definitely trying to eliminate companies.' Could the Trump Administration's controversial ongoing cuts to government agencies, spearheaded by Elon Musk's DOGE, cramp or cripple the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative just as it's trying to grow? Altepeter demurred on those 'bigger-scope&#8230;budget issues.' That said, when it comes to federal funding, 'it's always a danger that there are other priorities that take precedence,' he said. 'But my marching orders are the same as they have been since we started this&#8230;which is to sprint as fast as possible and get ready for a world-changing program.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/darpa-plans-major-expansion-of-quantum-computing-push-next-month/	2025-02-19T09:01:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/quantumn-navy-e1739907798420.jpg
Pentagon’s $96M wearable contract sparks protest, accusations of vendor preference	Tom Hale, chief executive officer of Oura Health Oy, wears an Oura Ring during an interview in San Francisco, California, US, on Friday, June 14, 2024. ( David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON – A contract to provide the Defense Health Agency (DHA) with millions of dollars of biometric trackers has been hit with a second protest, with accusations that the agency is seeking to tailor the contract to give it to a preferred vendor. The issue puts a spotlight on the Pentagon’s attempts to work with new technology firms, and has raised the ire of a member of Congress — all against the looming backdrop of expected cuts to acquisition programs at the Department of Defense, as Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, team get the knives out. Last August, the DHA put up a notice on the government contracting site Sam.gov, announcing it was going to sole-source a $96 million contract for wearable devices and a 'wellbeing platform' to Ouraring, the US subsidiary of Finnish firm Oura Health. The wellbeing platform refers to a system that takes data from a user’s wearable device, for example a ring, watch or band, and creates a custom plan based on what the user’s biometrics indicate needs improvement. The company’s rings had become a popular device among members of the military during the COVID-19 pandemic, and now, it seemed DHA planned to outfit its team of nurses and doctors with the items in order to better track biometric data. While $96 million isn’t major by Pentagon standards it was a big win for Oura; for comparison, its December series D round of fundraising was $200 million. But it didn’t take long for the deal to hit a snag. Wearable company WHOOP contacted the Government Accountability Office, protesting the award, saying the intent to sole source lacked sufficient information. Shortly after, the DHA wrote to GAO that they were going to cancel the sole source contract and requested that the WHOOP protest be dismissed. (Breaking Defense obtained a copy and verified the protest documents.) Then, when the initial contract was cancelled, another request for information and subsequent request for proposal was posted to Sam.gov by the DHA in November and December respectively, specifying that the wearable must be a ring — something WHOOP says was designed to still hand the award over to Oura by default. DHA has acknowledged to lawmakers that Oura is the only wearable ring company that is cleared by DoD for use in secure facilities, according to documents reviewed by Breaking Defense. So in January, WHOOP issued a second, previously unreported, protest. A response is due by mid-April. 'WHOOP is eager to compete on a level playing field for the opportunity to provide wearables and wellbeing solutions to our warfighters and all those who support them. We regret that DHA leadership has decided, for no discernibly valid reason, to effectively sole source this requirement to a foreign company,' a WHOOP spokesperson wrote in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'In this case, the agency's ‘ring-based form factor’ requirement is unnecessarily restrictive, excluding companies constituting more than 97% of the current commercial market. We hope that DHA leadership reconsiders its approach and allows innovative American companies like WHOOP to compete.' Neither Oura nor DHA responded to requests for comment by press time. Rep. Morgan Luttrell, R-Texas, a member of the House Armed Services Committee’s Cyber, Information Technologies and Innovation subcommittee, told Breaking Defense that he was alarmed by what seems to be a push to sole-source the deal. 'It is the responsibility of the Department of Defense to ensure that our warfighters have access to the newest biometric technology by spreading funding across multiple wearable biometric companies, rather than relying on a single provider,' Luttrell wrote in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'Competition drives innovation, strengthens national security, and ensures our warfighters get the best gear possible. Relying on a single provider limits options and slows progress,' he added. When Breaking Defense asked Luttrell’s office if he plans on advising the DHA to reconsider their choice in exclusively soliciting for a ring option, a spokesperson told Breaking Defense, 'Rep. Luttrell thinks that different biometric monitoring devices serve distinct purposes and exclusively investing in the Oura Ring raises concerns. Our office is reviewing the matter and will provide updates soon!' The Pentagon’s interest in wearable technology puts Oura and other wearable creators in good company. According to one report, the wearable technology market size is worth roughly $70.3 billion. Another report puts that number at $74.6 billion. Regardless of the actual figure, it’s clear it’s a growing business — and one that the DoD can find many uses for, given the focus on health and fitness in the military. But wearables come in many sizes and shapes, so to get the best results, the user should be given choices to find what fits best for them, Sam Howell, an associate fellow with the Technology and National Security Program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), told Breaking Defense. 'Having continuous data is the most important thing. People aren't going to wear the device unless it's comfortable [for] them. So, I do think there is a lot of benefit in giving folks some flexibility to choose what's most comfortable for them and their lifestyle,' said Howell. 'Another big component is they have to trust that the device is accurate, or they're not necessarily going to put any stock in the insights that are gleaned from them, and then the whole point is kind of defeated. So if there's a service member that, for example, trusts the Ouraring more than, let's just say, a Garmin, I do think there's value in allowing them to use the device they personally trust the most.' Asked to speculate why DHA may be emphasizing the ring option, Howell said in her experience rings 'probably give the most accurate heart rate reading, because it's directly on your finger.' However, she noted that doctors usually take off rings to perform surgeries — the kind of situation where you most want biometric data, if you’re trying to understand how someone is operating at their peak. Jerry McGinn, executive director of the Greg and Camille Baroni Center for Government Contracting at George Mason University, told Breaking Defense that though there is 'likely' a reason the DHA is choosing a ring, 'it would be helpful if they explain their rationale in their RFI and RFP,' something both solicitations did not include. 'Whether that's grounds for GAO to uphold the protest, I don’t know,' he added. 'It is a little surprising that after the protest of the sole source award, that the government wouldn't explain a bit more their rationale for seeking a ring solution as opposed to other solutions.' No one involved could have realized it when the protest began, but the contract dispute may be coming at a bad time. Members of DOGE, the Elon Musk-organized group that has been actively seeking government cuts on behalf of the White House, arrived at the Pentagon this week. And while $96 million may not seem like a lot of money, it feels like everything in the so-called 'fourth estate' —the parts of the Pentagon that, like DHA, don’t fall under the services — is at risk. 'I think pretty much every contract or solicitation that’s out there has got a lot of uncertainty now, so that is for darn sure,' McGinn said. And while he said he could see reasons for the wearable contract to go through, 'there’s bound to be some kind of changes' with DoD acquisition spending. Which potentially means that whomever ends up prevailing in this fitness tracker dispute may still have to sweat out if they’ll be getting their money.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/pentagons-96m-wearable-contract-sparks-protest-accusations-of-vendor-preference/	2025-02-19T06:25:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/oura-ring-scaled-e1739913886921.jpg
In EMSO, the small stuff matters	Imagine being tasked with solving the following problem: Find a way to double the traffic capacity on the DC Beltway without decreasing speeds – and please find a way to accomplish this using less highway real estate than currently exists. The ask is seemingly impossible as the infrastructure in place does not allow the current traffic flow to approach posted speed limits! The electromagnetic warfare (EW) community is facing a similar challenge as bandwidth requirements skyrocket and weight and size specifications continue to shrink. Today’s electromagnetic operating environment (EMOE) requires systems that can collect, process, and transmit vast amounts of data and dissipate the heat generated along the way. Basically, future systems need to be the smaller highway that can throughput more cars. Without the material science advances required to achieve the bandwidth and light-weight requirements needed for future manned and unmanned systems, the U.S. and its allies will be at a disadvantage in attaining spectrum superiority. Gone are the days when electronic warfare consisted of a joint restricted frequency list and the noise jamming of steady, single-frequency early warning radars. Successful electromagnetic spectrum operations (EMSO) must now contend with a congested, contested spectrum that includes adversary systems with pulse-to-pulse frequency and pulse width modulations that are much harder to identify and defeat. As we are seeing in the Ukraine conflict, the ability to gain and maintain electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) superiority will play a major role in a nation’s ability to succeed in operations across all warfare domains, and EW systems and operations can no longer afford to be an afterthought. From the Vietnam War through operations in support of the global war on terror, EW planning did not receive the same level of priority as the air-to-air and air-to-ground mission planning. When commanders devised operational plans and execution orders to conduct in-depth operations through complex integrated air defense systems, they relegated the integration of U.S. and allied EW capabilities to a limited number of experts who had studied the spectrum and knew how to use it to our advantage. However, as warfare has evolved in the 21st century, adversary capabilities across the EMS have forced the U.S. and our allies to revisit what EW capabilities we need and how we integrate them into the platforms and systems that we acquire. Realizing the importance of EW, in the October 2020, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) released the Electromagnetic Spectrum Superiority Strategy, which includes the need to develop superior EMS capabilities. Specifically, the strategy tasks the department to leverage and adapt commercial technologies and to collaborate with commercial companies to leverage the innovation and experience those companies offer in their fields of expertise. This is a potential game changer and extremely advantageous way to solve difficult problems, such as those encountered in the development of new, agile EW systems. Many of these companies, including W. L. Gore and Associates (Gore), are non-traditional defense companies and bring a wealth of talent and capabilities to the development cycle. For example, Gore is a materials science company that uses its current and advanced materials expertise to develop and design lightweight, high performance cables that provide system performance enhancements and weight savings. Including the non-traditional companies early in the design cycle allows the large defense ecosystem to leverage those capabilities in system trades. Whether it’s a cable, thermal material, or other capabilities, bringing this expertise into the fight can be a huge advantage. In this process, the integration of cables and connectors, and the ability to dissipate heat from high performance systems, should be included in the base designs. Just as the USG has realized the importance of integrating EW into the early planning process, Gore believes that the program offices and prime contractors would benefit from incorporating commercial companies with a history of material science expertise into their early planning and designs. For more than 60 years, Gore has partnered with the U.S. government, allies and partners, and the defense industrial base to anticipate the next revolution of aerospace and defense technology. Gore invented the flexible microwave assembly in the 1970s and, in cooperation with government and industry partners, solved seemingly intractable challenges by advancing the boundaries of material science and reliable performance. Welcoming the challenge to innovate, the team continues to create reliable material science solutions that will help ensure future EMSO systems keep pace with the rapid proliferation of threats. Similar to how operational planners historically added EW at the end of planning, acquisition teams often do the same for the wire and cable associated with EW systems. Often thought of as a commodity, the cabling is often purchased on a lowest cost, technically acceptable basis, focusing on program expenditures instead of lifetime costs. In the emerging EMOE, technically feasible must rise to a new level. When survivability is measured by detection ranges and response times, every decibel is critical. The question remains as to how to translate this imperative into successful, high-performing, cost-effective programs. Gore innovators and engineers have combined for over 3,500 patented inventions, including advanced cables and assemblies. These products have an esteemed track record of succeeding in harsh environments, from supersonic flight to low-earth orbit to Mars and beyond. Less well-known, but equally impressive is Gore’s applications expertise, which provides the appropriate technology for specific requirements like EMSO. Gore is currently supporting multiple programs to upgrade the EMSO capabilities of fourth-generation aircraft, with these enhancements further improving their survivability. Contributing its materials science and cabling expertise, Gore plays a key role in many current and future aircraft and systems. Our fiber optics capabilities and high-speed, lightweight copper-based data solutions are found across many U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force platforms. For each program, Gore provides engineering and scientific expertise to meet the requirements needed for the future fight. The combination of performance, durability, and lighter weight ensures that our aircrew have the performance they need. The need for a smaller, faster highway is not going away, and designs should focus on building digital backbones that won’t need to be replaced in 5 or 10 years due to the demand for more speed. The next generation of EW systems will require even more system integration. Collaborative Combat Aircraft will require more capabilities in a smaller airframe, and the Next Generation Air Dominance and F/A-XX programs will test the limits for power generation. Both issues will require material science advancements and innovations. We believe in our ability to design innovative solutions for EW systems that will have the bandwidth and durability to meet the needs of the next-generation warfighter. W. L. Gore and Associates stands ready to partner on future programs to find success in this critical endeavor to protect assets and save lives. Learn more about Gore and how material science innovations are shaping the future of EMSO and ensuring mission success.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/in-emso-the-small-stuff-matters/	2025-02-19T05:24:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Gore-Featured-Image.png
Saab CEO still upbeat on prospect of Sweden sending Gripen fighter jets to Ukraine	Sweden has already donated Gripen fighter jet spare parts to Ukraine, intended for use with a future fleet of 14 aircraft, but authorities have still to clear the aircraft for delivery (Saab) BELFAST — The head of Swedish manufacturer Saab remains optimistic that the Scandinavian nation will decide to send JAS 39 Gripen multirole fighter jets to Ukraine and strengthen strike capabilities on top of US-made F-16 and French Mirage 2000 aircraft. 'Without jumping into conclusions [at a political level] I hope it will happen' Saab CEO Micael Johansson told Breaking Defense at the Munich Security Conference. Ideally, a long-term agreement would be struck that opens the way for Ukrainian pilots to start training in Sweden, learn Swedish and begin flying the single engine combat jets, he said, leading to a first squadron of C/D standard aircraft being delivered to Kyiv 'sooner rather than later.' Johansson added that 'over time' the more advanced Gripen E aircraft should be sent to Kyiv, before stressing that 'it’s purely a political decision' to set the entire process in motion, beginning with the older C/D platforms. 'I can only hope it will happen. I don't have any more detailed insight into how they are contemplating' the approval decision, he said of political discussions associated with the military aid effort. There is 'nothing new [to say] regarding Gripen,' a spokesperson from the Swedish Defence Minister's office told Breaking Defense today. 'The Airforce Capability coalition advised Sweden to wait until' F-16 is implemented. Ahead of plans to send 14 Gripen C/D jets to Ukraine at a future date, Sweden has already donated 2.3 billion SEK ($214 million) worth of spare parts. 'By acquiring new materiel parts, a number of JAS 39C/D will be saved from being dismantled and can — if the Swedish government decides so — be considered for a possible future donation to Ukraine,' the Swedish government said in a statement last year. NATO allies previously asked Sweden to hold back on sending Gripen aircraft so Ukraine could first focus on flying F-16 jets and not overload its pilots with a variety of different aircraft types. A small number of French Mirage jets have since been sent to Kyiv. 'In the long term, yes, [but] I think we have to avoid [giving] too many systems to Ukraine, because they have a shortage of pilots,' Chief of Defence of the Netherlands Gen. Onno Eichelsheim told Breaking Defense last year. Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway have all agreed to supply around 80 F-16s under an air force capability coalition for Ukraine, which includes 16 nations in all. Additionally, Denmark, Romania, the UK and the US have contributed to Ukrainian pilot training on the aircraft. Prior to the F-16 and Mirage deliveries, the Ukraine air force had been mainly relying on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion. Defense analysts have consistently pushed for Gripen to be sent to Ukraine. A 2022 report from the UK’s Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) defense and security think tank labelled the aircraft 'by far the most suitable candidate' of Western-manufactured combat jets, capable of meeting operational requirements. It also highlighted that the aircraft would minimize the risk of Ukraine being subjected to long-range missile strikes by Russia, while stressing that the Swedish air force’s employment of 'low level air superiority tactics from dispersed bases' are similar to Ukrainian air force operations. The Swedish air force currently operates close to 100 Gripen jets, according to Flight Global. Courtesy of a C/D upgrade program and acquisition of 60 E models, both under contract with Saab, the Swedish air force plans on expanding the Gripen fleet to 120 aircraft long term. Johansson told Breaking Defense that a number of Gripen E types have been handed over to the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) test center in preparation for first deliveries to the Swedish Air Force's Satenas base. Brazil is Sweden's sole export customer for the E version, while the C/D type is also operated by the Czech Republic, Hungary, South Africa and Thailand.

Buoyed by Trump ‘boom,’ General Atomics expects MQ-9 LoA with UAE this year: Exec	MQ-9B SeaGuardian with Emirati flag, at General Atomics booth at UMEX 2022. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — With an aggressive Trump administration back in office, the head of General Atomics Aeronautical Systems said he expects the long-suffering, high-dollar deal for the United Arab Emirates to acquire MQ-9B SeaGuardians will move forward swiftly, with a Letter of Offer and Acceptance expected as early as this year. 'We expect that to move. It's been a long time in the making, and then it got on hold, and I think that's going to be all behind us now,' GA-ASI President David Alexander told Breaking Defense on the International Defense Expo show floor here in Abu Dhabi. Back in January 2021 the UAE struck a $23.3 billion deal to procure 50 F-35 fighter jets along with 18 SeaGuardians. But the combination deal was halted over US concerns about the Emirates’ use of Chinese network technology and a perceived threat to the F-35. A breakthrough appeared to come last year, when Alexander told Breaking Defense at a different Middle East defense show that the MQ-9B part of the deal had been disentangled from the F-35 controversy, clearing the way for it to go forward alone. Now, especially with businessman-turned-president Donald Trump back in office, Alexander said he sees a general defense sales 'boom coming this way.' 'They mean business now, and they want to see the business deals happen and where we've been, maybe stuck in policy and bureaucrats,' Alexander said in an interview Tuesday. 'I think it's going to move out quick, so I predict a lot of action in this area, and a lot of business growth for General Atomics.' C. Mark Brinkley, a spokesperson for the company, put it succinctly referring to the MQ-9 deal, which was negotiated under the first Trump administration: 'Trump started this. Trump's going to end this.' 'I think the Trump administration is committed to closing this deal. The Trump administration has made it very clear that they're committed to the UAE, and they're committed to putting this deal back on track,' he said. Alexander told Breaking Defense that because there's been such a long pause in the deal, it's currently being updated to reflect current realities. 'A lot has happened in four years and we're on the other side of COVID. We have to address the time issue, when we can make deliveries, what they cost, how fast can we get it delivered,' he said. Alexander said that there's been some configuration changes since the original signed LOA, 'it’s essentially the same system, [but] there are some [things] added and some things taken away.' In November 2023, Breaking Defense reported that General Atomics was planning to integrate Emirati EDGE Group missiles on the MQ-9B SkyGuardian platform. Representatives for the State Department, which has already approved the Foreign Military Sale of MQ-9s to the UAE, did not respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment on the new MQ-9 timeline. As GA-ASI puts what it hopes to be the finishing touches on the UAE deal, Alexander said his eyes are already on the 'biggest potential international deal' in GA-ASI history with neighboring Saudi Arabia. 'I can't discuss the numbers right now because we're still going back and forth, but it'll be the biggest deal in the region by far,' he added. He didn't specify any details but said that 'there's a long list of things to provide — MQ-9 [is] part of that list. So it's a significant program.' While the actual announcement date of this deal is not known yet, Alexander expected 'some details [to] come out later this year.' Regarding the localization mandate these Gulf countries request for any deal, Alexander didn't see any issues. 'Almost every international deal has some kind of reach back [localization] like that. We're doing it. India's got a maintenance repair that we have to stand up. Here in the UAE, they've got to offset requirements. Canada has 100 percent offset requirement. So we have to get creative on other ways to bring business,' he said. He added that 'it's not just the unmanned aircraft system that we bring in, but there's the sensor packages, and then there's the MRO, and maybe split the production and do half of the assembly, in-country.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/buoyed-by-trump-boom-general-atomics-expects-mq-9-loa-with-uae-this-year-exec/	2025-02-18T22:58:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/273926266_252473973758080_2833298978951006949_n-e1698856746894.jpg
With new MoU, GM Defense and EDGE Group’s team-up gets more ‘meat on the bone’	A GM Defense Next Generation Tactical Vehicle coupled with a drone launcher made by EDGE Group makes its public debut at IDEX 2025. (Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — American contractor GM Defense and Emirati defense conglomerate EDGE Group have announced a new agreement to explore 'light tactical vehicle'-focused projects, in a move that came as the two firms put on display what one such team-up could look like: a GM Defense ride boasting an EDGE drone launcher. 'Under terms of the memorandum of understanding GM Defense, a General Motors subsidiary, would work with NIMR Automotive, an arm of EDGE, on potential opportunities,' GM Defense said in statement Tuesday, adding that it was eyeing customers in the Middle East, Africa, Malaysia and Indonesia, specifically. 'By uniting EDGE’s regional insight, operational excellence, and established infrastructure with GM Defense’s technical expertise and industry leadership, we aim to create a powerful synergy that will drive innovative projects and elevate operational capabilities across key markets,' said Khaled Al Zaabi, the president of Platforms &amp; Systems at EDGE. GM Defense's exhibit at IDEX included what it calls its Next Generation Tactical Vehicle (NGTV) but with EDGE's Hunter SP loitering munition launchers nestled in the back — the first such set-up viewed in a public setting. In an interview with Breaking Defense, GM Defense President Steve duMont said that the MoU is 'not just to bring [the NGTV] to the UAE as a product, but to bring it there as a vehicle to be produced in the region for the region's needs, using an Emirati and regional supply chain to help us reduce the amount of transportation, bring jobs into the region, bring technology into the region.' He highlighted that the MoU is the initial step. 'We've had some really good discussions with UAE senior leadership for the past couple years,' he said. 'This signing of the MoU kind of puts a little bit more a little bit more meat on the bone.' (Last IDEX, in 2023, GM Defense signed an MoU with the Emirati government's Tawazun Council in an effort to expand the firm's footprint in the region.) Today other GM Defense representatives told Breaking Defense they expect the NGTV, which made its solo debut at the Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC, last year, to be tested in the UAE. 'GM has plans for summer trials for this vehicle, probably won't be in 2025, but we're targeting probably a 2026 time frame,' Bradley Watters, vice president of international business development, told Breaking Defense. The NGTV already participated in an exercise earlier this month in Germany, which was 'the first time that it had really been in a tactical environment.' Additional trials in the Gulf will be by the 'invite from the UAE [Ministry of Defense] and their general maintenance corps. But there's a lot of interest coming from the Emirates, as well as others in that region.' DuMont said the company has 'been looking at this vehicle for application in the Middle East region, which is very important region for us, and I think there's a lot of applications in this vehicle.' NGTV uses diesel fuel to power a generator which then charges a battery, and 'then that battery gives it that silent drive capability,' duMont said. He said this makes the vehicle quiet enough that it has the 'ability to sneak up behind soldiers, and the soldiers didn't even know there was a big truck behind them.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/with-new-mou-gm-defense-and-edge-groups-team-up-gets-more-meat-on-the-bone/	2025-02-18T21:46:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/IMG_5465-scaled-e1739894348747.jpg
Startup Saronic to build ‘Port Alpha,’ next-gen shipyard focused on autonomous vessels	Saronic’s Corsair autonomously navigating open waters in the Gulf of Mexico. (Photo provided by Saronic.) WASHINGTON — Off the back of a $600 million Series C funding round, Saronic, the Texas-based defense startup company, announced today it plans to build a 'next-generation shipyard' focused on producing unmanned and autonomous vessels, dubbed 'Port Alpha.' The latest funding round was led by Elad Gil, a San Francisco-based entrepreneur and investor with previous stints at Google and Twitter. The round evaluated the company’s worth at $4 billion, which Saronic says effectively 'quadrupled' its valuation. 'Port Alpha will reflect the apex of America’s shipbuilding past — generating new opportunities for the country’s shipbuilding workforce, forging public-private partnerships to accelerate growth, and bringing innovation and ingenuity to an essential industry,' said Dino Mavrookas, Saronic’s CEO. 'We will bring these elements together with a single goal: to rapidly build a fleet of autonomous vessels in America that redefine maritime superiority and guarantees freedom of the seas for generations to come.' RELATED: With Navy Exercise, Unmanned Surface Vessel Firm Saronic Sees &#8216;Next Step' Speaking to reporters today, Mavrookas and Saronic co-founder Rob Lehman said they have not yet selected a location for the new shipyard and declined to provide a timeline for the new project, except to say they will move 'as fast as possible.' The company executives said they will work with federal and state governments to determine the best location, a decision which may be the biggest determiner of the new project's success, because any new location is only going to be successful if they can sort out a key issue facing all naval programs today: Workforce development. Finding people to build ships has a been a top issue for both the US Navy and the defense industrial base in recent years. The service just last year spent roughly $1 billion trying to attract new workers to build submarines. A recent effort to bolster the workforce, dubbed 'SAWS,' stirred a snafu on Capitol Hill in December and January as outgoing service leadership from the Biden administration and lawmakers traded accusations about a lack of transparency. When pressed for how Saronic would overcome the existing workforce challenges, Mavrookas said Saronic is 'changing the culture' around shipbuilding. 'You look at the workforce we built today, we have over 350 employees&#8230; We've attracted people from Silicon Valley that focus on software. We've been attracting people from SpaceX and Tesla that run our manufacturing and production line. Now we're going to combine those folks with the lead naval architects and people that are focused on shipbuilding,' he said. 'We're raising the private capital to hire the people. We're creating a training pipeline to attract the people. We're going have programs in place to recruit to people. We're focused on building the entire ecosystem around this shipyard,' he continued. Saronic in October unveiled plans to mass produce 'hundreds' of its newest autonomous surface vessel, 'Corsair,' citing the Pentagon's need for expendable drones manufactured en masse. The company's announcements largely align with the framework the Defense Department has projected for its Replicator initiative, but the company, like others that have made similar announcements, has been coy when asked about specific deals or discussions with the Pentagon. The company last year also acquired a roughly 420,000-square-foot production and manufacturing facility in Austin, Texas. That space is scheduled to be fully operational by the end of this year, Mavrookas said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/startup-saronic-to-build-port-alpha-next-gen-shipyard-focused-on-autonomous-vessels/	2025-02-18T13:00:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/CORSAIR_STILL-07_v002-scaled.jpg
Space Force taps Firefly to launch mysterious Victus Sol ‘responsive space’ mission	Firefly Aerospace's Alpha rocket, shown here lofting a payload for Lockheed Martin in December 2023 from Vandenberg SFB, Calif., was chosen to provide launch of the Space Force's upcoming Victus Sol mission. (Photo: Firefly Aerospace) WASHINGTON — Although most details of the newest mission under the Space Force's Tactically Responsive Space (TacRS) program remain shrouded in secrecy, the service has announced a $21.81 million award to Firefly Aerospace to launch the effort, dubbed Victus Sol. Victus Sol, the third in the TacRS series, will build upon the past two demonstrations of rapidly satellite launch, and be the first to put an operational system on orbit, according to the Space Force. The mission 'is moving beyond TacRS demonstrations and will be available for operations,' a spokesperson for Space Safari, the Space Systems Command shop managing the program, told Breaking Defense in a Feb. 14 email. However, the spokesperson said the Victus Sol launch date, payload type, capability requirements and mission objective 'will not be disclosed at this time in accordance with mission requirements.' Nor would the spokesperson reveal when a provider for the space vehicle and/or payload would be chosen. The Space Force in its fiscal 2025 budget request [PDF] asked for $30 million in research and development funds for the TacRS program, explaining that 'each VICTUS mission furthers the capability to launch within 24 hours of notice, match the orbital plane of a previously unknown object, and conduct rendezvous and proximity operations for inspection and characterization on an operationally relevant timeline.' The budget documents further note that the goal of the Victus Sol plan for FY25 is to 'enable launch in the first half of FY 2026.' The Space Safari spokesperson said that Firefly's contract is sole source and is being paid for using FY24 and FY25 funds. The service's press release explained that the award was made under the Orbital Services Program (OSP)-4 indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract mechanism that 'provides dedicated and primary launch services to the DoD and other Government agencies.' Jason Kim, CEO of Firefly Aerospace, noted in a Feb. 14 press release that this will be the third TacRS mission to be launched by the company. 'As our country’s deterrence and responsive space needs grow exponentially, Firefly has ramped up our Alpha production line to meet that demand and provide flexibility to support the Space Force’s urgent needs that keep us ahead of the game,' he said. The stated goal of the TacRS series has been for the Space Force to be able to turn around a satellite launch within a 24-hour window. At the same time, all of the TacRS missions have been designed to carry maneuverable satellites that can get up close and personal with another satellite — a capability that could allow inspection, repair or even attack of the target satellite. The first TacRS mission, Victus Nox launched in September 2023 and was praised by senior Space Force officials as a game-changer for the service in future great power competition. Under that demonstration, Firefly launched a maneuverable space vehicle developed by Boeing’s Millennium Space Systems. In April 2024, the Space force announced awards to two vendors for the follow-on Victus Haze mission. Rocket Lab National Security was awarded a $32 million contract through the Pentagon’s Defense Innovation Unit (DIU), while True Anomaly was awarded $30 million through the Space Force's SpaceWERX innovation hub. 'VICTUS HAZE is progressing toward successfully achieving all cost, schedule, and performance goals,' the Space Safari spokesperson said. According to the FY25 budget documents, the two Victus Haze satellites should be 'ready for call-up in the second quarter of FY 2025.' Last October [PDF], Space Systems Command announced that it was developing two more missions for FY26, called Victus Surgo and Victus Salo, in partnership with DIU to 'demonstrate on-orbit prepositioned capabilities as response options to meet urgent needs of combatant commands.' Impulse Space was awarded a $34.5 million Small Business Innovation Research Phase III contract for two space vehicles 'that will demonstrate how highly maneuverable on-orbit assets can complement responsive launch approaches to further reduce response times and meet urgent needs,' the announcement added. Senior officials at US Space Command (SPACECOM) have expressed the need for on-orbit capabilities for what is broadly known as space mobility and logistics — such as highly mobile satellites that could be refueled and/or repaired by other space vehicles or even on-orbit 'gas stations' to allow 'dynamic space operations.' SPACECOM, US Indo-Pacific Command and US Transportation Command officials also have touted the potential for cargo to be placed on-orbit that then could be dropped into theaters as needed. And while as recently as 2023 Space Force acquisition leaders were equally enthusiastic about such capabilities, the service over the past year or so has seemed less interested. For example, as Breaking Defense was the first to report, the Space Force zeroed out funds for those activities in its FY26 budget request after having asked for $20 million in FY25.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-taps-firefly-to-launch-mysterious-victus-sol-responsive-space-mission/	2025-02-18T12:10:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Firefly-Alpha-flight-004-e1739903328357.jpg

UK Defence Secretary urges US to commit to ‘backstop’ to avoid future Putin attack	John Healey, UK Defence Secretary (left) with Pete Hegseth, US Secretary of Defense, during a meeting of the North Atlantic Council at NATO HQ in Brussels (UK MoD) BELFAST — UK Defence Secretary John Healey has called on the Trump administration to commit to a security 'backstop' for Ukraine, warning that 'only the US' is capable enough of stopping Russia from launching another attack on Europe. Healey said that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and US President Donald Trump will discuss the backstop plan when they meet in Washington next week. His comments at the Institute for Government think tank today arrived before US and Russian officials held bilateral peace talks in Saudi Arabia, where Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said deployment of NATO troops to Ukraine is 'unacceptable,' according to various reports. Washington and Moscow also agreed to 'appoint respective high-level teams to begin working on a path to ending the conflict' in Ukraine, according to the US State Department. The new pact once again excludes Europe and Ukraine from a direct role in peace negotiations. 'We need a security guarantee for Ukraine in Ukraine that is capable of delivering what President Trump has pledged and says he wants, which is a durable peace that requires an end to the Russian attack and no repeat of that in the future,' said Healey. 'The European countries have to play a leading part in that guarantee, but require a backstop from the US, because, in the end, it is only the US that can provide the deterrence to Putin that will prevent him attacking again.' Starmer said on Sunday that he is 'ready and willing' to deploy UK forces to Ukraine as a security guarantee for Kyiv connected to a peace deal, but Healey declined to comment on troop numbers linked to a minimal, credible force that London could deliver. 'The one thing I'm not going to do, is discuss details of the work that we're doing, the discussions we're having with allies and with the US, because the one thing I don't want to do is make Putin any wiser,' he said. US-European security relations were thrown into disarray when US Vice President JD Vance told the Munich Security Conference that Europe’s primary threat sits 'from within' — not with Russia — accusing the continent of media censorship and suppressing free speech but Healey appeared to downplay the impact of those messages. Somewhat surprisingly, Healey responded 'no' when asked if US discourse in Munich had changed his assessment of the state of European security. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, for example, mocked Vance's speech for failing to say anything of substance on Ukraine and US security relations with Europe. Healey, who attended the Munich event with UK Foreign Minister David Lammy, instead praised comments from US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at the last Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting around the need for Europe to increase defense spending and do more for its own security. 'The content of his [Hegseth’s] messages was not new, what was so striking was the recognition and agreement by the European nations at that meeting and in the discussions I chaired, recognizing, we've been stepping up, but recognizing and making the commitment that we must do more and we will,' he said. The UK currently spends around 2.3 percent GDP on defense but will 'set out a path' to reaching 2.5 percent GDP in the spring, added Healey, despite Hegseth calling a figure of 5 percent 'a model for the continent' of Europe. Forced to reckon with the reality of a more turbulent transatlantic relationship and exclusion by the US on peace talks, European leaders convened at an emergency meeting in Paris on Monday to discuss security guarantees and putting troops on the ground in Ukraine as part of a peace deal. The French President's Office did not share details of the discussion between Macron and Trump, according to the UK's Guardian newspaper. However, according to a White House official, on background, the call lasted 'approximately 30 minutes' and covered Ukraine, the European nations meeting, and the US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. Commenting on the talks with Macron, Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said on social media that they both hold a 'common vision' based on the idea that security guarantees 'must be robust and reliable.' He added, 'Any other decision without such guarantees—such as a fragile ceasefire—would only serve as another deception by Russia and a prelude to a new Russian war against Ukraine or other European nations.' On the separate matter of UK defense reform plans, which he framed as the 'biggest shake up of UK defense for over 50 years,' Healey said that a new 'quad' of senior UK MoD leaders will take office from March 31. The quad is made up by a new armaments director (not yet in post), permanent secretary (chief accounts officer) David Williams, Chief of the Defence Staff Adm. Tony Radakin and Chief of Defence Nuclear Madelaine McTernan. 'This new quad will lead a defense [department] which is more concentrated on warfighting, readiness and on deterrence,' said Healey.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/uk-defence-secretary-urges-us-backstop-to-avoid-future-putin-attack/	2025-02-18T10:10:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250213c-010.jpg.iCfX1JjuMe-THd1jYBMA.cUmKw_IyH3-e1739893025832.jpg

High-power microwave ‘force field’ knocks drone swarms from sky	Soldiers from the U.S. Army’s Air Defense Artillery community stand in front of the IFPC-HPM system alongside Epirus support staff following New Equipment Training in March 2024. (Epirus photo) In the mix of counter-UAS systems under development today like kinetics, lasers, and jamming, only one technology, high-power microwave (HPM), is specifically designed to take out swarms of drones all at once. Attacking swarms have become a common feature in Russia’s war on Ukraine. Defensive systems, however, can only shoot down one threat at a time. To address that gap, the Defense Department is experimenting with high-power microwave (HPM) to disable drone swarms and other devices dependent on electronics. A defensive concept known as 'one-to-many', the U.S. Army is developing these systems with Epirus, a 'neo prime' focused on asymmetric warfare. Epirus has delivered four prototype HPM counter-swarm systems under a $66 million OTA issued by the Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office in early 2023 under the Integrated Fires Protection Capability High Power Microwave (IFPC-HPM) program. Epirus delivered the first IFPC-HPM system nine months after contract award and finalized delivery of all four systems in March 2024. The Army followed in October with an approximately $17 million contract modification for the development and integration of an upgraded sensor suite in support of IFPC-HPM. Breaking Defense discussed HPM with Epirus CEO Andy Lowery. Breaking Defense: What’s the idea behind using HPM to counter drone swarms and the concept of one-to-many short-range air defense? Andy Lowery is Epirus CEO. Andy Lowery: This is an idea that changes the paradigm of how we think about defense of critical assets from a one-to-one thought process to a one-to-many thought process. It could be from a detection point of view, a command-and-control perspective, or in the case of Epirus, an effector perspective. There aren't many other types of systems that have one-to-many effects. Kinetics you rule out. They're all one-to-one. The counter-UAS strategy that the DoD published recently describes a need for this one-to-many philosophy of going after threats like what’s seen in network attacks, which are one-to-many attacks. When I talk to cyber experts, they are bored with me talking one-to-many. They say we've been talking about this for 20 years. So, we’re not actually alone in this idea or concept. In electronic warfare, there’s an interesting comparison with the Next Generation Jammer (NGJ). One of my chief engineering accomplishments at Raytheon was to design the NGJ system, which is a cousin or even a brother to Leonidas, the high-power microwave systems that Epirus specializes in. Waymo is another example. They have a different mission to navigate a car automatically, but they are processing one-to-many threats: a bicycle, a car, a commuter, a red light. How do they take in all of those 10,000 things at the same time and produce a meaningful objective? That's what we have to think about — HPM for high-value asset protection, short-range air-defense protection. The ways of protecting our guarded assets now need to evolve because swarms have manifested into the physical realm and are being developed by the Russians, Chinese, and Iranians. Do we still need kinetics? Absolutely. We need the kinetics because there'll be high-value targets that they are assigned to. Then there'll be swarms – cheap, attributable, and autonomous in the not-too-distant future. Ask any counter-drone warfighter what's the first thing that pops into their head when they hear the word ‘autonomy’, and they’ll tell you ‘swarms’. Like a Waymo vehicle, each one of them can be sent out with no signals or attachment to anything. The future of autonomy is no outside connectivity. This is where we come in because it isn't just counter swarms, it's counter electronics in a sector-defense way. HPM will affect anything with electronics in it: boat and car motors, night-vision goggles, computers, and switches. That's all vulnerable. Those all are hypersensitive to this type of electromagnetic radiation. Epirus delivered the first IFPC-HPM system nine months after contract award and finalized delivery of all four systems in March 2024. (Epirus photo) Tell us about your HPM solution called Leonidas. Leonidas spins on a gimbal and generates a persistent field of electromagnetic energy in the sky. As you push it into the airspace, incoming drones come into that energy field and begin to get confused. Different parts of the electronics are starting to pull energy onto the boards and they begin to overload. Epirus HPM basically cyber-attacks a target through an analog vector of absorption, meaning we don't move in through an antenna through an RF chain and then into the digital part of the system that pushes out some kind of effect. We come straight into the analog pieces like a servo motor or wires that run down the wing of an aircraft. These things become vectors of attack for this type of entry with high-power microwave. The CONOPs would be to find the exposed area of whatever asset you're protecting. If it is a base totally out in the open you can't beam these HPM systems over the base, so you would need to have maybe five or six of our systems positioned in a way that gives you 360-degree coverage. Remember that they're additive; as you scan off angle, you're adding the two together in order to give you a homogeneous bubble – really like a force field of energy with five or six of these. Once Leonidas is installed, it becomes a permanent way to generate an HPM shield that can go defend against any number of drones indefinitely at just the cost of electricity. The Army has tested our HPM technology upways and downways with all their threats that are relevant to these fights overseas – not to mention the fights domestically starting to happen – and we have 100-percent effectiveness. Final thoughts? Epirus is a formidable neo prime or next-generation prime. We work directly with the government, DoD, international agencies, and foreign governments in order to employ one-to-many defensive systems that are geared toward high-value asset protection. That could be bases, military airfields, civilian airports, stadiums, and refineries. As we zoom in, there could be local protection for JLTVs, Strykers, Abrams tanks, and C-17 transports. What we've, in fact, done is create a forcefield of sorts, which by nature is a one-to-many system that can effectively counter swarms, as well as attacks coming from the consumer electronics and the irregular/asymmetric warfare vectors. In order to defend that adequately, we need to do a lot of ‘me too’ and ‘better than’ the other guys – like companies such as Anduril and Saronic are doing. We've got to keep up, but we also have to flip it on its head and create capabilities in areas where the United States still bears a strong advantage. The folks at Epirus were largely trained by the primes. Many of us also have dual backgrounds in consumer electronics and big data. Our CTO has Waymo, Raytheon, and AFRL in his background. By fusing advanced technologies with bold thinking informed by decades of leadership at A&amp;D primes, Epirus is positioned at the forefront of this new neo-prime ecosystem. We're thrilled to be part of the equation.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/high-power-microwave-force-field-knocks-drone-swarms-from-sky/	2025-02-18T05:24:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/IFPC-HPM_NET_PressRelease_May_2024-scaled.jpg
UAE inks $1 billion deal with local firm Calidus for missile system	A HEDA missile on display at Emirati firm Calidus's exhibit at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — The United Arab Emirates today announced an AED 3.76 billion ($1 billion USD) deal with local defense firm Calidus for a new missile system, the largest deal announced on the second day of the International Defense Exposition (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi. The 'Phase 1' announcement, made by the governmental Tawazun Council, was sparse on details, including the number of systems to be procured, but representatives at Calidus's expansive exhibit here said the system was a ground-to-ground missile system that can be mounted on armored vehicles, including light infantry fighting vehicles. (In its announcement, Tawazun briefly showed a photo of the system with several missiles that appeared to be mounted on a heavy duty truck.) Calidus occupies a large event space in an outdoor pavilion, where it's showing off several armored vehicles, one of which featured an 'ALHEDA' mounted missile pod. Also at the stand, the company displayed a new, rugged 8&#215;8 vehicle, which local media said was the 'first to be designed and produced in the region.' Though IDEX focuses more on ground systems (and sister show NAVDEX focuses on maritime), Calidus is also an aircraft producer. Breaking Defense reported in November 2023 that the UAE Air Force had become the firm's first customer for its B250 trainer aircraft. Today's missile system deal represents a sizeable chunk of the total value of agreements signed so far at the show by the Emirati government, according to Tawazun, which reported in all 18 deals have been inked with local and international firms, worth a total of AED 9.8 billion. Day one involved nine local deals and four international deals, totaling AED 4 billion. Agnes Helou contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/uae-inks-1-billion-deal-with-local-firm-calidus-for-missile-system/	2025-02-18T03:07:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/250218_calidus_heda_missile_AGNES-scaled-e1739876302257.jpg
EDGE Group CEO says space, Africa two critical areas for growth in coming years	The EDGE Group stand at IDEX 2025. (Agnes Helou/Staff) IDEX 2025 — As the national champion of the UAE defense market, it's no surprise that EDGE Group has the largest space on the show floor here at IDEX 2025, nor that it seems to have the lion's share of unveilings and announcements through the start of the conference. Among the announcements today: EDGE's joint venture with Fincantieri, known as MAESTRAL, was awarded its first-ever deal , a five-year, €500 million service support deal with the UAE navy. The conglomerate also unveiled a number of unmanned ground vehicles, its new first-person view UAVs, and debuted its national offshore patrol vessel Falaj 3, dubbed the Altaf. But as big as its presence seems on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, EDGE has greater ambitions, according to CEO and managing director Hamad Al Marar. He laid out his plans for growth in an exclusive Monday interview with Breaking Defense. The interview was edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: You have been EDGE Group CEO for one year now. What has been achieved by the group during this one year? HAMAD AL MARAR: Definitely, we have positioned EDGE globally. We have seen a rise in exports and foreign deals. We've surely been working towards a stable order book to keep going, and we have been focused on the areas of focus that we always had, which is autonomous systems, EW and smart weapons. We've been seeing increased offerings, as we have today in our display in IDEX. Recently EDGE Group launched POWERTECH, a new aero engine and propulsion company. What are your plans for the new firm? How far can it take EDGE Groups in the aerospace industry? Engine and propulsion are a very demanding technical endeavor [for] any organization, any country We have been seeing successes on many of our developments, whether it was in the micro jets or the, literally, small piston engines. And we don't see [not to expect] successes in the larger ones. I believe, with putting the right partnerships in place, we will be able to cover, if not all our engine requirements for our systems, [at least] for UAVs. RELATED: Emirate’s EDGE Group marks 5th birthday, from small disruptor to Middle East heavyweight You used the show this week to launch your national offshore-patrol vessel Falaj-3. What is EDGE Group's future plans for the naval sector? And are you planning to develop and manufacture Unmanned Surface Vessels and underwater systems? We have a very strong drive now towards naval applications, whether it was ships, CMS systems [Combat Management Systems], underwater systems and underwater armament, mine disposal. So yes, there is a very strong drive on the navy sector. We had certain successes on autonomous surface vehicles, and we're continuing to do so. One of our entities called Marakeb has been designing autonomous system for vessels. EDGE Group have integrated its payloads on Turkish Baykar UAVs. Have you seen any countries who are procuring the UAVs with your payloads integrated on them? Yes. We have signed a deal with an undisclosed country [not UAE], currently operating the [Bayraktar] TB2, and yes, we are on target [for delivery]. EDGE has been investing worldwide for some time now. After Latin America, which was mainly Brazil, what is the second market that your are trying to increase your presence in? Africa. North Africa, from Egypt to Morocco, the whole of Africa is our focus, besides Brazil, and we have certain focus areas in Asia. But if we look at growth, we see the growth happening fast in Africa. What about Europe? We saw your interest in investing in European firms, what will that look like going forward? Definitely, it's going to pay off. I think when you look at this defense industry, it's quite regulated. Speaking of Europe, you might speak of NATO; speaking of NATO, that might limit you somehow in collaborating outside NATO. So you take two advantages here. One is for us to establish a leg in Europe, where our entities owned in Europe can play the role of doing the products domestically in Europe and selling to Europe. Vice versa is also correct, because they also want to establish [presence] in the UAE for what it is meant to be 70 percent of the world, [including] Latin America, Africa, and Asian. So such a relationship needs to be looked at [as] Europe-centric and outside Europe. And I think we've been doing very well in that. In general, our entities in Europe are already selling to Europe. This is how they were born before, and we see the growth happening, and it continues. With FADA, your new space entity, what is your space ambition? And what are your expectations for FADA, in terms of defense related space, from early warning to missile defense? Space is the future, and there is so much technology that we have to develop or be on par [with competitors] to keep rendering services. It's not limited. It [space applications] could be communication, reconnaissance. We are focused on putting the best engineering experts, because we're not launching it [FADA] for today. We're really going to continue launching way in the future. Therefore it is very important for us to have control over our satellites. For all of this operation [space], you need the regulator. You have players on the market today in Abu Dhabi, Dubai and the UAE that we are fully aligned on, who is going to do what. You can see us really clearly [focusing] on upstream, others are doing the downstream. We're looking at military, some of them are looking at civilian. That area is also so big that we have to continuously improve. Technology is very demanding. We will always try to have the best offering, the best technology, the best AI towards what you want to do. Big picture for EDGE, what's your next five-year plan? Our plan is to continuously grow. Our plan is to grow internationally. Our plan is to see how we can establish alliances with countries outside the UAE.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/edge-group-ceo-says-space-africa-two-critical-areas-for-growth-in-coming-years/	2025-02-17T10:47:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/img_5477-scaled-e1739816889511.jpg
AeroVironment unveils Jump-20X drone at IDEX 2025, eyeing expanded cooperation	An AeroVironment Jump-20X unmanned aerial system on display at IDEX 2025 on Feb. 17, 2025. (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) IDEX 2025 — American defense firm AeroVironment unveiled a new version of a current unmanned aerial vehicle on the first day of the International Defense Exposition (IDEX) in Abu Dhabi, part of a larger push to reel in some customers — as well as potential partners — in the Middle East. 'We're very interested in collaborations in the area [Middle East and Gulf] and we're looking at partnerships. We're looking at production possibilities, and research development possibilities,' the company’s vice president of international business, Charles Dean told Breaking Defense. Dean spoke on the show floor as his company showcased the Jump 20-X, the new maritime version of its current Group 3-sized Jump 20. 'What's unique about our launch here is that this is our new maritime version. We can now fly off of naval ships that have a heavy fuel requirement,' Dean said. (The X, the company's website says, signifies 'cross-domain dominance.') He specified that the new UAV, which is in the final development stages, is equipped with a heavy fuel engine, capable of burning multiple fuel types, including aviation-type fuels. The company said the UAV can fly for 13 hours with 30 pound (13.6 kg) payload and is equipped with Vertical Take-off and Landing (VTOL) capabilities. It is 'going through its final testing, up for sale in the next few months, so customers can place advanced orders right now,' Dean said. AeroVironment is the maker of the Switchblade family of loitering munitions, which the Pentagon has sent by the hundreds to Ukraine and which were among those chosen for the first tranche of Replicator platforms. RELATED: Following Replicator win, AeroVironment sees strong demand for Switchblade, loitering munitions The company also took the IDEX day one opportunity to showcase its new smaller, autonomous drone, the P550, an all-electric UAV designed for 'intelligence gathering, precision targeting, and force protection in dynamic and contested environments,' according to a company release. Dean said the P550 is highly modular, meaning a 'soldier or sailor can put on [multiple payloads] without any tools.' 'So in a matter of a minute, you can take the whole front end off of P550 that might be a reconnaissance payload and put on a whole other, perhaps electronic warfare payload that then take off and fly that mission set,' he said. As for partnerships in the Middle East, there are a few obstacles to contend with. For one, major potential partners like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are pushing aggressively to develop local production of their defense systems, which can include requiring the transfer of production and development. That can run up against US defense trade restrictions. If that's the case, Dean said, 'it's a little bit more difficult, but it's all doable.' He said the company already has such permission for one 'major' Middle East nation, but declined to provide further details.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/aerovironment-unveils-jump-20x-drone-at-idex-2025-eyeing-expanded-cooperation/	2025-02-17T08:39:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/IMG_5445-scaled-e1739809640821.jpg
General Atomics to unveil new ‘super wide area’ sensor for ‘Iron Dome for America’	MQ-9 Reaper aircraft and assigned personnel in Hawaii, Aug. 7, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Joseph Pagan) WASHINGTON — General Atomics is ready to step in the ring to compete for contracts to build President Donald Trump’s 'Iron Dome for America' with a new technology the company believes can radically contain the costs of the project, the head of General Atomics’ aeronautics unit said. The special sauce, Dave Alexander told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview, is a long-range, high resolution sensor that has been under development for about a decade, has a 'super wide area' of coverage, and is ready for production. 'We're ready to rock and roll on this. We’d go straight into production, full-rate production,' he said. 'This Iron Dome is perfect timing for us, and I'd be willing to go into Trump’s office and tell them we're ready to go today.' General Atomics envisions fielding a collection of sensors that would detect threats to the homeland as a ground-based capability and on an air layer integrated onto MQ-9 Reaper drones. Because the sensors have such a wide area of coverage, fewer would be needed to encompass the entirety of the United States, Alexander said. The data gleaned from those sensors can then be digested and combined into a single operating picture by General Atomics’ CCRi division. 'What we're trying to do, is just to grab available technology combined with this new sensor that we're talking about, so that we can get out there and scale and do it for a very affordable price,' he said. 'The cost of what we're talking about on this ground layer sensing is two orders of magnitude less cost than your traditional systems out there today. So that means it's 1/100th of the cost. That's what's game changing about it.' Beyond that, Alexander was willing to give few specifics about the technology, citing classification. He said the sensor has a 'high technology readiness level,' noting that 'the technology has already worked in other areas' outside of the Iron Dome program, with about 80 percent of its funding coming from General Atomics’ internal investment. However he declined to detail what kind of a sensor the company is proposing, whether the sensor has been demonstrated or if it was developed for an existing program. General Atomics intends to respond to Defense Department requests for information and will participate in an industry day on the program this week, said Alexander. The company is also interested in proposing technologies associated with the missile interception piece of Iron Dome, but Alexander declined to provide details about its potential offering. Just a week after taking office Trump released a Jan. 27 executive order that gives the Pentagon 60 days to develop a plan to defeat 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries' through a system he calls 'Iron Dome for America.' Since then, both the Missile Defense Agency and Space Development Agency have put out solicitations for industry on technologies that could be incorporated into the architecture. Alexander’s comments come just days after Gen. Gregory Guillot, commander of US Northern Command and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), told lawmakers that the 'top priority' for Iron Dome should be fielding a sensing grid with nodes located undersea, on the ground, in the air and in space. General Atomics is not the only company that sees Iron Dome for America as a potential moneymaking opportunity. During an earnings call last month, RTX chief executive Chris Calio said the company views the program 'as a significant opportunity for us, something right in our wheelhouse,' while Northrop Grumman CEO Kathy Warden said it was 'very well positioned to support that architecture' during its own earnings call in January.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/general-atomics-to-unveil-new-super-wide-area-sensor-for-iron-dome-for-america/	2025-02-17T06:00:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/8813732-e1739551941716.jpg
As the world reexamines defense priorities, the world looks to UAS like MQ-9B	GA-ASI’s MQ-9B multi-mission UAS delivers the longest range and endurance in its class The world has taken so many turns in the 21st century that it would be foolish to try to predict what might come next. Responsible nations have no choice but to be ready. In the realm of security and defense, the foundation of readiness is information, especially that gathered via intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance. Taking action requires greater insight for informed decision-making. And generals, admirals, ministers, border guards, rescue services, and many others can’t get enough. That’s one reason why the MQ-9B SkyGuardian® and its sibling SeaGuardian® are in such high demand around the world. MQ-9B is the leading multi-mission aircraft of its kind anywhere. With more than 30 hours of endurance, in some configurations, an advanced suite of onboard sensors, and a wide library of payloads—from communications equipment to anti-submarine sensors—MQ-9B is rewriting operational practices around the world. What’s more, because the platform builds on a well-proven series of earlier-model aircraft and didn’t require a risky novel design from a clean sheet, it can deliver these capabilities at much lower cost than an all-new system. Series of new programs The visits world aerospace leaders are making to IDEX in Abu Dhabi this month follow a long series of announcements about new MQ-9B programs around the world. The most recent was in Poland, which is acquiring three aircraft that will play a central role in bolstering European security near NATO’s eastern front. Warsaw’s decision to acquire aircraft of its own followed a highly successful company-owned, company-operated agreement in which builder General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc., flew MQ-9Bs on Polish missions, proving their enduring value. Before that, the government of Japan announced that it, too, would move from a company-owned, company-operated arrangement to a full program of its own aircraft. The Japan Coast Guard has ordered its own production-model MQ-9B SeaGuardian aircraft, and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force has followed suit, which will allow Japan to continue to expand and sharpen its maritime domain awareness in the strategically vital Western Pacific. Japan’s experience with the SeaGuardian has delivered vital intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance data across a variety of fronts, including some that have been a surprise to everyone—as when an MQ-9B detected the eruption of an undersea volcano, enabling Japanese coast guard authorities to warn mariners to steer clear of the area in order to avoid the lava. Japan is using the MQ-9B SeaGuardian for a wide range of maritime missions, including search and rescue Before Japan there was India, which likewise initially began to operate MQ-9B in a work-hire arrangement before placing its own order for a full complement of aircraft. Over tens of thousands of operational hours, MQ-9B has transformed the Indian Navy’s operational capabilities in the Indian Ocean and beyond and was further used to support several missions of global importance. When East African pirates threatened the orderly flow of trade through the region, the Indian Navy responded by tracking and, in some cases, rescuing hijacked ships. MQ-9B was central to those operations, using its long loiter time and precise intelligence-gathering sensors to stay with captured vessels hour after hour. And when Indian Navy special operations forces had to assault vessels to free their crews, MQ-9Bs provided real-time intelligence before, during, and after the operations, enabling commanders on land to watch the action unfold live. Meanwhile, on the other side of the world another government likewise selected MQ-9B for its protection—that being the government of Canada. MQ-9B SkyGuardian will serve as Canada’s mainstay platform for search and rescue, wildfire support, security, and other missions over a vast territory that’s also one of the most difficult in the world for most aircraft to operate in. MQ-9B will meet the challenge head-on, though, as it was purpose-designed to fly in the coldest temperatures, has electro-expulsive de-icing capabilities, and includes highly resilient and versatile satellite communications capabilities that support operations from pole to pole, something true of no other platform in its class. Enduring international demand These users followed orders by Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the U.S. Department of Defense. And the international demand for MQ-9B isn’t letting up. Still more nations, including Denmark, Norway, Morocco, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates are among those that have expressed serious interest. In the case of the UAE, discussions have progressed far enough to yield a commitment that GA-ASI would integrate Emirati-made smart weapons onto a future Emirati MQ-9B. Company President David Alexander has confirmed that the firm has agreed with the Abu Dhabi-based technology group EDGE to support the integration of its precision-guided munitions and guided-glide weapons on the aircraft, following authorization to do so by the UAE and U.S. governments. MQ-9B SkyGuardian is the first U.S. unmanned aircraft approved to carry indigenous UAE smart weapons 'We’re excited to work with EDGE on this initiative,' Alexander said. 'Integrating home-grown capabilities onto our customer platforms is something we’ve done a lot, but we’ve never before integrated a non-NATO weapon system onto one of our RPA platforms.' The partnership marks the first time that UAE-made smart weapons will be integrated onto a U.S. unmanned platform, signaling a new chapter in U.S.-UAE defense cooperation and opening the door to further collaboration. Hamad Al Marar, President of EDGE Group’s Missiles &amp; Weapons cluster, said, 'We are proud to be working with General Atomics Aeronautical. The opportunity to integrate our smart weapons on the MQ-9B SkyGuardian will offer the end user multiple dynamic, highly accurate, and cost-effective ground strike solutions. We look forward to working closely with General Atomics Aeronautical on this program and to enhancing our collaboration in the future.' So as governments around the world reexamine their defense and intelligence outlook at the beginning of a new era in global affairs, many already have chosen MQ-9B. As others approach the point of decision, MQ-9B’s compelling benefits will help to make their choice clear.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/as-the-world-reexamines-defense-priorities-the-world-looks-to-uas-like-mq-9b/	2025-02-17T05:20:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/2303_GA-ASI_JMSDF_Poster-03_Preview_EDITED-scaled.jpg
Estonia wants answers from US on HIMARS production, could turn to other options in ‘months’	US Army soldiers from Able Battery, 3rd Battalion, 321st Field Artillery Regiment, 18th Field Artillery Brigade, launch rockets from HIMARS during a semiannual validation exercise (US Army) MUNICH — Estonia could scrap a plan for a second buy of Lockheed Martin-made M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) if the US government cannot assuage its concerns about lead times and production slots, with a decision likely in the coming months, the Baltic state's defense minister tells Breaking Defense. 'I would like to speak' with the US government to ask, 'are they ready to speed up the production, or are they ready to give us earlier [production] slots because the information we've gathered today clearly shows that delivery time is very long and we don't have so much time,' Hanno Pevkur said in a Friday interview on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference. Primarily designed to strike fixed targets, HIMARS have proven to be formidable assets for Ukraine and are credited with success against Russian supply lines, ammunition depots and command and control centers. The US has suppled 'more than 40' HIMARS to Ukraine, according to a State Department factsheet. Breaking Defense initially reported on the prospect of a second HIMARS order in October, when another Estonian official disclosed issues linked with delivery lead times and pricing. Dependent on how Washington responds to Estonia's questions, Tallinn will either go ahead with a second tranche of HIMARS or change course and potentially opt for an alternative. A decision will be made on the preferred platform in a 'couple of months,' said Pevkur. RELATED: ‘Main focus’: With new defense budget, Estonia pledges big investments in long-range ammo Rocketsan's Khan, from Turkey, and the Elbit Precise and Universal Launching System (PULS), out of Israel, are known to be in the running, but in his discussion with Breaking Defense, Pevkur only mentioned South Korea's Hanwha Aerospace-made K239 Chunmoo. Poland is already a customer for the Chunmoo, and it is also under consideration with Norway, while Hanwha is also providing Estonia with 36 K9 Thunder self-propelled howitzers. Hanwha 'is one of the competitors' involved in the impending artillery equipment decision, Pevkur said, adding that he met with South Korea's acting defense minister Kim Seon-ho and Hanwha Aerospace officials last month. Lockheed Martin did not immediately respond to questions on HIMARS production. 'As a matter of policy, we are unable to comment on or confirm potential or pending arms transfers before they are formally notified to Congress,' said a US State Department official on background. Estonia has needed to invest in long-range fires in part because the country has made major donations of its own equipment to support Ukraine — something Dmytro Kuleba, the former Ukrainian foreign affairs minister, made clear by interrupting Breaking Defense's interview with Pevkur. After making sure Pevkur was talking to a reporter, Kuleba said he wanted to underline publicly how much Estonia's support means to Kyiv. 'Ukrainians appreciate Estonia probably more than anyone else because they gave all the artillery that they had to us&#8230; and never complained, [or said] &#8216;how are we going to survive without howitzers' like some other much more powerful nations did,' Kuleba said. To help fill the gap left by those donations, Tallinn has made key progress on a first order of six HIMARS units, a package worth over $200 million that includes several rocket types that can reach a range between 70km and 300km, communications systems, training and logistics. 'Officially, we've got the keys,' said Pevkur, in recognition of a HIMARS handover ceremony that took place at Lockheed Martin's headquarters in Camden, Arkansas last month. The first six systems 'are somewhere, probably in the Atlantic Ocean at the moment, but they will be delivered very soon,' he added. On other future procurements, Pevkur noted that there is 'still some time' to decide on a XA-180 armored personnel carrier replacement acquisition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/estonia-wants-answers-from-us-on-himars-production-could-turn-to-other-options-in-months/	2025-02-15T12:37:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/max1200-e1739634928119.jpg
German Chancellor’s pushback at Vance brings US-Euro tensions into the public at Munich	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz addresses delegates at the Munich Security ConferencePhoto: MSC/Tobias Koehler MUNICH — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz received rapturous applause from European officials in a fiery speech at the Munich Security Conference that took issue with controversial claims from US Vice President JD Vance surrounding alleged democratic infringements across Europe, hate speech and supposed mistreatment of the far-right, Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. 'We will not accept that people who look at Germany from the outside intervene in our democracy, in our elections and in the democratic opinion forming process in the interest of this party,' said Scholz. 'That is just not done, certainly among friends and allies. We resolutely reject this.' He went on, 'as a strong democracy, we are absolutely clear that the extreme right should be out of political control and out of political decision making processes and that there will be no cooperation with them….I think there is strong consensus between all relevant parties in Germany' on the matter. 'Where our democracy goes from here is for us to decide' Scholz added. German elections are set to take place next week after the collapse of Scholz's three party coalition, with polling indicating that the AfD, whose critics have compared them to neo-Nazis, is on course to return the second largest vote, behind the Christian Democratic Union (CDU). Scholz's Social Democratic Party of Germany is sitting in third place. Scholz's comments came the day after Vance appeared at Munich and gave a speech blasting European politicians for what he called suppressing far-right parties in their countries — in essence, using the security forum, which is traditionally a home for cross-Atlantic coalition building on defense issues, to attack America's allies. Vance’s remarks suggesting Europe’s main threat sits 'from within' seemed to shock attendees here. US President Donald Trump, who did not make the trip to Munich, endorsed the Vance message saying, it was a 'very good speech, actually very brilliant.' Following the speech, European officials, who have been cautious in their comments about the newly-inaugurated Trump administration, seemed ready to drop the veil of politeness, with Scholz — seeking to bolster his party's diminishing chances at home — providing the most open pushback. Asked on stage after his address if there was anything in Vance’s speech worth reflecting on, Scholz sarcastically replied, 'You mean all this very relevant discussions about Ukraine and security in Europe?' Those gathered hummed with laughter, amid a sense that Vance’s blindside attack on European democracy has thrown transatlantic relations into a tailspin. Vance's words have demonstrated that the US looks to be more of 'a divisive force, perhaps not [a] uniting force in Europe,' Alina Polyakova, president and CEO of the Center for European Policy Analysis, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the conference. Polyakova said another delegate at the conference had spoken of how a 'two-front' war has effectively emerged for Europe, comprising of the conventional conflict with Russia and a fight with the US over 'values and principles.' In the lead up to the conference, Trump administration officials have moved away from Ukraine’s long held conditions for securing peace with Russia: the return of illegally seized territory by Russia and future US security guarantees. In addition, comments from Trump have raised fears that he plans to negotiate directly with Russian President Vladimir Putin about Ukraine, sidelining Kyiv and its European allies entirely. European leaders here have been pushing the message that Ukraine must be involved in such talks, including Swedish defense minister Pål Jonson, who told Breaking Defense on Friday that 'There can be no talking about Ukraine without Ukraine.' 'We don't know what the US position is' on Ukraine, said Polyakova. 'The last few days, we've heard a lot of different ideas and a lot of different positions from various parts of the administration here in Munich. 'There is no policy, there is no strategy. There's a threat and it's unclear to me how real that is.' Ukraine giving up half of its mineral reserves in exchange for billions of dollars of US military aid has also been floated by the Trump administration. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent reportedly this week presented Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy with a draft contract that would sign half of Ukraine's mineral wealth to the US, something the Ukrainian leader reportedly did not agree to. 'There's a deal to be had there,' said Polyakova. 'The Ukrainians could basically say, &#8216;look, 60 percent of these deposits are in Russian occupied territory, you give us the weapons to take back the land, you can have it. And that is the kind of transactional mentality that I think is appealing to Trump.' Despite Scholz being quick to dismiss Vance's failure to make Ukraine more of a priority, he made it clear that at a fundamental level, he is on board with US thinking. 'We stand at the side of Ukraine, which has come under attack, and I'm therefore pleased that the American administration has reaffirmed our common objective of preserving the sovereign independence of Ukraine,' he said. 'This sovereign independence has also been reflected in the negotiations.' He added that it is 'right Ukraine is involved as we begin to talk directly with Russia.' Scholz also revealed that he has spoken to Putin 'several times' and put to him what a 'just peace' looks like. 'I trust that we all agree that Russia's war against Ukraine must end as quickly as possible,' he remarked.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/german-chancellors-pushback-at-vance-brings-us-euro-tensions-into-the-public-at-munich/	2025-02-15T06:39:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/20250215MSC2025tk1289-e1739628545577.jpg
Army deploys first Athena-R spy plane to South Korea	A photo of the US Army's new Athena-R aircraft that deployed to South Korea this week. (L3Harris) WASHINGTON — A new US Army spy plane deployed to South Korea this week and is slated to begin key testing to ensure it is ready for operations, according to a senior service leader. Dubbed Athena-R — short for the Army Theater level High Altitude Expeditionary Next Airborne ISR-Radar — the service tasked MAG Air and L3Harris with integrating a suite of sensors and equipment onto two Bombardier Global 6500 business jets. As of this week, that first one is now 'supporting the long-standing commitment we have to the Republic of Korea,' Andrew Evans, the director of the Army’s ISR Task Force, told Breaking Defense today. The service will begin an operational assessment with the aircraft next week that is expected to last about four months and assess any fixes the modified spy plane might need. 'We may spend the first few months doing some adjustments and tweaks. This is our newest system, and so as with any new system, we'll have to work out some bugs, but … we have the right experts on the ground,' Evans said. 'This will be an ongoing and iterative operational assessment with the goal of having those fixes complete in the coming months and then being in a sustainable place here by May or June, with it collecting on behalf of the US Army on a daily basis,' he added. In the meantime, the MAG Air and L3Harris team will continue integration work on the second Athena-R, with Evans eyeing its deployment to the Indo-Pacific region later this fiscal year. The Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) is also under contract to produce two similar aircraft dubbed Athena-Sensor. Those two aircraft are also expected to be ready for deployment later this year, though it is not yet clear where the Army will send them. 'They will be offered for global allocation according to the priorities of the administration, the joint force and OSD [Office of the Secretary of Defense],' Evans said. Both Athena lines are billed as 'bridging' aerial ISR assets as service leaders move out on plans to field the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES). Also centered around the Global 6500, last year the Army selected SNC to proceed with integration work on that program. If the HADES program stays on track, the first aircraft should be ready by the end of 2026 or early 2027, and the service could ultimately acquire more than a dozen under a one-per-year buy depending on budgets and the threat analysis.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-deploys-first-athena-r-spy-plane-to-south-korea/	2025-02-14T11:25:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/L3Harris-ATHENA-R-flight-1-scaled-e1739554062471.jpg
What America’s Iron Dome effort should learn from Israel’s air defense systems	Rockets launched towards Israel from the northern Gaza Strip and response from the Israeli missile defense system known as the Iron Dome leave streaks through the sky on May 14, 2021 in Gaza City, Gaza. (Photo by Fatima Shbair/Getty Images) On Jan. 27 President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at creating 'a next-generation missile defense shield for the United States against ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks,' something he dubbed an 'Iron Dome for America.' That term references the well-known short range Israeli air defense system that has been effective in countering thousands of rocket, and other types of aerial attacks on Israel. The main difference between the Israeli experience, and what the White House is embarking upon, is the fact that the US faces much larger global threats on an exponentially larger scale. Israel is less than one percent the size of the US. Still, there are absolutely lessons the Pentagon can, and should, learn from Israel’s experience with a multi-layered missile defense network — clearly the inspiration behind Trump’s push. Israel’s history of developing new air defenses to defend against emerging threats is closely entwined with the US experience in air defenses. Israel’s Arrow missile program has its origins in Israel’s partnership in the US Strategic Defense Initiative in the 1980s. In 1991, after Saddam Hussein’s invasion of Kuwait and the US deployment for Operation Desert Storm, the US deployed Patriot batteries to Israel to defend against Iraqi Scud missiles. As the Scud missile threat materialized, Israel realized how vulnerable it was and then moved to create the Israel Missile Defense Organization, which became the main body for accelerating work with the US on air defenses. For more coverage of Trump's Iron Dome executive order, click here. Israel’s experience in deploying air defenses illustrates how long it took to keep up with the emerging threats. Despite starting in the 1980s, it wasn’t until 1998 that the Israeli Air Force received the first Arrow 2 missiles. Iron Dome was started in the wake of the 2006 Hezbollah war, when Israel’s home front was battered by rocket fire; It only became operational in 2011. Israel also developed David’s Sling, designed to be the medium range interceptor between Iron Dome and Arrow, in cooperation with the US. Development began in 2006 and it was operational by 2017. Still, the systems have shown themselves to work. Iron Dome became incredibly successful over the years, protecting Israel first against existing rocket threats from Hamas and Hezbollah, and eventually from new emerging threats such as drones and cruise missiles. David’s Sling notched its first success in 2023, stopping a missile aimed at Tel Aviv. Arrow 3, the latest operational Arrow system, achieved its first war-time successful interception in November 2023 during Israel’s recent war. The growing threat of drones is one area that the Israeli experience also informs the US challenge. In the recent war Israel faced threats from up to seven fronts, including Gaza, the West Bank, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Iran. Long range drones were used by Iran and Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. These kinds of drone threats, which can occur over thousands of miles, are one that the US needs to confront. Cartels could use drones, as well as terrorist groups such as the Houthis in Yemen. In addition, drone threats could become part of a conflict in the Pacific. Israel has used every means to shoot down drones, from scrambling F-16s and attack helicopters to using air defense interceptors. Now Israel is moving toward laser air defenses, another type of technology that could inform US decision making on this front. The good news is, while Trump may want everything built in the US, there are ways to tie into the Israeli systems already in use — much of which, it must be noted, American dollars helped fund R&amp;D on. For instance, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems works closely with Raytheon, its US partner, on David’s Sling and Iron Dome. The interceptors for these systems are called Skyceptor and Skyhunter, respectively, in the US; the David’s Sling interceptors are similar to the Patriot PAC-3 and can be used in Patriot batteries. Recent sales of Arrow and David’s Sling to Germany and Finland also illustrate how there is a growing market for these systems. Any new US investment in aerial defense will thus benefit from the Israeli experience because new systems could be deployed to allies abroad. What this means is that the four-decade legacy of joint development of these systems can easily plug-in to the US drive for new air defenses to confront next-generation threats. And that is another key thing the White House has to keep in mind: The threats are going to keep mutating. Adversaries are already rolling out so many types of threats that keeping up with them is a hurdle. Intercepting ballistic missiles or maneuvering missiles, drones and cruise missiles is not the only problem. As Iran showed during its two attacks on Israel in 2024, the main goal is to launch so many missiles that they can overwhelm air defenses. Therefore, building a new system is not the only challenge. Israel’s experience has shown that the second problem to overcome is to have large numbers of interceptors and different types of them to confront all the threats — building up production is going to be key. The US will need to move quickly if it wants to build on existing systems, including existing cooperation with Israel, to roll out Trump’s vision of an American Iron Dome.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/what-americas-iron-dome-effort-should-learn-from-israels-air-defense-systems/	2025-02-14T10:45:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/01/220113_israel_iron_dome_GettyImages-1232873450-scaled-e1739291349746.jpg
Indonesia procures 60 Bayraktar TB3 drones	Baykar Bayraktar TB3 PT2, a Turkish medium-altitude long-endurance (MALE) unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV), successfully takes off from TCG Anadolu's short runway with a 12-degree inclined ramp on November 19, 2024. (Photo by Baykar / Handout /Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish drone maker Baykar will supply Indonesia with 60 Bayraktar TB3 armed drones and nine Akinci surveillance drones, according to Indonesian firm Republikorp. The deal was signed Wednesday by Baykar CEO Haluk Bayraktar and Republikorp founder Norman Joesoef, after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's visit to Indonesia, Turkish news agency Anadolu reported. The value of the deal was not disclosed. Per the agreement, 'a Joint Venture Company (JVC) will be established in Indonesia, focusing on the manufacturing, assembly, and maintenance of UAVs,' Republikorp's statement says. The Bayraktar TB3 can perform Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions and can be equipped with munitions under the wings for combat operations. It is also equipped with communication capabilities that allow control over distances beyond line of sight. The unmanned combat aerial vehicle completed open-sea shipboard trials and performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu, a short runway vessel, in November 2024, Breaking Defense previously reported. The Akinci High-Altitude Long-Endurance UAV entered service with the Turkish armed forces in August 2021, and has received six export contracts so far, according to the company. It is also the drone that was used to locate the helicopter crash of Iranian President Raisi in May 2024. Baykar had previously secured the largest contract in the firm's history to supply Saudi armed forces with Akinci drones. Baykar was in the top 10 Turkish defense exporters in 2024, with export revenue amounting to $1.8 billion.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/indonesia-procures-60-bayraktar-tb3-drones/	2025-02-14T10:01:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/GettyImages-2184995575-scaled-e1732120267604.jpg
DOGE or be DOGE’d: The Army needs to preemptively start cutting	American flag displayed on a laptop screen and Elon Musk post about DOGE on X displayed on a phone screen are seen in this illustration photo taken in Krakow, Poland on November 13, 2024. (Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) The Army currently appears to be holding the weakest hand in the Pentagon budget deliberation process. Just look at the Senate, which is recommending an add of $150B to defense, with priorities listed as growing the Navy and strengthening the shipbuilding industrial base; building an integrated air and missile defense for the Homeland, and investments in the nuclear enterprise. There is only one plus up for the Army: maintaining military readiness. Additionally, the incoming administration has questioned the need for forward deployed troops in Europe, which historically has been a major rationale for the size and structure of the Army. With two strikes against it, the Army is now going to be entering the woodchipper called DOGE and its slash first, fix later philosophy. It may be best for the Army to move first and make the difficult choices on its own. Specifically, with little new money coming into the Army, the best deal the Army can hope for is to keep its own savings. The only way to do this is to ask the Secretary of Defense to let the Army DOGE-itself before Elon Musk and his crew can get the knives out. Here’s where to start. First, the Army needs to organize for 'combat' specifically, by mirroring DOGE’s ability to see through the data. The Army has been hampered in this effort for decades, as many of the Army’s internal data owners claim that the data is theirs, however, as we see across the government, the data belongs to the president. (This should not be confused with the data-right issues associated with weapon systems, which may at some point come to the attention of DOGE; The group currently is only going after the government’s own internal personal and finance data.) The Army, however, in this case may have a running start with its Vantage program that is consolidating multiple sets of data. This may be the time to see if Vantage is worth the price the Army has been paying for it and to see if the Army can make decisions using that data before DOGE accesses it and makes the decisions for the Army. Second, since the DOGE crew prefers to work at midnight, the Army needs to pull some all-nighters and bring back its Night Court process that found $25 billion to cut back in 2018. That version of the Night Court focused on procurement programs and was driven by a desire to hit a specific dollar target. This new version would need to be expanded — and keep cutting until the Army leadership can assure itself that DOGE would find no fat to target. This new process would be deeper and more tedious, and need to cut across three main areas: Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M) funding; Weapon Systems; and Organizational Overhead. The Army’s O&amp;M funding accounts for $71.4 billion (38 percent) of its $185.9 billion FY25 budget request. By its nature, this funding is 'squishy' in that it funds everything from staff support consulting contractors, to fuel, to leases, and yes, subscriptions to media. While previous Night Courts focused on the 500+ or so major defense programs, the O&amp;M transactions number in the hundreds of thousands, so a serious review of every dollar spent has not been done at the most senior levels. However, given modern data analytics, this now appears possible. The Army could start with Elaine McCusker’s report on Defense Budget Transparency and eliminate many of the items she identifies. The O&amp;M accounts also fund the majority of the salaries for the civilian workforce, many of whom are now eligible for buyouts. Next up will be the weapon system accounts, both in research and development, as well as procurement. We already know that Musk has put a target on the F-35 aircraft because he states that 'design was broken at the requirements level, because it was required to be too many things to too many people.' The Army’s new lift helicopter program, FLRAA, has many similarities with the F-35 in complexity, cost, developmental time, and the fact that drones can replace many of its missions. It may be time to kill this program off and invest in transitioning Army aviation to a drone fleet. The Army will also have to wrestle with the statement that Musk has made that tanks are death traps, and will likely need to convince Musk that it is making Abrams smart again. Finally, the Army has too many headquarters and staff, a fact that DOGE will realize in a New York minute. While the current Chief of Staff, Gen. Randy George, has proposed cutting five percent of the General Officers, it is likely that DOGE will be looking for something like a 50 percent reduction. This level of reduction can only be done by dramatically altering the institutional structure of the Army, eliminating entire levels of staff and simplifying the organization. The DOGE shock and awe campaign that has started across the government is being unleashed by the Commander in Chief onto the Pentagon, and everyone in the building is battening down the hatches. The Army is the one service that lacks both congressional and Pentagon support. It needs to give up hope of growth and focus on holding onto the money it already has — and to do that, it needs to change at the speed of DOGE. Retired US Army Maj. Gen. John G. Ferrari is a senior nonresident fellow at AEI. Ferrari previously served as a director of program analysis and evaluation for the service.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/doge-or-be-doged-the-army-needs-to-preemptively-start-cutting/	2025-02-14T09:15:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/doge-logo-scaled-e1734035776699.jpg
Swedish DefMin: ‘No talking about Ukraine without Ukraine’ as tension over peace negotiations stir	A Swedish CV90 Infantry Fighting Vehicle maneuvers through the tree line during a training exercise between Swedish and American forces of the Minnesota National Guard’s 1st Combined Arms Battalion – 194th Armor (DVIDS) MUNICH — Ukraine must be included in any negotiations aimed at ending war with Russia, Pål Jonson, Sweden's Defense Minister, told Breaking Defense at the Munich Security Conference today, despite US President Donald Trump opening peace talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin. 'That is a given. There can be no talking about Ukraine without Ukraine,' said Jonson, as world leaders, defense industry chiefs and analysts gathered for discussions on the opening day of the event. 'They have to be involved in these negotiations.' Europe must also have a say in peace negotiations noted Jonson, because the continent has supplied around 60 percent of all military aid to Ukraine over the last year alone and any settlement will have 'important ramifications for security' across the region. As a priority, Sweden will continue to deliver weapons to Kyiv 'as quickly as possible,' so Ukraine can negotiate from a position of strength, he added. Stockholm has spent SEK 61.9 billion ($5.8 billion) on military aid to Ukraine over the course of the war including supplies of Archer self-propelled howitzers, Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90) infantry fighting vehicles, Pbv 302 armored personnel carriers, RBS Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and TOW anti-tank missiles. RELATED: Sweden’s new $1.2B donation to Ukraine includes drones, missiles and boats Jonson also backed Ukraine's campaign to join NATO, following Pete Hegseth, US Defense Secretary, telling a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting on Wednesday that the 'United States does not believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement.' Sweden entered the alliance last year, following decades of non-military alignment. 'We were very grateful that NATO opened the door for us when we applied in May 2022, and we don't think that it would be wise to leave Ukraine outside of the Euro-Atlantic structures,' said Jonson. 'Therefore we think it's very important that they have to maintain a membership perspective, even if it is not going to happen tomorrow.' On US links, Jonson said he had a 'good discussion' with Hegseth at a NATO defense ministers meeting on Thursday, without disclosing details. Hegseth has, however, been 'crystal clear' on the need for Europe to 'shoulder a lot' more responsibility concerning support for Ukraine, said Jonson. 'It's a valid point,' he explained. Long-term, Sweden has committed to spending 2.6 percent GDP on defense, significantly boosting expenditure last year with a jump of 28 percent, equivalent to $10.8 billion. Any additional increase above the 2.6 percent pledge depends on finalizing NATO capability targets, according to Jonson. Work on the capability targets is 'underway,' said Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General on Tuesday. The targets are set to be released in the summer, according to Reuters, and are designed to deliver better standards of readiness, interoperability and coordination across members on items like air and missile defense systems. Separately, Swedish lawmakers are considering launching a future fighter 'enquiry' later this year, following studies on the subject already underway by the Swedish armed forces and the Swedish Defence Material Administration (FMV). The parliamentary project could begin 'later this year,' said Jonson and run for a 'couple of years.' Sweden's Gripen fighter jet will be in service until around 2060, but Stockholm has decided to settle on a procurement pathway for a next generation aircraft by 2031 and is focused on three options: rely on development of an indigenous platform, join a program with other nations or acquire an off the shelf aircraft. 'I don't want to jump into any conclusions before the enquiry has even started,' Jonson said, giving nothing away about which option might be favored.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/swedish-defmin-no-talking-about-ukraine-without-ukraine-as-tension-over-peace-negotiations-stir/	2025-02-14T08:05:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/3801975-scaled-e1696863427965.jpg
Army, Navy experimentation efforts foreshadow second wind for Hypervelocity Projectile	A rendering of BAE Systems's Hypervelocity Projectile. (Image courtesy of BAE Systems.) WASHINGTON — The munition once slated for use on the US Navy’s failed electromagnetic railgun may be getting a second wind for both the service’s ubiquitous MK-45 5-inch gun, as well as a new Army initiative to defend bases from aerial drones. The Hypervelocity Projectile, produced by BAE Systems, is a maneuvering, precision guided munition capable of intercepting anti-ship cruise missiles. Its development and experimentation through multiple branches of the Pentagon spans back to 2012 when it was, at that time, destined for use on a key railgun capability to be installed on the Zumwalt-class destroyers. The Navy ultimately canned the railgun program in 2021, instead opting to outfit the Zumwalt class with the hypersonic weapon now called 'Conventional Prompt Strike.' But in the intervening years, HVP transitioned to programs at the Strategic Capabilities Office, Army and the Air Force Research Laboratory. Now, both the Navy and Army have taken up efforts that could lead to its wider fielding. For the Navy, this has come in the form of the Major Caliber Anti-Drone Air Program (MADCAP), Inside Defense reported. The crux of that testing, which began quietly last year, is to determine the viability of launching the HVP from BAE's Mk-45 naval gun as a means of defense against the kinds of drone threats that have been pervasive in the Red Sea. RELATED: Navy Is Down $1B In Munitions From Ops In Red Sea, Says SECNAV Tate Westbrook, BAE Systems director of business development for naval guns and missile launchers, told Breaking Defense in January during the Surface Navy Association symposium that if brought to full-rate production, HVP would be a 'fractional cost' compared to using Standard Missile, the Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile or the Rolling Airframe Missile. (Standard Missile in particular has been a favored, but relatively expensive, interceptor for Navy destroyers tasked with eliminating low-cost Houthi-based threats in the Red Sea.) The Navy’s ships operate using a principle of 'layered defense,' meaning that ships are equipped to employ different capabilities depending on how far away a threat is spotted. Westbrook, a retired surface warfare officer, characterized the 5-inch-gun and associated HVP round as a 'middle-range engagement.' Separately from the Navy’s MADCAP program, the Army in December announced it is planning to award BAE a contract to provide what has been dubbed the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon and Hypervelocity Projectile (MDACS) prototype. The Army’s Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office is aiming to develop and deliver a full MDACS battery no later than fourth quarter of fiscal 2027, which consists of 'eight Multi-Domain Artillery Cannons, four Multi-Function Precision Radars, two Multi-Domain Battle Managers, and separately, no less than 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles,' according to a public notice. The Army’s notice was an 'intent to sole source,' meaning that no contracts have been signed yet and plans could still change pending detailed negotiations with BAE. It’s 'same basic projectile that we would offer to the Navy,' Christopher Laski, director of business development for precision guided munitions programs at BAE, told Breaking Defense this week. 'The difference is, you’re going to be firing it out of an Army 155-millimeter gun.' Similar to the Navy, the Army’s public notice explicitly calls out MDACS and HVP as a defense against unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and other advanced air threats. The notice also said the Army is planning an assessment in 2028 to determine if the technology can be fielded. 'The Army has its procurement path, and the Navy has their procurement path to be responsive to their particular acquisition fielding needs,' said Laski. 'As you start tailoring it to specific service needs, you get those efficiencies and the right skill sets&#8230; the base to go design, develop, test and deliver the particular round to a particular service’s need. And so you get some of those natural efficiencies of having a common technology base.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/army-navy-experimentation-efforts-foreshadow-second-wind-for-hypervelocity-projectile/	2025-02-14T07:05:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/NEW-BAE_HVP_MidAir-scaled-e1739459255839.jpg
Ukraine orders 6,000 loitering munitions from Germany’s Helsing	An international donor has agreed to fund Ukraine's order of 6,000 Helsing manufactured and AI-enabled HX-2 loitering munitions (Helsing) MUNICH — Funded by an undisclosed international donor, Ukraine has placed an order with a leading European defense startup for production of 6,000 AI-enabled platforms, in a bid to significantly increase the war ravaged nation's loitering munitions inventory. The acquisition of Germany’s Helsing HX-2 one way attack drones coincides with a newly opened, first-of-its-kind production facility in southern Germany, dubbed RF-1, said the company in a translated company statement released on Thursday. The abbreviation stands for Resilience Factory. A Helsing spokesperson told Breaking Defense today that the HX-2 international donor 'will make' a future announcement about underwriting funding for the order. 'This new batch [of HX-2 loitering munitions] positions Helsing among the largest strike drone manufacturers in the world,' said the company in its statement. The new production site, it added, will 'initially' support production of 1,000 HX-2 aircraft per month, suggesting capacity can be increased if further demand merits a ramp up. 'Helsing has the ambition to deploy Resilience Factories across the European continent, with the ability to scale up production to tens of thousands of units in the event of conflict,' it noted. Ukraine previously ordered 4,000 HX-2 aircraft, said the Helsing spokesperson. The AI capabilities of the platform make it resistant to electronic warfare detection and it has been designed to strike artillery and armored targets out to a range of 100km, according to a product profile. Additionally, the integration of Helsing’s Altra reconnaissance and strike software enable deployment of HX-2 drone swarm formations. 'The HX-2 has been designed to be produced in large quantities and at a unit cost significantly lower than traditional systems, filling a growing gap in modern land warfare capabilities,' the company added. Loitering munitions have been a common feature of the war in Ukraine, offering combat mass at relatively low cost and short production cycles. Others that have arrived on the frontline include US Switchblades and French OSKAR (Opportunity Strike Kinetics Aircraft Ruggedised) systems. The startup has quickly made a distinctive mark on the European defense market by securing key contracts for the AI 'backbone' of the French-German-Spanish Future Combat Air System (SCAF), cooperating with Airbus on the Wingman future unmanned aircraft concept and is under contract to deliver a new AI-enabled electronic warfare platform as part of Saab's wider effort to integrate Arexis sensor equipment package on German Eurofighter EK (Electronic Combat) fighter jets.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/ukraine-orders-6000-loitering-munitions-from-germanys-helsing/	2025-02-14T06:01:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/HX-2-1.jpg
EDGE Group launches aero engine and propulsion firm, expands UAV testing facility	Swarming drones at EDGE Group's stand at Dubai Air Show 2023 (Agnes Helou / Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — Just days before the largest defense show in the Middle East, UAE defense giant EDGE Group announced its new aero engine and propulsions systems manufacturer POWERTECH. POWERTECH is EDGE's first company dedicated to developing and producing 'high-performance aero engines and complete propulsion systems. With a clear ambition to compete in the global propulsion market, POWERTECH will deliver reliable, purpose-built engines for civil aerospace and defence applications,' the firm said in a statement Wednesday. The company noted that POWERTECH will address 'international market needs' and will support the firm's unmanned and autonomous systems for national and international markets. 'The launch of POWERTECH represents a strategic move to enter the global propulsion market while enhancing EDGE’s capabilities across aerospace and autonomous systems,' Khaled Al Zaabi, president of EDGE's platforms and systems, said in the statement. 'By developing tailored, application-specific solutions, we are strengthening our market position and creating new opportunities for innovation and collaboration.' In a statement Thursday, EDGE also announced the expansion of XRANGE, its unmanned aerial vehicles testing facility launched by the firm's subsidiary REMAYA in November 2023. The expansion will include 'a secondary runway, two emergency runways, an environmental test centre, an unmanned aerial systems (UAS) Drone Training Village, and expansion of airspace for customer operations.' EDGE has also introduced a 'data acquisition systems facility' and will further add 'vehicle blast and ballistics test service' to the center, according to the statement. 'XRANGE was designed to push the boundaries of what is possible in terms of conducting critical TT&amp;E activities in the UAE,' CEO of REMAYA Haitham Awinat said in the statement. 'While significantly boosting our operational flexibility, these enhancements allow our clients to expedite their product development processes and accelerate the delivery of their solutions to market.' The secondary runway is 1.2 km long, increasing UAS operations on the test island. 'The new runway doubles the test island’s capacity to hold simultaneous flight operations for the conventional take-off and landing of UAVs while enhancing overall operational flexibility,' the firm said in a statement. EDGE Group is expected to display 200 defense platforms and services at the International Defense Exhibition and Conference, and the accompanying Naval Defense Exhibition taking place next week in Abu Dhabi.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/edge-group-launches-aero-engine-and-propulsion-firm-expands-uav-testing-facility/	2025-02-14T05:10:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/370244807_804947507984036_3855702757333965982_n-e1701364254203.jpg
Sensing grid should be ‘top priority’ for US Iron Dome: NORTHCOM head	An upgraded Ground Based Interceptor with a Capability Enhanced-II Block 1 Exo-Atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) is launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, during Flight Test Ground-based Midcourse Defense Weapon System-12, or FTG-12, on December 11, 2023 WASHINGTON — To make President Donald Trump’s vision of an Iron Dome missile shield for the United States a reality, the Defense Department should focus first on fielding a multi-layer sensor architecture with systems proliferated 'from seabed to space' and capable of tracking threats at greater distances, the head of US Northern Command said today. 'The top priority in our efforts to meet the direction of the [Iron Dome for America] executive order is first and foremost to establish increased domain awareness,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, who also leads North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing. 'You can't defeat what you can't see, and the adversaries have an increasing capability of reaching us and threatening us from ranges beyond what some of our current systems can detect and track.' That architecture would include space and ground-based sensors, air-based assets like the E-7 Wedgetail, and other sensing nodes on the bottom of the sea, all of which could provide enhanced missile detection, tracking and warning capabilities, he said. 'Some of those capabilities are right on the edge,' Guillot said. 'Others are probably three to five years out, but I think within sight of a year we could have a significant capability that could network those into a single sensing grid.' Trump made an 'Iron Dome for America' a major campaign priority, promising to build 'a dome like has never seen before, a state-of-the-art missile defense shield that will be entirely built in America.' Just a week after taking office, he released a Jan. 27 executive order that gives the Pentagon 60 days to develop a plan to defeat 'ballistic, hypersonic, advanced cruise missiles, and other next-generation aerial attacks from peer, near-peer, and rogue adversaries.' Since then, the department has been racing to figure out how to develop and deploy the missile shield —which will comprise current capabilities and emerging technologies — as well as how to fund a project that experts have said will be both costly and technologically challenging. The Missile Defense Agency last week issued a request for information on technologies that could be incorporated into the Iron Dome. The RFI seeks capabilities that could be fielded in two-year increments until 2030, as well as long-term ideas that would become operational afterwards. On Monday, the Space Development released its own solicitation, asking industry for suggestions on how the agency’s Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) satellite network could support a US-based Iron Dome. Beyond increased sensing capabilities, Guillot told lawmakers the Iron Dome effort should build on existing ground-based interceptors and next-generation interceptors built to defeat intercontinental ballistic missiles. It’s also 'imperative' that the Pentagon expands space-based capabilities for tracking hypersonic missiles, such as the Hypersonic and Ballistic Tracking Space Sensor (HBTSS), he added later during the hearing. Improving the detection of threats is increasingly important given the heightened levels of Chinese and Russian activity near the US homeland, as well deepening cooperation between the two nations, such as an instance when Chinese and Russian bombers flew a combined patrol near Alaska last summer, said Guillot, adding that he expects to see such activities increase across the air, maritime and undersea domains. 'What I worry about the most is that — instead of just weapons and technology — that they will trade access, which would shorten our timelines to react to either country's military capabilities,' Guillot said. Asked what technology would be most critical for mitigating that threat, he once again pointed to the need for better threat detection. 'The most important capability we would need is the improved domain awareness to allow us to see at further ranges. As military capabilities improve by our adversaries, we have to match that with our detection capability,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/sensing-grid-should-be-top-priority-for-us-iron-dome-northcom-head/	2025-02-13T13:10:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8163579-e1731077723934.jpg

Heven Drones unveils new hydrogen-powered, long range UAV at IDEX	Concept image of the Raider, a hydrogen powered unmanned system from Heven Drones. (Heven Drones) JERUSALEM — Heven Drones is unveiling a new, hydrogen-powered unmanned aerial system ahead of the upcoming IDEX conference, as the company seeks to expand its footprint in the Gulf. Dubbed the Raider, the new platform is 'tailored to provide extended endurance, versatile payload options, and field-ready modularity, addressing critical challenges faced by modern operators,' the company said in a statement. Speaking to Breaking Defense, company CEO Benzion Levinson said the decision to pursue the new design was driven by the recent conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, which have shown drones are moving from being 'flying cameras' to being 'flying robots.' The Raider is designed with a twin fuselage and vertical-take-off-and-landing capabilities. The addition to VTOL capabilities to drones has become common because it enables them to take-off from naval vessels, and also makes them easy to deploy in different environments. The images of the drone provided by the company show an airframe with the two fuselages which also have the four rotors for the VTOL option, and a tail section, with a thin body. The drone is shown carrying a payload that is shaped like a fuel tank or targeting pod. It appears like it could also carry a munition in this format, although the company did not specify which types of payloads it could carry. However, the payload, of about 50 pounds, fits into broader US Department of Defense guidelines, which means the US is a potential market. Switching to hydrogen meant the design of the Raider was made to take advantage of stealth-like characteristics, including what Levinson said is a low radar cross section — although he did not specify how low. The front of the Raider, a hydrogen powered unmanned system from Heven Drones. (Heven Drones) Levinson said the Raider uses hydrogen which 'is transferred into a fuel cell and it has chemical reaction, and [the] outcome is electric.' He claimed it is five times more energy efficient than a battery. The hydrogen can be refilled at a refueling station, built by the company, that can be pulled by a vehicle such as a Humvee. 'Hydrogen lets you fly up to 1,000km,' he said, saying that Raider can operate for around ten hours. 'Raider is scheduled to fly before the end of the year and be operational in 2026,' according to the CEO. It fits the niche between small quadcopters and larger drones that resemble full-size aircraft; while not going into pricing, he claimed the Raider will be '100 to 1,000 times cheaper' than traditional MALE UAVs like the MQ-9. Heven was founded in Israel and continues to do some research and development in Israel, but the firm is officially headquartered in Miami, Florida — important both for selling to the US and, for political reasons, for potential customers in the Middle East. That the company is unveiling the system at IDEX is no coincidence. Still, Levinson was quick to note, the system has enough power to be relevant in the Indo-Pacific. 'Most of globe is water and conflicts happen in those areas. The Indo-Pacific is a big one for the US,' he noted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/heven-drones-unveils-new-hydrogen-powered-long-range-uav-at-idex/	2025-02-13T11:15:56-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/HEVEN_RAIDER_OVERVIEW-scaled-e1739288112317.jpg
Frozen drones and robotic mules: What the US Army learned from a key exercise in Germany	US Army Pvt. Miguel Garcia, a cannon crewmember with 5-25 Charlie Battery, 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division, utilizes cover and concealment to safeguard the area of operation at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany, Jan. 31, 2025. (US Army Reserve/Staff Sgt. Tristan Peete) WASHINGTON — Freezing fog and chilling rain put new US Army drones and tech to a wintery test when soldiers with the 3rd Light Brigade Combat Team, 10th Mountain Division headed to Germany for a key exercise, according to a trio of Army officials. As part of Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George’s effort to test new formations and push technology to the force more quickly, last year he tasked three infantry units with testing out new equipment in different climates under the 'transformation in contact' (TiC) 1.0 banner. The 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division headed to the swamps in Ft. Johnson, La. while the 2nd Light Brigade Combat Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division was out in Hawaii. Soldiers from 3-10 Mountain Division got tasked with the cold, and towards the end of their nine-month stint in Europe, capped off TiC 1.0 testing as part of the Combined Resolve exercise at the Joint Multinational Readiness Center in Hohenfels, Germany. 'This is bottom-up innovation from our troops on how we need to change how we train and operate, how we change how we're organized. And it has informed a lot on how we buy things and really what we buy,' George, just back from Europe, told reporters Wednesday in the Pentagon. 'It was very icy, very cold, very wet…but that's exactly what we wanted to do. We wanted to exercise things and all different types of terrain,' the four-star general added. Smaller drones had battery problems while larger quadcopters had to be grounded when freezing fog covered the hills. Soldiers were fans of the newer Infantry Squad Vehicles while the robotic mule got mixed reviews. When soldiers with the 3-10 Mountain Division, headed to Europe for a rotation in July 2024, they did so with a host of the TiC 1.0 tech and weapons including new drones, loitering munitions, ground vehicles, and a 'minimal viable' version of the Command and Control (C2) Fix, commander Col. Joshua Glonek told Breaking Defense during a Feb. 8 interview. 'Throughout the course of the deployment, my brigade has been arrayed along NATO's eastern flank, really, from the Baltics up in Estonia all the way down to the Black Sea region in Romania,' Glonek said. 'To be able to field this equipment dispersed all throughout Eastern Europe, we had to get the requisite agreements with all the countries we were in to start flying these drones and operating the equipment in their training areas.' Getting those approvals was a major time suck, Glonek said, but he believes having done it once means future units will have an easier time navigating the bureaucratic process. And with approvals in place, the unit reorganized to spread sensors and shooters throughout the formation. 'What we're trying to do is to shorten the kill chain and reduce the time it takes from identifying an enemy force to acting on it, whether that be through lethal fires or sort of effects that we're trying to achieve,' Glonek said. For the 3-10 Mountain Division, it opted to create three identical 'strike' companies with 80 soldiers in each — one for each of the formation's three infantry battalions. Within each strike company, Glonek explained, there is a scout platoon, mortar platoon and a lethal unmanned system platoon. The latter included smaller squads to fly drones, loitering munitions and systems to take down incoming aerial drones. Electronic warfare teams were also integrated into the formation. 'The strike company is designed to be the lead echelon of the battalion, which combines manned and unmanned sensors in order to make contact with the enemy and to attrit enemy forces before they come in the range of our traditional infantry companies,' Glonek explained. So how did the new equipment perform? Across the formation, 144 new and experimental drones were given to soldiers to test out, with mixed results. At the company level and below, they used Skydio’s RQ-28A quadcopter, and the C-100 multi-mission quadcopter from Performance Drone Works. One clear lesson: 'We were seeing [a] very, very reduced battery capacity, which were limiting the amount of time we could fly those short-range drones,' Glonek said. 'For the medium- and the long-range drones, those really weren't affected that much by the cold weather in terms of their battery life.' Alex Miller, the Army Chief's Chief Technology Officer, told reporters on Tuesday that in the freezing climate the RQ-28A experienced battery challenges. Although soldiers had been able to fly that Skydio drone for up to 20 minutes in warmer test events, in the German winter they would only stay up in the air for four-to-five minutes. 'Either you carry a lot more batteries, which are heavy, or we figure out better ways to get more out of…the batteries that we will have,' Miller said. Soldiers with 3-10 altered how they used the drones to maximize those five minutes, he noted, without going into detail on what that looked like. The lessons learned will help feed into future requirements for smaller drones, Miller indicated. The C-100 — a man-packable quadcopter designed to ferry up to 15 pounds, for missions up to 74 minutes— is one of two drones the service recently selected for its medium-range reconnaissance line. While the second one, Anduril’s Ghost X, was also in the field but with the 3-10 Mountain Division opted to use them differently. The C-100 'performed relatively well' and was used more for close-in-reconnaissance missions since it has a shorter range, Glonek explained. His soldiers then used the Ghost X for targeting and directing artillery, mortars and loitering munitions towards targets. While the commander called the Ghost X quadcopter a 'very effective system' when the weather dropped below the freezing point, soldiers had to ground it. 'What frequently happens at the [Joint Multinational Readiness Center] is the fog sets in, you sort of get freezing fog,' Glonek said. 'Just like any aircraft, you get icing on the blades or the propellers, and you're limited in the ability to fly. So there were times where we couldn't get the aircraft up because of how adverse the weather conditions were.' While Miller did not specifically discuss the Ghost X with reporters, he said one option for cases like that is to coat them in anti-freeze spray on the drone and 'accept that there's a little bit of risk there.' Interestingly, Glonek said that two unnamed vendors for the possible upcoming Long-Range Reconnaissance drones competition also joined soldiers out in Germany. While Glonek said his brigade was not there to evaluate the competitors, they were able to provide feedback on how such a weapon could be used on the battlefield. Such a drone, he explained, provided his soldiers with a greater standoff distance. During a nighttime operation, for example, the LRRs flew 10 km ahead of his frontline to detect the opposition force, enabling soldiers to call for artillery fire and strike 50 percent of the spotted opposition force before it left the assembly area. 'The Ghost X is really good for our strike companies … providing observation within range of their organic systems,' Glonek said. 'But at the brigade level, I need to look much deeper, because I'm trying to identify enemy formations before they get within range of the battalion.' Not all the weapons and new tech tested out were relegated to the air. Two GM Defense- developed Next Generation Tactical Vehicle-Hybrid, or NGTV-H, were also out at the event. Soldiers used those two vehicles as part of the more mobile brigade tactical command post, and were able to operate them for 72-hours before refueling. There were also 96 of GM’s Infantry Squad Vehicles (ISV), at the event and the formation was tasked with helping the Army decide how many vehicles should be fielded to formations. The feedback, Glonek said, was that all infantry formations should receive the vehicle since it provides 'exceptional mobility.' 'The ISV is a mobility platform, not a fighting vehicle, and if you make contact with the enemy at an ISV, that is more than likely going to result in a lot of friendly casualties,' Glonek added. 'We spent a lot of time talking about the need to dismount in the right locations, so that by the time you made contact with the enemy, you were dismounted, spread out in a combat maneuver formation, not fully mounted on ISVs.' Soldiers with 3-10 also tested out the Army’s new robotic mule dubbed the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET), produced by General Dynamics Land Systems. They primarily loaded the ground vehicles up with ammunition and anti-tank weapons, and then moved through the woods with the S-METs trailing behind. By and large, the feedback was positive, but there were times when rough terrain forced soldiers to deviate from their planned route. 'We used it all the way to the front lines, and some of the feedback was, there's probably some situations where we wouldn't do that again, just because we're trying to stay in very covered and concealed routes,' Glonek added. 'We don't want to have to change our route up to accommodate areas where the S-MET can or can't go.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/frozen-drones-and-robotic-mules-what-the-us-army-learned-from-a-key-exercise-in-germany/	2025-02-13T09:58:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Tic1-scaled-e1739460474719.jpg
US Navy’s carrier Truman involved in collision with merchant vessel, no flooding or injuries	The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) transits the Atlantic Ocean. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class K. H. Anderson/Released) WASHINGTON — The aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman (CVN-75) was involved in a collision with a merchant vessel this week while operating near Egypt, according to a US 6th Fleet spokesman. 'The collision did not endanger the Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) as there are no reports of flooding or injuries. The propulsion plants are unaffected and in a safe and stable condition. The incident is under investigation. More information will be released as it becomes available,' Cmdr. Timothy Gorman said in a statement today. The incident took place on Feb. 12 at 11:46 p.m. local time in the 'vicinity' of Port Said. Open source websites tracking global shipping via automatic identification system (AIS) information indicate the merchant vessel, Besiktas-M, is a bulk carrier that sails under the flag of Panama. Since the October 2023 attack on Israel, the US Navy’s carrier strike groups have been rotating in and out of the Mediterranean and Red Seas, charged both with aiding in the defense of the US ally as well as trying to maintain safe sea lanes for commercial shipping. Although the Pentagon is reporting there were no injuries or flooding aboard the Truman, any time a US Navy ship is involved in a collision, it immediately stirs up investigations not just within the Defense Department but also among lawmakers. In 2022, the submarine Connecticut (SSN-22) was involved in an allision — when a ship strikes a stationary object, as opposed to a collision which is between two moving vessels. An investigation later pinned blame for that mishap on an 'accumulation of unit-level errors and omissions in navigation planning; watch team execution; and risk management.' Prior to that in 2017, the Navy came under intense scrutiny from Capitol Hill and the general public when two of its destroyers separately collided with merchant vessels while at sea, killing 17 sailors. Investigations that followed those incidents found the ship's crews were under trained and sleep deprived.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/us-navys-carrier-truman-involved-in-collision-with-merchant-vessel-no-flooding-or-injuries/	2025-02-13T08:40:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/2065424-scaled-e1706551345299.jpg
From rebuilding the armed forces to selling drones, how Turkey can enhance Syria’s defense	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (R) and Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa (L) shake hands as they hold a joint press conference after their meeting at Presidential Complex in Ankara, Turkiye on February 4, 2025. (Photo by Mehmet Ali Ozcan/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As the new administration in Syria takes control, experts are looking at the role Ankara may play to help boost the Syrian defense sector — starting with rebuilding the armed forces which disassembled after the fall of the Bashar al-Assad regime in December. And if Turkey and Syria truly strengthen their ties, analysts say, expect Syria to emerge as a market for Turkish-made weapons and security systems. Syrian transitional president Ahmad Al-Sharaa and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan met Feb. 4, during which the two men announced the relationship between the two nations would be elevating to a 'strategic level.' More concretely, Reuters reported the two men also discussed creating a defense pact that would could include establishing Turkish military bases inside Syria. Despite nothing being signed yet, four analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense consider the potential defense pact to be major sign of how relations between the two countries have warmed since the fall of Assad, and how Turkey is looking to expand its influence in the region. 'Turkey is a key actor in Syria, with significant military capacity, which will be essential in rebuilding the Syrian Army,' Murat Yesiltas, director of Security Studies at the Turkish think tank SETA Foundation, told Breaking Defense. 'Additionally, Turkey has played a diplomatic role in shaping the post-December 8 process, laying the groundwork to support Syria's territorial integrity and garner regional backing for the new government.' He added that such an agreement would likely formalize Turkey's military presence in Syria and enhance cooperation in the reconstruction of the Syrian army and counterterrorism efforts. Ali Bakir, a professor at Qatar University and non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told Breaking Defense that such a pact would benefit from focusing on on creating, training, and equipping a professional Syrian army according to NATO standards. 'The primary goal is to accelerate stabilization efforts in Syria and establish a capable, well-equipped military force that can ensure long-term security and stability. Such a development would not only assist the new Syrian administration in securing the country but also enable rapid control over all Syrian territories,' he said. Bakir added that a strong Syrian army will play a major role in combating 'cross-border organized crime, smuggling of drugs or weapons, and other regional threats. It would safeguard the security and integrity of Syria's borders while preserving the nation's unity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.' Syrian armed forces have been shattered after nearly 14 years of combat with rebels, and Assad’s regime was only able to survive as long as it did with the support of Russian and Iranian armed forces, who were on ground in Syria. Unlike his colleagues, Serhat Süha Çubukçuoğlu, an expert at Trends Research &amp; Advisory in Abu Dhabi, doesn't expect the pact to be signed in the short term, calling it a 'far-flung goal for now' as 'Al-Sharaa is wary of putting all the eggs in the same basket, instead trying to maximize his interests by playing all sides, from Saudis to the UAE and the US to the Israelis.' Nevertheless, he acknowledged that should Turkey get basing rights in Syria, a base near Homs could give Turkey a strategic advantage to balance Israel’s growing clout in the region and act as a deterrent against further escalation in Syria. 'The proposed agreement includes bases in central desert region (Badiyah), with key installations at Palmyra and T4 (Althias) airbase, that could serve as outposts for SIGINT-ELINT and forward deployments of UAVs for surveillance missions. It would also open a new front against the YPG-PKK, which Ankara is determined to dismantle,' he stated. While the defense pact may be the more important part of the Feb. 4 meeting, the experts also said not to dismiss the power of the statement that the relationship could hit a 'strategic' level. 'The elevation of relations between the two countries to a &#8216;strategic level' in the defense and security sector signifies a high degree of interoperability, interdependence, information sharing, cooperation, and coordination on matters pertaining to national security, as well as threats to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of both nations,' Bakir said. He added that Turkey, with its extensive experience in institution-building, is well-positioned to play a pivotal role in this partnership. 'Given that Syria's institutions, army, and internal security forces need to be rebuilt from the ground up, it will require significant time and effort for these entities to reach their full potential. During this transitional phase, Turkey can provide critical support in terms of expertise, training, and resources, helping Syria establish a robust and modern defense infrastructure,' Bakir said. Turkish defense expert Barin Kayaoglu compared what Turkey may seek to do with what it has been doing in Somalia, where Turkish officials have been working to rebuild state institutions and the military. 'This includes leveraging Syria as a strategic asset in countering Israel’s assertive posture, responding to potential U.S. troop withdrawals, and ensuring Syria’s political transition aligns with Turkey’s interests,' Çubukçuoğlu told Breaking Defense. 'Key objectives involve dismantling the YPG-PKK, securing a maritime border agreement, and integrating Syrian military priorities with Turkey’s regional strategy. Additionally, it strengthens Turkey’s position in the Eastern Mediterranean, including its approach to Cyprus via air and naval bases on the island.' The goal of any agreements between Turkey and Syria are, of course, geopolitical. But for Turkey's domestic defense industry, there would be a major benefit. Experts agree that Syria is expected to become a customer for Turkish defense platforms, whether in the short term or in the long term, to rebuild its armed forces that were shattered in the national conflict as well as its armament warehouses that were targeted by Israel. 'Syria’s military infrastructure has been severely damaged by Israeli strikes, both during the war and in the aftermath of December 8. As a result, the new Syrian Army will need to be built from the ground up, with its force structure designed accordingly. This will require the development of land, naval, and air capabilities,' Yesiltas told Breaking Defense. Bakir added: 'It is highly probable that the new Syrian administration will look to import Turkish defense equipment and technology, potentially even aspiring to adopt the Turkish model for building an indigenous defense industry. Syria possesses significant human capital and resources, and with proper stabilization, guidance, and support, it could leverage these assets to develop its own defense sector over time. In doing so, Syria might not only expand the reach of the Turkish defense market but also establish its own unique model tailored to its specific needs and capabilities.' He noted that in the short term Syria will likely focus on acquiring essential defense systems to rebuild its military and internal security infrastructure. 'Key areas of demand may include Armored Vehicles and Artillery Systems, Drone Technology (UAVs), and Air Defense Systems. While adopting the Turkish model offers a promising pathway for Syria's defense development, building a fully independent and capable industry will require substantial investment, time, and unwavering commitment,' he said. 'In the interim, collaboration with Turkey can provide the necessary foundation for Syria's defense modernization efforts while fostering long-term strategic partnership between the two nations.' Çubukçuoğlu agreed that Syria's priority will be to acquire light arms and train its armed forces. 'Turkey can provide air defense coverage, electronic warfare-early warning-intelligence solutions for Syria either through partnership or by installing such systems and training the Syria army to operate them. The priority would be to re-build the Syrian army, since the navy and air force require much higher know-how and differentiated skill sets built over a longer period,' he added. However, Kayaoglu doesn't expect Syria to go as far as procuring high-end Turkish products in the foreseeable future. 'But maybe Türkiye could convince the United States to allow it to hand over its oldest F-16s to Syria *if* Washington and Damascus could patch things up in return for Israel agreeing to normalize ties with Syria,' he told Breaking Defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/from-rebuilding-the-armed-forces-to-selling-drones-how-turkey-can-enhance-syrias-defense/	2025-02-13T07:54:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-2197171576-scaled-e1739380415984.jpg
DEI, DOA: How the defense industry is racing to bury its diversity efforts	Boeing employees attend the Long Beach Pride 40th Annual Parade on August 06, 2023 in Long Beach, California. (Harmony Gerber/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A month ahead of the #NatSecGirlSquad conference in March, organizer Maggie Feldman-Piltch is facing a problem that has been unprecedented in her 10 years of putting on the event. In the wake of President Donald Trump’s Jan. 21 executive order, which directs federal contractors to roll back diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices, there has been radio silence from defense companies who previously bought exhibit space, underwrote meals and otherwise sponsored the conference. 'Nobody,' she said, 'is returning emails.' It’s just one example of how, in the wake of Trump’s executive order, defense contractors are beating a hasty retreat from their previous commitments to DEI initiatives and reshaping their public-facing images to fit the administration’s vision — spelled out in felt-tip pen by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth in his first memo to the Pentagon, that 'DoD ≠ DEI.' Major defense primes are scrubbing their websites to remove references to DEI, including pulling down content associated with minority employees or celebrations like Black History Month. Breaking Defense found that large defense companies like BAE Systems, General Dynamics, L3Harris, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and RTX have clumsily removed webpages associated with previous DEI initiatives, which still appear in search engine results but redirect to dead links. One industry official, who Breaking Defense granted anonymity to discuss sensitive internal matters, said that defense companies are struggling to understand exactly which activities fall under the umbrella of 'illegal DEI.' A company maintaining a DEI department or employing officials hired solely to enact DEI practices would likely run afoul of the executive order, but other longstanding practices aimed at recruiting talent and fostering professional development of employees reside in a gray area, where it will be up to companies to determine how much risk to take, the official said. Those include activities like employee resource groups that allow workers to connect with others from similar backgrounds and supplier diversity programs focused on ensuring that major defense companies work with small businesses run by women, racial minorities, veterans or other historically disadvantaged groups. The President’s guidance (lawful orders) is clear: No more DEI at @DeptofDefense. The Pentagon will comply, immediately. No exceptions, name-changes, or delays. pic.twitter.com/KwRtxYRIbG &mdash; Pete Hegseth (@PeteHegseth) January 26, 2025 Internally, companies are also concerned that Trump’s crackdown on DEI could encourage whistleblowers to lodge complaints about any company activities related to diversity — potentially opening the door to litigation — or increase the likelihood of workplace bullying or harassment of women, people of color or LGBTQ employees, the official said. Pointing to measures like a federal tipline that would enable government employees to report on verboten DEI initiatives, Luke Schleusener, CEO of the non-profit group Out in National Security, argued that 'It's a waste of time and effort to pump people full of fear so that they're looking over their shoulder at the office rather than letting them do their job keeping us safe.' But industry has little choice but to follow Trump’s mandate or potentially face retribution, said one former defense official. 'No one wants to become a target in an environment where it is clear the administration is prepared to make examples and targets out of other organizations,' they said. The Jan. 21 executive order, titled 'Ending Illegal Discrimination and Restoring Merit-Based Opportunity,' lays out a series of instructions impacting federal contractors. It mandates that all future federal contracts include terms where contractors would certify that they do not operate 'any programs promoting DEI that violate any federal anti-discrimination laws.' It also directs the Department of Labor’s office of Federal Contract Compliance to hold federal contractors and subcontractors responsible for any acts that could be considered 'affirmative action' or workforce balancing based on race, sex, sexual preference, religion or national origin. (The order specifically retains federal and private-sector employment and contracting preferences for veterans.) Finally, to further deter private sector DEI activities, the order instructs the attorney general to work with heads of federal agencies to develop a report outlining 'key sectors of concern' as well as 'the most egregious and discriminatory DEI practitioners' — a move that could put companies in the line of fire for further government action, including litigation and the loss of government contracts. According to the order, the report would enable each agency to identify 'up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations' or other institutions, as well as 'litigation that would be potentially appropriate for federal lawsuits.' Trump’s executive order — along with a corresponding Jan. 20 order that ended DEI initiatives inside the federal government — led to swift changes inside and out of the Pentagon. Immediately after their signing, the military services rushed to purge any vestiges of DEI from their ranks — and industry quickly followed suit. 'I think larger companies, especially public companies, may feel particularly at risk because if there should become a target list of companies that are going to get challenged on stuff, it tends to be the larger, high-profile ones,' the former defense official said. 'Those are probably the ones that are going to be more risk-averse here.' Because the order was signed just ahead of earnings calls, recent regulatory filings reveal a noticeable change in how the defense primes characterize their positions on diversity. Lockheed Martin in a Jan. 23 statement said it would take immediate action 'to ensure continued compliance' with the order, and that 'merit-based talent management programs' have always been central to its mission as a weapons producer. 'We will not have goals or incentives based on demographic representation or Affirmative Action Plans,' the company said. 'Additionally, our training offerings are compliant with Executive Order 13950 from President Trump’s first administration. We will continue to help America and its allies achieve peace through strength by recruiting, retaining and promoting the best aerospace and defense talent in the world, with the only criteria being merit and performance.' The company swiftly deleted DEI content from its website — such as a story on Black History Month published in 2023 that now redirects to the firm’s general news page but is still archived online — and has also removed references to DEI in its latest financial disclosures to investors. In an annual regulatory filing for 2023, the company said under a subsection titled 'Diversity and Inclusion' that 'Diversity and inclusion is a business imperative for us, as we believe that it is key to our future success.' That language no longer appears in the 2024 report published in January. In a statement released after the executive order was signed, Northrop said it was 'actively reviewing our policies and processes and taking the necessary steps to ensure compliance' with the order, adding that 'we hire, promote and pay based on merit and performance.' It did not respond to a request for further comment. Northrop in its 2023 annual report included a 'diversity, equity and inclusion' section, which stated that the company 'strive[s] to reach all parts of the diverse talent pools available now and in the future because we recognize that we benefit from having coworkers with different ideas, perspectives and approaches to help us innovate.' That section, and accompanying language, no longer appears in the company’s 2024 annual report published in January, though the document does retain lightly edited language under a 'Human Capital' subheading that emphasizes the company 'value[s] diverse perspectives and foster[s] safe and inclusive environments.' A screengrab of Northrop Grumman's previous diversity, equity and inclusion page, which has now been scrubbed from the company's website. (Breaking Defense screenshot) RTX said it was taking actions to comply with the order and that 'our highly dedicated workforce is built and advances on merit.' Accordingly, the company has dropped a DEI section from its 2024 annual report published in February, no longer using language that appeared in the 2023 report that said 'We strive to advance a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment.' The firm has also taken down pages on its website associated with DEI and LGBTQ pride. RTX declined further comment. L3Harris, which previously espoused a goal of 'developing a workforce that is half women and more than one third people of color, reflective of the communities where it operates,' declined to comment on how it was applying the order. The company also appears to have removed past annual reports dedicated specifically to DEI, but some previous versions can still be found online, such as the 2022 report [PDF] where CEO Chris Kubasik declared that the firm’s 'commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&amp;I) is unwavering.' A spokesman for BAE Systems, which also took down its DEI website for its US-based arm, told Breaking Defense that the company continuously reassesses its priorities and policies to ensure continued compliance with the law, including the new executive orders. 'We strive to ensure our employees feel valued and respected, and we will continue to hire, promote, and compensate based on merit,' the BAE spokesman said. 'Celebrating our mission-centered culture and our focus on technology, we will maintain our ability to attract and retain exceptional talent to develop the cutting-edge solutions that set us apart.' Nevertheless, UK-based BAE still has an active DEI page for its UK and international business, highlighting the cross-Atlantic tensions Trump’s executive order may invite for defense contractors. General Dynamics took down its webpage on 'Diversity and Inclusion' on Feb. 7, following questions from Breaking Defense about the webpage and how the company was approaching the order. A spokesman said that the company 'always complies with the law,' but declined to comment further on company policy. In a departure from other defense contractors, Boeing shut down its DEI department in October prior to the presidential election, reflecting new CEO Kelly Ortberg’s realignment of the company, reported Bloomberg News at the time. Sara Liang Bowen, the vice president who led the DEI unit, departed the company while other employees previously in the DEI department were transferred to human resources. Boeing did not respond to a request for comment on whether it has taken further action since the publication of the executive order. The company has removed its DEI website but maintains a page on 'People and Culture.' Defense industry organizations are also wrestling with whether to continue initiatives geared toward the recruitment and professional development of women and minority groups. AFCEA International, a professional organization centered on defense information technology, ended all DEI-centric programming, including its Women in AFCEA initiative, after the release of the Jan. 20 executive order, confirmed Sandra Jontz, its vice president of communications. The organization has taken down webpages for its Women in AFCEA mentorship program and its women’s leadership network. 'This was not an easy decision for the leadership team,' Jontz said. 'However, we did so as we do not want to lose the momentum and progress we have made over the past several years in deepening our relationships with the military and the federal government. The critical nature of our military, government, academia and industry collaboration in our efforts to strengthen global security means we cannot jeopardize the participation of our vital federal partners. 'We have and will always stand against discrimination in everything we do and continue our merit-based programs to ensure we raise awareness and recognize the very best of AFCEA as a collective body of professionals,' she said. The Aerospace Industries Association and National Defense Industrial Association declined to comment. It was widely expected that Trump would move to roll back DEI efforts when he took office, and the Pentagon has followed suit, as Hegseth quickly pushed out a flurry of memos that halt certain gender-affirming medical procedures for transgender servicemembers, stop department celebrations of Black History Month and other holidays, and rename Fort Liberty in North Carolina to Fort Bragg (though the name now honors a WWII Army soldier and not the Confederate general). Already a major talking point among Trump supporters, the accusations that diversity efforts have led to a decline in military readiness took center stage less than 24 hours after the deadliest civilian aviation incident in the US in nearly two decades, when Trump repeatedly indicated his belief that DEI practices led to the fatal crash between a Black Hawk helicopter and a civilian airliner. And even before he was nominated to lead the US military, Hegseth stated that DEI efforts have harmed America’s ability to defend itself. US President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. Trump ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, escalating his efforts to protect politically important US industries with levies hitting some of the country's closest allies. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images 'Why do you get rid of something like DEI? From our perspective, it’s served the purpose of dividing the force instead of uniting the force,' Hegseth said during a Feb. 7 town hall at the Pentagon. 'I think the single dumbest phrase in military history is, ‘Our diversity is our strength.’ I think our strength is our unity, our strength is our shared purpose, regardless of our background, regardless of how we grew up, regardless of our gender, regardless of our race.' Unsurprisingly, those comments don’t align with how the previous administration views things. 'The idea that we have an inferior military because we’re promoting people who aren’t qualified is insane,' Frank Kendall, who served as Air Force secretary from 2021 until Trump’s inauguration, told Breaking Defense. 'Standards are standards, and we didn’t change them.' Regardless, the military services have already begun withdrawing from events and halting relationships with organizations centered on increasing the number of women and racial minorities in the defense sector. On Tuesday, Military.com reported that the Army has dropped out of an awards ceremony for Black engineers that was previously seen as a recruiting event, while USNI reported that the Navy has canceled memorandums of understanding with three naval organizations that promote diversity. Those critical of Trump’s focus on rolling back DEI efforts argue that the Pentagon and defense industry are already competing against the more lucrative commercial tech industry for talent, and cannot afford to alienate potential employees. 'This is going to damage readiness and national security by pushing people out,' Schleusener of Out in National Security told Breaking Defense. Alex Wagner, who served as the Air Force’s assistant secretary for manpower and reserve affairs under the Biden administration and has held other roles in the Pentagon and industry groups, especially highlighted that defense contractors also need to remain competitive against tech companies that are often vying for the same pool of workers. 'Aerospace and defense CEOs see their industry as in a race with Silicon Valley for talent,' he said in an interview. 'And they’re right: this distinction between &#8216;tech companies' and defense contractors has vanished; when you're engineering autonomous systems and quantum sensors, you're a tech company, full stop.' For Feldman-Piltch, the Trump administration’s moves to combat DEI are not surprising, but the effect on the #NatSecGirlSquad conference is disappointing, given the organization’s apolitical nature and the fact that membership is not restricted to women. 'We are the largest organization in the world of people focused on building and sustaining competent diversity in national security and defense, whatever diversity means,' she said. 'You can think of that as gender, you can think of it as race, you can think of it as ethnicity. You can also think of it as [diversity in] skill set.' And with companies from legacy defense primes to tech startups competing to hire highly qualified engineers, software developers and cybersecurity specialists, there has never been more of a need to identify talent, she added. 'You have defense tech booming,' Feldman-Piltch said. 'They need people. Where on earth are they expecting to get them?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dei-doa-how-the-defense-industry-is-racing-to-bury-its-diversity-efforts/	2025-02-13T06:26:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/boeing-pride-scaled-e1739392360946.jpg
SDA asks industry to propose 60-day studies of ‘novel’ capabilities for Iron Dome	Artist's illustration of a hypersonic missile tracking satellite constellation. (Graphic by L3Harris) WASHINGTON — The Space Development Agency (SDA) is soliciting 'executive summaries' from interested vendors for fast-track studies of how the agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture (PWSA) satellite network in low Earth orbit can be best exploited to support President Donald Trump's 'Iron Dome For America' missile shield. 'SDA is interested in industry’s perspective on implementing the Iron Dome for America architecture, and is particularly interested in building on and integrating PWSA’s current contributions to global kill chains and missile defense,' the agency wrote in a Feb. 11 solicitation. The agency is asking for 'novel architecture concepts, systems, technologies, and capabilities that enable leap-ahead improvements for future [PWSA] tranches, capability layers, or, enable new capability layers to address other emerging or evolving warfighter needs,' it adds. In his Jan. 27 Iron Dome for America executive order, Trump called for the development and deployment of a PWSA 'custody layer.' SDA has defined its potential custody layer as a hybrid constellation of government and commercial satellites to provide operators with near-real time ground target tracking and targeting information. The SDA solicitation lists eight specific areas of interest: The call for studies on speeding HBTSS 'missile defense capabilities' is interesting, as its wording differs somewhat from language in an earlier solicitation from the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) on the sensor system. The MDA call asks industry for ideas about how to accelerate deployment of an HBTSS 'layer' — a term that connotes a constellation of actual satellites, rather than simply related 'capabilities.' The fate of HBTSS and authority over how such high-precision sensors are pursued has been a bone of contention between the two agencies, and driven some concerns from Capitol Hill. Two prototypes were launched last February, but at the time MDA and SDA said that the birds would not be integrated into SDA's PWSA. Instead, technology advances and lessons learned from the HBTSS program were being migrated into sensors being developed by SDA for its Tracking Layer of missile warning/missile tracking satellites. The SDA solicitation says that the results of the studies and any recommendations for how to flesh out the Iron Dome for American architecture will be shared with the Space Force, MDA and other US government agencies. The agency 'strongly encourages' interested vendors to reply by 5 p.m. on Feb. 28.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/sda-asks-industry-to-propose-60-day-studies-of-novel-capabilities-for-iron-dome/	2025-02-12T12:57:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/220329_l3harris_HBTSS_gfx.png
GAO calls on Coast Guard to improve cyber for Maritime Transportation System	A team from the U.S. Coast Guard Academy participated in the National Security Agency’s 20th annual National Cyber Exercise (NCX), a three-day cyber competition that tests the offensive and defensive cybersecurity skills virtually, April 8-10, 2021.(U.S. Coast Guard photo by Petty Officer 2nd Class Hunter Medley) WASHINGTON — The Government Accountability Office released a report today calling for the US Coast Guard to improve the cybersecurity infrastructure of the Maritime Transportation System (MTS), the complex network of ports, waterways, ships and other vessels that are used to transport goods and passengers. The government watchdog found several gaps in the MTS's cybersecurity practices in its study, which was conducted as a result of the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. These include inconsistencies in cyber incident data, incompetencies in cyber professionals and a lack of a cohesive cybersecurity strategy to protect the MTS. 'Owners and operators of maritime facilities and vessels (MTS owners and operators) collectively manage these goods and services via technology systems that are often interconnected with internal and external systems and networks, including the internet,' the report explained. 'Although these technologies facilitate MTS operations, they are also vulnerable to cyberattacks with the potential to cause significant and catastrophic damage to maritime infrastructure. Consequently, the safe operation of the MTS is critical to our national and economic security.' The report emphasizes that the Coast Guard must fill the gaps as the MTS, which handles more than $5.4 trillion in goods and services annually, 'faces significant and increasing cybersecurity risks' from China, Iran, North Korea and Russia and other 'transnational criminal organizations.' Additionally, the increasing reliance on technology makes the MTS more susceptible to cyber threats. Related: US cyber vulnerabilities fuel N. Korea’s nuclear arsenal, but solutions are near: DARPA official The GAO outlined five recommendations the Coast Guard should implement to ensure the MTS is resilient against cyber attacks: The Department of Homeland Security concurred with all five recommendations and provided the Coast Guard’s planned actions to address them. 'Although the maritime critical infrastructure subsector is owned and operated by private industry and state and local governments, the federal government has a significant role in addressing cybersecurity risks facing the MTS,' the report reads.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/gao-calls-on-coast-guard-to-improve-cyber-for-maritime-transportation-system/	2025-02-12T12:30:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/04/6596254-e1643140442121-scaled.jpg
Space Force doubles down on acquisition reform ahead of DoD moves	Former Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Space Acquisition and Integration Frank Calvelli in 2022 developed nine space acquisition tenets that are guiding Space Force reform efforts to speed development of new capabilities. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — The Space Force is 'aggressively' pushing forward with acquisition reforms put in place under the Biden administration to fast-track new capabilities and cut costs — including rapidly moving toward the use of fixed-price contracts and cracking down on contractor performance, according to a senior official. The business of acquisitions is to deliver and integrate warfighter capability as fast as possible, and that's it,' Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy, acting head of the Air Force’s space acquisition shop, told the annual Defense and Intelligence Space Conference on Tuesday. His walk-through of activities to flesh out former space acquisition czar Frank Calvelli's 'nine space acquisition tenets' showcased how the Space Force already is positioned to meet expected guidance for accelerating weapons system development from new Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth. Calvelli's tenets, Purdy said, 'were all about speed, all about getting back to acquisition basics' and not only is the Space Force 'continuing' to push on implementing them, but 'doing it more aggressively.' For example, he said that of the 'about 59 major programs' in the service's unclassified portfolio, there are 38 that are designated as major capability acquisitions; i.e., 'traditional acquisition activities.' Another 12 are being managed as middle tier acquisitions (MTAs) aimed at developing prototypes and/or fielding capabilities within five years, and eight fall under what is known as the 'software pathway,' which uses iterative processes to bring new software into use. Finally, the service has one program being acquired under the 'quick start' effort initiated by former Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and approved by Congress in the fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act. Purdy elaborated that the number of programs using the software path approach has increased '300 percent' from 2023, going from two to eight. In addition, he said the Space Force's use of MTAs has increased over the past six months or so, although caveating that he hadn't 'done the numbers' to calculate that increase. 'If you look at a lot of the guidance that's coming down from DoD, and also pending guidance from the Hill and the Wicker act [the Fostering Reform and Government Efficiency in Defense (FORGED) Act introduced by Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker, R.-Miss.] there's a desire to move into software pathways and MTA and OTA [Other Transaction Authority] kind of constructs,' he stressed. Purdy expressed strong interest in a number of the changes proposed by Wicker in the FORGED Act, calling it a 'really interesting document' including 'a lot of really interesting ideas.' While noting that it is difficult to precisely quantify the multitude of Space Force contracts in play, Purdy said that by his 'rough numbers' about half have been awarded on a cost-plus basis and half on a fixed-price basis. 'So a good start, but I want to keep moving us down that fixed-price path,' he said. He further warned industry leaders that the Space Force is reviewing several high risk programs that are now under cost-plus contracts, with an eye towards 'converting' them to fixed-price awards or 'breaking them apart' into smaller pieces. 'I'm really looking to explore risk exposure on our programs,' he said. 'There are a couple of programs that we have that I would declare [carry] nearly unbounded risk exposure. What does that mean? They're sitting in a cost-plus environment; there's really difficult technology; and basically this is like future Nunn-McCurdy's' The 1983 Nunn-McCurdy Act requires the Pentagon report to Congress when defense programs exceed certain cost estimates, and critical breaches can lead to cancelation. 'So, we're going to look hard at figuring out how to get out of that, and that's going to be painful on all sides,' Purdy said. Meanwhile, Purdy explained that the Department of the Air Force and the Space Force are pursuing 'accountability' measures, as envisioned by Calvelli, to ensure good performance both from contractors and from department program managers. 'Accountability is a two-way street,' he said. Since May 2022, Purdy said 14 major acquisition programs have had 'contracts or entire programs restructured or canceled' largely because 'performance costs have skyrocketed. 'We weren't getting the capability we need. And unlike the Space Force acquisition of old, we stopped just piling money into that. And so we've stopped these contracts, and we've re-competed for the most part,' he said. 'We're also looking at taking action against poor performing US government program managers,' Purdy added. If problems are found, a first step will be 'to give them help — provide guidance and provide additional acquisition help,' he said. But 'if it's not making it, we'll look at removals.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-doubles-down-on-acquisition-reform-ahead-of-dod-moves/	2025-02-12T11:40:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240228_calvelli_afa_warfare_8238576-scaled-e1709151317344.jpg
Russia overtakes all of Europe on defense spending in key metric: IISS military balance	Russia's Orlan family of drones, on display at the World Defense Show, Saudi Arabia (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — Based on one key economic metric, Russian defense spending eclipsed all other European countries combined last year and is projected to increase further in 2025, according to a leading defense think tank. New analysis from the United Kingdom’s International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) found that Moscow's military expenditure spiked by over 40 percent to almost $146 billion in the past year, equivalent to 6.7 percent GDP, and is on track to hit 7.5 percent GDP in 2025. When adjusted for purchasing power parity (PPP), Russia spent nearly $462 billion in 2024, effectively leapfrogging Europe’s collective spending. PPP is a tool used to remove price level differences between currencies in order to better demonstrate the purchasing strength of one over another. 'The PPP comparison is important to make, just to take into account the lower domestic input costs that Russia has….it's a good indicator of why Russia is able to fund so much more with a seemingly smaller budget in US dollar terms,' Fenella McGerty, senior fellow for defence economics at IISS told media today. The spending figures are included in the think tank’s newly published Military Balance report — a comprehensive annual review of global defense capabilities, military budgets and other related economic trends. Ukraine's offensive operations are having an impact however with IISS figures indicating that Russia lost 1400 main battle tanks last year, and 4000 in all since the war started. 'Indeed, the IISS assesses that Russia will not have sufficient main battle tanks to conduct effective offensive operations beyond early 2026 if it maintains the same operational tempo and suffers the same losses as in 2024,' Bastian Giegerich, IISS Director-General told media. He also said that the conflict had 'demonstrated increasing connections between European and Asia Pacific security' which included North Korea entering the conflict by deploying 10,000 troops, China’s decision to sell dual-use technologies to Russia and the 'growing prominence' of South Korea selling equipment to countries including Poland. Documenting battlefield developments from 2024, Giegerich acknowledged that neither Russia or Ukraine had been able to leverage a strategic advantage and explained that Kyiv was 'increasingly strained by attrition and recruitment challenges.' He added that Ukraine's 'inadequate combat mass has driven focus on fast innovation cycles, developing a growing range of UAVs and using one-way attack UAVs to strike deep inside Russia.' Operational realities are also tempered by a decisive political shift in attitude toward the war by US President Donald Trump, his messaging around delivering a peace deal and the need for Europe to spend more on its own security. Giegerich said that 'strategic options are narrowing' for Ukraine, because of Trump's pledge to 'end the war quickly' and if Kyiv is to continue to stand up to Russian aggression, 'international support will have to increase significantly beyond current levels.' Such analysis arrived shortly before Pete Hegseth, US defense secretary, said this morning that it was 'unrealistic' to expect a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders, suggesting the same logic applies to the chances of the eastern European country joining NATO. The alliance has long stated that Ukraine belongs in NATO but has not set a timeline for membership. Speaking at NATO's headquarters in Brussels as part of a Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting, Hegseth also ruled out US troops being deployed to Ukraine as part of any future security guarantee for Kyiv. 'Safeguarding European security must be an imperative for European members of NATO,' he added. 'As part of this Europe must provide the overwhelming share of future lethal and nonlethal aid to Ukraine.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/russia-overtakes-all-of-europe-on-defense-spending-in-key-metric-iiss-military-balance/	2025-02-12T11:20:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/426550469_3262973424011488_4921886411513523113_n-e1707497379649.jpg
House unveils budget plan with $100B boost for defense	(L-R) U.S. House Majority Whip Rep. Tom Emmer (R-MN), Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA), House Republican Conference Chair Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) leave after a news briefing at the U.S. Capitol on November 2, 2023 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — House Republicans on Tuesday revealed a budget resolution that would add $100 billion in defense funding, one-third less than the Senate blueprint which would raise defense spending by $150 billion. What that means exactly for major weapons programs is unclear. Details of what that funding would pay for will be determined by the House and Senate Armed Services Committees only if the resolution is adopted by both the House and Senate — an open question, given the House and Senate’s competing approaches on how best to pass President Donald Trump’s agenda. Republicans intend to use a process called budget reconciliation to move a laundry list of Trump spending priorities through Congress without threat of filibuster. Unlike the Senate — which opted for a two-bill strategy that starts with approving additional funds for defense, border security and energy — the House is pursuing what Trump has called 'one big beautiful bill' that would also raise the debt limit by $4 trillion, include $4.5 trillion in tax cuts and cut government spending. 'This budget resolution is a key step to start the process in delivering President Trump’s America First agenda,' House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a statement on X. 'With nearly every House Republican directly engaged in this deliberative process, this resolution reflects our collective commitment to enacting the President's full agenda—not just a part of it.' The House Budget Committee will take up the resolution on Thursday as its Senate counterpart works through its own plan in hearings scheduled for today and Thursday. RELATED: Senate Republicans release budget plan with $150B more for defense At the start of the Senate Budget Committee’s markup process for their budget resolution this morning, chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said lawmakers must move with haste to pass additional funding, and implored his House Republican colleagues to consider backing the Senate version of the bill. 'The problem we have now is that ICE is running out of money,' he said. 'To my colleagues in the House, I hope you can pass one big beautiful bill … but we gotta move on this issue.' Over the course of the hearing, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle broadly expressed support for additional defense funding — although some Democrats questioned whether reconciliation was needed as a vehicle to boost money for defense. 'I’m on the armed services committee. Do you need to use reconciliation to do defense spending?' said Sen. Tim Kaine, R-Va. 'We not only spend hundreds of billions on defense, in a bipartisan agreement, just last year, we twice added to that. … Let’s just be clear about what this is about: This is an effort to amass savings off the backs of everyday people whose programs are cut, plus tariff revenue, and to direct all of that towards tax cuts for the wealthiest.' Sen. Tom Kennedy, R-La, expressed confidence in Johnson and said he wanted to see lawmakers come together on a single tactic for getting a reconciliation bill across the line. 'I just want to see us pass something. I don’t see this as a competition,' he said. 'Weakness invites the wolves. We have to spend more money on defense.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/house-unveils-budget-plan-with-100b-boost-for-defense/	2025-02-12T10:14:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_rep_mike_johnson_GettyImages-1770847690-scaled-e1709241354686.jpg
Want ‘Competitive endurance?’ Focus on maneuver in space	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman delivers a keynote address on the state of the Space Force during the Air and Space Forces Association 2024 Warfare Symposium in Aurora, Colo., Feb. 13, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) For almost two years, the Chief of Space Operations has championed his proposed theory of success, Competitive Endurance, which includes a detailed white paper published January 2024. Yet despite his urging of Guardians to challenge the theory and share their ideas broadly, the public discourse has been underwhelming. Space Security professionals owe the CSO the critical thinking and feedback he calls for, so here are some thoughts. Although the theory gets a lot of things right, it does not completely account for the significant risks inherent within its own assumptions. Identifying and challenging the assumptions upon which the theory is built is the essential next step to assess potential risks and ensure a coherent strategy for competition emerges. In doing so, the principle of maneuver becomes an important element vital to completing the theory and mitigating the inherent risks. There are two critical assumptions inherent within the theory that, when challenged, reveal significant risks to achieving its intended goal: space superiority. The first critical assumption is that competition and conflict follow linear logic. The reality of strategy is that competition and conflict instead follow paradoxical logic — where strategic competitors deliberately confound logical actions. This is not to argue that a theory of success should follow non-linear logic; rather, it must better account for uncertainty and surprise against a thinking and cunning adversary. The second critical assumption is that strategic competitors will come to the same logical conclusion: that their use of space and counterspace capabilities against US military forces will be impractical and self-defeating. The reality is that strategic competitors are likely to assume a lower risk threshold for initiating or extending conflict into space than the theory assumes — an error of mirror imaging and strategy mismatching. Strategic competitors possess fundamentally different principles and values, see escalation and competition in considerably different ways, and are attempting to achieve their strategic objectives against US and ally military forces that increasingly depend on space capabilities. The Space Force must carefully consider the importance of maneuver as a way to attain the necessary flexibility and adaptability against uncertainty and surprise. Integrating maneuver within a revised Competitive Endurance will improve the Space Force’s ability to achieve and maintain space superiority throughout the competition continuum. The principle of maneuver as a core component of its theory of success, will enable the service to better posture forces, deter nefarious activity, impose dilemmas, and ultimately hedge against unanticipated strategic challenges. (It is interesting that Competitive Endurance already acknowledges the importance of contesting and controlling the space domain just as other services do, yet stops just short of acknowledging how maneuver has proven to be an essential principle in achieving domain control throughout history.) In addition, integrating maneuver within Competitive Endurance enhances and complements its three tenets, further mitigating the inherent risks. The capacity to maneuver complements space domain awareness to better deny operational surprise by enabling space forces to preempt or respond to hostile action, let alone deter such hostile action in the first place. Maneuver also complements resilience to better deny a first-mover advantage by making systems more difficult to precisely target and by enabling changes in force posture to disrupt and complicate a competitor’s decision-making process. Lastly, it also complements counterspace campaigning by expanding the types and numbers of flexible deterrence and response options that allow US Space Command to better confront challenges and mitigate the risk of escalation. Integrating maneuver will also have positive impacts on national and economic security in indirect ways. It will help signal to industry the importance of maneuver-related technologies, convincing them there is a market worth investing their R&amp;D in. Such investment will also complement other related commercial and civil efforts tied to on-orbit servicing, refueling, and active debris removal capabilities. Even more promising are the potential opportunities for partnering and building interoperability with allied space maneuver capabilities and even open up areas of investment from allied commercial space industries. Despite these benefits, there is currently a level of uncertainty on the utility of leveraging the principle of maneuver in space. Such uncertainty has already led to cuts in maneuver-related technologies. However, to attain the necessary flexibility and adaptability needed in the near-future, the Space Force must invest in maneuver capabilities now so that they are delivered for tomorrow. In strategy, few things ever work out the way they are intended, and the probability of things working out the way Competitive Endurance anticipates is unlikely, especially in an immature space domain where even greater uncertainty exists — exacerbating such improbability. While Competitive Endurance serves as a logical departure point for hypothesizing strategic success in space, it must now evolve to articulate how it will attain the necessary flexibility and adaptability needed for an uncertain operational environment. To do so, Competitive Endurance must integrate maneuver as an instrumental component, much like it has done so with resiliency. Such a revision would enhance and complement the current theory of success and provide improved strategic direction to the national security space enterprise commensurate with the evolving operational environment. Changes in strategic and operational environments should drive changes in strategic approaches — like a theory of success — that then drive changes in space capabilities and operating concepts. The other military services demonstrated this throughout the twentieth century; the US Space Force now has an opportunity to demonstrate its ability to do this as well.

Cummings, ATRX team to develop hypersonic drones	If tests prove out, ATRX's engines will power a Cummings Aerospace-designed UAS with hypersonic flight. (ATRX) LONDON — Cummings Aerospace has signed a new agreement with propulsion specialist ATRX to rapidly design and develop affordable supersonic and hypersonic unmanned systems, company executives told Breaking Defense ahead of this week's announcement. The deal will see Cummings build out large-scale versions of its Hellhound UAS, equipped with ATRX’s Air Turbo Rocket (ATR) to undertake subsonic, supersonic and ultimately hypersonic flight tests. Speaking to Breaking Defense on Feb 5, company executives laid out how the partnership will explore multi-mission capabilities, which could include the integration of weapons, specialist payloads and even counter-hypersonic capabilities. A first, vertically-launched test flight is expected to take place in the next 18-24 months, executives said, with a Hellhound UAS up to 12x larger in size compared to the loitering munition variant due to participate in the US Army’s Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance (LASSO) loitering munition competition later this year. Follow-on development cycles are expected to occur every 18-24 months, as the team looks to integrate increasing levels in complexity across the program. Cummings Aerospace CEO Sheila Cummings said the strategic alignment with ATRX is designed to offer customers more affordable, flexible and rapidly prototyped solutions. 'The modern battlefield demands systems that are capable of flying faster and further into contested airspace. This partnership with ATRX will allow us to develop ATR-powered UAS that can offer both of these characteristics in a single vehicle, at an affordable price,' she told Breaking Defense. 'We have concepts for hypersonic but have not built them yet. A lot of our focus is on hypersonic and rapid capability for our warfighters and we are seeing this as an ideal time to bring these ideas to industry and customers, to capture research and development funding to bring to a technology readiness level,' she added before stating that potential customers had already mentioned interest in a supersonic UAS capability. 'It's all part of the whole standoff objective, right? So the farther back, the faster you can get to a particular location. And sometimes, in order to maximize that standoff range, you need more propulsion power, which means you need more speed. So supersonic is definitely among those capabilities that has been mentioned for UAS solutions,' Cummings said before adding that counter-hypersonic capability was another concept being considered by engineers across both companies. ATRX’s CEO Felix Bustos III confirmed his company is currently working up a prototype hypersonic engine, which he suggested is a version of a Ramjet. 'It allows capability to go from standstill on a runway or vertical take-off to Mach 5. We have the hardware in development and are on a fast track to develop that capability which will provide a very unique capability for the warfighter,' he told Breaking Defense, before confirming it would be 'highly maneuverable in flight.' Cummings Aerospace could also support ATRX’s development of the Hummingbird space plane, which Bustos described as a 'wholly different mission set' to Hellhound. The Hummingbird is being designed with a view to deploying satellites from low earth orbit. 'Data obtained through the whole [Hellhound] program directly applies to next phase which is the Hummingbird space plane. A mix of government and private financing will allow us to move fast,' he said. 'Being able to validate the performance of our ATRs using a bespoke UAS based on a flight-proven airframe will de-risk and accelerate our space plane development efforts. Space planes are very much needed with more than 50,000, mostly commercial, satellites that need to be launched into orbit in the next few years,' he concluded.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/cummings-atrx-team-to-develop-hypersonic-drones/	2025-02-12T05:15:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Air-Turbo-Rocket-Hot-Fire-Test-e1739305860907.png
Space Force sees light at the end of the development tunnel for OCX, ATLAS	Space Force Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy (Image: Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's two biggest problem children — the next-generation ground system for GPS satellites and a crucial software update for the service's space domain awareness network — are both expected to soon overcome their long-standing development woes, according to the acting head of the Air Force's space acquisition shop. Speaking to the the annual Defense and Intelligence Space Conference sponsored by the National Security Space Association, Maj. Gen. Stephen Purdy was optimistic that both programs would be in the hands of operators as soon as fall. Purdy currently is warming the Air Force space acquisition chair left empty by the departure of Frank Calvelli in January with the change of administration. In particular, Purdy highlighted testing progress being made by the GPS Next-Generation Operational Control System (OCX) program — citing the fact the ground system is 'in operator hands touching actual satellites right now,' having 'hit 40 contacts with live satellites' as of Feb. 5. Overall, he said, the program has now made it through testing of 97 percent of its requirements. Calvelli, in an exclusive Jan. 15 exit interview with Breaking Defense, called the failure to get OCX working during his term as the first Department of the Air Force Space Acquisition Executive one of his 'greatest regrets.' Under development by RTX Space (formerly Raytheon) for nigh on 15 years, OCX is needed to allow some 700 weapon systems across the US military to fully access the encrypted M-code GPS signal that will be harder for adversaries to jam. Further, OCX Block 3F, which is the final planned version of the update, will be needed to allow Space Force Guardians to operate the GPS Follow-On, or GPS IIIF, constellation, currently expected to begin launching in 2027. Purdy said the OCX program office at Space Systems Command is working toward a decision on whether the ground system is ready to operate this summer; followed by a decision on actually fielding it. If all goes well, he said, GPS satellites then will be 'transitioned' to the new ground system — something Calvelli in January said he hoped would happen by the end of this calendar year. 'I know that's been a long-running program, but we're a little further along than perhaps you're tracking,' he said. Meanwhile, operational testing of the Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System (ATLAS) software to modernize the Space Force's core command and control capabilities for space domain awareness, is going smoothly, Purdy explained. ATLAS is the Pentagon’s latest effort, following a plethora of failed attempts, to replace the 1980s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system for managing data from the military’s network of radar and telescopes that detect and track objects on orbit. Purdy said that so far the testing program has 'resolved or mitigated' all of problems dubbed 'Category 1 Deficiencies' — which are those that could cause a catastrophic failure — as well as 'most if not all' of the Category 2 problems. 'So, that software is looking pretty good,' he said. Noting its 'really interesting performance,' Purdy said that if all continues to go well, ATLAS is expected to pass 'operational acceptance,' which he explained is the 'equivalent' of initial operational capability, this summer. The Space Force originally planned for ATLAS to become operational in 2022, but the program has been troubled by technical issues with integration into the Space Force's legacy systems and schedule delays. Meanwhile, the Space Systems Command on Jan. 30 announced that it had awarded a $90M sole-source contract to L3Harris for continuation of the ATLAS program. 'This sole-source award will ensure a seamless continuation of the ATLAS program to achieve ATLAS Minimum Viable Capability Release (MVCR) Operational Acceptance and will deliver a modernized and integrated SDA system,' the press release said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/space-force-sees-light-at-the-end-of-the-development-tunnel-for-ocx-atlas/	2025-02-11T13:28:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-11-at-3.30.29 PM.png
US cyber vulnerabilities fuel N. Korea’s nuclear arsenal, but solutions are near: DARPA official	Darren Cofer, principal fellow at Collins Aerospace demonstrates the company's Secure Mathematically-Assured Composition of Control Models (SMACCM) capabilities at a DARPA demonstration day. (Photo courtesy of DARPA.) WASHINGTON — The US’s vulnerable cybersecurity systems are indirectly allowing North Korea to bolster its nuclear arsenal, but thanks to existing technology this can be easily avoided, an official from the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency said Monday. North Korea is able to use the funds it acquires from ransomware attacks on US systems and those of other countries to pay for the development of nuclear weapons, Kathleen Fisher, director of DARPA’s Information Innovation Office, said during an agency event Monday. However, thanks to the advanced technology DARPA has funded and industry and the Pentagon have been able to develop, stopping the ransomware attacks is preventable. The problem lies within getting the tech into the hands of the right people, which is often bogged down by bureaucratic processes like authority to process (ATO) procedures, Fisher said. 'We are essentially funding nuclear weapons development in North Korea with our bad software practices,' she said. 'We know how to do better. It's like all of that [North Korea’s ransomware attacks] is even worse, because we know how to do better. Imagine a world where our software is not riddled with these vulnerabilities.' 'This is compounded by our current ATO process, which means that it takes a very long time to update the software in our systems, because the ATO process is so slow, we have many mission critical systems that have known vulnerabilities, exploitable vulnerabilities in them that we can't update for very long periods of time because the ATO process is so slow,' she said. 'We can't afford to continue that practice — the learned helplessness that is afforded in that practice.' ATO procedures have long been viewed as a thorn in the side of the Pentagon’s acquisition process because of their redundancy. Different organizations typically have their own Authorizing Officer (AO) who has to give a piece of software an ATO before it can be implemented. AOs often have different criteria, so the software company going through this process has to operate a little differently each time, dragging the process down when the office next door may already have been cleared to use the same software. Related: Pentagon announces new reciprocity guidance to streamline software adaptation Last May, the DoD issued new guidance that enforced the concept of ATO 'reciprocity,' which essentially means if one office certifies that a system is cyber secure, then all offices can accept it instead of having to redo the certification process. However, Fisher said that the lack of reciprocity in software systems is still prolific, hindering the advancement of cybersecurity software. Though the dilemmas that ATOs pose are likely not going to be resolved anytime soon, the defense industrial base (DIB) still must focus its energy and resources in building resilient cybersecurity into software systems, Fisher said. One technology practice that Fisher said should be more widely adopted to prevent ransom attacks are 'formal methods' — mathematically based approaches to produce software that come with checked guarantees and proofs that the code 'cannot go wrong.' Some use cases of formal methods include DARPA’s previous High-Assurance Cyber Military Systems (HACMS) and Assured Micropatching (AMP) programs along with the current Verified Security and Performance Enhancement of Large Legacy Software (V-SPELLS) program. These programs, along with others, have showcased that using formal methods can ensure adversaries cannot penetrate systems. For example, with the HACMS program, run by Collin Aerospace (Rockwell Collins at the time), Secure Mathematically-Assured Composition of Control Models (SMACCM) were developed to showcase new tools for building unmanned aerial vehicle software that was resilient to adversarial hacking. During demos of the program, when a group of fictional hackers tried to hack into the drone’s system, nothing happened — an indication that everything went as planned. The DIB and industry partners sometimes have to adopt less-traditional methods of acquiring cyber-secure tech to ensure the tech gets in the hands of operators and software engineers. For example, it is increasingly common for DARPA to conduct the research required to see if a method or technology is possible to execute, and then once it proves its worth industry can adopt it, Col. Rob Gerbracht, the Marine Corps Operational Liaison for DARPA told reporters Monday. Then, it makes its way back into the Pentagon, he said. 'Some of the technologies that DARPA leaps forward end up in the commercial sector and come back to us in the defense industrial base, far after they had actually been introduced,' Gerbracht said. 'Sometimes that's the easiest way to do it,' Fisher added. 'Everything is on the table to get maximization as fast as possible. DARPA isn't about creating technology for the sake of creating technology, it's about creating technology to change the world for better national security, for the warfighter’s safety.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/us-cyber-vulnerabilities-fuel-n-koreas-nuclear-arsenal-but-solutions-are-near-darpa-official/	2025-02-11T12:15:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/VM11348-1-scaled-e1739284493789.jpg
US needs to engage, as well as deter, China to maintain space leadership: CFR report	(Graphic: iStock, Getty) WASHINGTON — In order to protect its leadership in space, the United States needs to out-compete China and deter its ability to successfully attack US space assets, but also needs to seek 'targeted' engagement with Beijing to improve communications and find areas of mutual benefit such as space traffic management, finds a new report by the Council on Foreign Relations. The report, 'Securing Space: A Plan for U.S. Action,' was crafted by an expert task force co-chaired by retired Space Force Lt. Gen. Nina Armagno and former California Congresswoman Jane Harman. Recognizing that space has become both a 'strategic vulnerability' and a 'strategic imperative' for the United States, the report lays out both hard and soft power actions that the authors maintain are necessary for the US government in order to keep its current leadership role in the face of increased competition. 'In the increasingly chaotic realm of space, the United States’ position is slipping. In 1957, the Soviet Union’s launch of the Sputnik satellite was a wakeup call, spurring the United States to assume a dominant role in space. Today, nearly seventy years later, the United States is in danger of losing that privileged position. In many ways, the country risks another Sputnik moment,' the report finds. The US government thus 'needs to act now to address threats to space assets; champion space traffic management to support the growing space economy; and incorporate commercial perspectives into civilian and national security space policy,' it sums up. The CFR report makes seven recommendations for the new Trump administration as it crafts its approach to space across the civil, commercial and defense spheres:	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/us-needs-to-engage-as-well-as-deter-china-to-maintain-space-leadership/	2025-02-11T11:10:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/iStock-1333071678-e1669760260420.jpg

Microsoft announces plan to slide $22 billion IVAS contract over to Anduril	The Army received the new IVAS 1.2 prototype for a series of tests. (US Army) WASHINGTON — Microsoft is seeking to transfer its entire IVAS contract over to Anduril, in a stunning twist to the long-running saga to deliver mixed-reality goggles to troops. The move — which would see Anduril assume oversight of the entire program, including development of the current hardware and software, hiring decisions on staff and takeover of production — comes as the Army is considering launching a follow-on IVAS competition given the years-long delays on getting the system operational. The service has not blessed that newly unfurled 'contact novation' and did not respond to questions from Breaking Defense about the program or the proposed shift. However, executives from both companies expressed confidence the Army will back the move. 'We've been working together for quite some time now… [and] we are signing a strategic partnership that will take IVAS into the future,' Robin Seiler, Microsoft's corporate vice president for mixed reality, told reporters ahead of today’s official announcement. Seiler added that Microsoft Azure would be the preferred hyperscale cloud for IVAS. The bid to slide current contact work on the 10-year, $22 billion contact comes at a critical juncture for the program. Despite years of program challenges and a heads-up display redesign that is still being tested, Army leaders have not officially said if they will cancel IVAS work under the original contract or do a limited production run. However, they are gearing up for a new competition and even meeting with companies today to answer questions about an IVAS Next competition and possible requirements. Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, who made his tech breakthrough with the commercial Oculus VR headset, has been teasing development of a new mixed-reality device with military applications. In September 2024, the tech startup announced its steps toward assuming the IVAS contract with a Microsoft partnership for the integration of new sensors and the Lattice platform into the device. So, with IVAS Next in the wings and their positioning as a likely competitor, why would Anduril want to take over the troubled program now? By taking over management of the current contract just ahead of findings of a make-or-break operational assessment, Luckey’s team could be asked to produce a limited number of the latest IVAS devices designed by Microsoft, or left with a canceled deal. At the same time, though, his team would have additional time working with Army leaders on the program, and access to a mix of production and research and development funding, Luckey confirmed. One industry source who has been anticipating today’s announcement previously said it’s that access to government funding that will give Aundril an advantage over other IVAS Next competitors. 'They should invest their own capital to architect and develop IVAS technology which the Army can acquire and field affordably,' the industry source said. 'If they use the contract as a vehicle to capture Army subsidies, they will be re-running the problematic defense prime playbook we have seen for decades.' When asked about the perception of such an unfair advantage, Luckey said that is just the reality of being the incumbent and there was always going to be a company in that position. 'The people who are already doing it will definitely have an advantage over people who are coming in and starting from scratch,' he added. 'Anduril is no stranger to fighting incumbency. I think that if people have better things, they're gonna be able to come in.' The first Trump administration started the IVAS effort based around Microsoft’s commercially available HoloLens 2 heads-up display, with the goal of providing soldiers with a single device they could use both in combat (including under the cover of darkness) and for virtual training. That work eventually led to a 10-year production contract valued up to $22 billion. However, shortly after the 2021 award, a host of problems publicly emerged including soldiers complaining of discomfort, dizziness, nausea, and system reliability. Although Army leaders publicly stood behind the program at first, they began tempering expectations and even split the program up into three initial versions — the 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 iterations of the goggles. (The service has acquired 5,000 1.0 units, with plans to possibly acquire an additional 5,000 1.1 units for limited use.) Version 1.2 was billed as the key make-or-break upgrade — an iteration to correct past problems, in part, by transitioning the device from a helmet-like display with a 70-degree field-of-view, to a hinged, flat design with a 60-degree field-of-view that soldiers can flip up. The service hasn’t released details of initial testing with that new redesign, and a recent Director of Test and Evaluation report on fiscal 2024 activities said the service is now expected to detail findings of an operational assessment of IVAS 1.2 in the April through June timeframe. That testing is designed to help Army leaders decide if they want to skip production, do a limited run or dive into a larger bulk purchase. Based on that decision, Luckey said Anduril would be ready to move out, and any large-scale buy of IVAS 1.2 or Next could eventually be produced at the company’s future Arsenal-1 facility in Columbus, Ohio. But while the Army continues preparations for that key test, it conducted other assessments that will factor into the path ahead. For instance, members from the 75th Ranger Regiment were tasked with running IVAS 1.2 through the ringer alongside dedicated night vision systems like the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENVG-B) and another system dubbed PVS-14, one service official told Breaking Defense last year. While companies wait for additional information on Army IVAS Next plans, Luckey said he anticipates the service buying a variety of heads-up displays, from different vendors that are tied together via a common architecture and common application layer. That hardware design, he surmised, will vary depending on the soldier's job. 'I think you're going to see things ranging from glasses that look a lot like the Oakley’s you wear everyday, all the way up to things that look like an Iron Man helmet,' he told reporters. 'Anduril is going to make some [slice] of those things but… pretty much everybody that's working on IVAS Next [are companies] that I'm interested in working with.' Not all companies preparing to compete in IVAS Next have publicly announced plans. However, Massachusetts-based Kopin has also said it’s interested in competing, while companies like Palantir have been attending industry days.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/microsoft-announces-plan-to-slide-22-billion-ivas-contract-over-to-anduril/	2025-02-11T08:15:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/7941063-scaled-e1691079418376.jpg
Twin political paths President Trump can take to ensure nuclear deterrence	US President Donald Trump (2L) and Russia's President Vladimir Putin wait ahead a meeting in Helsinki, on July 16, 2018. (Photo credit ALEXEY NIKOLSKY/AFP via Getty Images) President Donald Trump enters office at a possible inflection point in the ongoing nuclear competition with China and Russia. Though it is a moment of great peril for the US nuclear modernization program, it is also one of great opportunity — should Trump choose to seize it. Both China and Russia have exploited America’s glacial effort to modernize its aging nuclear arsenal and atrophied defense-industrial base by rapidly expanding their own. Beijing has grown the world’s largest fleet of nuclear-capable land-based missile launchers. And Moscow has locked in a glaring theater nuclear advantage in Europe that helped constrain former President Joe Biden’s support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. Compounding these developments is the fact that Washington, due to its deficient defense-industrial capacity, cannot reverse these trends in the near term by simply accelerating its troubled nuclear modernization program. And yet, despite the long-term structural problems with nuclear modernization, Trump still has readily available options at his disposal. Two near-term options, in particular, stand out. Both are political in nature, dealing with the 'software' of nuclear alliances and the mechanics of US domestic leadership. And both would generate immediate deterrence payoffs. First, Trump should move quickly to initiate political consultations within NATO to integrate Poland, in some form, into the alliance’s nuclear mission. Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the deployment of Russian short-range nuclear weapons in Belarus, Warsaw has expressed interest in joining NATO’s nuclear-sharing program — an arrangement in which forward-stationed gravity bombs remain in US custody in peacetime, but are carried by allied aircraft during crises and wartime. Poland’s fervor to host US nuclear weapons is undoubtedly a reflection of NATO’s failure to adjust to two transformations in the post-Cold War European security environment: the migration of the alliance’s center of gravity from Germany to Poland, and Moscow’s massive theater nuclear buildup that dwarfs the hundred or so American gravity bombs based in countries far from Russia’s border, like Germany. Integrating Poland into NATO’s nuclear-sharing system would address NATO’s changing geography and Warsaw’s growing fear of Russia’s theater buildup. Washington would not necessarily have to station gravity bombs in Poland, where they would be more vulnerable to preemptive attack. Polish pilots, after all, could always fly dual-capable aircraft based in Germany, as both nation’s pilots will soon be trained on the F-35A. A larger wrinkle would be to bring Finland into the nuclear fold and field weapons in both Poland and Finland — whether permanently or only for temporary rotations. This alternative might appeal to Helsinki, which has expressed a nascent interest in revising its long-held prohibition of nuclear weapons transiting its territory. It would mean Poland was not the only nuclear-armed NATO member along Russia’s border. And it would have the bonus effect of creating a nuclearized perimeter on Russia’s frontier that would greatly complicate Kremlin planning. Of course, one can never know what, exactly, will deter Moscow. But Russia has a historic tendency to pick on the 'little guy' — and a nuclear-capable NATO frontline is no small matter. The fundamental point, though, at least in the short term, would be for Trump to send a political message to Russia via allied consultations that American security is indivisible from NATO. To be sure, this option is not a rationale for dramatically scaling back US conventional forces in Europe — which would only weaken the alliance’s overall deterrence. Nor should it be wielded as a bargaining chip in whatever negotiations Trump might pursue regarding the Russia-Ukraine war. Nuclear consultations should be treated on their own terms: as an effort to reinforce NATO via two allies who are already devoting vast resources to their own defense. The second option readily available to Trump would be for him to get the White House back in the business of explaining to the American people the mounting threats they face — and what this means for their security. Here, Trump has a tremendous opportunity to outshine Biden, who neglected his duty to make the public case for greater defense spending. The simple act of adequately resourcing the military will have a deterrence effect by showing Beijing and Moscow that Washington is serious about defense. But sending this message will be impossible unless Americans hear from their president why they should support a larger defense budget. Indeed, Trump can rip a page directly out of the Cold War playbook of Ronald Reagan, the last president to make the case for and oversee a military buildup to counter a nuclear-armed peer adversary. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Reagan hammered home the point that the country was on the wrong end of adverse trends in the Soviet-American strategic balance. And he clearly articulated, in speech after speech, why the country required modernized missiles and bombers to penetrate improved Soviet air defenses. Reagan’s rhetoric and preparations to deploy these new capabilities ultimately had a demoralizing impact on the Soviets and yielded a landmark arms-control agreement on theater nuclear forces. Indeed, the Kremlin, as one Soviet official later recalled, was 'already compromising' before the US nuclear buildup even began to pick up steam in the mid-1980s. Fortunately for President Trump, the measures discussed above don’t require immediate solutions to America’s troubled defense-industrial base. They simply require the will to speak frankly with allies and the American people. That nuclear modernization is beset with delays, a work-force shortage, and funding gaps is no reason to surrender to despair. President Trump, like Reagan, can achieve peace through strength if he seizes the opportunities before him.

Aussies hoping AUKUS relationship will spare them Trump’s steel, aluminum tariffs	US President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, US, on Monday, Feb. 10, 2025. Trump ordered a 25% tariff on steel and aluminum imports, escalating his efforts to protect politically important US industries with levies hitting some of the country's closest allies. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images SYDNEY — Last week, made its first payment of $500 million USD to the United States to bolster the submarine industrial base, part of an eventual $3 billion investment inside the US to help speed up production of the Virginia-class nuclear powered attack submarine. It was a move that drew rare praise for a foreign government from Trump administration officials. Now, just days later, Australia finds itself hoping that goodwill can carry over after US President Donald Trump used an Executive Order to slap 25 percent tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports from around the globe. There is hope for an exemption, although, as has happened multiple times in the first few weeks of the new administration, the message coming from the White House is sometimes difficult to ascertain with any precision. When Trump signed the executive order for the tariffs, he told reporters that there would be 'no exemptions.' But he also said he had had a 'warm and constructive' call with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, during which the PM made the case for an exemption. Trump noted the trade surplus that America has with the Lucky Country, 'and the reason is they buy a lot of airplanes,' he said at the White House after speaking with Albanese. He added that he told the prime minister the exemption is 'something that we'll give great consideration to.' During a discussion today with reporters after the call with Trump, Albanese was very careful to say several times that 'we agreed on wording to say publicly, which is that the US president agreed that an exemption was under consideration.' Clearly echoing his conversation with Trump, Albanese noted that 'the US has a trade surplus with Australia that it's had since the Truman administration.' He noted that the US only imports about one percent of its steel and two percent of its aluminum from Australia. The fifth largest steel maker in America is an Australian company, BlueScope, which has invested about $5 billion into the US, the prime minister said. At least one AUKUS supporter is concerned: Rep. Joe Courtney, a Connecticut Democrat who is a major backer of the trilateral agreement, said in a statement that 'What we're seeing is a completely needless, almost insult to the people of Australia by raising tariffs of Australian products coming into this country.' 'They are buying three nuclear submarines, cash on the barrelhead, full price, no gimmes, no giveaway,' Courtney continued. 'So again, by all the measurements that President Trump talks about trade issues that we're being ripped off by other countries, in this case, every one of those arguments fails.' One Australian defense expert, John Blaxland of the Australian National University, compared his country's 'circumstances with its strategic cousins in Canada. There, tariffs are driving a strong nationalist reaction, while also triggering a period of reflection on trade and national security priorities internal to the nation.' Australia and Canada share many characteristics, as both are wealthy Commonwealth countries with parliamentary democracies and they have extremely close relations with the United States. And yet, Canada has found itself in Trump's crosshairs, to the point Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has warned that Trump's threats to annex Canada are 'a real thing.' Blaxland noted that 'the imposition of tariffs likely will have a corrosive effect on American soft power — of the latent good will in the Australian political scene towards positive US-Australian security and economic dynamics.' The good news for Australia is that steel and aluminum are not huge industries here so the country is not 'likely to suffer to any great degree as a result — as the pain probably will be diffused internationally,' he added. How should Australia measure its relationship with the United States, given the fact they are treaty allies, are working together to build a unique alliance based on the purchase and construction of nuclear-powered submarines and have fought side by side in every war since 1918? 'Do not be misled by the idea that there's any altruism in Washington towards Australia. Australians love to delude themselves to this,' former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told the Australia Broadcasting Corporation. 'If we want to be respected, we have to stand up.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/aussies-hoping-aukus-relationship-will-spare-them-trumps-steel-aluminum-tariffs/	2025-02-11T06:38:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/trump-steel-tarrif-scaled-e1739283017690.jpg
Air Force pauses ‘reoptimization’ planning as service awaits new leadership	An F-15EX fighter jet taxis to its parking spot at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (US Air Force) WASHINGTON — The Department of the Air Force has halted planning for a sweeping overhaul of its internal structures amid an order from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to wait for new, Senate-confirmed leadership before proceeding, the service confirmed today. 'On Feb. 6, the Secretary of Defense directed the Department of the Air Force to pause all planning actions connected to its Reoptimizing for Great Power Competition efforts. The planning pause remains in effect until a Senate-confirmed Secretary and Under Secretary of the Air Force are in place and have the opportunity to review the initiatives,' an Air Force spokesperson said in a statement. 'The Department of the Air Force welcomes the opportunity for our new leaders to assess all ongoing actions and ensure compliance with DoD directives. We will issue clarifying guidance, as necessary,' the spokesperson said. The pause does not require reversing reoptimization actions already undertaken, they added. Formally launched last year, the Department of the Air Force’s 'Reoptimizing for Great Power Competition' initiative aims to revamp Air Force and Space Force internal structures and processes; for example, by ensuring acquisitions are more integrated, and overhauling airman education and training. The pause on reoptimization planning was previously reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine. The reorganization was launched, former Air Force Secretary Kendall explained last year, with the intent to properly prepare airmen and Guardians for potential conflict with China. The overarching effort entails two dozen changes across the Air Force and Space Force, officials said when it was unveiled. The pause comes amid a wide-ranging review of DoD initiatives under the new Trump administration, where officials have now focused their gaze on purported diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. Lawmakers have also voiced some skepticism of the reoptimization drive but have yet to substantively impede its progress. Trump has nominated Troy Meink, the National Reconnaissance Office’s No. 2 official, to serve as the next secretary of the Department of the Air Force. The president has additionally picked Matthew Lohmeier, a former Space Force lieutenant colonel removed from his post in 2021 over comments he made on a podcast, to serve as the department's next under secretary. Hearing dates for the two nominees have not yet been set, and it’s not clear how long the pause for reoptimization planning may last as a result.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/air-force-pauses-reoptimization-planning-as-service-awaits-new-leadership/	2025-02-10T12:33:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240216_f15ex_taxi_6959449-e1708094519988.jpg
DoD acquisition reform guidance expected soon, with focus on rapid prototyping	US Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth visits Joint Task Force North, US Northern Command, along the southern border at Fort Bliss, Texas earlier this month. (US Army/ Sgt. 1st Class Andrew R. Sveen) WASHINGTON — Defense industry insiders are preparing for Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to issue new guidance for the Pentagon's acquisition process aimed at getting new tech into the field at a faster clip, Breaking Defense has learned. Hegseth is expected to sign out a new memo kickstarting the process as early as this week, according to two sources. Though that timing could shift and memo contents remain under wraps for now, it is expected to be the first of several steps designed to accelerate the process of buying and fielding new weapons and software. Both sources predicted an expanded role for the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) and its push to circumvent the traditional acquisition process. The wait for more details about priorities and the road ahead comes after Hegseth promised to 'rebuild' the military last week, to include the Department of Defense’s 'acquisitions process [and] how we rapidly field new technologies.' 'There's a lot of programs around here that we’ve spent a lot of money on that, when you actually wargame it, don't have the impact you want them to,' he said during a townhall-style event on Feb. 7. 'That means I'm going to take a lot of arrows, and I'm prepared to do so. That's fine,' he later added. 'We need the best systems in the hands of warfighters where they need it, to the COCOMs [combatant commanders] to deter and send the signals that when that fight comes, we're ready to win and win decisively.' Just how broad this shakeup will be remains to be seen, but a third source that works closely with a broad swath of defense companies said a new look at acquisition is par for the course when a new secretary hits the Pentagon. 'With all new administrations, there is a pretty much ‘stop, relook and clarify priorities period,’' the source said. 'And right now there is a sense of urgency with acquisition reform.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/dod-acquisition-reform-guidance-expected-soon-with-focus-on-rapid-prototyping/	2025-02-10T12:00:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/Hegseth2-e1739216330555.jpg
Promising biotech startups ‘dying on the vine’: In-Q-Tel	DNA molecular structure with sequencing data of human genome analysis. (Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Driven by the spread of CRISPR gene-editing techniques and rapid advances in AI-powered biochemical models, biotechnology is taking off. But not all biotech is equal in an investor’s eyes, and the biotech sectors that face the hardest fight for funding — at least in the United States — happen to be the ones with most promise for the Pentagon. While tens of billions of dollars pour into biotech ever year in the US and Europe, it overwhelmingly goes to pharmaceutical products, everything from lifesaving medicines like mRNA COVID vaccines to mass-market cosmetic creams, because those investments have the shortest and most obvious path to high returns. By contrast, there’s much less commercial demand — and a more confusing regulatory process — for other promising biotech that might matter for the military. That includes new, biologically-derived materials like lighter-weight body armor, anti-corrosion coatings or even explosives. 'The private sector on its own is not going to fund that stuff,' said Vivek Chilukuri, director of the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, in an interview with Breaking Defense. 'It’s going to fund skin creams and lotions and other mass-market pharmaceuticals.' 'It's easier to … either go after quick-turn products or to really focus, laser focus, on high return-products,' Jessica Dymond, vice president for technology at In-Q-Tel, the nonprofit venture-capital arm of the US intelligence community, said last week at a panel hosted by CNAS. 'There's a lot left on the sidelines, that is, you know, quite frankly, dying on the vine.' Private-sector investment just isn’t coming fast enough to sustain these biotech startups, Dymondvadded. That means, she said, 'a lot of thought is needed in terms of how to cultivate that early, very fragile stage.' Investors weren’t always so hyper focused on pharmaceuticals, lamented another panelist at CNAS, Jason Kelly, cofounder of Ginkgo Bioworks, which provides high-tech tools for other biotech firms. 'Fastest growing area for us now is biopharma,' he said. But if you go back to the first influx of venture capital about ten years ago, he said, 'all the rage at that point was … being able to make new materials,' such as humane alternatives to leather and meat. However, he noted that when interest rates rose in the last few years, the funding for everything outside of pharmaceuticals 'evaporated.' 'When private markets aren't there for the parts of biotech that are relevant in defense, how do you back-stop it?' he asked. One federal effort to fill the gap is BioMADE, a nonprofit, public-private partnership aimed specifically at bio-manufacturing. It was launched in the last months of the first Trump administration with $87 million in Pentagon funding spread over seven years, and $187 million in private-sector and university funds. The Biden administration followed up in 2023 by pledging another $1.5 billion for various biomanufacturing initiatives spread over five years, so it will be up to President Donald Trump to continue it or not. There’s also a congressionally chartered National Security Commission on Emerging Biotechnology just now wrapping up its work, though they’re not focused solely on DoD interests or biomanufacturing. 'In just a few weeks, the NSCEB will publish our major report, including a number of policy recommendations,' said the chairman, Sen. Todd Young, in an address to CNAS after the panel. 'Our government must take targeted action in ways only the federal government can.' Otherwise, the Indiana Republican warned, China will capitalize on its current dominance of the low end of the biotech supply chain — by some estimates, it exports 40 percent of all active pharmaceutical ingredients worldwide — and steal undervalued American IP to take the lead in biotech writ large. 'China, in short, plays to win,' he said. This really is a moment that Congress and Trump can seize, said Chilukuri, a former Hill staffer himself. 'I’m optimistic that the commission is going to put forward some very thoughtful, practical recommendations,' he told Breaking Defense. While finding more federal funding at a time of feverish DOGE cuts is far from easy, the money that’s gone to bio-materials and other non-pharmaceutical biotech so far is 'a rounding error' in the Pentagon budget, he argued. Even without new funding, he went on, there is an opportunity to streamline biotech regulation and improve coordination among federal agencies — 13 different offices have some degree of jurisdiction, with multiple funding sources in DoD alone. 'These programs could stand to scale up, but that should be paired with an actual strategic plan at DoD about how these different programs are going to be married together and what is the actual vision for the next five to 10 years of actual products,' Chilukuri told Breaking Defense. 'We don’t have that plan right now, and it’s a huge opportunity that I think is just waiting for this administration to seize.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/promising-biotech-startups-dying-on-the-vine-in-q-tel/	2025-02-10T08:43:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/GettyImages-1703790414-scaled-e1738964966546.jpg
On Lebanese border, Israel’s Plasan kept rolling out armored vehicles as war raged	Plasan's Sandcat 'Tigris' (Photo courtesy of Plasan) SASA, Israel — The Israeli defense company Plasan makes armored solutions for military platforms, such as producing complex armored plates for vehicles. But the company had to think about a different kind of protection in 2024 — how it keep its facilities and staff safe as the war expanded into Lebanon. The company is located in the northern Israeli community of Sasa, around a mile from the Lebanese border, right along the front line of Israel’s conflict with Hezbollah. The company continued to roll vehicles off the line and keep up production throughout the war. During a visit to Plasan, representatives discussed how they kept up with orders and dealt with the disruptions of war. The northern border of Israel is quiet these days. The rolling hills of the upper Galilee are preparing for spring, and some trees even have blossoms already. But for most of 2024 this area was a war zone. Israel evacuated more than 60,000 people from border communities in October 2023 when Hezbollah began rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel. Roads near the border were closed and concrete barriers were erected in many places where drivers or soldiers might be exposed to anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) fire. 'On October 7 [2023] the army came and took vehicles we had, those about to be delivered,' recalls Gilad Ariav, vice-president of marketing and business development at Plasan. And given the demand from the IDF, the company was charged with keeping production up at normal or higher rates, despite the potential dangers of being so close to the border. The IDF needed ceramic plates for soldiers, and Plasan reopened an old line to produce them, working 24/7 to produce 35,000 plates while also increasing production of armored vehicles. While the members of the Sasa Kibbutz that is adjacent to the company were evacuated to the south, the company’s employees stayed at work. Around 50 percent of the employees were called up to IDF reserve duty. 'It didn’t prevent us [from delivering]' says Ariav. As the company provided a tour of its site, the evidence of the threats from the last fifteen months of war was still visible: In one section of the factory there are several window sections that have been impacted by various projectiles. There is also one vehicle that is missing a rear wheel and was hit by some kind of IED, and concrete barriers remain in place to protect against missile fire from Lebanon. Members of the company described how one could often see and hear interceptions overhead during the war. Not only was Sasa targeted, but Mount Meron, which looms a mile away across a nearby valley, was often targeted because it has an IDF base near its peak. Many of the residents of the community around the company have not fully returned to their homes and schools. (Overall Plasan has around 450 employees in Israel and around 700 worldwide, with subsidiaries in the US, Australia and France.) But officials are proud of the fact that despite the frequent sirens, need to go into shelters, and the constant threats, the work went on. Today the company appears to be continuing to work at a fast pace to produce its armored solutions. In one area of a factory floor Ariav shows how armored plates for things such as doors of vehicles are produced. Small hexagonal ceramic pieces are placed as a layer and then they are sandwiched between metal, which the company says helps absorb blasts. During a presentation, Ariav stressed how the company uses live trials to test its armor and solutions against explosions and projectiles, as well as running complex computer simulations. The simulations examine how different projectiles might hit a plate, or how an improvised explosive device would impact armor. This saves the cost and effort of blowing up numerous vehicles, Ariav says the simulations have proven effective in terms of final design and predicting how threats will impact armor. In another area, the company showcased their FlexFence defense against RPGs, which looks like a kind of fence that can be draped around parts of the vehicle. The fence uses special technology to trigger the RPG and helps protect the vehicle from being penetrated, so that the damage of the blast is reduced. The firm is also in production on a number of vehicles. One is the Sandcat, which is called the 'Tigris' by the IDF. The company uses the chassis of F-550s and then adds an armored body on top of them. This is an armored solution the company calls Kitted Hull and it provides protection from all angles, including below for mines and above against small bomblets that drones can drop. In one hangar the company is producing the Sandcats for both the IDF and what they said was another, undisclosed customer. Each has a different configuration, and employees work on the vehicles by hand, producing around ten vehicles a week. Besides the Sandcats, a major focus for the firm are contracts for armoring JLTVs with Oshkosh as well as the Australian Redback infantry fighting vehicle, which is made by South Korea’s Hanwha. The company is also up-armoring a number of Piranhas, a family of fighting vehicles the originated in Switzerland in the 1970s and is now in its fifth generation and in use by a dozen countries. In addition, Plasan is also working on a new system called an All-Terrain Electric Mission Module (ATeMM), which is an electric-powered 'modular' system that can function as a kind of trailer for a vehicle, or be used as a four-wheeled robotic unmanned vehicle. ATeMM was first unveiled in 2021 but was tested by the IDF in the recent war in Lebanon. It was one of many vehicles in the Plasan factory that seemed to encapsulate how technology is transforming not only armored vehicles but also solutions for maneuvering forces — the kind of lesson that comes from 15 months of a multi-front war.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/on-lebanese-border-israels-plasan-kept-rolling-out-armored-vehicles-as-war-raged/	2025-02-10T07:14:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/PLASAN_SANDCAT_TIGRIS-004-690x388-1-e1738961341316.png
L3Harris unveils command, control software envisioned for 1,000s of drones	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019. This exercise was the first of many held at the National Training Center. (US Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — L3Harris today announced it is unveiling a new command and control software, dubbed 'AMORPHOUS,' designed to control thousands of unmanned systems in a 'swarm,' joining a number of other companies in recent years that have homed in on that technology as a gap in the Pentagon's arsenal. 'There have been concepts that have said maybe you need one particular asset that is referred to as the mothership, or the brains of the operation,' Jon Rambeau, president of integrated missions systems, told reporters last week. 'We believe that's not the best approach, because if something happens — that asset is degraded, it's attacked, it's no longer able to communicate, then what happens?' The answer, Rambeau said, is that AMORPHOUS is designed to pass control of the swarm from one asset to another on the fly. Toby Magsig, vice president of autonomy programs, added that the idea behind a 'leaderless swarm' is that the user sends out instructions — for example, conduct a search of the area — to every asset in the swarm, but the drones intelligently delegate tasks among themselves. AMORPHOUS — Autonomous Multi-domain Operations Resiliency Platform for Heterogeneous Unmanned Swarms — is currently being used on contracts for the Army and the Defense Innovation Unit. To date it has demonstrated the ability to control 'multiple separate assets across multiple vehicle types operating in different domains during government-managed tests.' Asked about how large of a swarm AMORPHOUS has controlled to date, Magsig said the top number has been in the 'double digits,' and he believes it will soon exceed 100. 'It becomes an economy of scale in terms of testing this live, when you talk sort of four digits &#8230; and so that's where we rely on a Live, Virtual, Constructive mix to get and test and validate this scalability to what DOD is really looking for,' he said. Rambeau and Magsig acknowledged their product is joining a crowded field of competitors. Indeed, companies such as HII and Swedish defense giant Saab, among others, have all recently been making plays into software development focused on unmanned systems command and control. L3Harris's pitch may be among the more ambitious in scale but it's unclear how the Pentagon — or more precisely, each of the individual services — will approach the question of controlling thousands of drones in concert on a joint battlefield.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/02/l3harris-unveils-command-control-software-envisioned-for-1000s-of-drones/	2025-02-10T06:00:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1733415596741.jpg
