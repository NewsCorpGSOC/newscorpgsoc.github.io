Ground robots challenged, battery issues: Transformation in contact hits the Pacific	A US Army small unmanned aerial system assigned to the 2nd Light Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division prepares to take off from the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center on Dillingham Airfield, Oahu, Hawaii, on Oct. 7 (US Army/ Staff Sgt. Brenden Delgado) WASHINGTON — Attendees at last week's AUSA conference in Washington couldn't escape the phrase 'transformation in contact,' Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George’s push to quickly test new equipment with units both inside the US and abroad to understand how that technology will operate in real world environments. One of the units George has tasked with testing the new kit out is the 2nd Light Brigade Combat Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, which recently wrapped up putting new gear through its paces in Pacific conditions to see how they did. The results, divisional leaders told reporters today, should give Army leadership plenty to think about. 'When we receive equipment from across the Army that is really tested in pristine environments&#8230;we're seeing what it can do in the heat, in the salt, in the humidity, and at some cases, at altitude as they train on the Big Island of Hawaii,' said 25th Infantry Division’s Command Sgt. Maj. Shaun Curry. 'Maybe it didn't work the way we wanted to, but we have the capability of giving feedback to the Army, to development, to industry to try and make it work a little bit better.' Out at the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center in Hawaii those soldiers used the newer tech in different temperatures and terrain than the recent training rotation this summer with the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division in the woods and swamp at Ft. Johnson, La. 'Each one of these pieces of equipment requires the opportunity for soldiers to use in different terrains and environments to figure out how they can be employed, what limitations may be involved,' added Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans, the 25th ID commander. 'That's exactly what a training environment like the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center provides.' So what did they find out on the island? While Evans and Curry did not provide reporters with a comprehensive list of every finding, they offered a quick peek at initial takeaways from three key program areas: the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET), unmanned aerial systems and the Infantry Squad Vehicle. The S-MET Increment 1 robotic mules were designed to help soldiers ferry their equipment around on the battlefield. And while officials inside the 2nd Brigade, 101st Division publicly praised the S-MET’s performance out in Louisiana’s relatively flat terrain, those from the 25th found that soldiers in the Pacific or in hillier terrain may need to use them differently. At times, Evans explained, the steep ravines made it a 'bit problematic' for soldiers to maneuver those robotic mules, versus when they were using them on flatter, less dense parcels of land. As a result, Curry said soldiers found different ways to use them, ways that could shape numbers and operations. 'Bottom-up refinement has been a part of the entire transformation in contact, so it may have been one version to say the [S-MET] was going to work in this particular environment, but for us, I think it works best in all logistics patrols in moving large equipment further back…in the rear area,' Curry said. '[That] may be a little bit different from how originally envisioned, but that's how we're using it on the ground.' Across the board, battery power emerged as another challenge for the soldiers looking to recharge everything from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to the additional communications equipment they had in tow. The hotter temperatures and humidity, Evans added, means less battery duration for systems, which is simply 'acknowledging and understanding the limitations' based on the operating environment. As for UAS on hand, soldiers had about 130 Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) aerial drones inside the formation, and those provided them with the ability to see further out than an organic rifle platoon. However, soldiers were 'challenged' to get to higher ground and above the tree line in order to launch the smaller drones, Evans added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/ground-robots-challenged-battery-issues-transformation-in-contact-hits-the-pacific/	2024-10-21T13:16:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/SRR-e1729532581703.jpg
Army plans follow-up to SATCOM services pilot for FY25	In support of the Army’s Satellite Communications (SATCOM) as a Managed Service (SATaaMS) Pilot, Project Manager Tactical Network (PM TN), Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) facilitates new equipment training on commercial equipment for the Virginia Army National Guard, 529th Sustainment Support Battalion, North Chesterfield, Virgina, on Feb. 14, 2024. (US Army photo by Amy Walker, PEO C3T public affairs) WASHINGTON — The US Army is working on a follow-on contract vehicle for purchasing commercial satellite services before the end of fiscal 2025, following the success of a year-long pilot project wrapping up at the end of this month, service officials told Breaking Defense. 'The Army G6 is currently consolidating all commercial SATCOM requirements to find efficiencies in providing network services through various contract options and consolidated funding lines,' said Lt. Col. Mark Scott, product manager for Unified Network Capabilities and Integration (UNCI) in an Oct. 18 email. 'The Army acquisition community is planning to move from a pilot contract to a follow-on contract in fiscal year (FY) 2025 that will establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement with multiple vendors that provide services from all constellations to include Low, Medium and Geosynchronous Earth (LEO, MEO, and GEO) orbits,' he added. Scott is assigned to the project manager Tactical Network, which led the Satellite Communications (SATCOM) as a Managed Service (SaaMS) pilot under the Army Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications and Network (PEO C3N). PEO C3N is the new name as of Oct. 9 for the service's Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications – Tactical — a change that was designed to reflect the Army's plans to develop a modernized unified network. The Army on Oct. 16 issued a request for information (RFI) to industry designed to assess the 'state of the art' of commercial tech for two types of SATCOM services that would be bought under a new agreement, that in essence buy access to SATCOM in the same way that individuals subscribe to a mobile phone plan. Like the Army's SaaMS pilot, the new contract vehicle would be managed through the US Space Force's Commercial Space Office. 'The US Army is seeking a highly reliable and secure communication network for the Army with worldwide coverage. The communication network will ensure uninterrupted data transfer, voice communication for the warfighter. The offeror must meet at least a 6 Mbps download and a 2 Mbps upload. These are only the very minimum requirements, but the Army seeks higher and cost-effective data plans,' the RFI said. 'In addition, the US Army seeks multiple vendors to supply iDirect SATCOM terminals that will be used for the Sustainment Transport System (STS) Program. The [SaaMS] portion to STS will provide: multiband-capable SATCOM terminals, SATCOM terminal training, and maintenance of SATCOM terminals,' it added. Scott said while the current timeline is subject to potential change, the Army hopes to issue a formal request for proposals in late FY25. Army officials were pleased with the outcome of the SaaMS pilot, which involved two vendors, Intelsat and DRS Global Solutions. DRS Global Solutions now has been folded into into SES Space and Defense, the American arm of Luxembourg-based SES S.A., which purchased the business from Italian defense firm Leonardo. While noting that he was not directly involved in the effort, Col. Pete Atkinson, the Army's principal space advisor, told the annual Association of the US Army conference on Oct. 15 'it was an absolute success.' Scott explained that the pilot used 'one and six-month service plans' that 'included satellite terminals, bandwidth in all regions of the world, training packages, coordination of host nation agreements, cybersecurity, 24/7 helpdesk support, and maintenance services.' Via individual task order under the Blanket Purchase Agreement contract managed by the Space Force, the Army was able to tailor packages to different 'use cases,' including 'short term deployments, support to Army exercises, replace non-mission capable systems, and to supplement bandwidth for units needing extra data transport,' he said. Overall, the partnership between the Army and the selected pilot vendors enabled the successful fielding of over 60 systems within the pilot period of performance,' Scott added. The pilot provided the Army with several 'key takeaways' that will be factored into shaping the SATCOM as a service model, he said. 'One area of improvement included the need for a quicker transition of services if a unit is required to move locations, requiring vendor and Army coordination to execute the technical action,' Scott elaborated. 'Additionally, feedback from pilot participants on vendor terminal solutions commented that they preferred smaller systems that are easily transportable. Short-notice deployments may require commercial air travel and ruggedized terminals with added power supplies in bulky tough boxes proved difficult for transport.' Overall, however, the Army is convinced that there are benefits to be had from moving in that direction. For example, using a service contract allows for 'potential for rapid response to unit SATCOM requirements combined with the ability to scale quickly,' Scott said. 'The biggest benefit discovered is the use of many of the latest technologies available in the commercial market.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-plans-follow-up-to-satcom-services-pilot-for-fy25/	2024-10-21T12:25:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/APPROVED-SaaMS-NET-VAARNG-14Feb24-NorthChesterfield-VA-AmyWalker-IMG_1473rev-scaled-e1729532648615.jpg
Army official wants tech contracts in 6 months, and is inverting the requirements process to get there	A student at the US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School in the Technical Exploitation Course processes a laptop computer during training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina October 22, 2019. (US Army photo by K. Kassens) Danielle Moyer, executive director of Army Contracting Command at Aberdeen Proving Ground, said during a panel at AUSA 2024 last week that the service plans to emphasize the use of 'characteristics of need,' rather than too restrictive traditional requirements. 'When we have a problem, we want to take that problem and give it to industry, and not over prescribe contracts,' Moyer said. She suggested that instead, industry 'propose back a solution, and then we determine the contract type based on your solution, instead of me predetermining everything.' The thinking was echoed by none other than Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, who described the improved process earlier in the conference. 'We put out a two-page characterization of needs for our network, and then we had all the experts, people who really understand this, and we have our own group of nerds that are a part of this as well, but they would actually tell us, ‘Hey, here's what we can do, and here's how we can do it, and this might be a better way to approach this.' And I think we're getting faster with that too,' George said. Industry seems to agree with the Army's initiative to move toward a characteristics of need approach. Tara Murphy Dougherty, CEO of defense software firm Govini, said it allows industry to be more involved in the process. 'So to the point about how restrictive requirements are and how rapidly outdated they are, what is fantastic about a characteristics of need is that it creates a focus on the warfighter from the buyer side of the problem, and it allows industry to suggest the solutions,' she said. 'If you want innovation, and you know that the vast majority of the innovation in the United States today is happening in the commercial sector, then why not describe your problems and seek that input rather than describing the solution you want?' 'We want affordable contracts, but sometimes we want the best thing, and then how do we incentivize you with the best thing once you prove it right?' Moyer said. She added that her office is looking at ways to hand out incentives for vendors who showed their product was 'better and faster' than others. Christian Brose, chief strategy officer of Anduril Industries, agreed with Moyer, saying incentives and the focus on needs, rather than requirements, would help vendors stay focused on the service’s mission and help deliver products at a faster speed. Moyer said the Army also plans to focus on more demos and less paperwork. She said this allows vendors to actually show off their capabilities instead of showing how well they can fill out a lengthy proposal, which can take large quantities of time as they are are usually hundreds of pages. 'We want you to come demo like, what do you really do and show me?' she asked. 'There should be real constant feedback in some tech demonstrations, versus ‘Did you write [the proposal] really well?’ You probably used some AI to write the proposal anyway.' She added that the Army has already gotten away from the 'hundreds of pages' of written proposals, which she reiterated were not the best measurement as to how a vendor will perform. 'You probably get kicked out of a competition because your font was wrong. [We’re] probably gonna change that,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-official-wants-tech-contracts-in-6-months-and-is-inverting-the-requirements-process-to-get-there/	2024-10-21T11:45:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/230525_DVIDS_soldier_laptop_5895094-scaled-e1685021963805.jpg
Turkish defense spending to reach record high amid neighboring conflicts	Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz attends the Opening Session of the 3rd Legislative Year of the 28th Term of the Turkish Grand National Assembly at the Turkish Parliament in Ankara, Turkiye on October 1, 2024. (Photo by Harun Ozalp/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkey plans to increase its defense and security spending in 2025 to ₺1.61 trillion ($47 billion), its highest-ever military budget, in what experts said is a response to increased local production and raging conflicts in neighboring countries. Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz told reporters in a briefing Thursday that the money will be split, with ₺ 913.9 billion ($26.6 billion) going to the defense spending budget and ₺694.5 billion ($20.28 billion) going to internal security. The 2025 budget, which is a 17.5 percent increase from the $40 billion 2024 budget, follows the recent upward trend of defense spending in Turkey. The 2024 budget, for instance, was a 150 percent increase from the prior year's $16 billion budget. Experts told Breaking Defense that the surge in spending was spurred by Ankara’s focus on boosting its air and missile defense capabilities, as well as supporting local defense production. 'Air defense systems and missiles will be at the top of these projects,' Turkish aerospace and defense expert Cem Dogut said. 'Air defense was one of the weakest areas of the Turkish Armed Forces. For many years, this task was left to the air force, and the air force had mainly resorted to combating this with fighter jets.' He also highlighted Turkish local projects in this domain, stating, 'In order to eliminate this deficiency, various projects have been initiated to create a layered air defense, including the Hisar and Siper air defense missile families and various radar projects.' Another budget need, according to Dogut, is maintaining modern aircraft fleet. '[There is a] need to maintain the current fleet while the current aircraft projects (Hürjet, Kaan) continue until they arrive. A serious additional budget is needed for the F-16 modernization project and the Eurofighter purchase,' he said. RELATED: The &#8216;dual purpose' in Turkey's bid for 40 Eurofighter Typhoons In her opinion, defense analyst Sine Özkaraşahin told Breaking Defense that Turkey has multiple ambitious defense projects, namely 'upgrades to Kızılelma, the steel dome layered air defense system, and potential purchase of Eurofighter jets.' She said Turkey is reacting to a high 'threat perception in its neighborhood,' including instability in neighboring Syria, Iraq and Iran, as well as the current Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute. The Israeli wars in Gaza and Lebanon are a short trip across the Mediterranean. Of the many surrounding conflicts, the biggest problem facing Turkey, according to Dogut, is the current situation in Syria. 'Previously, different operations were carried out [by Turkey] to create a safe zone in Syria. However, the entire border could not be secured, and new operations in this region seem inevitable. Although Turkey wants to postpone this as long as it can, it will eventually have to do so,' he added. Turkey has been focused on making strides in localizing defense production in an attempt to become less dependent on Western technology that might be subjected to embargoes — a long-term investment that Dogut nevertheless says comes at a price. 'Producing a weapon system yourself from scratch will usually be more costly than purchasing it from abroad. Turkey is forced to produce everything it cannot buy from abroad, which wastes time and money,' he stressed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-defense-spending-to-reach-record-high-amid-neighboring-conflicts/	2024-10-21T10:57:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GettyImages-2175261114-e1729531119722.jpg
In Ukraine, Austin takes aim at Putin ‘apologists,’ decries ‘both sides’ narrative on blame for war	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III answers questions during a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO Defense Ministerial meetings at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 12, 2023. (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) WASHINGTON — In an impassioned speech in Kyiv today, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin took direct aim at the idea that Ukraine is to blame for Russia's invasion, saying US 'fully understand[s] the moral chasm between aggressor and defender.' Taking a line from President John F. Kennedy's famous 1963 address in Berlin, Austin, who normally avoids political statements, said that 'there are some who don't understand — or say they don't understand — what is at stake between the free world and an aggressive tyrant like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.' 'There are some who say that both sides are to blame for Putin's war of aggression &#8230; There are some who blur the lines between aggressor and victim,' Austin said according to prepared remarks, adding in each instance that those people should 'come to Kyiv.' Austin did not identify the people he was talking about, except to mention 'Kremlin apologists,' but the speech comes as a critical moment ahead of the US election and just days after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was responsible for Russia's invasion. 'That doesn't mean I don't want to help [Zelenskyy], because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war's a loser,' Trump said last week on a podcast. Speaking next to Zelenskyy late last month, Trump said he and the Ukrainian leader have a 'very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin.' Just days later, after Zelenskyy criticized Trump in a New Yorker article, Trump suggested the US should reconsider its commitment. 'Those buildings are down. Those cities are gone. They're gone. And we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal,' Trump said at a campaign rally. (Earlier in September, during a presidential debate Trump declined to say if he thought Ukraine should win the war.) Some lawmakers in the US Congress, especially among Republicans in the House of Representatives, have spoken out against US aid for Ukraine, arguing that the money is better spent inside American borders. Austin spoke the same day the Defense Department unveiled its latest aid package, including $400 million-worth of equipment ranging from rocket ammunition to Javelin anti-armor weapons to satellite communications equipment. In his speech today, Austin attempted to link Ukraine's security with America's. 'Ukraine matters to US security for four blunt reasons: Putin's war threatens European security, Putin's war challenges our NATO allies, Putin's war attacks our shared values, and Putin's war is a frontal assault on the rules-based international order that keeps us all safe.' And though Austin did not mention Trump, he did name-check Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, saying she and President Joe Biden 'will have a proud place in history for rallying the world to defend Ukraine.' Austin also praised Zelenskyy, saying that from his position 'on down, your leaders chose to fight back.' 'The spirit of Ukraine has inspired the world, and it has reminded us all to never take our freedom for granted,' Austin said. 'So we refuse to blame Ukraine for the Kremlin's aggression. We refuse to offer excuses for Putin's atrocities. And we refuse to pretend that appeasement will stop an invasion.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/in-ukraine-austin-takes-aim-at-putin-apologists-decries-both-sides-narrative-on-blame-for-war/	2024-10-21T08:58:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240416_austin_nato_flags_8069533-scaled-e1713254552575.jpg
Australia announces $7B for SM-2, SM-6 missiles in huge munitions purchase	HMAS Sydney fires Royal Australian Navy's first Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) near Hawaii during Exercise Pacific Dragon 2024. (ADF LSIS Daniel Goodman) SYDNEY — Australia today announced a massive $7 billion AUD ($4.68 billion USD) investment in SM-2 IIIC and SM-6 missiles for its Navy, solidifying a commitment to buying the US-made long-range precision weapons while boosting the sea service's ability to defend against ballistic missile attacks. 'The Standard Missile 6 and Standard Missile 2 Block IIIC will enable our Navy to strike maritime, land and air targets at long-range, and provide a terminal ballistic missile defense capability, boosting the capacity for the ADF to safeguard Australians and their interests,' Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a Monday statement. 'The SM-2 IIIC and SM-6 are the most advanced air and missile defense weapons in the world and will be progressively deployed across Navy’s Hobart class destroyers and in the future, the Hunter class frigates,' Marles continued. 'This follows the recent successful test firing of a SM-6 from HMAS Sydney.' Australia's minister for defense procurement, Pat Conroy, noted in a statement that, 'Australia was the first country, other than the United States, to fire the SM&#8211;6 missile, underscoring the strength of our alliance.' In terms of capability, SM-2 IIIC adds active seeker technology and 'significantly enhanced defensive capabilities against missile threats,' per the statement. The SM-6 will give Australia's missile defense more depth because of its increased range, the government release says. The announcement is a culmination of years of interest in the weapons from the Lucky Country. In August 2021, the US State Department approved a Foreign Military Sale (FMS) case for 'services related to the future purchase of' SM-6 and SM-2 IIIC. That agreement was for just $350 million USD, but likely helped pave a path forward for today's announcement. While today's statement doesn't say so, it's likely this is a also an FMS case, which will include training, spare parts, manuals and other incidentals. FMS cases mean the US government serves as the go-between for the company — in this case, missile-produced Raytheon — and the foreign buyer. While FMS cases need to be approved by Congress, that is unlikely to be an issue here given the widespread support for military relations with Australia. The SM-2 was the subject of a production shutdown in 2013, when international demand sagged. However, production has since resumed, and the first successful test of a missile from the line occurred in 2020. More than 12,000 of these air defense missile have been delivered, and according to Raytheon, other foreign users include Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Spain and Taiwan, with Chile and Denmark also planning to purchase the weapon. Australia has operated earlier SM-2 model missiles since at least 2010. The US Navy fired SM-2 missiles to intercept anti-ship missiles and drones in the Red Sea in early 2024 to defend against attacks by Houthi rebels targeting commercial vessels transiting the waterway. In a recent op-ed, noted defense budget expert Mackenzie Eaglen pointed to what she called the 'dire' missile production problems of the US Navy, including across the Standard Missile line. Eaglen notes that SM-6 procurement for the US Navy is 'expected to increase to 300 missiles by 2029' but that these rates 'pale in comparison to those of the past. For example, in 1985 alone, President Reagan requested 1,380 SM-2s—over 10 times this administration’s Standard Missile request.' The Australian orders, for which no production numbers were provided by the government in its release, should help bolster both the SM-2 and SM-6 production lines.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/australia-announces-7b-for-sm-2-sm-6-missiles-in-huge-munitions-purchase/	2024-10-21T08:30:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20240805ran8620187_0098.jpeg
It’s time for a true industrial strategy for American national security	Robotic arms along assembly line in modern factory. Heavy industry, technology and machine learning. 3D rendering (Getty images) Earlier this year, the bipartisan congressionally-appointed commission on which we serve sounded the alarm that America is at risk of losing its military and technological edge to China. One way to meet that challenge is to redefine how the industrial base fits into national security to create an all-elements of national power approach. Currently, the view of industrial national security tends to focus on efforts to keep the defense industrial base healthy, productive, and resilient. The emphasis has been ensuring China or Russia cannot buy companies that are integral parts of the defense supply chain, improving and expanding production of the weapons in demand around the globe, and ensuring the security of critical infrastructure essential to the defense industrial base. But in 2024, and certainly going forward, this is simply too myopic a view of the role industrial policy plays as the backbone to American security. There is an integral link between the defense industrial base and American industry as a whole. The materials, components, and manufacturing produced by American industry are as essential to the defense industrial base as they are to U.S. economic strength. The next administration should ensure that industrial policy receives significant attention to strengthen national security. Industrial policy requires making strategic public investments designed to strengthen economic and national security — not only what is traditionally thought of as the defense industrial base, but in broader goods and manufacturing category for both America and its allies. This means ensuring effective production of and supply chains for goods and manufacturing that serve interests and needs across the economy – not just the defense industrial base — as an expanded aperture strengthens U.S. security. RELATED: National Defense Commission: Pentagon has ‘insufficient’ forces ‘inadequate’ to face China, Russia An effective industrial strategy rests on three pillars, each with tangible steps the new administration should take: Defense Production: First, a new administration must enable the U.S. industrial base to rapidly surge and scale production to manufacture goods, from silicon wafers to aluminum pipes to attritable drones. This requires repurposing available mechanisms for public-private financing via the Defense Production Act, within Development Finance Corporation or Department of Energy authorities, or creating new ones. It means legislatively reforming existing U.S. permitting processes, including addressing unintended consequences of the 50+ year old National Environmental Protection Act. It also requires industry to embrace more flexible design, test, and manufacturing processes such as additive manufacturing, and leveraging software to automate and speed defense production. This must be enabled by significant reform of overly rigid government test, evaluation, and qualification regulations. Build Our Workforce: Second, the strategy must harness the American workforce to lead the world economically and provide for a more secure American future. America needs more workers skilled in trade: plumbers, welders, electricians, and those ready to mine and process the minerals that power phones, batteries, automobiles, and weapons systems. Equally, America needs scientists, technologists, and innovators at every level in every field to maintain a cutting edge. The next administration must recast the narrative so that industrial and technical jobs, whether they in civil, military service or in private industry, are seen as critical public service without which the nation cannot function – let alone lead. The narrative must be paired with smart investments in community colleges, vocational certifications, STEM recruitment, and the ability for those with needed skills to move seamlessly between public and private sectors. Work With Partners: Third, the strategy should leverage allies as industrial and technological force-multipliers. Industrial collaboration helps create redundant and resilient supply chains, expands manufacturing capacity, and taps into key leading technologies such as quantum computing. International industrial cooperation strengthens American security and economy by increasing production and innovation in the right technologies. It requires re-engineering export controls like the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and developing swifter information sharing with America’s most trusted friends — in other words, more open channels for industrial collaboration abroad. Consider an America that with like-minded international partners can develop software and computer chips, create a sustainable and resilient critical mineral supply chain, build the defense equipment needed to deter China, and offer more job opportunities and skilled workers to fill them. The good news: This is all possible, and there have been steps made in the right direction. Major economic and energy legislation of the last few years – the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act — lay a foundation for onshoring key industries paired with the ability to 'friend-shore' with allies and partners. The next administration must iterate on these Biden administration initiatives, taking a step further to implement a truly innovative industrial strategy that reimagines manufacturing as a core pillar of American strength. Luckily, there is a growing bipartisan agreement that things need to change. Just look at the presidential campaign today — eight years ago, strengthening the U.S. industrial base to ensure American competitiveness would hardly have gotten a mention. Now you can see candidates talking openly about competing with China economically, reducing dependency on China for key supply chains, and deterring destabilizing actions that threaten U.S. and global security. Our commission assessing the National Defense Strategy highlighted the dangers of inaction. The next president must be maximally focused on moving industrial strategy from words to action to demonstrate that defense of the nation is not just the responsibility of the military alone. For an industrial strategy to work, the president must make it a White House priority that pulls together all elements of national power. At an executive level, a joint team from the National Security Council and the National Economic Council should lead implementation, honing flexible and innovative policy options for the president and playing a coordinating role across government to execute the strategy. At the legislative level, the presidential candidates should consider calling upon the next Congress to constitute a bicameral, bipartisan task force on industrial strategy implementation. The House Select Committee on China, HASC and SASC members, and supporters of the CHIPS and Science Act would be strong candidates for participation. America and its allies acting together present a formidable integrated economic and security edge that can counter China’s attempts to corner markets and coerce economically and militarily. The next president must make clear the nature of the threat and opportunity, pair it with a call to action, and offer pathways for every American, anchored in the industrial strategy that will guide America for the rest of the century. America’s future, and with it, global security, stability, and prosperity, depend on it.

Estonia mulls additional HIMARS buy, while talking with Lockheed competitors	A High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) from Alpha 'Able' Battery, 3-321st Field Artillery Regiment (FAR) from the 18th Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) lights up the night sky on Fort Campbell, Ky. (US Army) WASHINGTON — Estonia is weighing a second Lockheed Martin M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) order and has opened talks with other competitors to assess alternative platform options, according to the Baltic nation’s top weapons procurement official. 'We are expecting [HIMARS] deliveries next year, and we plan a follow on order,' Magnus Saar, Estonia’s national armaments director, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the AUSA trade show last week. 'Lately, our government decided to invest an additional €1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) to increase strategic sustainability&#8230;.a huge part of it' will be spent on HIMARS, he noted, before stressing that any new deal is dependent on delivery lead times and pricing from the US government. Speaking on background, a US State Department official told Breaking Defense that 'As a matter of policy, we do not publicly confirm or comment on proposed arms transfer cases until they have been formally notified to Congress. We refer you to the Estonians to speak to their defense procurement plans.' Lockheed Martin did not return a request for comment by publication. Estonia signed for six HIMARS in a package worth over $200 million in 2020 and which covers several rocket types that can reach a range between 70km and 300km, communications systems, training and logistics. First deliveries of the weapons system were scheduled to begin this year, but Saar’s reference to 'next year,' highlights a delay — an issue that looks to have drawn concern ahead of placing a new order. 'If the delivery times were long, we may need to substitute HIMARS munitions for something else, that’s available faster,' he added. 'We're having those discussions here [in Washington] to establish a clear picture of if we would make an order and how fast we could get it.' Talks with a number of non-US competitors have already taken place and include South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace pitching the K239 Chunmoo, Turkey’s Rocketsan offering Khan and Israel’s Elbit putting forward the Precise and Universal Launching System (PULS). And there may be more — Saar said he had 'probably neglected to mention a few' other competitors. Despite those conversations, the foundations for a follow on HIMARS acquisition appear to be relatively strong, even with the question mark over delivery times. In January, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania signed a trilateral agreement, 'which aims to create a framework for joint use' of HIMARS, according to a translated statement from Estonia's Ministry of Defence. Additionally, the US Army HIMARS unit in Estonia, Task Force Võit, frequently trains and collaborates with Estonian Defense Forces’ 1st Brigade and NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) Battle Group. In a more general sense, Tallinn has ramped up defense spending in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion, reaching a figure above 3 percent GDP this year — outperforming the 2 percent NATO target. The Baltic state plans on spending €3.5 billion on new 'armaments' over the next five years, according to the Estonian Centre for Defence Investments long term spending plan [PDF]. Over the next two years alone it has committed to layouts of €200 million for 155mm wheeled self propelled howitzers, €200 million for French Mistral Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and €200 million for new loitering munitions. As it looks to build up multi-layered air defense capabilities, Tallinn is also set to receive deliveries of German made IRIS-T SLM medium range ground-based air defense systems next year. 'NATO has taken steps to enhance air defense and improve situational awareness,' Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's Defence Minister said at the NATO Defence Ministers' Meeting in Brussels on 18 October. 'The imminent reopening of our Ämari base and the presence of Spain's NASAMS unit in Estonia are part of this air defense enhancement, which will soon be reinforced by our own IRIS-T systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/estonia-mulls-additional-himars-buy-while-talking-with-lockheed-competitors/	2024-10-21T07:02:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/8367481-scaled-e1719929733574.jpg
Army’s new Theater Information Advantage Detachments will be tailored to their theater: Officials	Staff Sgt.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) AUSA 2024 — One size doesn’t fit all in cyberspace. So the Army’s three planned Theater Information Advantage Detachments will deliberately undergo divergent evolution to better serve the specific commanders they’re attached to, officials said last week. 'One’s going to the Pacific, one’s going to Europe, and one’s going to Army Cyber [Command],' explained ARCYBER’s commander, Lt. Gen. Maria Barrett, in a packed briefing at the Association of the US Army’s annual conference dedicated to the information warfare teams. The newly designated units are designed to help commanders counter disinformation and other 'malign influence' interfering with Army operations. The TIAD assigned to US Army Pacific in Hawaii will stand up first, Barrett said. The official activation date is October 2025, although the service intends to get as many personnel in place as far ahead of that date as it can. The next TIAD to go live will be collocated with ARCYBER headquarters at Fort Eisenhower, Ga. (formerly Fort Gordon), and Europe will be last. Each TIAD will have 65 soldiers, but the US-based detachment will have a trans-regional focus and easy access to ARCYBER’s high-end technical capabilities, Barrett and other officials said, while the two forward-deployed TIADs will focus 'down and in' on their respective theaters and may need more soft-power assets such as foreign-language speakers. The European and Pacific detachments will probably end up diverging from each other, as well, for example in how they plug into the existing command structures. 'We've got to give a little bit of permission [for commanders to say] ’I want all of that coming through my G-38 [staff element]’ or ‘I want all this going through my theater fires element,’' Barrett said. 'I think that is going to play out in some of the exercises. &#8230; We saw this really with the MDTFs [Multi-Domain Task Forces] as well, how each one of the theaters really chose how to command and control' in its own way. That kind of customization is a contrast to the past generation of guerrilla warfare, where the Army deliberately created a few standardized types of 'modular' units that could replace each other on deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan with minimal reorganization or disruption. The TIADs, however, don’t even have a single standardized Table of Organization &amp; Equipment (TOE), Barrett told Breaking Defense after her briefing (though they do have a formally approved Initial Capabilities Document). Their core personnel will come from the 1st Information Operations Brigade, which had been providing specialists in 'military information support operations' (formerly known as psyops) to commanders on an as-needed and ad hoc basis. But the TIADs will add other specialties such as cyber/electronic warfare and languages, she explained, and they’ll embed these experts in their assigned HQs on a permanent basis so commanders can better understand their capabilities — and customize them to their campaign plans. 'It's going to be up to the commander how they're organizing their campaign, what kind of effects they want to have, and what the planners come up with,' Barrett told the AUSA audience. A key aspect of this customization is focus. 'We are not trying to boil the ocean and figure out who’s doing what to whom globally,' said Aaron Pearce, a civilian expert on Barrett’s staff. Instead, he said, the TIADs will specifically look at misinformation, propaganda, and other 'malign influences' affecting the specific commander, theater, and forces to which they’re assigned. Then they can counter it at the commander’s discretion, he went on — whether that means simply exposing the lies, aggressively 'naming and shaming' the perpetrators, or bringing in 'technical means' to hack the adversary’s social media accounts, botnets, and troll farms. Information is a vital tool for military targeting, planning, and other functions, Pearce emphasized, but it can also be a weapon in its own right. 'We also need to start fighting with that information,' he said. 'Information has to be a component of the commander's scheme of maneuver and scheme of fires.' 'Last year, the Combined Arms center published ADP-3-13, the doctrine for information advantage,' Barrett said. 'Now we have a framework for how to think about those things, but the doctrine isn't good enough [by itself]. We've got to have some structure to support this as well… a Theater Information Advantage Detachment.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/armys-new-theater-information-advantage-detachments-will-be-tailored-to-their-theater-officials/	2024-10-21T05:58:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241017_DVIDS_soldier_computers_7758907-scaled-e1729191253630.jpg
The wings of the M437 take flight after being developed in a fully connected digital ecosystem	The wings for Scaled Composites Model 437 Vanguard technology demonstrator were designed and built by Northrop Grumman in a fully connected digital thread. (Northrop Grumman photo) Northrop Grumman revealed the future of aircraft engineering with the first flight of a technology demonstrator sporting a pair of wings designed and built in a fully connected digital thread. The wings were integrated with Scaled Composites Model 437 Vanguard that took flight in late August. This wasn’t just another first flight, though, as it demonstrated the validity of an end-to-end digital ecosystem that Northrop Grumman calls Digital Pathfinder that paves the way for faster and more affordable aircraft engineering and manufacturing. 'As we pivot toward a near-peer competitor that is increasingly enabled by technology, we must deliver high-tech, high-end solutions within tighter timelines. Digital engineering makes that possible,' said Sarah Beaudin, director, Digital Pathfinder at Northrop Grumman. 'Without digital capabilities, developing systems at the cutting edge of technology would be far slower. 'Our digital environment provides near-real-time visibility, creating a single source of truth. This allows us to adopt a shift-left approach — iterating everything from design through sustainment as early as possible in the program. By the time we actually start building things, we’ve already got it right.' The Digital Pathfinder (DPF) team, spanning Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary Scaled Composites, was tasked with developing a clean-sheet aircraft design and production of a multi-mission, low-cost attritable aircraft using a fully connected digital thread from the onset. Northrop Grumman led the design, build, and manufacturing of the aircraft’s removable wing assemblies using advanced digital tools and processes. Scaled Composites handled aerodynamic and structural analysis, fuselage and empennage fabrication, aircraft assembly, systems integration, and the ground and flight tests. Together, the DPF team delivered quantifiable benefits – reducing costs, accelerating timelines and improving quality. For example, engineering rework on the wings was less than 1 percent, compared to a more typical 15-20 percent for a first-time build. Additionally, the design, build, and testing of the DPF wings was accomplished with less than 2 percent of schedule erosion. Digital ecosystem of the future Ultimately, the platforms and systems created in the digital environment must take solid form and take flight – like the M437. Typically, that involves fabricating parts from aluminum and composite materials. Now, digital engineering enhances these processes with additive manufacturing and determinate assembly. 'Digital Pathfinder had three major manufacturing elements,' said Eric Barnes, a Northrop Grumman Fellow and additive manufacturing expert. 'First, we integrated suppliers into the digital transformation collaborative toolset, enabling the ‘shift-left’ approach. This was a game-changer in many ways. 'The other two aspects were determinate assembly and additive manufacturing. To perform determinant assembly effectively, we need to push digital collaboration down to our suppliers, integrating them into our digital toolsets.' Determinate manufacturing designs components from different manufacturers in a shared digital ecosystem. This ensures that when the parts come together on the factory floor, they do so with minimal tooling and adjustment. In traditional manufacturing, for example, aircraft ribs and skins would arrive at the factory floor without fastener holes, requiring tooling to align the pieces before drilling. The process is both time- and cost-intensive and prone to errors, leading to scrap and rework. In determinate manufacturing, however, the exact location for fastener holes are pre-determined in the digital design. When the components arrive on the shop floor, they align perfectly, allowing technicians to quickly install fasteners without rework. Additive manufacturing is also revolutionized by digital engineering. Suppliers, OEMs, and customers can collaborate in real-time to create shared designs, which are then fabricated layer by layer using 3D printing technology. Northrop Grumman has invested more than $100 million in additive manufacturing, inventing new processes along the way. 'We have multiple patents associated with this continuous fiber additive manufacturing cell,' said Barnes, who led several of those innovations. 'One of these patents allows machines to switch between materials, laying down continuous fiber composites in true 3D form. This enables us to align fibers with load directions, producing lighter, stronger structures with less material.' Collaboration is king in a digital world Manufacturing in a digital ecosystem not only enhances collaboration within an enterprise, as we’ve seen between Scaled and Northrop Grumman, but also brings together project offices, primes, subcontractors, customers,and suppliers into the heart of the production process – from research and development to sustainment. Stakeholders can easily collaborate in a digital ecosystem because they have direct access to the same single source of truth. That provides a common view of requirements from top-level system capabilities down to component-level parts. When changes occur through the Change Control Board, which always includes customer representation — whether it’s a product improvement, evolving threats, or a design change for producibility or sustainability — those changes flow across the fully-connected digital ecosystem. 'Being connected in the digital ecosystem throughout our development lifecycle, we all can immediately see the impact of changes on top-level requirements, test requirements, and sustainment of the system,' said Beaudin. 3D digital design models, including virtual and augmented reality representations, are available for internal stakeholders, as well as customers to view. The models allow users to simulate tasks such as refueling an airplane or reloading weapons, and high-fidelity system performance simulations are also included. 'Many of these simulations are validated models of environments and threat scenarios,' said Beaudin. 'The integrated DoD-industry team can assess system performance and collaborate on design trades to optimize for real-world conditions.' When Northrop Grumman tests systems, whether through virtual models or physical hardware, the results are visible in near real-time via dashboards. Thanks to the company’s digital thread, any deviation from the customer’s requirements can be identified and addressed quickly. Scaling across the enterprise The Digital Pathfinder team is small, agile, and empowered to take leaps ahead in methods of testing and stressing the integrity of the digital thread. While its first tangible output was a set of wings and a new technology demonstrator, the important output was the building of a team that can now operate efficiently and effectively in the digital space and, most importantly, be exported and replicated across the enterprise to include current and future programs of all sizes. 'Digital Pathfinder enabled us to integrate and optimize our digital systems, boosting productivity and minimizing wasted time,' said Beaudin, adding that the digital readiness implementation team is now working with both capture and current programs to assess their ability to operate in a fully-connected digital ecosystem and helping them make the necessary changes to transition. 'The digital thread that is connecting our tools and the digital systems engineering process embedded in our models are scalable to large programs, and the lessons learned are going to pay huge dividends,' Beaudin said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-wings-of-the-m437-take-flight-after-being-developed-in-a-fully-connected-digital-ecosystem/	2024-10-21T05:28:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Northrop-Scaled-Composites-M437.jpg
Industry looking for what’s next after Army’s cancelation of next-gen Patriot interceptor	A Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) missile is launched during a successful Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) flight test at White Sands Missile Range in 2021. (Darrell Ames/Army) AUSA 2024 — The US Army this week announced it was cancelling plans to develop a next-generation interceptor for the Patriot air defense system, but executives from key air defense competitors largely shrugged off the news to Breaking Defense. Maj. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army’s program executive officer for missiles and space, on Monday announced the service's intent to walk away from the effort, called the Lower-Tier Future Interceptor (LTFI). Instead of buying a new interceptor, which Lozano called 'very expensive,' the Army will upgrade the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement currently made by Lockheed Martin, he told Defense News. Lockheed had been preparing to compete for LTFI, and as of Tuesday afternoon, the Army had not yet informed the company of its specific path forward for future PAC-3 upgrades, said Tim Cahill, executive vice president of the company’s missiles and fire control business. However, the decision didn’t catch Lockheed 'flat footed,' as it typically invests in future capability enhancements on PAC-3 and has technology 'waiting in the wings,' he added. 'There's budget challenges, and so future programs are always going to face some level of uncertainty relative to whether they're going to go forward or exactly how they're going to go forward,' Cahill told Breaking Defense. While the Army has not laid out which technology upgrades it could seek to transfer from LTFI to future PAC-3 production, Cahill said the company typically pursues improvements to solid rocket motors, seeker technology and lightweight materials — all of which can extend the range of the missile or improve its ability to detect targets. Raytheon, the prime contractor for the overall Patriot system, had also been developing concepts for LTFI, but will lose little sleep over its cancellation, said Tom Laliberty, Raytheon’s president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems. 'To be honest it doesn't really surprise me, only because funding has been — over the last several years — what I would call sort of conservative,' he said. Laliberty said Raytheon and other vendors likely had plans to test upgrades to existing weapon systems that could provide a cheaper way to do the mission LTFI was designed for. For example, in a recent demonstration in partnership with Northrop Grumman, the companies integrated Raytheon's Standard Missile 6 and Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor with Northrop's Integrated Battle Command System. 'We basically showed how effective SM-6 could be for a large portion of that threat set, that mission that potentially LTFI was also going to be addressing. So I don't know if that played into the decision, but my point is that there's other things out there,' he said. The Army’s senior leadership and program office made the decision to cancel LTFI after conducting a business case analysis of the effort, Lozano said in his interview with Defense News. He said the service would 'continue to advance' PAC-3 'so that it can remain relevant against the evolving threats,' but did not provide further information on the Army’s path forward.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/industry-looking-for-whats-next-after-armys-cancelation-of-next-gen-patriot-interceptor/	2024-10-18T11:45:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/pac-3-e1728400253523.jpg

New DoD space policy directive clarifies Space Force, Space Command roles	US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks (Photo by Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department today quietly published it's newest update to the document [PDF] that assigns roles and missions to both the Space Force chief and the commander of US Space Command, with language that should plump up each of their influence with respect to joint force activities. In particular, the new version of 'DoD Directive 3100.10' — dated Oct. 15 and signed by DoD Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks — for the first time codifies into Pentagon policy the three primary missions for which Space Force Guardians must be organized, trained and equipped to fulfill: The directive also officially establishes the assistant secretary of defense for space policy as the chair of the Space Warfighting Activities group. That group, stood up last September as a coordinating body, is described by the new directive as 'a forum to synchronize sensitive space activities with DoD strategic messaging, policy, and strategy.' 'DoD issuances generally aggregate and clarify signed guidance. As you know, this is a dynamic time for the space enterprise, and we are postured to continue to update our issuances as DoD policy evolution demands,' a DoD spokesperson told Breaking Defense today. The previous version of the directive was issued in August 2022. It replaced the 2016 version (itself an update of the original 2012 directive) to reflect the creation of SPACECOM and the Space Force, as well as the 2022 accord signed last year by SPACECOM and the National Reconnaissance Office regarding their roles in defense of the spy agency’s own satellites. DoDD 3100.10 is an internal Pentagon document, and as such it does not represent the end-all-be-all for DoD’s guidance in space. Different presidential administrations have promulgated other types of documents to guide DoD space policy over the years, in addition to National Space Strategy framework documents that capture the roles of other departments and agencies such as NASA. DoD policy is subordinate to any presidential policies and guidance. And yet, it serves as an important role, particularly when it comes to sorting out missions inside the department at a time when the demarcation lines between the Space Force and SPACECOM, as well as among the services, remain somewhat gray. The new directive for the first time includes a separate section on responsibilities of the chief of space operations (CSO), a job currently held by Gen. Chance Saltzman. The previous version included it within the responsibilities of the Air Force secretary. Besides establishing the Space Force's missions, it also puts into policy the CSO mandate as the 'integrator for DoD's Joint Space Requirements.' That role was first assigned to the Space Force chief in 2021 by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, prompted by concerns about service coordination with regard to space under the Pentagon's ambitious Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept. The previous version of the DoD space policy directive laid out five distinct responsibilities for the SPACECOM commander, currently Space Force Gen. Stephen Whiting. The new versionincreases that total up to nine. The four new taskings are: Perhaps the most important change included in the new DoDD 3100.10 language is that SPACECOM is now empowered not just to synchronize the space operations of the other combatant commands, but also ensure the various regional commands are not duplicating or even canceling out each other's battlefield actions. The language is also notable for the specific reference to 'offensive' as well as 'defensive' operations — the word offensive is not included in the 2022 version.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-dod-space-policy-directive-clarifies-space-force-space-command-roles/	2024-10-18T09:17:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/GettyImages-2160730520-scaled-e1723040734514.jpg
NRO speeding contracting to support commercial partners	Troy Meink, National Reconnaissance Office principle deputy director. (Photo: Theresa Hitchens/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) has been moving to speed its processes for acquiring commercial imagery in order to help support a robust US industrial base, according to the spy satellite agency's deputy. 'We continue to enhance our internal processes to award contracts faster, which industry likes, and to create more opportunity and great engage with new industrial partners. We are willing to go big on investments where it makes sense for success. The electro-optical contract we ordered a couple years ago, which is about $4 billion over 10 years, is an example,' Troy Meink, NRO's principal deputy director, told the Mitchell Institute Thursday. 'That said, we've got to make ourselves even easier to do business with, and we do that by accelerating investment decisions, again, trying to accelerate the timelines to support what the commercial companies are trying to do, and by adopting a wide variety of risk management strategies that allow us to use industry partners that we may not been able to in the past,' he added. Meink explained that tapping commercial innovation — in remote sensing, in launch, in data processing and in artificial intelligence/machine learning — is critical to helping the NRO meet one of its key challenges: keeping up with the pace of technological change. '[G]iven the threats we face, how fast that threat is evolving, how fast the demands for capability that not only the NRO, but the entire space industry, is seeing, requires a rate of change that's really faster than maybe, almost since the beginning, when we were doing Corona and those sorts of things,' he said. The Corona program, initiated in 1958, was one of the very first US spy satellite programs. The remote sensing satellites carried cameras that took pictures over the Soviet Union, then dropped film canisters that were captured mid-air by a specialized US Air Force plane. Meink stressed, however, that keeping ahead of the tech curve, and being able to rapidly deliver new capability to users, is a 'whole of government' effort, involving Congress and the Department of Defense — especially with regard to speeding acquisition processes. 'That's where we spend a lot of our time, is just working across all the people that are involved in how we do acquisition, how we deliver capability, to constantly push on driving delivery of new capability,' he said. When asked by Breaking Defense about progress in resolving the ongoing interagency debate on acquisition authority for space-based commercial remote sensing, Meink skirted the question. Instead, he made it clear that NRO sees its own role as already fairly well defined, versus that of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) — as well as the Space Force. 'I hate to say absolutes, right, because there are always exceptions to the rule. But in general, the NRO is responsible for procuring pixels. NGA is really looking at procuring analytics,' he said. 'Now, sometimes that does get blurred; there's no question about it, but that's fine. It should be, because in many cases, we're looking to different contractors. Some contractors do pixels, some do analytics. So, we work closely with NGA,' he added. 'But we do the pixels. They do the analytics.' While Meink didn't mention it, the Space Force also begun to buy the products derived from imagery analysis under its pilot Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Tracking (TacSRT) project. Just last month, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said the project had proved its value and that a next step is bolstering the budget — although he was very keen to clarify that the service is not treading on NRO's toes because it is not buying raw images. (He did not, however, reference NGA.) Further, US Space Command's Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell on Oct. 1 began expanding its remit from buying commercial space domain awareness data to include purchasing TacSRT data. The JCO director, Barbara Golf, has stressed that the cell is working closely with NGA to avoid duplicative data buys.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/nro-speeding-contracting-to-support-commercial-partners/	2024-10-18T08:23:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/IMG_2184-scaled-e1710791883564.jpeg
Lockheed anticipating Sentinel A4 full-rate production contract in coming months	Lockheed Martin is expected to go into full rate production of the the Sentinel A4 radar in mid-2025. (Photo provided by Lockheed Martin.) AUSA 2024 — Lockheed Martin is anticipating it will receive a request for proposals to advance the US Army’s Sentinel A4 radar into full rate production within the next six months, a company official told Breaking Defense. Chandra Marshall, vice president of radar and sensors systems at Lockheed, said today the RFP will follow the service’s recently approved justification and approval (J&amp;A) document being signed out. (A J&amp;A is an acquisition tool the Defense Department uses to explain and memorialize why certain contracts are awarded.) The Sentinel A4, which will replace Raytheon’s Sentinel A3, is a medium-range, air defense radar that uses active electronically scanned array (AESA) to track cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, helicopters, planes, rockets, and artillery and mortar threats. The Army is planning to purchase 240 radars for its program of record. Lockheed to date has delivered 10 units dedicated to government testing activities, and in July 2023 was awarded a low-rate initial production contract for 19 units, a portion of which are slated to be used for the defense of Guam, according to Marshall. The LRIP deliveries will start in the later half of 2025, she added. A full-rate production contract award signals that the Defense Department is satisfied with the radar’s performance and manufacturing methods, and gives Lockheed a green light to begin serial production. The radar is slated to be integrated with the Integrated Battle Command System, which represents the Army’s contribution to the Pentagon’s Joint All Domain Command and Control construct. Col. Jason Tate, the Army officer overseeing the program, told reporters last year during AUSA 2023 that the A4 is scheduled to reach initial operational capability in the fourth quarter of 2025. Tate and Marshall also said at the time that they had received expressions of interest from international customers in the radar. Marshall today re-iterated those expressions of interest but said no contracts had been signed yet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-anticipating-sentinel-a4-full-rate-production-contract-in-coming-months/	2024-10-18T07:48:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/F1D8360_SM-e1729092425334.jpg
Army watercraft readiness precipitously declined over past 4 years: GAO	A 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary) landing craft mechanized (LCM) transports a vehicle to the shore at Fort Story, Va., on Aug. 25.

Benjamin Parsons) AUSA 2024 — Readiness rates for the US Army's fleet of watercraft have steadily declined over the past four years, highlighting a significant weakness in the service’s ability to move personnel and equipment as it prepares for a fight in the Indo-Pacific, according to a new independent government audit. Army policies state that its equipment and assets, watercraft included, should aim for 90 percent of assets to be 'fully mission capable' — meaning they are prepared to execute their full range of missions at a moment’s notice. Not only is the Army failing at that target, its readiness rates dipped from from 75 percent in 2020 to less than 40 percent this year, the Government Accountability Office stated in its report, released today. 'Army officials stated that these low mission capable rates, along with the smaller size of the watercraft fleet after divestment, hinder operational readiness and the ability to meet mission requirements,' the GAO writes. The watchdog examined the service’s watercraft readiness at the behest of a congressional direction included the 2023 annual defense policy bill. Although the service told auditors that it is developing a watercraft modernization strategy aimed at projecting a future fleet in the 2030s and 2040s, GAO found it is 'unclear' what mitigation is in place in the meantime to improve the service’s readiness. 'Moreover, the Army has struggled to address a series of longstanding maintenance challenges with its watercraft fleet. Using handwritten systems to manage maintenance has adversely affected the fleet’s readiness,' the GAO report stated. 'For example, as of May 2024, one vessel had been out of service for over [five] years. Army officials reported several factors contributing to significant delays, including maintenance work.' As part of its report, GAO made four recommendations that focus on Army leadership in Washington as well as operational commanders in the Indo-Pacific taking a variety of action to mitigate the ongoing readiness issues. Responding on behalf of the service, Secretary Christine Wormuth concurred with GAO’s recommendations. A table from the GAO's report on Army watercraft shows the annual drop in mission capable rates. (GAO) The GAO’s report comes the same week that Army leadership at the annual AUSA exposition aggressively argued the service's importance to the Pentagon’s broader strategy for fighting in the Indo-Pacific — a place where watercraft and moving troops and equipment around in them will be integral to winning a future conflict. Gen. Charles Flynn, commander of US Army Pacific, told attendees at AUSA on Monday that the service is now making an effort to repair its watercraft forward, similar to how the Navy does ship repairs and maintenance in Japan. 'We’re trying to fix these watercraft forward in Japan, in the Philippines and Australia and Guam,' he said. 'We were bringing our watercraft all the way back to the continental United States, in some cases, on the west coast and through the Panama Canal for the East Coast, just to fix the watercraft.' 'Army watercraft is a system,' he continued. 'It’s tugs, it’s cranes, it’s connectors, it’s bridges. These systems, we have to have them forward, but we have to actually have them out in the Pacific operating.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-watercraft-readiness-precipitously-declined-over-past-4-years-gao/	2024-10-18T05:55:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/230130_DVIDS_LCM_2184553-scaled-e1675099483811.jpg
The connected warrior will have a common operating picture even when contested	Soldiers participate in Saber Junction in Hohenfels, Germany, Sept. 13, 2024. The exercise is designed to assess readiness to execute unified land operations in a joint, combined environment and to promote interoperability with participating NATO allied and partner nations. Photo credit: Army Sgt. Joskanny Lua. As the Defense Department pursues new ways to share data across echelons and security domains, the role of the 'connected warrior' continues to evolve from that of command-driven warfighters to warriors with access to relevant data that enables them to make informed, operational decisions in the absence of direct orders from command posts. Not an easy undertaking as doing so requires creating a base level for data security and management so communications and intelligence can be shared with maneuver forces to create a common operating picture (COP) of their individual battlespaces. 'Persistent issues seen across all levels include translating classified data for sharing among diverse services, organizations, and coalition partners,' said Chadwick Ford, team lead for Army Connected Battlespace Capabilities at Collins Aerospace. 'Managing data security across various levels and enclaves, alongside creating a unified COP and maintaining connectivity in degraded environments while on the move, remains a formidable challenge.' Chadwick Ford is team lead for Army Connected Battlespace capabilities at Collins Aerospace. It’s a challenge, though, that Collins Aerospace is actively addressing. Its execution of the connected warrior concept includes not only basic battlefield communication and movement, but an understanding of the broader operational situation and one's specific role is critical. In contested environments, it’s not about having constant connectivity but having timely access to relevant data for informed decision-making. 'The decentralized command structure of the United States military is a key strength,' said Ford. 'Whether leading a task force, air assault unit, or maneuver force, commanders wield authority within defined constraints, managing units effectively and maintaining connectivity, even without continuous communication with higher headquarters. 'Ultimately, connected warriors possess a deep understanding of their role within the operational context, enabling effective mission execution despite communication challenges. They're best suited for informing the capability testing we conduct in the theaters where they operate. They’re the driving force behind a lot of the work we do.' As an example of that, Collins recently partnered with the Army’s 1st Multi-Domain Task Force at U.S. INDOPACOM's Valiant Shield exercise to demonstrate the best way to enable a unit to take command and control (C2) capabilities from a fixed site and quickly integrate them onto a ground vehicle for more resilient, distributed C2. Access to a variety of intelligence sources was provided by commercial and military communications networks. Battle management software using artificial intelligence and machine learning 'made sense' of the data from various sources. That created fused situational awareness that was shared with bilateral and joint force partners. The mission command on-the-move capability significantly enhanced C2 operations by seamlessly integrating with networks such as the Integrated Tactical Network, Joint Fires Network, and commercial networks,' said Ford, noting that it facilitated quick transitions between fixed and mobile sites during multi-domain operations, enhancing both survivability and situational awareness. 'It is a roadmap for advancing the technology suite in successive large force exercise demonstrations that show how the capability can scale to connect more networks and provide joint and coalition forces with a more decisive edge in the early stages of a conflict.' From identifying issues to deploying solutions Developing a rapid transition between fixed and mobile sites during multi-domain operations extends far beyond the normal complexity of procurement and the standardization of equipment. Given the emerging role of AI, cloud computing, commercial 5G, and Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite communications capabilities, the aperture of today’s battlespace is being greatly widened and with it the need for clearly defined objectives and requirements. Tackling this challenge is not necessarily about building interfaces between systems. That’s part of the solution but it only addresses the hardware challenge. 'To effectively move from identifying problems to implementing solutions in the development of a COP, the DoD and its industrial partners must adopt a strategic approach,' said Ford. 'This begins with clearly defining operational objectives and requirements for the COP across all military echelons and domains. 'Close collaboration through joint working groups, consortia, and research agreements is essential to address specific COP challenges. Incentivizing innovation within the industrial base with grants, funding opportunities, and contracts focused on COP development promotes creative problem-solving and rapid prototyping.' That includes embracing agile development practices to quickly respond to evolving operational needs and technological advancements. Standardization also plays a role in interfaces and data formats that enable interoperability and information exchange for the real-time decision-making capabilities mentioned earlier. In addition, exercises like Valiant Shield and the Army’s Project Convergence play an important role in validating the effectiveness of COP solutions by providing critical feedback for further enhancement. It is through these strategies that the DoD and its industrial partners can progress from identifying issues to actively developing and deploying solutions that optimize COP across domains. The primary challenges in creating a unified and coordinated approach across the DoD lie in the scale of the task, the time required to implement the necessary changes to existing programs, and the prior investments made in stove–piped capabilities that now must become a node in Joint All Domain Command and Control, for example. Transitioning from identifying problems to implementing solutions represents an enormous challenge for the DoD and its industrial partners, calling as it does for a focused approach on standards for data and connectivity. Seamlessly harmonizing programs requires connectivity across various platforms, be they mounted, dismounted, crewed or uncrewed. Resolving these issues will require a phased approach and a commitment of time to implement comprehensive solutions. 'It’s analogous to not having Apple CarPlay in your car,' said Ford. 'Without it, connecting to Apple CarPlay becomes nearly impossible without resorting to expensive aftermarket solutions, which may not guarantee success.' It’s clear that providing soldiers with a common operating picture will help them function independently and execute commander’s intent when communications are contested. 'These are complex problems we are solving, and it takes partnership between DoD and industry to solve them, and incentivizing innovation within the industrial base with grants, funding opportunities, and contracts focused on COP development. That promotes creative problem-solving and rapid prototyping,' said Ford.' In the reach toward a common operating picture, questions such as: how data is transformed into intelligence; how it’s protected and shared; and how decisions are made and by whom and at what speed, become crucial to the transformative journey that the DoD must take to counter great-power adversaries. While pilot programs and demonstrations provide the necessary feedback for operational and technological advancements, connectivity and interoperability ultimately succeed or fail in the theater of operations. In the military context, there are evident issues with connection, data flow, and information exchange across services, complicating effective communication even within the same service echelons. While the technology exists, the scale of the challenge necessitates concerted effort, resources, and funding from multiple individuals and service branches. 'Integration is crucial,' notes Ford. 'A focused approach on standards for data and connectivity is essential to harmonize programs seamlessly. Depending solely on a single program manager is impractical, particularly across diverse military branches. 'Addressing this challenge is undeniably formidable, but it requires incentivizing individuals and organizations to collaborate and innovate towards solutions. Without such collective motivation, this connectivity issue will persist indefinitely.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-connected-warrior-will-have-a-common-operating-picture-even-when-contested/	2024-10-18T05:24:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/DOD.mil-image-Collins-240913-A-VS161-2582M-scaled.jpg
Commerce Department eases export controls on satellites, including for remote sensing	Northrop Grumman SpaceLogistics MEV-1 On-Orbit Servicing Satellite (Northrop Grumman image) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department today announced a tripartite set of export reform rules for a variety of commercial space technologies — including the removal of licensing restrictions on sales of remote sensing satellites and on-orbit servicing platforms to Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. A senior Commerce official emphasized that 'this isn't just a regulatory update' in a background briefing with reporters today. 'This is about maintaining our leadership in space technology, protecting our national security and bolstering our partnerships around the world.' The export control changes also will bolster national security, allowing the Defense Department to more easily cooperate with allies and partners to implement its ambitious plans to create a 'hybrid space architecture' that would enable commercial and friendly government satellites to augment US military space capabilities. 'The three new rules &#8230; recalibrate our approach to export controls. They're easing restrictions on some of the less sensitive space related technologies and on spacecraft related items going to our closest allies, like Australia, Canada and the UK. These changes will offer relief to US companies and they'll increase innovation without compromising the critical technologies that keep our nation safe,' the Commerce official said. The first rule removes 'licensing requirements' remote sensing satellites carrying electro-optical cameras and radars, as well as satellite systems 'providing space based logistics, assembly or servicing spacecraft that are destined for Australia, Canada and the UK,' the official said. The second change removes license requirements for exports of 'certain spacecraft components to over 40 allies and partners across the globe' — for example, including members of NATO and the European Union — easing exports of 'the least sensitive components for most destinations, and broadening license exceptions,' the official explained. A key goal of this change is to bolster and broaden NASA cooperative programs. Finally, the official said, third rule change is still in the proposal stage and is being published alongside a corresponding State Department export reform proposal in the Federal Register for public comment through Nov. 22. The changes imposed by the third rule would 'transfer jurisdiction of certain space-related defense articles that no longer provide a critical military or intelligence advantage' from the US Munitions List, embodied in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) managed by the State Department, to the Commercial Control List, managed by the Commerce Department via the less restrictive Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The proposed list shift is designed 'to account for advances in technology and the changing operational environment and to facilitate international cooperation and commercial space activities while continuing to protect our national security and foreign policy interests,' the official aid. Some examples of things that would be moved from the Munitions List include 'spacecraft that conduct collision avoidance, spacecraft that perform cooperative docking or grappling, and spacecraft for autonomous detection and tracking a ground vehicles and aircraft,' the official said. Commerce and the State Department back in 2019 published advanced notices of proposed rulemaking on plans for licensing reform, seeking industry input. Last December the National Space Council tasked Commerce and State to reform space export controls. Chirag Parikh, executive secretary of the National Space Council, told the annual Space Foundation Space Symposium on April 9 that the changes were needed because the last round of reforms took place more than decade ago and technology, all around the world, has since rapidly evolved. 'With today's updates to our export controls, the United States is taking a bold step forward in fostering a strong space industrial base,' he said in a statement today. 'These changes will strengthen international alliances and reflect America’s commitment to innovation and leadership in space.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/commerce-department-eases-export-controls-on-satellites-including-for-remote-sensing/	2024-10-17T14:35:41-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/SpaceLogisticsMEV-1-e1668472106987.jpg

Australian Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg on domestic weapons production and new vehicles	An armed reconnaissance &#8216;Tiger' helicopter from the 1st Aviation Regiment fires a Hellfire missile during Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2022. (Australian Ministry of Defence) WASHINGTON — America's largest defense conference, the annual gathering of the Association of the US Army, brings in a reliable international presence for the conference, including a sizeable contingent from Australia. Among the top officials making the trip to Washington for the conference was Australian Army Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg, the service's head of Land Capability, a role that sees him provide acquisition requirements for the service. Vagg, who was the top military officer on Australia's recent Defense Strategic Review, talked with Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the conference. Among the topics discussed: lessons of Ukrainian artillery, Boxer troop carrier production, the future of the Tiger ARH helicopter, the new Redback Infantry Fighting Vehicle and more. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Breaking Defense: Let's start with Boxer. How is that program progressing? MAJ. GEN. RICHARD VAGG: As you know, we've got our Block One vehicles in service now. We took delivery of the first Australian-built Boxer in July and we are working with the company (Rheinmetall Defense Australia) to work out what the drum beat of vehicles is going to be. &#8230; We're expecting to receive the Boxer between now and 2028, 2029, over that period. 211 vehicles in total will be our Boxer fleet. Plus the 100 vehicles that we're doing the government-to-government deal back into Germany with. [Australia is also building 100 Boxers to be exported to Germany.] How many are you expecting to have by the end of the year? I'm not sure at this stage. Are you comfortable with everything being on track with Initial Operating Capability and Full Operating Capability? I'm comfortable. We know we've got a really good capability. What about the Redback Infantry Fighting Vehicles, made by Hanwha in Australia. I know it's still early days, but how are you feeling about that? Any hiccups you're seeing early? No, we're really pleased, actually, with the relationship that we've developed with Hanwha &#8230; You know, they've recently opened what's called the Hanwha Armored Center of Excellence down in Geelong. That was opened ahead of time, below budget. So all the indicators are there — like the facilities and building a factory is generally pretty difficult. So, enjoying working with Hanwha and they've really established themselves in Australia. How's that relationship developing? Hanwha has just kind of blown up the last couple of years in Australia, in a good way. It's been a really good relationship. It's early days, yeah, so I don't want to sit here and say it's [always] going to be awesome, but all the indicators are really positive &#8230; What we hope is that actually establishes an ability to build an export base from Australia. If Hanwha can manage that, that would be really powerful. What's the plan for aviation as you bring down the the Tiger ARH helicopters? As you may well know, we're replacing our Tiger fleet with AH-64 Apaches. So we expect to receive our first Apaches by Q4 next year. We'll manage the phase out of the ARH capability Tiger with the introduction in the service of the Apaches. It's important that we maintain that capability, and the way we'll do that is, we currently have our attack aviation capability in Darwin. Apache will be delivered into Townsvile. So one aviation regiment will move from Darwin to Townsville, and as we introduce Apache, work up to an IOC capability, we'll close down Darwin and the capability with Tiger. What happens then to the Tigers? We will provide options for government in terms of what they want us to do with Tiger, when it comes out of service — everything from contributing to the global supply fleet, there may be gifting options there. It's probably too early to tell at this stage, and that'll be a government decision. Is there any military value in mothballing them, or does that just not make any sense for you? Cost of ownership becomes problematic for us. It's a really technical airframe here. It's effectively, I don't think it's the technical term, but it's like software defined radios. It's a software defined air system. It's not something you just lock in the shed and then roll it out at a later date. Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg spoke with Breaking Defense during the 2024 AUSA conference. (Australian Army) You're an artillery guy by training. Are there lessons that are coming out of Ukraine and to a lesser extent Gaza that you feel are being successfully incorporated into your planning, or is there not as much relevance to those takeaways, because it's such a different situation in Australia? There's some really strong lessons that are coming out of out of all those theaters you've mentioned. And I think it underpins that what characterizes war, it's a battle of will and magic bullets don't exist. There is certainly a need for precision and really high-end weapon systems, but there's also a need for mass, relatively inexpensive weapon systems. A few years ago, people were starting to draw down their stocks. Now you can't buy 155 [shells] in the world, and we can't produce enough 155s. You can't produce enough propellant or explosive fill for those types of systems now. So I think some of those hard learned lessons from last conflicts are definitely coming forward in terms of us drawing those lessons into our theater, the Indo-Pacific, of what it means for us. We as an army, need to be prepared to conduct close combat. And we need to have all the capabilities that come with close combat. You mentioned 155s. How important is it for Australia to get a domestic capability for insensitive explosives? I think our government's been really clear. You just look at the investment they put into guided weapons and explosive ordnance in Australia. Air Marshal Leon Phillips is the chief of our Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordinance, very active in terms of establishing domestic capabilities. And look at some of the announcements that have been made recently in terms of the domestic production of NSM in Australia. I know we're looking at 155; it'll be crawl, walk, run. I don't need to say it's important — I think the government's actions, the amount of money and effort they've invested in that area makes that pretty clear. What about solid rocket motor production? Again, that's part of that ecosystem the GWEO group is starting to develop. We know some of the rate limiting factors to some of our long-range strike capabilities is access to motors. So that's something you think is important to have domestic production of? Bloody oath it does. And I think there's an active request for information with industry in terms of that capability being introduced into Australia, and how industry will go about dealing with that. Obviously, AUKUS is the biggest military modernization effort facing Australia. Are you at all concerned or seeing signs at all that some land projects or land modernization efforts might get delayed, pushed back, underfunded because that money is needed to go towards AUKUS instead? No, and I'm cautious in doing that. Our National Defense Strategy and our Integrated Investment Program have looked across our force structure and have prioritized capabilities and investment in capabilities to have an integrated force, and we're quite clear about not having an overly weighted force in one area. It's about an integrated force, and an integrated force is one where the five domains are thought about and integrated before they hit the objective. An integrated force is about combining and integrating those effects well before the objective, and much like a stool, once you remove one of those legs, it becomes uneven and wobbly. So, probably a long explanation, but you know, we've made some very, very considered decisions about our investment plans from a ADF perspective, and are quite comfortable where we're sitting in terms of our land projects.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/australian-maj-gen-richard-vagg-on-domestic-weapons-production-and-new-vehicles/	2024-10-17T13:47:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/arh_tiger-e1729194090907.jpg
Army aims for final draft of software mega-contract by Nov. 7	Jennifer Swanson, left, the deputy assistant secretary of the Army for Data, Engineering and Software, gives her remarks during the Engineer Hour Panel Discussion titled 'Army Engineers Making a Difference in Europe and the Pacific,' at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C., Oct. 11, 2023. (US Army photo by Pfc. Brandon L. Perry) AUSA — The Army's massive and much-debated 'modern software development' contract is headed for a third and final revision due out next month, officials told a standing-room-only audience here at the Association of the US Army conference Wednesday. Officially called the Multiple Award Indefinite Quantity Indefinite Delivery Contract for Modern Software Development, the proposal is now on its second major revision, incorporating significant changes suggested by contractors. Comment on this draft closes on Oct. 25, so service officials can try to get a final version ready for an industry day tentatively scheduled for Nov. 7. But if the draft isn’t ready, they’ll push the industry day back 'because it doesn’t make sense to have it without the last draft out,' said deputy assistant secretary for software Jennifer Swanson. 'Please, please, give us feedback,' she told the contractors packing the room. 'We are absolutely reviewing all of it, and I think you’ve seen probably some significant changes between the first draft and the second draft [already].' Swanson said the next draft will be the last 'because we have to call it at some point. We could do this forever.' The official Request For Proposals launching the competition will come out in December or early January, she said, but added, 'I pledge to you, I will not drop it on Christmas Eve.' The stakes are high because the 10-year 'multi-award' contract is meant as an umbrella to modernize a wide swathe of Army software programs, although not all. The initial competition next year would select a pool of preferred vendors, who would then compete for individual programs’ software needs as 'task orders' under the umbrella contract, with a maximum value of $10 billion. The service will have 'on-ramps' to bring promising new companies into the pool and 'off-ramps' to kick out underperformers, but getting in the preferred pool is still a huge advantage for a firm. But on reading earlier versions, many contractors grew worried about the details. In particular, critics charged the service plans to reinvent the wheel by developing bespoke software through cumbersome 'cost-plus' procurement processes, rather than simply buying proven commercial code at market rates and then making a minimum of necessary tweaks. In the recently released second draft, arguably the most significant change is that the Army now plans to give companies formal input into how to write the very contracts they’re competing for. 'We want industry to propose what contract type you think is best,' said Swanson. That’s a big deal. Normally, government officials decide, behind closed doors, what contract structure is best suited to their program. There’s a wide variety of options, but in simplified terms, there are two extremes. If they’re buying a product or service that already exists and for which there’s a commercial market, they’ll ask companies to bid a 'firm-fixed price.' If they’re asking industry to develop something uniquely military, they’ll ask for 'cost-plus' bids that allow companies to make a percentage of profit atop whatever their expenses end up being. Historically, though, officials decide which structure to use, and companies can take it or leave it. The revised language released Oct. 11, however, says that when companies submit a bid, they can also recommend a contract structure. The ultimate decision will still be up to the Army. But the service hopes that opening this avenue for input will alleviate industry concerns about blinkered bureaucrats saddling then with onerous and inappropriate procedures. Officials are already talking about some further changes they plan for the third revision due in November. For example, firms competing for a place in the preferred pool will be judged, in large part, by their performance on a 'tech challenge' — and the third draft will make it explicit that using AI-generated code on that challenge now counts as cheating. 'We had in the second draft that you could use GenAI tools to generate code for the tech challenge,' Swanson said. 'We’re going to take that out … I don’t want to evaluate your LLM; I want to evaluate you.' The third draft will also clarify other rules for the tech challenges, officials said, and incorporate industry input on performance metrics used to judge the winners. Service officials are even considering changing the contract's name to de-emphasize the contentious 'development' aspect. Roaming the AUSA conference, 'we had some candid conversations about the modern software — I’m not going to say ‘development’ — contract,' said Col. Matthew Paul, project manager for the service’s IPPS-A personal &amp; payroll system. 'I don’t like ‘development,’' he told the AUSA seminar. 'We’re crowdsourcing the name.' Paul’s not the only one. At the same panel, the head of the Army’s new Digital Capabilities Contracting Center of Excellence (DC3OE), Danielle Moyer, referred to it as 'the M-S-question-mark contract.' If, after all these changes in name and substance, a company still doesn’t like how this contract is written then they don’t have to compete for it, officials said — echoing recent statements by their boss, Army acquisition chief Doug Bush. 'You don’t have to play on this one,' said Young Bang, Bush’s principal civilian deputy and a former commercial software exec himself, standing up from the audience to speak during the panel. 'There are plenty of other contract vehicles out there. … This is just another tool, [developed] based on your feedback.' The initial competition to get into the preferred-vendor pool will be arduous and expensive, Bang and other officials acknowledged. But that’s on purpose, they said, because the hurdle should be high to get first shot at up to $10 billion in task orders over a decade. Is the effort worth the potential payoff? 'That's a business decision you have to make,' said Bang.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-aims-for-final-draft-of-software-mega-contract-by-nov-7/	2024-10-17T12:02:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8065934-scaled-e1729187142979.jpg
Army picking 2 cargo drones to pair with autonomous boats for Project Convergence 2025	A CH-47 Chinook helicopter, operated by soldiers with Bravo Company, 3-238th General Support Aviation Battalion, 28th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, flies over an airfield in the 28th ECAB's area of operations in the Middle East. (US Army/Sgt. Eric Smith) AUSA 2024 — Cargo aerial drones and autonomous boats will team up at next year’s Project Convergence capstone exercise to help the service flesh out future operating concepts and drive investment decisions, according to a senior Army leader. 'We're going to have to figure out how to resupply dispersed formations,' Brig. Gen. Shane Upton, the director for the Contested Logistics Cross Functional Team, told Breaking Defense on Tuesday. 'The Pacific, by nature, drives you to that. There's no other option if you start putting a Multi Domain Task Force lethal firing asset on a remote island chain, I have to resupply them with ammo and we may not be able to fly a traditional C-17 or C-130 in there,' the one-star general added. 'The enemy will be like: &#8216;You're not using that port because I just shot it up and it's gone.'' To evaluate the ever-evolving drone market, the service issued a request for information from industry for their heavy-lift options. Upton said 24 companies came back with options that ranged from flying prototypes to more developmental ideas. Based on that feedback, the Army has now picked two drones to participate in its Project Convergence Capstone 5 event next year, though Upton remained mum on which companies will be flying since they still haven’t been notified. He did, however, disclose that those heavy-lift drones can ferry roughly 1000 pounds up to 300-400 nautical miles. The plan now, in part, is to use those two different drones along with autonomous boats, to look at logistics options inside the Pacific theater and other parts of the world. 'It’s looking at using them together. &#8230; None of the solutions that we're going to develop for the Army are going to be just for the Pacific, they've got to work in Europe,' Upton said. 'The money they do give us is a lot of money, but you [have] got to be able to buy things and still scale to the requirement you need. We need smaller, movable boats. We need these drones to be able to move that cargo, and you're not going to be able to spend $50 million, $60 million or $70 million per drone to do this,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-picking-two-cargo-drones-to-pair-with-autonomous-boats-for-project-convergence-2025/	2024-10-17T10:28:24-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/6512537-scaled-e1649039835342.jpg
RTX to pay $950 million to resolve federal charges of fraud, bribery	The RTX chalet at the 2023 Paris Air Show shows off both the rebranded company name and its older Raytheon Technologies title. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Defense and aerospace giant RTX agreed to pay more than $950 million to settle a list of charges that include defrauding the US government and bribery of foreign officials, the Justice Department announced Wednesday. In separate instances in 2013 and 2018, RTX — then known as Raytheon — provided fraudulent information to the Defense Department, leading it to award foreign military sales contracts for the Patriot air defense system and an unspecified radar system worth over $111 million more than the company should have been paid, the Justice Department said. RTX also admitted that company officials schemed to bribe a high-level Qatari air force official from 2012 to 2016, with the goal of enabling Raytheon to win contracts from Qatar’s military, including a joint operations center that Raytheon would build for Qatar, the department said. RTX agreed to enter two separate three-year deferred prosecution agreements with federal courts in Massachusetts and New York, which require that the company retain an independence compliance monitor for that time period, improve its internal compliance processes and cooperate with any future criminal investigations. It also agreed to a separate False Claims Act settlement relating to the defective pricing schemes, the department said. 'Raytheon engaged in criminal schemes to defraud the U.S. government in connection with contracts for critical military systems and to win business through bribery in Qatar,' Kevin Driscoll, a deputy assistant attorney general with the Justice Department’s criminal division, said in a statement. 'Such corrupt and fraudulent conduct, especially by a publicly traded U.S. defense contractor, erodes public trust and harms the DOD, businesses that play by the rules, and American taxpayers,' he added. In a statement, RTX stated that it is committed to following global laws and regulations and noted that the unlawful behavior occurred before the merger of Raytheon and United Technologies Corp. in 2020. 'RTX is taking responsibility for the misconduct that occurred. We have worked diligently during the investigations to remediate that misconduct and continue to do so,' the company said in a statement. 'We are committed to working closely with the incoming independent monitor to improve and further enhance our ethics and compliance program.' The financial impact of the incident is consistent with the amounts disclosed in the company’s second quarter earnings report this year, RTX stated.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/rtx-to-pay-950-million-to-resolve-federal-charges-of-fraud-bribery/	2024-10-17T09:28:05-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/IMG_4982-scaled-e1687510332841.jpg
Offering policy advice for the next administration? Be realistic.	Former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris met for a debate in September. (ABC NEWS/MICHAEL LE BRECHT II) Election season is upon us, which means think tanks are beginning the quadrennial ritual of providing unsolicited advice to a new administration in the form of 'transition papers.' Scholars typically write these papers on a single topic within their area of expertise ('Bringing Peace to Gaza'), which the institution collects into volumes. The work benefits everyone in the ecosystem. A well-crafted transition paper might influence policy or even land the writer a senior governmental position, while think tanks exist to help produce better policy through research; transition papers offer the opportunity to do this with a vehicle aimed directly at the top. But are these papers actually useful to a new administration? And how are consumers to interpret them? The truth is that most 'transition papers' are actually op-eds, ignoring the political realities that administrations must deal with, and contain advice that is not actionable. Too often, they are self-indulgent fantasies and not useful to a new administration. As a veteran of the transition paper circuit, I’d like to offer some lessons learned from past efforts. These suggestions might help craft transition papers that are clearer about what they are doing and, ultimately, make their products more useful to a new administration. From the outside, all transition papers look like serious efforts to help a new administration take power and govern effectively. The papers are largely well-crafted and written by people who know what they're talking about. A key problem, however, is that many, even most, authors can't decide on the purpose of their writing. One purpose is to give advice that the new administration might use. This requires acknowledgment of that administration's campaign promises and ideological beliefs. For the half of the think tankers who might have voted for the incoming president, this is a comfortable exercise: They generally support the new administration’s platform, they often know campaign officials and can strongly believe in the advice they are giving. However, even transition papers written by ideologically aligned scholars will not be helpful to a new administration if they don't consider the administration's campaign promises and political circumstances. Campaign promises might sometimes appear exaggerated or unrealistic to outsiders, but the new administration's political advisors will want to satisfy whatever elements of their coalition supported the promise. Further, democracy is about the division of power, and unless the administration is lucky enough to solidly control both houses of Congress, it must shape its proposals into something that Congress might pass. To be useful, transition papers must acknowledge this, even if it means modifying preferred policies. The other problem is that roughly half of the electorate will have voted for the losing candidate. That means that many think tank scholars face a gap, often a wide gap, between their personal beliefs and those of the incoming administration. How to bridge that gap? One approach is to ignore the gap and write what the author thinks the new administration should do. But that’s not a policy paper, that is an op-ed. There's nothing wrong with an op-ed: The media are full of them, and they are a valid way of putting out ideas to influence the electorate and the policy community. They are the think tank's bread and butter. However, being inconsistent with the new administration’s views, they don’t 'transition' anything. Better to call these op-eds and dispense with the transition paper label. Another approach is to seek common ground. That's attractive in theory but difficult in practice because it means compromising many core beliefs to find agreement with an administration that the writer does not support. A personal story captures the difference between the two approaches. Trump's election in 2016 was a shock to the DC think tank community, which had generally believed that Clinton would win. Nevertheless, work on transition papers went forward. I talked with another staff member about doing a paper on energy. Trump had expressed skepticism about climate change and the previous administration's plans for dealing with it, so I suggested finding some common ground. For example, the Department of Defense had done analysis showing that there was tremendous payback for upgrading heating and air conditioning systems. DoD had 285,000 buildings, many with old, inefficient systems. The investment aspects (payback within three years) might be attractive to a Trump administration, while the reductions in carbon emissions would appeal to environmentalists. Could we write a paper together and identify some bipartisan common ground? Many Republicans were looking for a middle way that did something for the environment without going full 'Green New Deal.' No, my colleague responded, the Trump administration should sign the Paris Climate Change Accords, set aggressive targets for fossil fuel transition, and subsidize sustainable fuels. I replied that they had campaigned against those actions. Doesn't matter; it is what they should do. So, the resulting paper might have been ideologically pure, but it was useless for influencing Trump administration policy. Given the fierce competition in the 'marketplace of ideas,' think tanks sometimes 'jump the gun' by publishing before the election to gain much sought-after visibility. However, with the election results unknown, papers must be written without referencing the new administration's beliefs or the political environment in which it must operate. In this indeterminate space, it is easy to drift into writing vague policy platitudes: 'Redouble efforts to find a just and lasting peace in the Middle East.' (Would we ever want an unjust and temporary peace?) 'Strengthen the U.S. position in the Pacific through smart diplomacy.' (As opposed to stupid diplomacy?) 'Encourage NATO allies to meet and exceed the two percent of GDP military spending target.' (Having allies spend more has been a US goal for 70 years.) Alternatively, these papers can take a descriptive approach, analyzing challenges ahead and what decisions will need to be made. By leaving out recommendations, the papers are bipartisan, helping whichever party wins. However, the descriptive approach makes them background papers rather than transition papers —research material for developing a policy paper. The Congressional Research Service, an arm of the Library of Congress, is good at this. They describe an issue and pose questions for Congress rather than recommendations. For most think tank writers, leaving out recommendations and references to their preferred policies is difficult in Washington’s highly partisan environment. Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 (technically 'A Mandate for Leadership') is unique in the transition paper ecosystem. Even think tanks with close ideological ties to a candidate are usually separate from the campaign. What made Project 2025 unique was having so many former Trump appointees participate. In April, Trump referred to it positively: 'They’re going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do.' That gave it the aura of being a campaign document, not independent advice. Indeed, Heritage initially encouraged that kind of thinking. Now, the project has become a political liability because it laid out policy specifics. Campaigns rarely describe trade-offs or identify losers should they win. Project 2025 did that. They were quite correct that governing requires tough decisions ('to govern is to choose'), but campaigning does not. What can think tanks learn from this? As attractive as close alignment with a candidate might be, think tanks need to provide campaigns with a gap for plausible deniability. Campaigns must be able to say, 'We appreciate all inputs and will consider them at the proper time.' Once the election is over, think tanks can gather specific scholars and former government officials who might be closely aligned with the candidate and provide something that links closely with the now pending administration. That work might begin before the election but should never be published before the election. Campaigns might conclude from the Project 2025 experience and the lack of usefulness in most transition papers that they should develop the papers themselves, soliciting them from supporters, former administration officials, and the party faithful. Such papers would be non-public and ideologically aligned with the campaign. Unfortunately, transition papers are much harder to write than many people think. For all the problems that think tank transition papers may have, they are written by experts who write on policy for a living. There is no substitute. Another personal story is relevant here. Many years ago, my boss at the time was involved in a presidential campaign. He asked me to read the papers being sent to the campaign to help build a platform and, if the campaign were successful, set policy for the new administration. The papers were uniformly awful. Most were poorly written and displayed such single-minded advocacy that they were unhelpful, even when the authors knew what they were talking about and their ideas were aligned with the campaign, which was not always the case. None had the nuance that a campaign or administration needed. I don't think any made it to the candidate. The point here is not that transition papers are always useless. Indeed, they are arguably good for the nation. Administrations take office facing many challenges, yet it takes months to fully staff an administration with the many, many political appointees required under the US system — 57 Senate confirmed in DoD and 1200 government-wide. (Whether that is a wise system is another question entirely.) The point is that readers and think tank writers should be clear about what the transition papers represent. If writers want to have their ideas implemented (and themselves noticed by the new administration), the papers should address politics and campaign promises in addition to policy. Readers should recognize that while the papers represent thoughtful analysis and often exciting ideas, most are op-eds with little chance of swaying policy.

Army working with appropriators to iron out flexible spending plan	Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth observes soldier training in Grafenwoehr, Germany, on February 15, 2024. (US Army/Sgt. David Resnick) AUSA 2024 — As US Army leaders continue inking plans to request flexible spending pots for several broad groups of technology, the service's top two civilian leaders say that they are growing more optimistic about their chances of getting such a request across the line. The Army’s plan, at least right now, is to use the upcoming fiscal 2026 budget request to test the waters on a proposal to bundle dollars in three distinct categories — unmanned aerial systems, counter-unmanned aerial systems and electronic warfare — instead of requesting funds for specific systems. By doing this, service leaders say that they will be better able to keep up with the pace of changing technology and quickly pivot to what works. 'One of the challenges we face, of course, is that we live in a two-year forward-looking appropriation cycle, so it's very difficult to predict what technology might be available two years from now,' Army Undersecretary Gabe Camarillo told Breaking Defense in late September. In an interview with Breaking Defense on Wednesday, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said a key part of those 'active conversations' includes House and Senate appropriators to determine just what route they are most receptive towards. Part of the challenge there centers on lawmakers' reluctance to provide slush funds they can't control. And while there is no guarantee that Army leaders and appropriators strike a deal, Wormuth said she is 'cautiously optimistic,' which wasn’t the case nine months ago. On the floor of this week’s Association of the US Army conference, some industry executives expressed broad support for the Army plan — with a few caveats. 'I get what the Army wants to do,' Tom Laliberty, Raytheon’s president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems, told Breaking Defense. 'They're seeing the dynamic nature of the environment, and they're saying, this kind of single line item way of managing our money is really difficult, and it'd be better if we had things like counter-UAS as a topic. 'I can even see value to a company like Raytheon, where we can say, ‘Hey, we've got a really good idea. We just don't have the money to do it.’ … And they'd say, ‘Yeah, we agree with you. Here's the money,’' he said. However, the current system signals demand at a 'pretty precise level,' allowing prime contractors and their suppliers to make capital investments when sharp increases to production are slated to occur. Laliberty pointed to plans to increase production of its Coyote counter-drone interceptor from 40 to 100 units this year, which he said would not have happened without signaling from the Pentagon. 'Perhaps there's something in between,' where they have the ability to flex certain procurement dollars, 'but with certain guidelines,' he said. Tim Cahill, Lockheed Martin’s executive vice president for its missiles and fire control unit, said there’s nothing in the Army’s plan that would give him 'immediate concern,' at least in terms of how officials have described it so far. 'You wouldn't try and apply that to the big munitions programs, for example, because that would put a level of uncertainty that I think would be detrimental to us continuing to drive investment, and draw the supply chain along with us. It would be almost the opposite of a multi year,' he said. 'But for some of the systems that — at least [I’m] hearing talked about and discussed — to me, I think that makes a lot of sense.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-working-with-appropriators-to-iron-out-flexible-spending-plan/	2024-10-17T08:05:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Christine-Wormuth-scaled-e1729174908683.jpg
The TEASER Missile: Redefining the modern tactical battlefield	TEASER, Seeker-less, Automatically Guided Missile | Credit: IAI. A special forces unit navigates through a densely packed urban environment, under heavy sniper fire. Pinned down inside a small room of a building with limited options, the enemy is concealed within a high-rise position more than a kilometer away, dominating the surroundings with deadly precision. The unit must neutralize the threat quickly and continue their mission. One soldier, equipped with the TEASER missile, takes position. With a swift, stealthy launch, the soldier guides the missile with the TEASER-Sight to accurately strike the sniper’s position, clearing the way for the team to advance. This scenario, once fraught with peril and uncertainty, now demonstrates the decisive impact of the TEASER missile. The TEASER by Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) is a game-changer in individual assault missiles, creating a new category between low-cost unguided rockets and high-end, long-range guided missiles. Until now, the choices for individual assault missiles were limited. Soldiers had to rely on cheap, unguided rockets effective up to 200 meters or opt for sophisticated, expensive guided missiles designed for long-range targets. The TEASER creates a third category of a simple, cost-effective, guided solution capable of striking targets up to 2,500 meters away. This new category of missiles provides unprecedented value, combining affordability with advanced Automatic Command to Line of Sight (ACLOS) guidance technology. The TEASER missile stands out for its cost-effectiveness and ease of training. Unlike high-end guided missiles, which can be prohibitively expensive, the TEASER offers a budget-friendly alternative without compromising on performance. This affordability enables wider deployment among infantry units, enhancing overall tactical capabilities. The missile’s design incorporates true Fire-From-Enclosure (FFE) capabilities, opening new ways for soldiers to deploy devastating firepower from bunkers, buildings or behind cover. This feature provides significant tactical flexibility, enabling troops to maintain a low profile and avoid detection during engagements. TEASER can also be launched and operated from Remote Weapon Stations (RWS) on the soldier's command or strike beyond line of sight, guided by aerial vehicles. TEASER redefines the tactical battlefield with a true &#8216;Fire from Enclosure' (FFE) design | credit: IAI. A critical advantage of the TEASER missile is its guidance system, which operates independently of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In modern battlefields, electronic warfare and signal jamming are common, often disrupting GNSS-reliant systems. The TEASER’s reliance on external optical cues ensures it remains operational even in challenging combat zones, maintaining precision and effectiveness without revealing the launch location. Traditionally, guided missile systems require extensive training, impacting readiness and operational effectiveness. The TEASER missile, however, can be mastered in less than three days. Its intuitive design makes it as easy to use as a standard rifle, allowing any soldier to quickly become proficient. This rapid training cycle ensures that units remain combat-ready without the burden of long, complicated training programs. The TEASER missile employs a secure, narrow-band communication link between the operator and the missile. This ensures precise targeting with minimal risk of interception or detection. The system’s simplicity and reliability make it an ideal choice for modern infantry units. Measuring only 70 cm in length and 8.4 cm in diameter, it is easy to carry and deploy. Despite being so compact, TEASER has unmatched warhead-to-weight ratio, capable of destroying lightly armored targets and structures, providing significant firepower in a compact form. IAI’s reputation as Israel’s premier missile manufacturer is well-established. With over 40 years of experience in developing advanced missile systems, the company brings unparalleled expertise to the TEASER missile. This new addition to their arsenal reflects IAI’s commitment to innovation and excellence in defense technology. The TEASER missile is more than just a new solution; it represents a revolutionary step in tactical warfare. By offering a cost-effective, guided missile solution that can be quickly mastered and deployed, it empowers infantry units to respond swiftly and effectively to a wide range of threats. Whether in dense urban environments or open battlefields, the TEASER missile provides the tactical edge needed to ensure mission success and soldier safety. With its unique combination of affordability, ease of use, and tactical flexibility, the TEASER missile is set to become an invaluable asset and redefine the ever-evolving tactical battlefield. This revolutionary missile introduces a new category in individual assault missiles, delivering exceptional value and creating an unmatched tactical advantage. TEASER is set to redefine the standards of infantry combat, making advanced missile technology accessible and effective for today’s soldiers, ensuring they remain one step ahead of adversaries in the theater of war.

The Army’s ‘most challenging’ unmanned threat? Group 3 drones	Remain of Shahed 136 at an exhibition showing remains of missiles and drones that Russia used to attack Kyiv on May 12, 2023 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Oleksii Samsonov /Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) AUSA 2024 — As drone warfare proliferates in conflicts like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Army official tasked with forging plans to fend off drone attacks on troops sees mid-side uncrewed platforms as perhaps the biggest threat. 'Group 3 remains one of the most challenging threats we have in terms of the capabilities and then the payload that you’re talking about, as well as the reach,' Maj. Gen. David Stewart, the director of the Joint Counter-Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, said during a Monday panel at the AUSA conference here in Washington. (The Pentagon categorizes drones as belonging to five different classes, with Group 1 being the smallest and Group 5 being the largest.) Displaying a chart that mapped out the spectrum of unmanned threats ranging from Group 1 to Group 5 drones, Stewart explained that smaller drones fall under 'protection tasks,' or a problem that 'everyone is responsible for.' Essentially, since less sophisticated defensive systems are more appropriate for targeting smaller Group 1 and 2 drones, units should generally have their own capabilities on hand to defend against them. Moving along the chart toward larger, Group 4 and 5 systems, Stewart argued that these drones fall under an 'air defense mission,' or 'a mission that is seated with a commander in support of a [Joint Task Force] JTF commander, a combatant commander, and really aligns with a mission set.' These larger drones would be better handled by Patriot batteries or fighter jets, according to Stewart’s chart, which in turn requires higher levels of coordination since not every unit has that kind of equipment at their disposal. But Group 3 drones — with Stewart’s chart displaying a system that roughly resembles Iran's Shahed-136 used extensively by Russia in Ukraine — occupies a more vexing position that’s somewhere in the middle between the protection and air defense missions. These drones are large enough that they can carry considerable payloads and fly farther than smaller systems, and require capable interceptors to knock them down. Making the problem worse is that defensive interceptors are typically more expensive than the threats they’re destroying. For example, Stewart’s chart displayed key interceptors that can take out Group 3 drones like RTX’s Coyote and Anduril’s Roadrunner. But on a separate panel on Monday, Maj. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army’s program executive officer for missiles and space, argued that while it was good the Army ramped up orders of systems like Coyote, relying on them for the long term isn't sustainable. Highlighting a rough price tag of about $120,000 per Coyote, Lozano said, 'We’re not going to win that cost curve battle if all we do is deal with the threat kinetically.' The cost issue is well known to the Pentagon, and officials on both Monday panels emphasized the need for a layered defensive approach that incorporates kinetic and non-kinetic systems. Lasers in particular represent a holy grail for defensive tech, since they are relatively inexpensive to operate compared to kinetic systems. Beyond the need for cheaper intercept technology, integrating all available capabilities together 'remains a challenge for us,' Maj. Gen. Rich Harrison, commanding general of the 32nd Army Air and Missile Defense Command, said during the Monday panel with Stewart and other Army officials. The Pentagon has other needs to defend against the unmanned threat, according to Harrison. 'One of the most pressing,' he said, is detecting and targeting lower-class drones that have smaller radar cross sections. Since radar systems are typically tailored to tracking larger targets, smaller drones can sometimes slip through detection and 'blend into the clutter of the battlespace.' Fighting those drones isn’t always easy due to policy and legal limitations, particularly in urban settings Harrison said. And as adversaries find ways to make systems more resistant to interference from electronic warfare, services like the Army need to exploit cyber vulnerabilities in response, according to Harrison. With the threat of unmanned warfare only poised to accelerate, Harrison underlined that the military services need to undertake a bottom-up revamp. 'Our current air and missile defense training primarily focuses on traditional threats: aircraft, missiles and rockets. While these remain important, we must also shift focus to include UAS in our training programs at all levels of command,' he said. Looking ahead, Stewart said unmanned threats are no longer just coming from the air, requiring the DoD as a whole to anticipate how to defeat land- and sea-based systems. 'The Department is moving towards a counter-UXS, so that's air, sea and land, not just the air part,' he said. 'So when we wrap our arms around that as a department, we're really seeing that this uncrewed, unmanned threat is coming from all different areas.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-armys-most-challenging-unmanned-threat-group-3-drones/	2024-10-17T06:04:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230713_shahed_136_iranian_drone_GettyImages-1489472086-scaled-e1689283793586.jpg

Army about to formalize ‘micro-high altitude balloons’ as a new requirement for surveillance ops	The Army said micro–High-Altitude Balloons (microHABs) completed a Continuous Uninterrupted Relay Transmission Aerial Intelligence Network over a large distance as part of the Vanguard 24 exercise in September 2024. (PEO IEW&amp;S via LinkedIn) AUSA 2024 — The US Army is about to approve a new requirement for small high-altitude balloons for sensing deep inside enemy territory, according to a senior official. 'You'll see it as mHABs, a micro-high altitude balloon. Those are smaller and they carry less payload, but they're more transportable, so they're a little bit more tactical in nature,' Andrew Evans, director of the Army's Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) Task Force, told Breaking Defense today on the margins of the annual Association of the US Army Conference. 'So, imagine them being man-portable, potentially easier to launch from field conditions, potentially requiring less logistic support,' he said. A formal requirement paves the way for official acquisition of a new capability. According to an Army Space and Missile Defense Command fact sheet on high-altitude platforms [PDF], the land service is looking for a wide range of capabilities to suit both its own needs and help support multi-domain operations across the joint force. In particular, the service has been exploring stratospheric craft to undertake ISR missions for the past couple of years. The new effort for microHABs is being led by the Army's Program Executive Office for Aviation, Evans said, which for the moment is the primary acquisition shop overseeing the service's pursuit of systems that can operate at the upper edges of the stratosphere — roughly between 60,000 and 100,000 feet, and just below orbital space. 'The only way to get there is with balloons or ultra-light, solar-powered vehicles,' Evans said. 'Airplanes and things that have big motors can't get that high.' RELATED: After setting ultra-endurance record, Army Zephyr drone keeps flying, whether it wants to or not The Army in July issued a request for information designed to provide the service with market research on small, light electronic intelligence, communication intelligence, and radar payloads for 'microHABs,' described as weighing under 15 pounds. Those are relatively 'micro' compared to, say, the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System (JLENS) system that involved lumbering blimps. The Army's Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors has been playing with microHABs and said two weeks ago that some systems 'completed a Continuous Uninterrupted Relay Transmission Aerial Intelligence Network over a large distance as part of the Vanguard 24 exercise' in September. 'Although similar to the larger HABs, the microHABs will provide different capabilities due to its variance in size,' the office posted on LinkedIn. 'Project Director Sensors-Aerial Intelligence is currently working hard to mature the microHAB to serve as an Army capability that will be readily available to Soldiers.' Evans explained that the Army's plans for high-altitude balloons of different sizes aren't yet set in stone, with the service also still experimenting with other types of platforms, such as solar-powered aircraft. For example, the Army in 2022 undertook a series of experiments with the spindly Airbus-made Zephyr long endurance drone. He noted that the first funding for the service's High Altitude Platform for Deep Sensing program will appear in the fiscal 2025 budget — although Army budget documents do not break out an amount. 'It's all very nascent. So, we just haven't fully figured out what this is going to be. What we all universally agree on is that we need to do it. We just don't know to what scale and exactly what the solution will be,' Evans said. 'And whether it'll be a balloon, a solar glider, what we're fully sold on is we got to exploit the stratosphere.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-about-to-formalize-micro-high-altitute-balloons-as-a-new-requirement-for-surveillance-ops/	2024-10-16T14:05:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241016_army_microhab_PEOIWS_LinkedIn_CROP.jpg
US Navy adjusting weapons, radars based on sailor feedback following Houthi engagements: CNO	The Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) defeats a combination of Houthi missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles in the Red Sea, Oct. 19. Carney is deployed to the U.S. 5th Fleet area of operations to help ensure maritime security and stability in the Middle East region. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Aaron Lau) AUSA 2024 — The US Navy is making adjustments to the radars and weapon systems it is using in the Red Sea to fend off Houthi attacks in part thanks to real-time feedback from weapon systems and sailors, the service’s top admiral said on Wednesday. 'We’ve been able to observe all of the different engagements, everything that the Houthis have used, all of their Iranian-supplied weapon systems, and we’ve been able to look at their tactics that they’re using,' Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the chief of naval operations, said during an event at the Atlantic Council. 'We’ve been able to use data and extract that information from our weapons systems, bring that back here to the US in a matter of hours, and getting that to our engineers, to our warfighting development centers, where they develop tactics, techniques and procedures.' In at least one case the new TTPs are born in theater. Franchetti specifically cited a sailor whom she said she personally promoted during a ship visit. That sailor, following engagements with the Houthis, thought up a more effective way of using one of the ship's guns. After writing up the idea and sending it back to engineers stateside, the service ultimately validated the sailor’s suggestion and made the change fleetwide. 'And so, we got to put technology into the hands of a warfighter. We got them to think about how to think, act and operate differently. And he was really a pioneer in innovating there on the battlefield,' Franchetti continued, without going into details about the change. The CNO was at the Atlantic Council primarily to discuss her recently published 'Navigation Plan,' which heavily focuses preparing the service for 2027, the year Chinese President Xi Jinping has said he wants the military to be prepared in case he gives the order to invade Taiwan. RELATED: Navy's 80 percent surge-readiness target is a &#8216;stretch goal,' says CNO That deadline and what it means for the Defense Department has dominated Pacific-oriented discussions elsewhere in Washington, DC, this week during the annual AUSA exposition. Gen. Charles Flynn, commander of US Army Pacific Command, who is set to retire from the service next month, said the Chinese were on a 'dangerous path' and their actions have become progressively more provocative and belligerent over the past decade. 'We have to win as a joint, combined, multinational force,' he said on Monday. 'That's the only way to prevent the continuation of their incremental, insidious and now irresponsible behavior.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-navy-adjusting-weapons-radars-based-on-sailor-feedback-following-houthi-engagements-cno/	2024-10-16T13:23:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/231207_DVIDS_carney_houthi_red_sea_8082818-scaled-e1701969268949.jpg

‘Get well’: Army’s upgunned Stryker approaches first fielding but trio of problems linger	The Army provided new details about plans to fix its new upgunned Stryker vehicle this week. (Aaron Mehta/ Breaking Defense) AUSA 2024 — The US Army is on track to begin receiving upgunned Stryker vehicles early next year, but there are several lingering deficiencies that will need to be addressed down the road, according to a pair of service officials. '[We’re] actually going to work as fast as we can to get them fixed, but as part of our material release process, we have to submit a &#8216;get well' plan to the Army, and that &#8216;get well' plan allows us to have up to three years,' said Clifton Boyd, the project manager for the Stryker brigade combat team. The three key issues to address, Boyd said, are 'software glitches' with the display that continue to crop up, light emission through vehicle seams, and a casing ejection problem that leaves rounds rolling around on the deck of the vehicle or can 'jam' the turret. That last issue is the most notable, because if not corrected, it potentially leaves soldiers without a cannon on a battlefield — the entire purpose of the vehicle upgrade. Boyd, however, downplayed the severity of the problem, saying the true purpose of the vehicle is to move soldiers across the battlefield, with the gun more of a nice-to-have than must-have for the Stryker's core operational purpose. 'I want to make it very clear that the turret is not a mission essential system, if the turret was to go down, the vehicle is still mission capable… because it delivers infantry soldiers to the fight,' Boyd told reporters on Tuesday The service and Oshkosh, Boyd said, are still working on the fixes and will have up to three years to roll them out. In an interview with Breaking Defense today, Oshkosh Defense’s chief programs officer Pat Williams said the company has not yet seen the test report but will receive it in November. At that point, he said, it will have more insights into thedetails of the problems outlined by Boyd, and can plan the road ahead. Despite those issues, the Army still says it's going forward with fielding the upgraded Strykers, with Oshkosh on contract to upgun 269 vehicles across three brigades. After recent force structure changes, the service 65 upgunned Strykers, with a third receiving 83. Another 20 vehicles are bound for the schoolhouses and testing, while the service is still deciding what to do with the remaining 36 vehicles. 'If we're going to continue to increase lethality, we are always going to have to modernize, and we're always going to have to make the system better than when the first soldier gets it,' said Col. Jerome Parker, the director for the Army’s Stryker brigade combat team capability shop. 'So yes, this is what we have in 2024. In 2027 we need to make it better, but we need to continue to get that feedback from the force to make it better.'

‘Not one big bang’: Army looking to enhance competition with ‘teams of vendors’ for Next Gen C2	Members of the 56th Air and Space Communications Squadron at Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam operate cyber systems using a Enhanced communications flyaway kit during the Global Information Dominance Experiment 3 and Architect Demonstration Evaluation 5 at Alpena Combat Readiness Training Center, Alpena, Michigan, July, 12, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Amy Picard) AUSA 2024 — The Army aims to make a break with habit in its acquisition for the high-profile Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) project, looking for industry teams to tackle the problem rather than a single player, according to a senior official. 'My sense of what I'd like to see is, you know, competition within the program,' Army undersecretary Gabe Camarillo said here at AUSA 2024 on Tuesday. 'So not just one or two or three vendors that are going to kind of give you this big bang and take three or four years to do it. That's probably the traditional way we would have done software 10 years ago. I think my view of it is we want to open up the competition. Have different teams competing, both together, on teams and against each other, in many cases.' So far three vendors — Anduril, Palantir and Google — have been selected to work on a portion of NGC2, also known as C2 Next, specifically to develop dashboards that will display location and positional information with the goal of bolstering soldier’s situational awareness. The companies showcased that capability at the Network Modernization Experiment (NetModX) 2024 event back in August and will do so again in March of next year at Project Convergence, an Army spokesperson told Breaking Defense in an email recently. Additionally, earlier this month, the Program Executive Office of Command, Control, Communications-Network (PEO C3N) put out a Request for Information seeking input on 'experimentation, pilots and, prototyping' in establishing NGC2. Camarillo said he’s trying to move that process along quickly while working closely with the PEO C3N. 'The goal is to get a program of record started as quickly as we can. In fiscal year [2025] we want to get a competition going. I think currently, [Mark Kitz, the program executive officer of C3N] is scheduled for a third quarter of FY25 to do it. I'm pushing him to see if we can go faster, as I always do,' Camarillo said. 'But the goal is to get, you know, teams of vendors on contract and iterating because again this is not one big bang. We want to get vendors on contract. We want to try something out. We want to do it under the auspices of a formal program that, you know, we can show the Congress that we've got a different approach.' Other plans to stand up NGC2 include prototyping activity by next year and a minimum viable product for new C2 capabilities by early fiscal year 2026. Camarillo emphasized that during all of this, the requirement and acquisition process with NGC2 will vary from traditional processes not just by using a multi-vendor approach, but also because of the timeline. He said that there’s no end to NGC2 because there will continuously be new requirements as the technology develops. Also adding that because of this, the requirement process may yield 'revalidation.' 'This is probably going to be a different kind of requirement, whether it automatically gets kind of revalidated over a set period of time, or whether there's continuous revalidation, which I think is even more appropriate, involving the requirements user and the acquisition community working together. It's going to force us to team together in ways that maybe we haven't on a program like this ever before,' Camarillo said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/not-one-big-bang-army-looking-to-enhance-competition-with-teams-of-vendors-for-next-gen-c2/	2024-10-16T11:13:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240716_gide_finger_computer_6733216-e1721160785247.jpg
Italy, US space cooperation plan includes launch, domain awareness	Italy and the US held a first bilateral space dialogue Oct. 11-12, 2024 in Rome, signing a wide-ranging cooperation agreement. (Photo credit: US Embassy in Italy) WASHINGTON — Following a first-ever bilateral space dialogue in Rome, the US and Italy on Oct. 15 inked a wide-ranging cooperation agreement — including strengthening national security space ties on issues such as space domain awareness and commercial integration. 'The U.S.-Italy Space Dialogue’s purpose is to strengthen cooperation and advance bilateral collaboration in space matters,' according to the joint statement, following the Oct. 11 and 12 meeting between US and Italian interagency delegations. 'Both sides reiterated their strong determination to expand already robust bilateral cooperation in a variety of areas, including addressing the climate crisis and sustainable and safe use of outer space; preserving outer space heritage; advancing national security space cooperation and information sharing; and strengthening bilateral commercial space cooperation,' it added. Italy in 2020 stood up a new Space Operations Command and in 2023 signed an agreement to second a liaison officer to US Space Command. It also is one of the few European countries operating its own fleet of military satellites, including for communications and remote sensing. For example, the Italian Ministry of Defense currently is developing an updated version of its Sicral telecomms birds. The Italian space agency — which in January signed a space cooperation agreement with the nation's armed forces — also is working to field a new generation of dual-use (civil/military) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites to replace its aging COSMO-Skymed constellation, called CSG. The new statement stressed the need for tighter ties among the two NATO allies due to the 'growing scope of counter-space and related threats and potential adversaries increasing use of space to track and potentially target' allied forces. The two sides pledged 'to strengthen the coordination of national security space activities with other allies and partners around the globe, including by leveraging innovative commercial space capabilities, to ensure access to critical space-based services and improve space domain awareness' as well as satellite cybersecurity. The statement explained that Rome and Washington now are negotiating a Technology Safeguards Agreement that would create the legal and technical framework needed to allow US commercial space launch from Italy and ease commercial partnering on satellite and space systems. This would allow the Pentagon and US Space Force to tap into an expanded industrial base as part of their ambitious plans to created a 'hybrid' space architecture that links satellites operated by the US and allied governments, as well as private companies. The two sides further pledged to jointly support international acceptance of voluntary norms of behavior for on-orbit activities, including the US-initiated call for a UN-wide moratorium on testing of debris-creating anti-satellite missiles. And in an obvious dig at Russia — which the US has accused of developing a space-based nuclear weapon — the joint statement also reaffirmed Italian and US support for the 1967 Outer Space Treaty's ban on placing nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction in orbit.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/italy-us-space-cooperation-plan-includes-launch-domain-awareness/	2024-10-16T10:50:29-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Italy-space--e1729098934725.jpg
General Atomics could produce CCAs at a rate of one-per-day, exec says	General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, Inc's CCA on display at AFA 2024 (Valerie Insinna/Breaking Defense) AUSA 2024 — General Atomics could ramp up production of autonomous combat drones to a rate of one aircraft per day in two to three years if given the signal by the Defense Department, the company’s head of aeronautics told Breaking Defense. The Air Force has yet to award a production contract for its drone wingman, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), nor has it laid out a definitive plan for how quickly it plans to acquire at least 1,000 drones across the lifespan of the program. However, General Atomics has already begun assessing what it would take to meet potential future needs for the other US services as well as international customers, which could lead to a market that is closer to 2,000 CCAs, Dave Alexander said in an interview at the Association of the US Army conference. 'The question is, how quick can you get them there?' he said. 'How long do you want to take to get 2,000 built?' At peak production, the dronemaker manufactured one aircraft from its unmanned fleet every three days, for a rate of about 100 per year, Alexander said. 'It's not a far stretch for us to turn that into one per day on a single aircraft with productionization and automation, which we're investing in today.' General Atomics could scale to build a CCA every two days 'without lifting a finger' at its existing 5 million square foot production plant in Poway, Calif., Alexander said. To go faster, the company would need to expand its footprint with additional facilities, but the level of capital investments required would be 'not huge,' he added. In April, the Air Force awarded contracts to General Atomics and defense tech startup Anduril to build CCA prototypes, which are expected to make their first flights next year ahead of a production decision in 2026. Service officials have repeatedly stated that it could put CCAs from one or both vendors into production, or that it could opt to buy CCAs from other vendors that were previously cut from the competition. Since the prototype contracts were announced, both General Atomics and Anduril have waged a technological and public relations battle, with both companies hyping up their ability to develop a semi-autonomous combat drone that will fight alongside fighter jets — a capability that is completely novel for the Air Force — and build those CCAs at scale. RELATED: Before their CCA drones even take to the air, Anduril and General Atomics trade shots General Atomics is investing in technologies to make CCA production quicker and more efficient than the days of the MQ-1 Predator and early models of the MQ-9 Reaper, when the drones were essentially fabricated by hand, Alexander said. 'Our goal right now [is] to squeeze out the touch labor, and get the automation in there. And that affects the design,' he said. The company is looking at 'how would we automate actually building parts with robots, kind of like you would have in an automotive production line, so that this thing can come together much, much faster, with less touch labor.' For example, General Atomics is bringing in robotic systems that can lay up composite fibers, which can build composite aircraft structures like wings more efficiently than humans can manually. The company is also incorporating more additive manufactured parts in that effort to cut human touch labor while cutting material waste, Alexander said. General Atomics is not the only potential CCA manufacturer trumpeting its production capabilities. Anduril has also touted its plans to build weapons systems like CCA at 'hyperscale' at a factory it has dubbed 'Arsenal.' It plans to announce the location of the new production plant this year. In addition to the focus on the Air Force program, Alexander said General Atomics is evaluating new variants of the Gambit drone that forms the basis of its CCA offering. For example, on its Gambit 5 — a proposed version that can be launched from an aircraft carrier — the company hopes to add capability meant to enable expeditionary operations, such as the ability to take off from 'very, very short runways,' he said. He declined to comment on the specific takeoff length for the proposed variant, as well as how the drone would be launched, though he acknowledged that some additional launch equipment would be needed. 'We're working on concepts that we will reveal in time, but we're very bullish about our ideas,' Alexander said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/general-atomics-could-produce-ccas-at-a-rate-of-one-per-day-exec-says/	2024-10-16T10:34:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_1690-scaled-e1726499062235.jpg
IAI unveils new lightweight, electronic warfare-resistant ‘Teaser’ guided missile	An artist's rendering of IAI's Teaser missile. (IAI) AUSA 2024 — Israel Aerospace Industries has announced the development of a new lightweight missile called Teaser, which it says is the 'first guided missile in the world using an external optical guidance without a homing sensor.' Avi Kadoori, a manager at IAI, told Breaking Defense Tuesday that the missile, which can be shoulder-launched and weighs less than five pounds, operates without relying on the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). The company describes the weapon as an 'ACLOS (Automatic Command to Line-of-Sight) tactical, affordable infantry weapon system.' This means it's immune to traditional GNSS jamming or spoofing. 'It’s important that you are not relying on GNSS,' Kadoori said. He said IAI developed the tech due to the customer focus on these types of requirements. 'We had a lot of thought on the version we wanted. We learned a lot from the experience in wars.' He didn’t specify any particular Israeli experience, and the company didn’t comment on the recent Gaza war, but rather mentioned Ukraine’s large conventional battlefield as an example, where both sides are engaged in perhaps the most intense electronic warfare environment in history. Israel has also reportedly compromised GPS signals, allegedly to interfere with GPS-guided weapons weilded by the Lebanese group Hezbollah. RELATED: GPS shows some Lebanese citizens in Jordan, likely result of combat-related &#8216;spoofing,' experts say The new weapon uses an external sight, called Teaser-Sight, to guide it into targets up to 2.5 kilometers (1.6 miles) away. As the operator needs to stay locked on target through flight, the company emphasized that the missile flies fast — some 200 meters per second. The warhead is designed for use with battalion-sized or smaller infantry and special forces units, enabling them to target light structures, light armored vehicles or in an anti-personnel capacity. Photos distributed by the company show how IAI envisions it being deployed as a shoulder-launched weapon or on a truck using cannisters to launch it. Kadoori also said that the sight could be put on a drone so that an operator could lock on and direct missiles remotely toward a target. Kadoori noted that the decision to focus on this range came from the sense that forces need a system like this both for short range combat in urban environments and open areas. Kadoori also pointed out that it could be used by crews of small boats, apparently for naval applications or in littoral combat environments. RELATED: French Army demos MBDA's AI-powered anti-armor add-on, firm unveils new cruise missile The company said in a statement that 'the missiles two-stage embedded motor (ejection stage and booster) enables safe back-blast, allowing for firing from enclosed areas.' It also has a remote launch capability meaning a 'launch command given by the operator through a GCS (Ground Control Station).' While not operational yet, Kadoori said several potential customers have been waiting for a solution like this. 'They have spoken to us in the last year about this,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/iai-unveils-new-lightweight-electronic-warfare-resistant-teaser-guided-missile/	2024-10-16T09:52:37-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/TEASER-2-e1729095746486.jpg
‘Sense of urgency’: Army’s NETCOM says it will transform IT and cyber ops by the end of next year	U.S. Army, Sgt. RJ Koreis, assigned to 3rd Psychological Operations Battalion, edits on laptop in 'Technical Lanes' event, during the 2023 Spc. Hilda I. Clayton Best Combat Camera Competition at Fort A.P. Hill, Virginia, May 24, 2023. (U.S. Army photo by Spc. Noah Martin) WASHINGTON — As part of the Army’s C2 Fix initiative, the Army Network Enterprise Technology Command, or NETCOM, is planning to transform from solely a network provider to an information technology and cybersecurity provider by the end of next year. Gen. Jacqueline McPhail, commanding general of NETCOM said the move will allow her office to become more of an operational force spending less time on fixing IT and cyber issues and more time focused on progressing and protecting the DoD’s Information Network, or DODIN. This change will 'not only deliver that network, but everything that's going through that network, and then making sure everything that goes through that network is protected,' McPhail said during a panel at the Association of the US Army’s annual conference on Monday. She said the transformation will happen at the 'global level,' but the process will be theater-aligned. 'It's enabling that global collaboration. So allowing theaters to collaborate amongst themselves, as well as vertically within the Army, we also are making sure we have that seamless movement across the globe. So as you go from the enterprise or from your base post camp station, and you deploy to another environment, whether it's CENTCOM AOR [area of responsibility], INDOPACOM AOR, it’s seamless movement,' McPhail said during a media roundtable Monday. One of the biggest changes this 'pivot,' as McPhail calls it, will bring is that soldiers will no longer have to reimage their computers when they move from theater to theater. (Reimaging is an often lengthy process that completely clears a computer’s hard drive and reinstalls the operating system.) 'The days of having to image your computers every time you go to a different theater, those days are coming to an end,' McPhail said during the roundtable. This initiative to cut down the reimaging process is something the service invested heavily in back between 2016 and 2017, then called Warfighter Information Network-Tactical, or, WIN-T, however, the program eventually fell flat. Gen. John Morrison, deputy chief of staff of the G6, assured reporters at Monday's roundtable that won’t happen this time around, mainly because there’s a stronger 'sense of urgency' within the Army to make such changes and the operational environment is much different. 'It is literally trying to get after things with a sense of urgency,' Morrison said. 'Where we were at in 2017 is not the operational environment if we are seeing today. We know that the capabilities that we had were not ready to fight tonight, and why, we got very focused on C2 Fix, and it was an all-of-Army-effort to make sure that we were going to put capabilities into the hands of our operational formations to make them more survivable, made them more maneuverable, gave them the operational capabilities they needed,' he later added. Another capability the transformation will yield is the increased use of software-as-a-service and identity, credential and access management (ICAM), with strict zero trust protocols. 'When we start talking about zero trust, that's your step one. Everything that we plug in gets scanned and yes, it is compliant and is authorized to connect to the network. And then that also includes making sure that our endpoints are secure,' McPhail said at the roundtable. But while NETCOM aims to widen its portfolio, it's not getting out of the IT fix-it mission at its core. A big push for the command is the Army Enterprise Service Management Platform (ASMP), which McPhail compared to a help desk to assist soldiers with any network or IT issues they have out in the field. 'That is a help desk, but it's not just a help desk, right? It’s probably the most robust help desk support that I have seen in my 30 years in the Army,' she said. 'It really means being able to pick up with your system and not have an image, right? And that is a huge thing. Any of us that have gone through all these different deployments in our career, having to reimage over and over and over.' McPhail said NETCOM hopes to provide each new capability by the end of 2025.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/sense-of-urgency-armys-netcom-says-it-will-transform-it-and-cyber-ops-by-the-end-of-next-year/	2024-10-16T09:10:03-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240502_DVIDS_soldier_computer_7816206-scaled-e1714651021729.jpg
Australia launches planning for multi-billion dollar AUKUS dry dock, expanded naval base	US Navy Virginia-class submarine, USS North Carolina, docks at the HMAS Stirling port in Rockingham on the outskirts of Perth on August 4, 2023. A US Navy Virginia-class submarine arrived at HMAS Stirling for a scheduled port visit as part of routine patrols in the Indo-Pacific region. (Photo by Tony McDonough / AFP) (Photo by TONY MCDONOUGH/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — Facing the enormous demands of the AUKUS submarine program, as well as a long-term doubling of the country's surface navy, Australia today launched a formal plan to develop a military shipyard and port complex in Western Australia worth up to $20 billion, providing up to 10,000 jobs. But there is less money than rhetoric so far, with only $127 million AUD ($85 million USD) committed for a three-year planning and feasibility study for the effort, seen as vital to the country's naval ambitions. The single biggest budget item in this development is likely to be a new 'graving dock,' known by most as a dry dock. The Lucky Country has not built a new large dry dock since the Captain Cook dock in Sydney, which took four years to build during World War II and was the largest engineering project in the country at the time. The new dock in Western Australia will probably be part of HMAS Stirling, where the nuclear-powered attack boats will be based and maintained. While details are scant on what the dock will look like, it's possible Australia will model it after the new dry dock being built by the United States at Pearl Harbor. That project, with a $3.4 billion USD ($5.9 billion AUD) price tag, is built to handle Virginia-class boats for generations to come. The dry dock attracted high-level concern in August when Rear Adm. Wendy Malcolm, the Royal Australian Navy officer in charge of readying Australia's infrastructure for AUKUS and the expanded surface fleet, said the military and government needed to 'get going' on crucial work like the dry dock and nearby shipyards or her country's entire effort to host, build and maintain nuclear boats was 'at risk.' An image from the Australian government showing build-out plans for future naval docks. (Australian MoD) The dry dock will be a centerpiece of the massive consolidation and expansion of shipyards and HMAS Stirling, as an illustration from the government depicts. Stirling is set to begin hosting rotations of US and UK nuclear boats from 2027, around the time the study will have been finished. Marles has said a floating dock could be leased to service the boats in the short term, but floating docks cannot sustain the depot-level maintenance submarines will need over time. The expansion of the shipyards and the port 'represents the most significant defense industry offering to Western Australia since federation (in 1901),' the defense minister said today. The new consolidated defense area will be established at the southern end of the Henderson shipyard, which is where new landing craft for the Australian army and new general purpose frigates for the Navy will be built. It's worth noting that Western Australia is considered crucial to Labor keeping its hold on power when the next election occurs. That will be no later than September next year and both parties are already jostling for position — so it's no surprise that the Liberal Party's shadow defense minister, Andrew Hastie, criticized the study as 'barely enough to get works underway. 'The Albanese Government is already kicking these important works into the long grass, with &#8216;delivery of initiatives' not set to commence for another nine months,' Hastie, who represents a Western Australian district in Parliament, said in a Wednesday statement. 'Labor's measly $127 million commitment to transforming Henderson is reflective of their lack of investment in the defense budget which is barely keeping up with inflation under this government.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/australia-launches-planning-for-multi-billion-dollar-aukus-dry-dock-expanded-naval-base/	2024-10-16T07:32:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/virginia-australia-scaled-e1723223982442.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: 4 Nordic nations in talks for joint procurement of infantry fighting vehicles	Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are aligned on a plan to jointly procure a new Infantry Fighting Vehicle to replace existing Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90) fleets in the 2030 to 2040 timeframe (Saab) AUSA 2024 — The Nordic countries of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden are evaluating a joint procurement of a future Infantry Fighting Vehicle (IFV), senior officials from two of the countries told Breaking Defense. Discussions between the four nations have already been held, and if the plan moves ahead as anticipated, the new platform would be acquired in the 2030 to 2040 timeframe. Maj. Gen. Lars Lervik, Chief of Staff of the Norwegian Army, said in an interview on Monday that the four nations are 'currently investigating' the project, in the hope that it could lower procurement costs and make development and maintenance issues 'easier.' Similarly, Maj. Gen. Jonny Lindfors, Commander of the Swedish Army, told Breaking Defense Tuesday, 'We’re in agreement that we’re going to go together. &#8230; We want to have the same [future] platform, the same equipment. We don’t want any national, special requirements.' He added, 'We’re aiming for cross-development, cross-buying and cross-use, basically, because we need to align and ease up the supply chains and be able to sustain the vehicles. We’re going to fight in the same region so we see the benefits' of a joint approach. Each nation currently fields BAE Systems's Combat Vehicle 90 (CV90), and Lindfors said it would be a 'natural development to buy more of them.' But, he said, it's not the 'sole single system' under consideration and talks have been held with 'more than one manufacturer.' 'We're having discussions regarding requirements and what the next generation of combat vehicles will look like,' he said. Eventually, a newer version of the tracked vehicle will 'probably' be procured, according to Lervik. Based on the 'need' across the four nations to replace existing CV90 stocks, the next generation IFV would be acquired 'between 2030 and 2040,' added Lindfors. In a statement, a spokesperson for Sweden’s BAE Systems Hagglunds said, '[For] decades, we have a close relation to and support all the four Nordic countries operating the CV90. Given the Nordic countries needs, we are welcoming the conjointly dialogue about how to procure more CV90s in an efficient way to meet the new European situation, and how to be able to deliver within an agreed timeline.' Denmark's Defence Acquisitions and Logistics Organisation (DALO) declined to comment. Finland's Ministry of Defence has not responded to a request for comment. In August, Denmark committed to a DKK 10 billion ($1.5 billion) acquisition of 115 CV9035 MkIIIC IFVs for the Royal Danish Army, per a European Union tenders notice. In the case of Finland, it struck a $32 million CV90 upgrade contract, including a midlife extension program, with BAE Systems in 2021. The manufacturer said at the time that the upgrade will last until 2026. Norway operates a fleet of 144 CV90s that is guaranteed 'continuous modernization' under a support, sustainment, and readiness contract, signed with BAE Systems in 2022. Sweden is currently in the process of acquiring CV9035 MkIIIC IFVs to replace CV9040 vehicles donated to Ukraine. The modernised vehicles feature a new turret design and 'significant ergonomic improvements' for crew, according to BAE Systems. Broadly speaking the company has seen an uptick in orders in recent years including lucrative deals with Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Last year Stockholm donated 50 CV90s to Ukraine and, through a joint statement with Denmark, the two Nordic counterparts agreed to collaborate on additional supplies of the vehicle, backed by funding from Copenhagen of DKK 1.8 billion. The Netherlands is also part of the initiative through an investment of €400 million ($435 million) to finance manufacturing of the vehicles. Outside of the joint procurement IFV effort, Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden have already agreed to buy the 'same uniforms' while plans are in motion to ensure that artillery rounds among the four nations are 'interchangeable,' in order to develop 'as much interoperability as possible,' said Lervik. 'We're not there yet, but that's what we're looking at.' He outlined that national approval processes relating to the 155mm artillery shell, for example, currently stand in the way of delivering on the interchangeable capability.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/exclusive-4-nordic-nations-in-talks-for-joint-procurement-of-infantry-fighting-vehicles/	2024-10-16T06:19:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20231011-en-4647184-1.avif

Aussies arming Ukraine with almost 50 Abrams tanks, a change in Canberra’s plans	An Australian Army M1A1 Abrams Tank during Exercise Southern Jackaroo 23, in Townsville, Queensland. (Credit ADF Cpl. Nicole Dorrett) SYDNEY — Australia is transfer 49 M1A1 tanks to Ukraine, ending months of speculation about when, or if, Canberra would provide armor to Kyiv's defense. The formal announcement will be made in Brussels at the NATO Defense Ministerial meetings tomorrow by Pat Conroy, minister for defense industry and capability. The tanks have an estimated value of $245 million AUD ($164 million USD), bringing Australia's military assistance to Ukraine to more than $1.3 billion. Conroy announced the transfer during a Wednesday press appearance in London. 'These tanks will deliver more firepower and mobility to the Ukrainian Armed Forces, and complement the support provided by our partners for Ukraine,' Conroy said in a statement. The United States did have to approve the transfer as Australia bought them from America, which requires permission for countries to send US weapons to third countries, the minister noted. Ukraine’s ambassador to Australia Vasyl Myroshnychenko welcomed the news, calling the new armor in an interview with the ABC a 'significant contribution' to Ukraine's war effort. 'These tanks will be an essential part of our land defenses, and we have already been operating some of those tanks which we’ve been provided by the Americans in the past, so we already have teams of people who know how to use that equipment. The armor they have, the missiles that they also use will be of huge help to Ukrainians on the battlefield, especially where we build those defense lines,' the ambassador said in audio shared with Breaking Defense. The sending of Abrams represents an about-face for the government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. Back in late February, Defense Minister Richard Marles told a reporter that supplying Ukraine with these tanks was 'not on the agenda.' The Abrams announcement also comes against the backdrop of months of criticism of the Australian government for not transferring its prematurely retired Taipan helicopters to Ukraine. Instead, the military here has stripped them for parts, which they've resold to Airbus, and scrapped the airframes. Some of the tanks, because they are near the end of their lives, may need to be cannibalized or rebuilt to some degree, a decision that will be up to Ukraine. This is all made possible because the Australian Army has begun receiving the first of its new M1A2 fleet of 75 tanks. 'The reason for this timing is because we have begun receiving the M1A2 tanks, so this is the logical time to do this,' Conroy said in London. A small number of the 59 old tanks will be retained to assist the transition to the new tanks. Just how effective the Abrams has been in Ukraine is a bit of a debate. Earlier this year, the Associated Press reported that Ukraine has decided to pull its fleet of American-supplied M1A1s from the front lines because they are too vulnerable to Russian weapons, and at least five of the 31 from the US have been lost to enemy fire. Since then, Ukraine has put reactive armor on the M1s and provided them with jammers to better protect them.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aussies-arming-ukraine-with-almost-50-abrams-tanks-a-change-in-canberras-plans/	2024-10-16T04:51:23-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20230630army8614011_0032-scaled-e1729078846849.jpeg
Army to defend small businesses against hackers with NCODE secure cloud enclave pilot	Concept art showing a member of the military working in a server room. (Getty Images/SeventyFour) AUSA 2024 — Army undersecretary Gabe Camarillo announced here Tuesday that the service would create a secure online enclave where small businesses can work with sensitive information under the Army’s protection — a potential lifeline for smaller firms struggling to meet Pentagon cybersecurity requirements and defend themselves against high-end threats like China. Known as NCODE — an acronym for Next-gen Commercial Operations in Defended Enclaves — the program will begin with a two-year, $26 million pilot project in 2025-2027, Camarillo said. Further details, including how small businesses can apply to join the NCODE pilot, will start coming out in 'days,' he told a packed conference room. 'This essentially provides &#8230; a secure environment for small businesses to participate in, where they can collaborate, share information, and most importantly, do their own work &#8230; that would otherwise present a threat vector,' Camarillo said. 'What's great about it is that it's compliant with CMMC [Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification], so all of the department's requirements would be met by operating in this environment.' What’s more, the undersecretary said, since the enclave will be operated by Army cybersecurity experts but not actually part of the Army network, companies can run their usual software in it, without having to go through the cumbersome Authority To Operate process required to install new programs on DoD computers. Some context: For at least a decade, the Defense Department has worried about China and other adversaries stealing sensitive or even classified data — most famously, details of the F-35 stealth fighter — from the networks of its numerous contractors. But the Pentagon’s official process for vetting vendors’ digital defenses is ponderous and often painfully expensive. Contractors’ internal networks must achieve Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC), which was recently revised and strengthened, while government offices that want to buy commercial software must get an official Authority To Operate (ATO) before they can install it on DoD networks. These CMMC and ATO processes are especially burdensome for smaller firms, which might be more likely to come up with precisely the kind of innovations, especially in software, that adversaries are most eager to steal. 'We really do need the innovation support of our industrial base, and a key font of that innovation is all in our small businesses,' Camarillo said. 'But…another thing that we hear a lot about, it's the concerns that small businesses face in dealing with the Department's requirements.' The Army estimates 'about half' of the 12,000 small firms it does business with are exposed to 'medium- or high-risk' cybersecurity threats, he said, and defending against such sophisticated adversaries often requires more talent and technology than most small firms can spare. 'Across the Department of Defense, there's a number of efforts underway &#8230; to provide opportunities for small businesses to meet cybersecurity requirements without having to incur all of the fixed costs,' Camarillo continued. 'We've called it, notionally, before, ‘cybersecurity as a service,’ but really what it is, it's a pilot for us to create the environment that these small businesses can operate in without having to pay for the infrastructure themselves.' 'It's not tied to Army networks,' he said. 'It is really … a network enclave that we lend to them while they're doing the work of the Army and provide security protections for.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-to-defend-small-businesses-against-hackers-in-secure-cloud-enclave-pilot-ncode/	2024-10-16T04:30:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/Getty-creative-military-network-scaled-e1698759860778.jpg

New National Guard chief Nordhaus takes stage as Helene, Milton recovery continues	Gen. Steven Nordhaus at his promotion ceremony on Oct. 15, 2024. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class Zach Sheely) AUSA 2024 — Air Force Gen. Steven Nordhaus introduced himself as the 30th chief of the National Guard Bureau today, emphasizing that he will focus on ensuring readiness so that Guardsmen are prepared to overcome challenges at home and abroad. 'During my time as Chief, we will remain focused on readiness every day — particularly in light of intensifying Great Power Competition,' Nordhaus said in an assumption of command ceremony. 'We must always be ready to ensure our freedoms and our security are never in doubt.' Nordhaus officially started his new role Oct. 2, taking over from former Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson whose term ended in August. The new Guard chief, who was previously responsible for homeland air defense at NORAD, was confirmed by the Senate in September. An immediate task for Nordhaus will be overseeing cleanup operations in the wake of hurricanes Helene and Milton, including the need to combat disinformation campaigns that authorities recently said have led to threats against aid workers. 'They are rescuing families in devastated areas. They are clearing roads and establishing distribution sites, so our fellow Americans can regain access to life-saving food, water and power. They are bringing more than disaster response expertise to these communities — they are bringing hope and compassion to neighbors in need,' Nordhaus said of Guard soldiers assisting with recovery operations. A member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Nordhaus will also be tasked with ensuring the Guard is ready for war with a peer military power, as Russia's invasion of Ukraine inches toward its third year and officials warn China is readying its military to take Taiwan by force if necessary. Nordhaus will additionally have to navigate some politically contentious issues. For example, budgetary pressures are driving the Air Force to divest a range of aircraft, potentially disrupting the missions of some Guard units who could be left without one-to-one replacements. Lawmakers may also soon decide the fate of Guard units that perform space missions, an issue that’s ignited controversy among some officials and supporters of the Guard. Pointing to the lack of Senate-confirmed leaders in other critical Guard posts, like director of the Air National Guard, a spokesperson for the National Guard Association applauded Nordhaus’s ascension, pointing to the 'critical time' at which he's taking up his post considering domestic and international challenges. 'We’re certainly looking forward to working with him,' the spokesperson said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-national-guard-chief-nordhaus-takes-stage-as-helene-milton-recovery-continues/	2024-10-15T14:31:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Nordhaus-scaled-e1729027169727.jpg
China’s military maneuvers around Taiwan meant to send signal: Analysts	A man watches a news programme about Chinese military drills surrounding Taiwan, on a giant screen outside a shopping mall in Beijing on October 14, 2024. China said on October 14 it had 'successfully completed' its 'Joint Sword-2024B' military exercises around Taiwan, adding the drills had 'fully tested the integrated joint operation capabilities of its troops'. (Photo by GREG BAKER / AFP) (Photo by GREG BAKER/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — China's decision to launch its largest-ever air operation in Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ), while practicing a blockade of the island nation without prior notice, is aimed at sending a clear message to the government in Taipei but not starting a broader conflict, analysts says China's surprise exercise, dubbed 'Joint Sword 2024B,' was stunning in scope. The 153 aircraft, 14 warships (including one of China's precious aircraft carriers) and 12 Chinese Coast Guard vessels, showcasing China's growing efficiency at joint operations, a longstanding developmental goal of the PLA. The operation occurred Oct. 14-15, just days after Taiwan's National Day on Oct. 10, when Taiwanese president Lai Ching-te made comments which received public pushback from Beijing, which considers the democratic island as part of its rightful territory. That's no mistake, said Bonnie Glaser, a China expert at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. 'Since the PLA operates on almost a daily basis in Taiwan's ADIZ, they likely sent higher numbers of military aircraft and ships to ensure that Lai gets the message that Beijing strongly opposes what they view as his provocative pro-independence rhetoric.' Glaser wrote in an email. The impressive deployment of such a large force in the air and at sea demonstrates that the Peoples Liberation Army, working with the Chinese Coast Guard, 'has attained a position where it could theoretically mobilize assets and organize an air and naval blockade around Taiwan, and these forces are believed to be all coordinated and working in sync,' Collin Joh, a defense analyst at Singapore's Institute of Defense and Strategic Studies at Nanyang Technological University, said in an email. With today&#39;s military exercises, China aims to undermine regional stability &amp; the status quo, failing to live up to global expectations. While Taiwan remains open to cross-strait dialogue &amp; exchanges, we are determined to protect our free &amp; democratic constitutional system. &mdash; 賴清德Lai Ching-te (@ChingteLai) October 14, 2024 This exercise, Joh said, should not be dismissed as 'mere posturing,' noting that the Taiwanese have warned that such constant pressure and large exercises 'are blurring the lines between posturing and the real thing,' making misadventure more likely. Joh said Chinese forces have been 'creeping much closer towards Taiwan' and are increasingly close to the 24-mile limit known as the Contiguous Zone. Crossing into that zone could trigger a Taiwanese military response. But China, he said, 'is assiduously trying to avoid making the first move' at the same time it tries to bait the Taiwanese to make a rash move that could give the PRC the pretext for military retaliation. Glaser also downplayed the notion that this is a precursor to an imminent invasion, saying that she did not think China has changed its military intentions toward what Beijing regards as a renegade province and said, 'this is not a propitious time for China to use kinetic action against Taiwan.' The Chinese economy is sputtering under massive debt and the early effects of a declining population. Australia and the United States both condemned the Chinese maneuvers. 'This military pressure operation is irresponsible, disproportionate, and destabilizing,' Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement this morning. 'As the White House noted last week, it is a long-standing tradition for Taiwan's president to deliver remarks on 10/10. It is a routine, domestic-focused address that has historically prompted little response from the PRC. Still, the PRC has chosen this opportunity to take provocative, military action.' Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, through a spokesperson, called the exercise 'deeply concerning' and called on China 'to refrain from actions that increase the risk of accident and potential escalation.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/china-practices-naval-blockade-of-taiwan-deploys-record-fleet-of-warplanes/	2024-10-15T14:22:41-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/taiwan-china-scaled-e1729013547875.jpg

In ‘war of industrial capacity,’ West shouldn’t go 1-to-1 on ammo with Russia: Nammo CEO	AUSA 2024 – A leading European ammunition manufacturer suggested that competing with Russian artillery shell production output on a 'one to one' basis is futile, but rather should beat quantity with quality. 'We are in a war of industrial capacity, but the end result of this is not to compete [against Russia] one-on-one on volume, it is to compete and increase the advantage for us with the help of technology; meaning longer range, precision, more manoeuvrability,' Morten Brandtzaeg, CEO of Norway’s Nammo, told Breaking Defense. Nammo is one of four major ammunition suppliers in Europe alongside France’s Nexter, BAE Systems of the UK and Germany’s Rheinmetall. Russian annual ammunition output stands at around three million units a year, with Europe and the US jointly only able to produce 1.2 million on a comparative basis, according to a CNN report citing NATO and European intelligence sources. Though Europe and the US may not be able to — and shouldn't necessarily try to — match Russian output, Europe is moving swiftly to increase its production capability, Brandtzaeg said. Efforts have taken a 'huge step forward' over the last year chiefly because 'separate nations' have been supporting 'local industry' through government subsidies. Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany — countries in which Nammo has a presence — have all followed this path, he noted. 'The message from industry that we have to share the risk of building war capacity between government and industry has been well heard, ' said Brandtzaeg. He also stressed that the European Union’s Act in Support of Ammunition Production (ASAP) pledge of €500 million ($544 million) for the continent’s defense industry, has helped matters. The funding was approved in March and has been offered to suppliers so they can hit a production target of two million shells by 2025. Brandtzaeg repeated his call for production contracts to be awarded on a multi-year basis and argued that scaling production to meet demand remains a battle because 'the whole acquisition system prioritised national buying' during an era of 'deep peace.' On other business, he said Nammo and the US Army are in 'detailed talks' over a second 155mm ammunition base for the service &#8211; an addition to the existing plant in Mesa, Arizona.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/in-war-of-industrial-capacity-west-shouldnt-go-1-to-1-on-ammo-with-russia-nammo-ceo/	2024-10-15T13:15:29-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/image2-e1729021862807.jpeg
Army SMDC reviewing classification in push for improved integration with allies	Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, commander, Army Space &amp; Missile Defense Command, speaking at AUSA 2024 on Oct. 14. (Photo credit: Theresa Hitchens/Breaking Defense) AUSA 2024 — Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) is working to lower the classification levels of its space capabilities as part of a wider effort to improve its ability to work with allies and partners, senior command officials said today. 'We're currently in a rewrite of our security classification guide to open up the aperture,' Col. Donald Brooks, commandant of the Space and Missile Defense Center of Excellence (SMDCOE), told the Association of the US Army conference today. SMDCOE is responsible 'for managing Army change to doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership and education, personnel, facilities and policy,' according to the SMDC website. 'But I would argue, as we're developing capabilities we need to do a better assessment: &#8216;Is it state of the art versus state of the world?' I would say that there's a lot of things that come out, and we're developing, that are state of the world, but we put way too tight restrictions on that security classification, and then we ignore our partners,' he said. 'And as we all understand, space is inherently joint, multinational and a commercial enterprise, and we've got to figure out ways that we can more effectively and efficiently integrate our entire partners, the entire suite of partners, to [solve] a problem set.' While loathe to promise a completion date for the effort, Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, SMDC commander, said the command 'understands the urgency' of being able to bring allied and partner space capabilities into the fight. Army officials see space capabilities as critical to implementing both its own multi-domain task force concept, but also the Pentagon's ambitious Combined Joint All Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) plans. And lowering space classification levels, the SMDC officials stressed, is critical to both sharing information with allied and partner nations, and being able to operate together on the battlefield. Col. Mark Cobos, head of SMDC's 1st Space Brigade, told Breaking Defense in an Oct. 7 interview that the command and the brigade are already 'making progress' in creating allied partnerships — starting with the United Kingdom. 'At the top of that list is our partnership with the UK and UK Space Command, and a relationship that has just absolutely blossomed [recently] because of mutual interest and mutual philosophies about how to conduct operations,' Cobos said. 'I can't say enough about the strength and the magnitude of the partnership between Army space and our UK counterparts, just just being an incredible story of of not only security cooperation, but the strength of the security cooperation, but the strength of the Alliance, and just the tremendous things happening there,' he added. Command Master Sergeant Maurice Tucker told the AUSA audience that the 1st Space Brigade has been talking with the UK about tactics, techniques and procedures, as well as 'employment opportunities, employment processes, and how they can employ their systems much like how we utilize ours, so that we're building that common space.' Meanwhile, SMDCOE is planning 'an exchange program' under which a UK Space Command instructor will come to the center's space education 'schoolhouse,' and vice versa, Brooks said. The center also is in discussions with Australia and New Zealand about doing the same, he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-smdc-reviewing-classification-in-push-for-improved-integration-with-allies/	2024-10-15T12:41:44-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_3088-scaled-e1729019792658.jpeg
The Army’s latest response to contested logistics is an uncrewed one-ton VTOL lifter	Airbus U.S. Space &amp; Defense is developing an unmanned variant of the UH-72B Lakota platform for the Marine Corps' Aerial Logistics Connector program. Image courtesy of Airbus. Why put soldiers and marines at risk by having them physically transport materiel the 'last mile' of a logistics supply chain with crewed vehicles, boats, and aircraft? That’s a question both the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have already asked themselves, and their responses are similar: develop autonomous, uncrewed platforms that can perform dangerous logistics tasks in contested environments not only for the last mile but throughout every theater of operation. 'Innovation is the coin of the realm, and we are committed to producing solutions that will help DOD navigate the changing landscape of warfare,' said Rob Geckle, Chairman and CEO of Airbus U.S. Space &amp; Defense. 'Ultimately, we want to provide our Soldiers, Airmen, Sailors, Marines, Guardians, and Coastguardsmen with the right tools to deter our adversaries, and if called on, fight and win.' In the Army, the charge to help develop autonomy falls with the Contested Logistics Cross Functional Team out of Army Futures Command. Said its commanding general, Gen. James Rainey, 'Autonomous and robotic systems are going to disrupt the land domain, starting now.' One of the CFT’s first initiatives is the '1 Ton Capable Cargo UAS.' This platform will have a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) capability from both ground and marine environments, with or without cargo. The lifter must also 'be terminally guided from a variety of end-users with no specialized training as well as from various locations [by] field personnel, medical personnel, supply personnel, remote command center,' stated the recent request for information. Airbus U.S. Space &amp; Defense responded to the Army’s RFI with details about how it can satisfy those requirements and many more – using examples and lessons learned from its prototype program developing an autonomous UH-72 Lakota helicopter for the Marine Corps, details of which are discussed below. 'When using manned aircraft in an unmanned configuration for logistics you’re able to take seats, life support, and instruments out of the cabin, which makes room for more payload as well as special cargo handling equipment designed to onload and offload standardized cargo containers quickly with minimum personnel,' said Carl Forsling, senior manager, business development and strategy for Airbus U.S., noting that some redesigns of the doors and hatches are involved. 'Adapting an existing manned aircraft to an unmanned configuration that can carry more cargo, further, and with less maintenance support removes a big part of the risk and cost of a new airframe design. When you already have a manned aircraft that fits the bill performance-wise, and requires just some conversion, it's very effective from a programmatic and a production standpoint.' The U.S. Army and Army National Guard have their own fleets of Lakota numbering around 480 – with the Army National Guard having received 18 of the improved UH-72 Bravo model – and are observing the progress of the Marine Corps’ prototype autonomy program managed by Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR). There are no safe zones anymore in contested logistics, which creates a primary danger for Soldiers and Marines in forward areas who can't be adequately resupplied due to the threats against ground, naval, and air logistics platforms. The shift to uncrewed platforms is related to a general realignment of logistics away from organic and contracted logistics as wielded during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars where supply lines were generally uncontested. Russia’s war on Ukraine has shown that logistics are now regularly contested kinetically by precision fires and non-kinetically by drones flying ISR sensors and, more seriously, electronic warfare designed to jam or spoof communications and positioning, navigation, and timing. Potential adversaries in the Indo-Pacific can similarly contest the supply chain. 'Contested logistics are hard enough without running a resupply operation and not getting the right thing,' Army Future Command Chief Gen. James Rainey told Breaking Defense last year. 'There's a lot of room there for progress.' Autonomy to resupply forward-deployed Marines Those realities become clear when looking at the vast distances of the Indo-Pacific region and the logistics tail that must remain intact and operational. Across U.S INDOPACOM’s Area of Responsibility, for example, the Marine Corps’ latest operational construct called Expeditionary Advanced Base Operations calls for insertion of small, distributed units of island-hopping Marines amidst the First Island Chain to hold enemy shipping and other elements at risk. As mentioned, supply lines are exceptionally long in the Pacific and it tends to stress and exceed the capability of what's organic, especially as the Navy and Marine Corps still operate in many instances under legacy manpower-heavy concepts for logistics. That will only be exacerbated by a conflict in the region. NAVAIR’s Aerial Logistics Connector (ALC) program is designed to address some of those challenges through the use of autonomous aircraft to resupply marines with weapons, ammunition, food, medical supplies, and other materiel inside the enemy’s weapon engagement zone. 'The ALC should not put people at risk, nor should it require a large number of people to operate, maintain, and sustain,' said Forsling. 'That’s important because if you add things that require a lot of support to operate, then you're adding to the logistical problem while trying to solve it. That requires a capability that does not use a lot of resources at the forward edge and can operate off ships and ashore with minimal sustainment. 'That means it must be autonomous and produced in sufficient quantities so that if it is lost in the course of proceeding through these weapons’ engagement zones then it's not an irreplaceable asset that stops the mission from continuing. We've kept those lessons in mind as we developed our concept for the Aerial Logistics Connector.' Earlier this year, NAVAIR awarded Airbus U.S. Space &amp; Defense a Phase 1 Other Transactional Authority Agreement (OTA) in support of the Marine Corps’ ALC. in response, Airbus U.S. Space &amp; Defense’s developing an unmanned variant of the UH-72B Lakota platform under the OTA. 'Our unmanned UH-72 logistics connector leverages nearly two decades of U.S. military capability and offers Marines a versatile, affordable and enduring solution to address logistics missions around the globe,' said Geckle. 'We look forward to supporting the Marine Corps with this latest modernization of the Lakota platform.' The UH-72 logistics connector’s cabin allows for easy loading and unloading of multiple types of cargo and standardized containers. The award is part of a Middle Tier of Acquisition (MTA) rapid prototyping program that will provide the USMC with aircraft prototypes to demonstrate autonomous logistics capabilities through a series of operationally relevant experiments. 'Right now, logistics is done with traditional amphibious shipping and naval maritime prepositioning of ships, as well as theater resupply that originates out of places like Japan and Guam,' said Forsling. 'That all depends, however, on getting those supplies to the last tactical mile to reinforce a platoon out there operating a missile launcher or sensor. 'An autonomous version of the Army’s UH-72B, widely used around the world as the commercial H145 twin-engine light utility helicopter, meets the Marine Corps’ requirements to transport assets at long range and high speed without risking lives,' said Forsling. 'We’ve modified it for the Marine Corps’ special handling requirements for cargo, as well as for UAS operations,' said Forsling. 'We've just entered the rapid prototyping OTA with several other companies in a competitive process, and we're beginning a series of design events and flight demonstrations of our air vehicle.' Complementary missions with the same solution The Army’s need to resupply maneuver forces without putting soldiers at risk – both the ones executing the logistics mission and those on the front lines waiting for resupply – resembles in many ways the Marine Corps’ need to conduct logistics in contested environments for expeditionary operations. Each service operates across all warfighter domains – ground, maritime, air, space, and cyber – at a time when all are contested by kinetics, drones, and EW. It’s not a coincidence that the mission set for the USMC’s Aerial Logistics Connector and the Army’s 1 Ton Capable Cargo UAS can both be addressed by a VTOL already flying for both services – the UH-72 Lakota. 'The Lakota is the most affordable from a development, acquisition, and sustainment standpoint and is currently available for the Marine Corps’ mission,' said Forsling. 'It's the lowest-risk option, and with the addition of a MOSA-compliant digital backbone has room for growth in terms of mission capability, obsolescence management, without the risk of vendor lock. Those are the right entry points for the Marine Corps requirements for the ALC.' For many of the same reasons, the Army can transition a VTOL to an autonomous cargo platform &#8211; based on the upgraded UH-72 Bravo model &#8211; already in production, Airbus notes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-armys-latest-response-to-contested-logistics-is-an-uncrewed-one-ton-vtol-lifter/	2024-10-15T12:00:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/UH-72-Logistics-Connector-scaled.jpg
Army selects 5 companies for self-propelled howitzer roadshow	A photo of the now cancelled Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) prototype during a firing. (Kristen Rounsaville / US Army Contracting Command) AUSA 2024 — As the US Army moves out on its quest to revamp its self-propelled howitzer plans, today it announced the five companies picked to demo their existing platforms on a roadshow of sorts. That handful of companies includes Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems, with the service divvying up $4 million among the bunch to cover other transaction agreements. The plan now is to visit those companies to see what platform capabilities they have today that can potentially fill the gap created when the Army halted Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) platform work. That prototype added a 30-foot, 58-caliber gun tube to BAE Systems’ Paladin M109A7 self-propelled howitzer to launch 155-mm rounds out to 70km, an increase from the current max range of up to 30km. 'We want industry to tell us what the optimal ways of achieving something like this,' Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, the director of the Army's long-range precision fires cross functional team, told reporters today. While the service is open to seeing a mix of platforms and munitions, it ultimately wants a platform that can fire a mix of new munitions still under development and will need a resupply vehicle for the weapon. Following that market research phase, the service will decide if there are viable options on the market today or if it will need to embark on a new development effort, Army acquisition head Doug Bush recently told Breaking Defense. 'Hopefully some time next year [the Army will know] whether we can go straight to procuring those things, or if we need to do development,' Bush added. 'We've accounted for options in the 2026 [budget plans] and then this information would all be able to feed into [the program objective memorandum for] 2027 because if we were to go into procurement … you'd have to fund it,' he later added. And if the decision is made to go into procurement, the service will open up the competition to any vendor interested in competing, said Col. Freeman Bonnette, a program manager with the Program Executive Office for Ground Combat Systems. News of the deals came during this week’s Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC, with many of the selected vendors on the show floor talking artillery. South Korea’s Hanwha, for example, is showcasing its K9A1 tracked self-propelled howitzer that it plans to demo for the Army, while BAE Systems told Breaking Defense it will show off Archer — a Swedish self-propelled howitzer system. Jim Miller, BAE's vice president of business development for combat mission systems, said the company also plans to show the service an upgunned Paladin as part of a separate line of effort to upgrade the artillery platform.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-selects-5-companies-for-self-propelled-howitzer-roadshow/	2024-10-15T11:31:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221215_DVIDS_ERCA_firing_7443969-e1729016022515.jpg
Army network team eyes new requirements for smaller, mobile, survivable command posts	An antenna farm is set up away from soldiers inside the command post. (Breaking Defense/ Ashley Roque) WASHINGTON — The Army’s Command and Control Cross Functional Team will be coming out with a new requirement for modular command posts as part of the service’s Mission Command on the Move project. 'It's putting tools in the hands of the commanders that allow them to kind of scale up and scale down, reconfigure their command post as they need to, based on the mission, but really also based on how the commander chooses to command. It's something we were able to observe, watching the conflict in Europe,' Gen. Patrick Ellis, director of the C2 CFT said Monday during a panel at the Association of the US Army’s annual conference. The C2 CFT was previously known as the Network Cross Functional Team until a recent name change. 'The command posts are constantly changing as a result of the battlefield. So instead of building something from the beginning, that's one big thing, and that our soldiers are just going to take winches to and take apart anyway, this allows us to build something that's a little bit more modular,' he added. The Mission Command on the Move project has long been on the Army’s to-do list. The service first tried out the idea with the Army’s 101st Airborne Division back in August and is currently testing it with the 25th infantry division in Hawaii. Related: Army using ‘transformation in contact’ to make case for new weapons, formation decisions When asked when the requirement will come out of his office, Ellis said he 'won’t put a timeline on it' but it's expected 'relatively quickly.' Industry players are already lining themselves up to aid the push. General Dynamics Land Systems told Breaking Defense in a recent interview that they’re building a sort of systems-of-systems for command posts that the company says will help soldiers stay hidden in contested spaces. Scott Taylor, director of business development for the Army and Special Operations Command at General Dynamics Land Systems, said that his team is working on a concept that 'fuses human, machine integrated capabilities for command post.' 'So what you see is the M10 Booker Combat Vehicle at the centerpiece of that linked with our proven robotic combat vehicle technology that provides a TRX [which stands for Tracked Robot, 10-ton] that can serve as both air and ground defense or protection, but also linked to a smaller robot that can provide deception that confuses and obfuscates the footprint for the command post and makes it harder for the enemy to find those command posts.' Taylor said it's been 'painfully clear' that in an age of 'persistent observation,' including satellite imagery and electromagnetic scanning, that current command posts are 'extremely vulnerable, too stationary &#8230; too large and, frankly, they're too easy to find and kill. To fix the problem, Ellis said during the media roundtable that there’s an existing framework that the new requirement will be based on. However, he said, there will be specific cases where he will need to add 'annex' sections to the requirements so they meet the varying needs of different units. Kitz echoed this statement, saying it may be too early to try to gauge the specific requirements because it’s ultimately up to needs of the warfighter’s particular command post. 'One of the lessons learned of our [command post] configurations is that we have very different demands in different environments, and we can't predict what exactly these commanders are going to need or what exactly the prescribed requirements are going to be,' Kitz said during a media roundtable Monday. Ashley Roque contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-network-team-eyes-new-requirements-for-smaller-mobile-survivable-command-posts/	2024-10-15T10:54:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/antenna-farm-scaled-e1724767823161.jpg
L3Harris protests SNC’s HADES spy plane contract win	A generic rendering of a missionized Bombardier Global 6500. (Bombardier Defense photo) AUSA 2024 — L3Harris has protested the Army’s decision to award Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) a contract to develop a fleet of deep-sensing spy planes — a move that SNC says will delay work on the program. 'L3Harris has filed a formal protest asking the U.S. Government Accountability Office to review the U.S. Army’s decision on the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) contract,' an L3Harris spokesperson said in a statement. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army’s debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation. Our goal remains to ensure that mission operators receive the lowest risk and most capable solution available for an increasingly complex security environment,' they added. 'We believe the protest is not technical in nature. There is no technical merit to L3Harris’s filed protest,' Walsh said. 'We believe they are protesting a minor administrative issue that should not be grounds for the protest and delay such a critical program for the Army.' The protest was filed on Sept. 16, GAO said, and the oversight agency has a deadline to deliver its verdict by Dec. 26. A GAO spokesperson said that by statute, the Army is required to order a work stoppage on the program until the dispute is resolved. The Army did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Aviation Week first reported the protest. The HADES effort calls for converting Bombardier’s Global 6500 business jet into an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform to replace a legacy fleet of RC-12 Guardrail turboprop aircraft. The Army eventually expects to field up to 14 of the jets, which will come with capabilities like moving target indication and signals intelligence. The Army has previously tasked an array of companies with producing 'bridging' aerial ISR assets designed, in part, to inform HADES requirements. Those efforts included: Army officials anticipated that a losing bidder could protest the service’s HADES decision and planned to deliver the first jet to SNC in the October-November time frame once the protest window closed. 'We have to be cognizant that every performer that competes for work has the right to protest if they would like to protest,' Andrew Evans, the director of the Army’s ISR Task Force, previously told Breaking Defense. 'If there’s a protest, we’ll get through that period and the GAO will make a decision about what the future of the award looks like.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/l3harris-protests-sncs-hades-spy-plane-contract-win/	2024-10-15T09:18:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/HADES-Rendering-e1729004326131.jpg
Lockheed launches virtual parts catalog ModSTAR for AI-wielding digital engineers	A wireframe fighter jet sits on a computer chip. (Getty images / Breaking Defense graphic) AUSA 2024 — The world’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin, is pulling from its vast archives of digital engineering data to build a comprehensive 'hardware catalog' of proven, tested components that its designers can draw on, the company announced here Monday. The newly announced initiative, ModSTAR, will feed into the company’s ARISE simulation toolkit announced last year. The combination is meant to let Lockheed engineers run detailed tests of their designs before they even start building a prototype — potentially cutting months and years off development timelines. 'We’re using it for everything,' said Tim Cahill, president of the Missiles &amp; Fire Control division, in a roundtable with reporters. 'We are bidding fewer design cycles. We’re bidding more confident test schedules. We're bidding open system architectures and the ability to quickly change out key components.' Earlier versions of the digital design and virtual testing approach were used for parts of high-profile programs like the Army PrSM (Precision Strike Missile), now being fielded, and the Air Force’s hypersonic ARRW (Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon), currently in programmatic limbo. 'We used pieces of this on PrSM and were able to deliver on PrSM in a fraction of the development time you’d normally need,' Cahill said. 'With ARRW &#8230; folks tend to focus on some of the issues, but [they were] nothing compared to what you might have had for development without using some of these tools.' The basic idea is to build on the aerospace giant’s decades of engineering experience by applying cutting-edge AI tools to the data. 'We have, frankly a hundred years of experience in this [aerospace engineering], decades of experience in modern missiles and fire control systems, and all that data is there,' Cahill said. 'The first time I was a PM [program manager] — that was probably 25, 30 years ago — we were using engineering models for the complete assembly. We just didn’t necessarily have all the engineering data in each of the components.' But today 'build to print' manufacturing practices have become the norm at both at Lockheed Martin’s in-house factories and its legion of subcontractors. This approach requires digital models of everything, to millimeter levels of precision and quality control teams to scan the actual products to check they match. 'It is a big effort, but it has been going on now for many, many years, and every time that we have a upgrade, an enhancement, an obsolete component that is replaced, it goes digital,' Cahill said. 'It’s build-to-print models, [so] it’s not PowerPoint, it’s engineering data.' Modeling specific components with this kind of precision and rigor, in turn, allows engineers to build so-called 'digital twins,' virtual replicas of physical machinery. They can then put the 'twin' through its paces in detailed simulations — trying out far more possible designs, in a far wider range of stressful environments, in far less time and at far less cost than would be possible with physical testing. What particularly excites Cahill, he says, is the ability of ARISE to apply artificial intelligence to analyze the data generated by these simulations. Even the most experienced and attentive human engineers can only detect some of the potential problems, he explained. But when you have those engineers train AI on what to look for, it can check those patterns and find deviations with superhuman accuracy. 'Compute, power, storage and the sophistication of software systems, all it's on some kind of an exponential curve, and so the things that you might have not been able to do three years, five years, much less 10 years ago, you can do today,' Cahill said. 'The system &#8230; will continue to get smarter and smarter as you load it up with data, and it'll continue to get better and better at predicting things.' But AI is only as good as the data it has to go on, which is where ModSTAR’s massive catalog of tested, certified parts comes in. RELATED: &#8216;Poisoned' data could wreck AIs in wartime, warns Army software acquisition chief 'Let’s say you want to build something new,' Cahill explained. 'What you’d like to do be able to do is take pieces that are already qualified and put them together in some combination…. We can rapidly take these digital models put them together and test these different configurations rapidly.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-launches-virtual-parts-catalog-modstar-for-ai-wielding-digital-engineers/	2024-10-15T07:46:19-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/230714_fighter_jet_computer_chip.png
Loitering munitions firm UVision looking to expand in US: CEO	UVision's Hero-120 loitering munition on display. (UVision) AUSA 2024 — As he prepares to attend his first AUSA event as CEO of loitering munition specialist firm UVision, Ran Gozali says his company is looking to expand its footprint across larger, conventional forces, including the US Army. Speaking from Israel on the 'Memorial Day' of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack, Gozali added that his vision of the company also includes transitioning from 'single loitering munitions towards autonomous, multi-launch arrays.' Today, UVision supplies undisclosed special operations units and armed forces around the world with loitering munitions from across its family of products, including the Hero 30, 120 and 400 systems. But as Gozali explained to Breaking Defense, the company is now focused on landing a sizeable chunk of the US Army’s upcoming Low Altitude Stalking and Strike Ordnance (LASSO) program of record, which is expected to publish a request for proposals early next year. According to the US Army’s Program Executive Office (PEO) Soldier, LASSO comprises a 'man-portable, tube launched, lethal payload munition, unmanned aerial system' which includes 'electrical optical /infrared sensor, precision flight control, and the ability to fly, track and engage non-line-of-sight targets and armored vehicles with precision lethal fires.' LASSO will feature three modules, including launch tube, uncrewed aerial system and fire control station, PEO documents added. To better target the US Army, Gozali said, his firm has developed strategic partnerships with SAIC and Mistral, while going through an 'Americanization' process which ensures manufacturing and certain intellectual property remain in the US. The company is now 'focused on LASSO,' for which it is offering its Hero 90 design. The company is also seeking to 'Americanize' its Hero 400 design for future competitions. A few years ago, loitering munitions were a niche capability. But the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, followed by Ukraine and then the war in Gaza, means the capability is now front-and-center — with firms like UVision able to see their systems used in real-world scenarios and then incorporate that feedback. 'Everything is changing,' Goazli said. 'Loitering munitions are the next big thing but they have to be very, very fast and very accurate, smart and connecting to a variety of intelligence-gathering systems. 'The operators of FPVs [first person view drones] are excellent but what we have learned from Ukraine is that you must reduce the burden from the operator on the battlefield. You need to simplify mission execution by the soldier.' This approach, Gozali explained, factors into another offering from the company: an advanced autonomy system based on a 20-ft containerized solution, featuring a command and control module and 24 launch canisters each equipped with a Hero 120. Capable of being deployed onboard a tactical ground vehicle or surface ship, the containerized system will allow operators to receive targeting data from a variety of sources including uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and the DoD’s Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) battle management system to 'simultaneously launch multiple loitering munitions towards various targets,' Gozali said. 'This is a full end-to-end weapon system with a lot of firepower, capable of prosecuting 10 targets simultaneously,' Gozali continued to explain before highlighting the solution’s open architecture and ability to autonomously support mid-course navigation of loitering munitions in GPS-denied environments. 'This is all about having the operator on-the-loop, and not in-the-loop, for more accurate and effective mission execution,' he added. Gozali said the containerized solution could be applied to any member of the Hero family, including the Hero 400 which has a maximum range of 150km, although initial focus at AUSA will continue to concentrate on the Hero 120. 'We have conducted a demonstration of the container on a surface ship which allows greater firepower for surface to land and surface to surface engagements,' he claimed, although he was unable to provide details. AUSA is set to witness a variety of loitering munition solutions this year. Anduril has finally unveiled its Bolt-M solution which is already under contract with the US Marine Corps as part of its consideration of an Organic Fire Precision-Lite (OPF-L) capability. The Bolt-M, which has an endurance of 40 minutes and maximum range of 20km, received a system development contract in April to support OPF-L alongside offerings from Teledyne FLIR and Aerovironment. The OPF-L program is worth up to $249 million and is expected to run for eight years as the USMC seeks to provide dismounted personnel with 'precision strike capability against adversaries beyond the line of sight.' Also at AUSA, Teledyne FLIR plans to present a 'six-pack'’ tube launcher for its Rogue 1 loitering munition, integrated on board the M3 RCV-Light. A company spokesperson informed Breaking Defense it remained a 'technology concept for extending uncrewed precision strike capability on the battlefield.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/loitering-munitions-firm-uvision-looking-to-expand-in-us-ceo/	2024-10-15T06:20:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240405_UVision_Hero120_handout-e1712320582337.jpeg

French Navy close to launch of new VSR700 UAS program phase: Airbus Helicopters CEO	The Airbus Helicopters VSR700 UAS on display at the manufacturer's production facility in Marignane, France (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — The French Navy and the country’s DGA military procurement agency will likely launch the next phase of the Airbus Helicopters VSR700 unmanned aircraft system (UAS) program in a matter of 'weeks or months,' leading to further 'incremental development' of the aircraft and entry into service in the next two to three years, according to Bruno Even, Airbus Helicopters CEO. The expected move comes after successful flight tests of a VSR700 demonstrator off the service’s multi-purpose FREMM frigate last year and that fall under its SDAM (Navy Airborne Drone System) de-risking technology line of effort. Airbus and Naval Group, joint developers of the drone, were awarded an SDAM development contract in 2018. 'We are discussing with the Navy and the French DGA and I'm optimistic that we'll be able to decide the launch of the [VSR700] program in the coming weeks or months, again, at the time where we see the need for more and more unmanned capability,' Even told reporters during an Airbus Helicopters press day held at the company’s production facility in Marignane, France, last week. 'What we propose for the Loi de programmation militaire (France’s long-term defense spending program) &#8230; is incremental evolution [and] to enter into service with the VSR by 2026 or 2027,' Even said. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and accommodation for the trip.) Depending on how France wants to proceed with the VSR700's next phase, it could either decide to 'sign for a development programme first, then sign a contract to launch production,' or commit to both at the same time, an Airbus spokesperson told Breaking Defense in follow on comments Friday. Even said Airbus, the French Navy and DGA are in discussion about aircraft quantities but declined to comment on an exact figure. He also noted that under the SDAM de-risking phase, the uncrewed helicopter had met 'all' operational requirements. Figures from France’s long term defense plan 2024-2030 [PDF] indicate that Paris has committed to acquiring 10 SDAM aircraft by the end of the decade and at least 15 by 2035. Aviation Week reported in June, however, that Airbus could face competition to secure a SDAM production contract from Austria's Schiebel S-300 rotary wing UAS. Capable of vertical take off and landings and based off France's Guimbal Cabri G2 light helicopter, the VSR700 has, to date, been designed to support naval based intelligence, surveillance, targeting and reconnaissance (ISTAR) and anti-submarine warfare (ASW) operations, but Even revealed that it 'could perfectly deliver a logistic mission' for the French Army, in a separate configuration. Airbus has not yet started design of such an aircraft, he stated.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/french-navy-close-to-launch-of-new-vsr700-uas-program-phase-airbus-helicopters-ceo/	2024-10-15T04:33:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_1999-e1728651740796.jpg

Norway edges closer to long-range precision fires selection	A High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) with the 1st Battalion, 181st Field Artillery Regiment fires toward a designated target at Yausubetsu Training Area, Hokkaido, Japan (US Army) AUSA 2024 — Norway expects to take a major step forward with one of its key land warfare acquisition priorities by selecting a new long-range precision fires system, likely in the 'summer' of next year and ahead of entry to service in 2027 or 2028, according to the Nordic nation’s top army official. Maj. Gen. Lars Lervik, Chief of Staff of the Norwegian Army, told Breaking Defense that Oslo is in the process of receiving offers from industry competitors who have been asked to detail 'price, timings, capabilities' and delivery timeframes. 'We are currently in the process of considering different options,' he said. 'It's either a FMS [US Foreign Military Sales] case … or we buy from other manufacturers. We are looking at sometime, hopefully before summer next year, we hope to have a [weapon system selection] decision.' In August, the US State Department approved the potential sale of 16 Lockheed Martin M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and supporting equipment, valued at $580 million, to Norway. But that approval doesn't mean the sale is final and, as a rival bid, South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace is pitching the K239 Chunmoo Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). Moving from the selection decision to entry to service for the long range fires weapons system, as early as 2027 or 2028, would be possible based on 'realistic production times,' suggested Lervik. Norway has already requested technical information from industry under the Long Range Precision Fire System (LRPF) program, including weapon system guidance performance, munitions communications, warhead target sets, maximum range, flight time, test and qualification procedures, according to a request for information solicitation posted online. The document calls specifically for a 'self-propelled' LRPF capable of protecting northern Norway, launching missiles and guided rockets with a range in excess of 300 kilometers (186 miles). The future platform must also be compatible with Norwegian Command, Control, Communication, and Computers (C4I) systems. In April, Norway announced a 'historic' hike in defense spending, based on expenditure of NOK 1.6 trillion ($150 billion) out to 2036, aligned to a new long-term defense plan that includes commitment to a new long-range, ground based air defense (GBAD) and an expansion of the Norweigian Army to three brigades, instead of one. Despite such a focus, Lervik acknowledged that 'most of the money' on offer will be spent on the Royal Norwegian Navy. Still he suggested the country’s parliament, responsible for approving spending, was right to take the 'military advice' of Gen. Eirik Kristoffersen, Chief of Defence of Norway, when approving the spending and defense plans. 'What we are going for is a balanced armed forces, still rather small, but balanced,' Lervik added. 'That's been my key, I think that's important, not to go too much to one direction. I think that's what we're doing with what’s been decided.' At a broader level, he said that the strategic picture in the High North has not changed significantly, of late, as Russia continues to prioritize war against Ukraine. Lervik noted he was 'more optimistic' about Europe’s ammunition crisis, because of investments by the Norwegian government in Nammo, the country’s main ammunition producer. 'I share [the view] with all my partners, all my colleagues, that we need to restock, both from what has been donated to Ukraine, but also to have sufficient [national] stocks,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/norway-edges-closer-to-long-range-precision-fires-selection/	2024-10-14T13:38:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240806_DVIDS_GMLRS_Australia_5673744-e1723560734745.jpg
‘Hard choices’ afoot if Army unable to grow its annual budget, Wormuth warns	Secretary of the Army Christine Wormuth visiting the ASC Headquarters on Rock Island Arsenal, Illinois, in June 2022. (Linda Lambiotte/ASC Public Affairs) AUSA 2024 — Over the past several years, the US Army’s annual budget has remained relatively flat. If that trend continues, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth warned that the service will need to take a hard look at what weapons program to cut. '[We are] constantly looking at the different programs and again, trying to make decisions that are data driven, so that we don't inadvertently allow the resources we're spending on soldiers and families to crowd out the modernization that we have to continue with,' Wormuth told reporters today at the Association of the US Army’s annual conference. 'If our budgets remain flat as they have in the last few years, we're going to continue to have to make really hard choices,' she later added. For context, the service discretionary spending request for fiscal 2025 came in at $185.9 billion and included $14.1 billion for research and development (R&amp;D) efforts and $24.4 billion for weapon procurement. While neither Wormuth nor Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George identified a tipping point for when the service would need to start terminating weapon programs en masse. Earlier this year, the service unveiled a massive aviation overhaul that included saying goodbye to Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) development and phasing out the Shadow and Raven unmanned aerial systems. But as service leaders like Wormuth and George craft budget and weapons plans, part of their calculus includes testing out new technologies with soldiers, in part, under the newer 'transformation in contact' initiative. That newer transformation in contact initiative is a pet project for George. The four-star general’s push has included sending developmental high-energy lasers to the Middle East for testing against drone threats, and selecting units to test out new tech and weapons for feedback on how they would be used inside the formation as well as tweaks to the very formations themselves. 'There is risk in testing new systems in challenging environments and getting soldiers hands-on experience with new technology in the field, but we do not have the luxury of time to wait for perfection: We must field to learn,' Wormuth said during her opening ceremony speech. The push is expected to remain a hot topic during the conference, with George teasing a new 'transformation in contact' 2.0 announcement coming later this week but declining to disclose just what it will entail.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hard-choices-afoot-if-army-unable-to-grow-its-annual-budget-wormuth-warns/	2024-10-14T13:08:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/rock-island-scaled-e1696698295934.jpg
Stryker MCWS: A milestone in lethality and innovation	Oshkosh Defense MCWS conducting operations during FOT&amp;E at Yakima. (image courtesy of Oshkosh Defense) The Stryker Medium Caliber Weapon System (MCWS) program represents a significant advancement in soldier lethality, with its focus on enhanced firepower, operational flexibility, and soldier-centered design. As the program moves through critical milestones, it has significant future growth potential not only for the U.S. Army but also for international allies and partners seeking adaptable and effective weapon systems. Meeting Modern Battlefield Demands The MCWS Program of Record integrates the Oshkosh Defense weapon system onto the Stryker Infantry Carrier Double V Hull (ICVVA1), creating a formidable platform capable of handling modern battlefield threats. The Oshkosh MCWS incorporates a blend of features specifically designed for the Stryker mission. Based on the proven Rafael Samson Remote Weapon System (RWS), the MCWS introduces several improvements aimed at addressing previous performance gaps in the Stryker 'Dragoon' vehicle, which it replaces. It provides an effective and efficient Remote Weapon Station (RWS) for the XM813 30mm cannon, M240 coaxial machine gun, Ammunition Handling System (AHS), and optics. 'The Stryker MCWS provides improved firepower and increased accuracy at longer ranges,' said Pat Williams, chief programs officer at Oshkosh Defense. 'It is a lightweight system that does not compromise the mobility or survivability of the Stryker platform, ensuring that soldiers can operate effectively in diverse combat environments.' Key Milestones and Progress to Date In June 2021, Oshkosh Defense secured a five-year requirements contract, which includes production for up to six Stryker Brigade Combat Teams (SBCTs). To date, Oshkosh has received orders for three SBCTs, with more than 100 systems delivered to the U.S. Army. Oshkosh recently completed Production Verification Testing (PVT) at Aberdeen Test Center in Maryland, as well as Follow-On Operational Test and Evaluation (FOT&amp;E) at Yakima Training Center in Washington. These evaluations involved rigorous gunnery and force-on-force exercises, where Soldiers operated the MCWS in realistic battlefield conditions. 'FOT&amp;E is a critical part of the test process because it puts the system in the hands of Soldiers,' Williams explained. 'We’ve received positive feedback about the increased capability, and while we expect to make some changes based on Soldier input, it will not delay the fielding of the system in early 2025.' Soldier-Centric Design and Feedback Integration One of the defining aspects of the Oshkosh MCWS is its close collaboration with the U.S. Army throughout the program to ensure that the MCWS addresses operational challenges faced by troops in the field. The MCWS includes a dual feed, linkless ammunition handling system that is critical for maintaining high levels of operational flexibility in dynamic environments. Other key enhancements include improved day/night optics, increased ammunition storage, and enhanced situational awareness. 'The system we are delivering today is a direct result of Soldier feedback,' Williams said. 'Their input helped shape the requirements for this program, and we are proud to deliver a system that meets their needs on the modern battlefield.' Fielding and Future Plans The Stryker MCWS program is on track for fielding in early 2025, starting with the first. All systems for this brigade have already been delivered, signaling the beginning of a broader rollout to additional units. While Oshkosh Defense’s immediate priority is to meet the U.S. Army’s needs, the company is also eyeing future opportunities for the MCWS platform. The turret’s lightweight and flexible design make it adaptable to a variety of platforms, expanding its potential use beyond the Stryker vehicle. Oshkosh has already demonstrated the integration of the MCWS turret on BAE Systems’ Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) and the Oshkosh Defense Robotic Combat Vehicle (RCV), showcasing the system’s versatility in both manned and unmanned applications. 'We’ve shown that the MCWS has the flexibility to be integrated onto various platforms,' Williams noted. 'And we continue to explore additional capabilities, such as an Anti-Tank Guided Missile (ATGM) pop-up launcher, for international partners interested in that capability.'

(image courtesy of Oshkosh Defense) Enhancing the Army’s Modernization Efforts As the Army continues its modernization efforts, the Stryker MCWS is positioned to play a critical role in enhancing the combat effectiveness of SBCTs. The system’s ability to provide increased lethality while maintaining mobility and survivability makes it an ideal solution for the evolving demands of modern warfare. Moreover, the MCWS meets the Army’s affordability goals, delivering a high-performance solution while staying under budget. This balance of cost-effectiveness and operational capability has been a driving factor in the program’s success to date. 'The MCWS delivers transformational lethality at a price well below the Army’s affordability targets,' Williams emphasized. 'It’s a win for the Soldiers, the Army, and the taxpayer.' Looking Ahead: A Future Built on Flexibility As the Stryker MCWS program moves toward full-scale fielding, its future potential continues to grow. The system’s modular design allows for easy upgrades and integration of additional technologies, ensuring that it can evolve to meet new threats and challenges. With its demonstrated performance in testing and the positive feedback from Soldiers, the MCWS is set to become an asset of the U.S. Army’s armored vehicle fleet for years to come. Oshkosh Defense remains committed to working closely with the Army to deliver innovative solutions that enhance the safety, survivability, and lethality of the warfighter. 'We’re excited to see this system in the hands of Soldiers and look forward to building on its success,' Williams said. 'Innovation never rests, and neither do we.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/stryker-mcws-a-milestone-in-lethality-and-innovation/	2024-10-14T12:36:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/FOTE_Strykers_VinD_0004_Layer-1-copy.png
Army putting ‘significant … emphasis’ on air and missile defense with looming investments	A Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Cost Reduction Initiative missile is launched during an Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) flight test at White Sands Missile Range. (US Army/Darrell Ames) AUSA 2024 — As Army leaders put the finishing touches on tentative budget plans through 2030, they are literally banking on air and missile defense being a chief priority, according to a pair of senior officials. 'We're still working on the ‘26 POM [program objective memorandum] submission across the department, but if you look at the trajectory of where we've been the last couple of years [for air and missile defense, it’s a] significant area of emphasis and growth,' Army Under Secretary Gabe Camarillo told Breaking Defense during an interview ahead of this week’s Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC. Camarillo and Army acquisition head Doug Bush say they are eyeing a myriad of air and missile defense investments that includes beefing up the Patriot force and number of counter-unmanned aircraft systems (C-UAS) to develop new interceptors to down incoming threats. That continued focus on identifying ways to protect fixed sites and soldiers on the move from incoming aerial threats comes as insights from the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East continue rolling in, including from a recently announced deployment of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) battery to Israel along with US troops to operate it. Speaking with reporters today, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth declined to say which unit was bound for Israel or when it would arrive, but said the service is not overly concerned about the deployment's strain on the force. 'The THAAD deployment will have about 100 soldiers who will go over to Israel &#8230; that's not a very large number of soldiers, so it's not adding, you know, a tremendous amount of additional strain, broadly, to the community,' she said. 'But as you know, the Air Defense Artillery community is the most stressed, they have the highest [operational tempo] really, of any part of the Army.' Deployments like this one, combined with observations around the globe are, in part, fueling budgeting plans that span the fiscal 2026-2030 timeframe, although a new presidential administration could upend everything. While neither Camarillo nor Bush disclosed just what that perceived air defense investment is envisioned to land at, they did drill down on a few focal points. The Army’s Patriot force, for example, currently consists of 15 battalions but is one of the most in-demand assets inside the service. So, to help alleviate the stress on those units, the service is planning to add an additional two battalions to the force over the next five years, and the funding to do that will be spread out over that time period, Camarillo explained. But, he added, 'it's hard to say' if 17 battalions will be the sweet spot. 'We see a lot more demand than we can possibly keep up with, that's one of the reasons … the air defense force is so strained, frequent deployments [and the] significant demand signal to meet hotspots all over the world,' Camarillo said. 'It’s not just the [Central Command area of responsibility] CENTCOM AOR, it’s Europe, and other places like the Pacific. 'One of the reasons we focused so heavily on air defense in our last force structure change was to try to give us more options and give us more units, and grow those capabilities so that we can meet worldwide demand,' he added. By summer 2025, the Army is also expected to have its eighth THAAD battery fully operational, while it also continues testing out its new Indirect Fire Protection Capability Increment 2 (IFPC Inc 2) launcher. If IFPC Inc 2 testing proceeds smoothly, the service will be acquiring the launchers in mass and building out units to man them to defend against threats like supersonic cruise missiles. Developing and fielding new C-UAS weapons is expected to remain a top budget priority and a focus at this year’s AUSA conference as well. Just a mere two weeks ago, for example, the Pentagon unveiled its new Replicator 2 initiative to find C-UAS systems to defend fixed sites inside and outside of the continental United States. While Camarillo declined to disclose which systems the Army could put forward as potential contenders for funding, he noted it could be a mix of existing systems or ones in development. 'All of the services will be looking at participating in Replicator as a way to ensure that we can break down barriers in terms of policy, ensure that we are addressing production and manufacturing challenges and cohesively investing R&amp;D [research and development] funding to try to get the next generation capabilities that we can produce and field at scale,' he said. In a separate interview with Breaking Defense, Bush explained that it is not just about picking the most capable system for base defense. The Office of the Secretary of Defense, he explained, has asked the services to look at specific sites and respond with estimates of just what the cost and timeline would be to set up C-UAS defenses there. But because some of those sites are inside the US, that brings along an extra layer of scrutiny and regulation. 'We have restrictions here for good reasons that we don't have … [in] Jordan or Iraq,' Bush added. 'There are some significant policy issues that have to be worked through … in parallel.' That means it's not just a question of how quickly the services can scale production of new C-UAS systems, but instead a broader policy examination across the Department of Defense and other government agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and Department of Homeland Security. Regardless, Bush said he anticipates that the forthcoming FY26 budget request will reflect the way ahead on fixed-site protection and bets on Replicator 2. Replicator plans aside, both Camarillo and Bush said they are eyeing ways to spread the C-UAS bets across a variety of portfolios, including directed energy options — both high-energy lasers and high-powered microwaves — and kinetic ones too. 'You need a kind of portfolio approach, there's not one system that's going to solve the challenge: You need missile-based systems, such as Coyote and Roadrunner, … but you also need directed energy of different forms … and we believe we need a gun-based, low-cost system,' Bush said. When it comes to those previously disclosed mixed results with testing a 50-kilowatt laser on Strykers in the Middle East this year, the service is adjusting and moving out with a new prototyping effort aimed at better sustainability and, possibly, a lower power class for smaller vehicles and robots. 'The army is fully committed to ensuring that we field directed energy systems at scale as quickly as we possibly can to defeat this [UAS] threat,' Camarillo said. 'It's not just one thing that's going to defeat the small UAS threat, it is a range of approaches that we have to take, and we have to place many bets along different areas to ensure we're constantly ahead of this highly evolving threat,' he added. On the kinetic side, the Army is eyeing what comes after the Coyote interceptor and at a lower price point. Bush also cited the need for additional proximity rounds for cheaper per-unit shots. He noted that the Army is using such 30-millimeter rounds in theater today, and said it is considering outfitting Bradley Fighting Vehicles with additional caliber sizes for an enhanced C-UAS capability. 'We are focused on things that are cheaper and things that you can spread across the whole Army, not just in air defense units, because we're also learning that it can't just be an air defense unit mission, it's going to be in every unit in the Army … like we’re seeing in Ukraine,' Bush said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-putting-significant-emphasis-on-air-and-missile-defense-with-looming-investments/	2024-10-14T12:33:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/pac-3-e1728400253523.jpg
Flight of the Gray Eagle: How a proven platform evolves	GA-ASI’s latest Gray Eagle variant, Gray Eagle 25M, successfully conducted its first flight on December 5, 2023. Much like the U.S. Army it supports, the Gray Eagle uncrewed aerial system is constantly evolving. Today’s Gray Eagle 25M and Gray Eagle Short Takeoff and Landing variant, also known as Gray Eagle STOL, are the most capable aircraft in their class anywhere in the world. Their capabilities have been achieved through continuous enhancements and upgrades, building brick on top of brick to reach new heights by standing on the firm foundations of what came before. Iterating based on proven increments lets the Army and other users gain a new level of performance with the lowest amount of risk. That’s been the Gray Eagle story since the beginning. Earning its reputation during counterinsurgency operations while adapting both the aircraft and its capabilities to large-scale combat operations demonstrates true transformation in contact—a top Army goal for now and the coming years. The Gray Eagle continues to be a relevant asset deployed in every area of conflict with U.S. or coalition soldiers. The first aircraft grew out of the original Predator®. The Army sought a new unmanned aircraft to support commanders’ battlefield needs in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. But the new platform, initially nicknamed the 'Warrior,' quickly took on its own identity. The new look One reason was that the Gray Eagle did not have a turboprop engine. Instead, it flew with a heavy fuel piston aircraft engine that responded to the Army’s single-fuel approach in the battlefield concept. This enabled the aircraft to burn either jet or diesel fuel, simplifying logistics for units as they operated in expeditionary environments. Another reason was that the Gray Eagle was purpose-designed to be flown by an Army cadre of enlisted Soldiers. This didn’t require traditional aircraft-style stick-and-rudder flying. Instead, Soldiers would use highly automated controls to fly the Gray Eagle from a laptop or similar hardware. Gray Eagle would take off and land automatically through secure line-of-sight links with no need for operator interaction and conduct its beyond-line-of-sight mission via satellite communications, providing the Army multiple command and control options in contested environments. Gray Eagles have recorded hundreds of thousands of these automatic takeoffs and landings, demonstrating advanced levels of automation and autonomy. The success of the Gray Eagle quickly induced the Army to support additional upgrades. An extended range model doubled its range and endurance, thus providing the key discriminator for reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition missions: persistence. The ability to observe, report, detect, and influence threats both kinetically and non-kinetically, from a single platform, with the unblinking eye of an array of long-range sensors, is one of the keys to creating overmatch for ground forces. One test aircraft flew for nearly two days nonstop in a demonstration above Southern California. As the Gray Eagle was improving, the Army was adapting to it, too. The service began to pioneer the doctrine and systems for what is now known as manned-unmanned teaming, pairing Gray Eagle with the purpose-built AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopter. Crew members aboard these aircraft could seamlessly transmit and receive data from the Gray Eagle and even take control of the payloads or the aircraft if necessary. Manned-unmanned teaming enables both aviation and ground forces to work together in ways that weren’t possible before. A flight of Apaches might use Gray Eagles to observe distant targets to coordinate their approach. An infantry unit might guide one sensor to confirm a target. At the same time, the onboard synthetic aperture radar might detect inbound threat drones and send tracking data to a shooter—or Gray Eagle might employ its own onboard systems against the threat. The Gray Eagle of tomorrow, today Building on these practices is what has brought manufacturer General Atomics Aeronautical Systems to the newest and most capable variant: the Gray Eagle 25M (GE 25M). With an improved heavy-fuel engine, greater onboard power, significantly reduced maintenance, and other refinements, including an expeditionary laptop-based ground control station, GE 25M epitomizes the Army’s concept of transformation in contact and is the Gray Eagle the Army needs for the future fight. Staying with manned-unmanned teaming, GE 25M’s modular open system architecture incorporates rapid, low-risk, low-cost integration of current and future applications, including a new breed of air-launched effects and long-range sensors. These additions increase the survivability of both the aircraft and the troops it supports while preserving all the multi-mission capabilities of the Gray Eagle. Imagine the Army needs to close with a sophisticated adversary on a large battlefield. The enemy is defending its position with advanced air defense systems. Gray Eagle 25M approaches the forward line of troops, releasing one or more launched effects. These expendable, low-observable systems sniff out the enemy’s radars without the need to put a human in danger. Once located—with Gray Eagle 25M acting as the quarterback for multiple launched effects relaying their findings—friendly aircraft, long-range fires, or other effects eliminate the air defense threat, permitting the maneuver elements to advance into their attack unharassed and potentially unobserved by threat-loitering sensors. When equipped with the EagleEye synthetic aperture radar, Gray Eagle can detect and track threat drones well beyond current ground-based options in addition to detecting ground targets out to 80 km and maritime targets out to 200 km. Gray Eagle 25M’s other improvements include a high degree of electronic threat resilience, vision-based navigation in which onboard systems can recognize what it senses to counter GPS jamming, SATCOM anti-jam technologies, and a new engine designed to reduce long-term costs, sustainment, field service representatives, and spares along with an expeditionary laptop ground control element. Gray Eagle 25M embraces the Army’s modular open systems approach in which any number of sensors, effectors, or other payloads can integrate rapidly with the aircraft. This versatility allows GE 25M to adapt at the speed of threats affordably. It has already proven its effectiveness by integrating multi-intelligence sensors in an operational theater against live threats and by utilizing the Army’s new class of launched effects at Yuma Proving Ground, Arizona. Gray Eagle STOL The next generation of Gray Eagle incorporates all the aircraft improvements in 25M with another innovative twist: the ability to take off and land in much shorter distances on unimproved surfaces or ships at sea. Commanders can choose virtually any bases of operation and take advantage of unconventional locations not normally affiliated with unmanned aircraft or aviation operations as an added level of survivability and surprise. The aircraft emerged from a well-known record-breaking demonstrator known as Mojave, which caught the attention of the aerospace world as it logged first after first as part of a company-funded program. GA-ASI’s Mojave UAS STOL demonstrator completed multiple successful takeoffs and landings on a dirt strip near El Mirage, California, on August 1, 2023. Mojave took off and landed with a fraction of the ground roll of a traditional aircraft at a dirt field and from the British aircraft carrier HMS Prince of Wales. The aircraft also conducted a field integration achieving a first pass hit on targets with the Dillon Aero DAP-6 minigun in a live-fire test at the Army’s Yuma Proving Ground. Benefitting from these proven accomplishments and the commonality of the shared advanced data links and ground modernization with Gray Eagle 25M, Mojave was designated as Gray Eagle STOL. With the ability to perform reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition—or RSTA—as well as attack, contested logistics, and other missions, Gray Eagle STOL showcases new flexibility in where and how U.S. and allied forces can operate to support the full spectrum of missions in large-scale combat operations. Gray Eagle STOL might go with American forces into an expeditionary base deep downrange, co-locating with them as necessary to support missions, including delivery of supplies with the range to reach from island chain to island chain for units separate from the main body. Operating from a semi-prepared landing zone, a dirt road, or any paved surface, it expands commanders’ options. An artist rendering of the Gray Eagle STOL UAS, GA-ASI’s most rugged UAS design, built for expeditionary mission support. The aircraft also might provide armed overwatch combined with logistics support for small units deployed in a maritime environment. Picture a detachment of soldiers stationed on a small island where Gray Eagle STOL makes regular flights to resupply and rearm without risk to a human aircraft crew—while also providing reconnaissance and, if necessary, armed response against hostile incursions. The possibilities are endless, making it easy to envision more missions and capabilities on the horizon. The Army can get there because of its success building the Gray Eagle 25M as the backbone for the data links, avionics, and expeditionary ground control stations over time to achieve a ruggedized, reliable, relevant, and survivable multi-mission capable platform.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/flight-of-the-gray-eagle-how-a-proven-platform-evolves/	2024-10-14T11:23:58-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/2312_ASI_2256_GE-25M-First-Flight_L12170_screen_APPROVED.jpg
Pitching US market, Leonardo UK launches BriteStorm attritable UAS stand-in jammer	Concept art showing the BriteStorm stand-in jammer equipped on an Air Launched Effect (ALE) and UAS. (Leonardo) AUSA 2024 — Making the US market a top priority for orders, Leonardo UK today unveiled a new lightweight, stand-in jamming system to be equipped on attritable Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and Air Launched Effects (ALE). Designed to operate ahead of friendly forces and suppress Integrated Air Defence Systems (IADS), the 2.5-kilogram (5.5 pound) Electronic Warfare (EW) airborne countermeasure has already undergone successful flight trials with the UK’s Rapid Capabilities Office — a future technologies and test agency — while three US-based test assets are currently being used to demonstrate the capability to potential customers stateside, Leonardo UK executives told Breaking Defense. In bid to secure BriteStorm industrial agreements, the manufacturer has also opened talks with prime manufacturers involved in the US Air Force's Combat Collaborative Aircraft (CCA), US Army's Future Tactical UAS (FTUAS) and other DoD-led Air Launched Effects (ALE) programs. The company was moved to develop BriteStorm due to a 'drive in the market' for an attritable UAS integrated jamming capability that can stay ahead of friendly forces, in order to deliver 'sophisticated countermeasure techniques,' as an alternative to the more traditional method of 'large, expensive, strategic' standoff or escort jamming aircraft sitting behind them, said Mark Randall, EW campaign manager at Leonardo UK. 'It's hard to shift towards a contested environment where you cannot be sure you've got freedom of maneuver, freedom of action, and doing everything that you possibly can do to suppress and confuse the enemy &#8230; [but that] is exactly what BriteStorm has been developed to do,' he explained, adding the system has 'applicability across all three domains.' Leonardo has already 'sold' a number of BriteStorm payloads to the UK’s Rapid Capabilities Office, which has conducted 'successful flight trials' with the system, according to Randall. Leonardo UK declined to comment on aircraft that took part in the tests, but Randall noted that an 'element' of the UK’s Autonomous Collaborative Platform (ACP) strategy [PDF], a derivative to CCA, relates directly to new EW capabilities. The strategy identifies a Suppression of Enemy Air Defence (SEAD) mission, underpinned by stand in jamming and decoy capabilities, as one possible use case for autonomous and collaborative type UAS. A focus on gaining a foothold on the US stand-in jammer market persists for Leonardo however. 'At the moment, we've got three trial assets in the US, which we're using to demonstrate [BriteStorm] to the end user community, and we are already very pleased with the number of US primes involved in the programs we just talked about [FTUAS, CCA and ALE efforts] who are coming to us to discuss what EW payload capability we can provide,' said Michael Lea, VP Sales EW at Leonardo UK. Griffon Aerospace and Textron Systems are competing for FTUAS, which seeks a RQ-7B Shadow UAS replacement. Meanwhile, General Atomics and Anduril were contracted in April to build the first tranche of CCA prototypes. Evolved from the manufacturer’s BriteCloud active expendable decoy, set for integration on US F-35 fifth generation sets, and its Digital Radio Frequency Memory (DRFM) technology, BriteStorm serves to suppress ground based radars, as opposed to the former’s speciality of disrupting incoming missile radar guidance platforms, said Leonardo in a company statement today. 'BriteStorm works by using Leonardo’s mission-tested DRFM technology to detect and evaluate the electronic warfare threat environment and then choose the most relevant countermeasure technique,' it added. Sharing electronic 'noise' or confusing enemy radars with 'dozens' of false fighter jet signatures are among a range of techniques BriteStorm operators can tap into to overwhelm and suppress threats. As part of a 'capability spiral' for BriteCloud, Leonardo plans on adding a 'live update' capability to those jamming techniques, which will be enabled through 'communication links,' said Randall. A 'standard' BriteStorm payload includes a 'platform-specific' antenna, transmit-receive modules and the Leonardo manufactured Miniature Technique Generator, according to the company statement. The system is produced out of the Leonardo UK EW research and manufacturing hub in Luton, England.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/pitching-us-market-leonardo-uk-launches-britestorm-attritable-uas-stand-in-jammer/	2024-10-14T10:00:24-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/BriteStorm-install-on-Launched-Effect-and-UAV-scaled.jpg
5 questions with the 3-star general leading Army Materiel Command	Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan, then the deputy commanding general for Army Materiel Command, addresses the audience during the AUSA 2023 in Washington, DC (US Army/Leroy Council) AUSA 2024 — From repositioning US Army equipment in Europe to eyeing new autonomous capabilities in the air, in the water and on the ground, acting commanding general Army Materiel Command, Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan is pursuing a host of initiatives aimed at the better distribution of weapons and equipment. Ahead of this week’s Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC, Breaking Defense spoke with the three-star general about how conflicts around the globe and emerging tech are shaping AMC planning. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: Starting with the broader picture, can you provide an update of AMC’s role in supporting Ukraine and setting the theater? MOHAN: We continue our operations for support to our Ukrainian partners, and that has been a heavy lift all across the organic industrial base. And so at Red River Army Depot, it’s seven days a week, two shifts a day, working on equipment. At the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant, that plant is shut down for a total of four hours per week, and that is so maintenance crews can do preventive maintenance… but other than that, it's running 24/7, as well as up at Scranton [where the team] is working seven days a week on multiple shifts. So we are continuing our surge operations… It is an absolute battle drill at this point, as presidential drawdown directives get released, we identify the sourcing and then we start flowing the material. But at the same time, we are working with our partners in US Army Europe and Africa and 21st Theater Sustainment Command (TSC), in particular, and we have depot teams forward from the expeditionary organic industrial base to rebuild track maintenance capability so that we have more options forward. We have depot maintainers who are working to reset some of the APS [Army Prepositioned Stock] equipment that's seen a high utilization, as well as we have depot teams working with our partners…who are training Polish mechanics on the operation of US equipment. You are also in the process of moving one APS brigade combat team set of equipment to Powidz, Poland. Where does that stand today? So that started with a NATO project several years ago. &#8230; Powidz, Poland is home to one of the largest airfields in Europe. &#8230; It is a massive airfield that is a central hub for not only Poland, but also NATO. Part of the US facilities there is a state-of-the art APS storage facility with dedicated maintenance bays. Our Polish allies upgraded the rail infrastructure to increase the mobility coming in; they upgraded power and the road infrastructure, as well, to build out a world-class facility. We signed for the keys to it in late spring, early summer [2024]&#8230; [and] within the last 45 days, in conjunction with our partners in the 21st TSC, we have been moving in that heavy brigade combat team [-worth of equipment] that was being stored at Coleman [in Germany] &#8230; and it's almost 100 percent moved in now. Because a lot of the new equipment has not been documented yet, the changes have not rolled down to APS. But [Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George] is full speed ahead on the transformation experimentation, the rollout of new kit, [and] he's also being very deliberate about making sure that when we actually get to the documentation phase, that we make the right decisions. We've just started to really integrate ourselves [with plans for transformation in contact]. And so right now, from the sustainment community, the contested logistics cross-functional team has been intimately involved with all things transforming [in] contact and all things modernization. From our standpoint, the direction I am taking with this — the broader sustainment enterprise — is to really focus on those processes that we believe will better enable soldiers. We're going to focus on the transformation in contact units, to streamline their operations … [to] think about helping them be more mobile by sweeping all their excess equipment &#8230; to put [those items] back in the supply system or dispose of, so we've lightened their load as well. On top of that, we've got some property accountability pilots that we've executed at Fort Liberty, which is basically streamlining how long it takes to inventory equipment using modern tools that are loaded on an iPhone. Another layer is advanced manufacturing. So, when the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division was down at the JRTC [Joint Readiness Training Center], we actually had a team from TACOM [the Tank-automotive and Armaments Command] down there, and we pushed a digital file from our digital repository of available parts to print. &#8230; We haven't pushed that type of capability down that low, and so in the future we're working with them to try to integrate that type of reality into [combat training center] CTC rotations. What is the AMC’s tentative approach for 3D printing? Printing at the tactical level is designed to specifically impact combat power for specific missions. It's not the panacea that's going to solve all our Class IX [supply system] problems, but it is a way to rapidly affect readiness for specific things so that units can continue their mission. Our Ukrainian partners, because of necessity, are pushing the boundaries on how they do this — both at the tactical level and all the way back at their depot system as well. The world has a lot to learn from how our Ukrainian partners are working. Are you eyeing any new requirements or capabilities to help on the logistics front such as autonomous trucks or heavy lift helicopters, or additional ships? In conjunction with the contested logistics cross-functional team and CASCOM [Combined Arms Support Command], we are really interested in autonomous distribution — both air and ground. We’ve spoken before about telemaintenance and how we're doing diagnosis over the horizon. &#8230; Think about if we had a fleet of autonomous delivery vehicles that we could place under in the belly of a [unmanned aerial system] UAS, and then that UAS could bypass other choke points in the distribution system and go right to the point of need, and then return to base. That technology is out there. I'm hoping at Project Convergence 5 that we will see some of that demonstrated but we know, for example, that there's a company that will test fly a UAS that will carry 20,000 pounds. The other piece is, and it's not just the air, it's not just the ground, it's also the sea. We have seen demonstrated autonomous watercraft that are either semi-submersible or traditional looking watercraft. &#8230; That capability is out there. We have to change the way that we look at the requirement and be willing to go after these autonomous capabilities, and we're driving that at our level.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/5-questions-with-the-3-star-general-leading-army-materiel-command/	2024-10-14T09:07:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/mohan-scaled-e1728568333203.jpg
Airbus keeps H175M ‘industrial footprint’ options open after NMH withdrawal	The H175M super medium class aircraft on display at Airbus Helicopters production facility in Marignane, France (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — The head of Airbus Helicopters says it is not closing any doors to industrial agreements, including the offer of in-country production, as the company bids to secure a launch customer order for the H175M helicopter in the wake of withdrawing from the UK’s New Medium Helicopter (NMH) acquisition. Talks with a number of 'other customers' besides London are underway, but an 'industry footprint' for the super medium-class aircraft has still to be decided, said Airbus Helicopters CEO Bruno Even. 'We know that we are ready to propose this whole partnership with some of our customers, in order to produce this capability locally for them, but also to be able to export this new program to address the export opportunity,' he told reporters during an Airbus Helicopters press day held on Oct. 8 at the company’s production facility in Marignane, France. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and accommodation for the trip.) He suggested the UK should 'reflect' on the next steps for NMH, a competition for which Airbus had floated the H175M, but was thrown into disarray when both Airbus and Lockheed Martin pulled out of the competition on the day bids were due. Pitching the AW149 multirole helicopter, Leonardo was the only manufacturer to table a bid, aligned to a request for 23 to 32 new rotorcraft to replace Airbus Puma HC2 aircraft. Doubts continue to hang over the future of NMH, not only because the viability of a competition with a single manufacturer remains dubious, while the UK has put big ticket acquisition decisions on hold, until it completes a new strategic defense review. Airbus had committed to standing up a H175M production facility in Broughton, Wales, but said at the time of walking away from NMH that its decision to do so was based on a review of requirements that left it 'unable to formulate a responsible bid that would in parallel satisfy the customer’s requirements and provide adequate long-term returns to the business, while implying a reasonable prospect of winning.' Even was more specific, remarking that the withdrawal directly related to Airbus judging that it could not put forward an offer that could meet performance, local content and budget requirements, while receiving 'the right return for industry.' He added, 'It's perhaps also a good opportunity [for the UK] to take time and to reflect on this requirement.' He did not rule out running again if, for example, the competition was to be recompeted. 'We will listen to the customers [UK] and what they have in mind for the next step and of course will come with the best proposal, depending on the evolution' of NMH, said Even. Regarding development, the H175M is still at an 'early stage' with decisions pending over which 'configurations' and equipment to settle on, Olivier Pastore, head of the H175M programme, told Breaking Defense. 'The program itself is already de-risked in terms of [definition as] a pure military transport platform, because we already know the platform, but there are still open discussions and architecture [decisions] to be drawn' up for sensor integration, he explained. The H175M will be initially designed to carry out troop transport and Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, before Airbus looks at adding more 'complicated missions' such as Special Forces and medical evacuation, according to Pastore.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/airbus-keeps-h175m-industrial-footprint-options-open-after-nmh-withdrawal/	2024-10-14T08:05:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_1992-e1728672505974.jpg
France, Germany join US space warfighting plan ‘Olympic Defender’	US Space Force Lt. Col. Jordan O.E. Mugg, commander, 18th Space Defense Squadron, welcomes members from the German Space Situational Awareness Centre and Operational Center for Military Surveillance of Space Objects during a German-French operator exchange at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., July 10, 2023. (US Space Force photo by Julian Labit) WASHINGTON — US Space Command today welcomed France and Germany as the newest participants in Operation Olympic Defender, the US military's operational planning process for warfighting in space. SPACECOM Commander Gen. Stephen Whiting traveled to Paris and Berlin on Oct. 11 to attend the two induction ceremonies with Maj. Gen. Phillipe Adam, French Space Command commander, and Lt. Gen. Gunter Schneider, director-general for military strategy and operations at the German Ministry of Defence, respectively, according to twin SPACECOM press releases. Representatives of Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and newest member New Zealand, which accepted the US invitation on Sept. 5, also participated, SPACECOM said. Created in 2013 by US Strategic Command, which at the time had responsibility for US military space operations, Operation Olympic Defender was updated in 2018 to open up allied participation. Australia, Britain and Canada joined in 2020. Whiting extended the invite to France and Germany, along with New Zealand, on April 9 at the Space Symposium in Colorado Springs. Details about the warplan, of course, are scant. SPACECOM's releases today characterize Operation Olympic Defender as 'a multinational effort that focuses to optimize space operations, improve mission assurance, enhance resilience of space-based systems, synchronize efforts to strengthen deterrence against hostile actors and reduce the spread of debris orbiting the Earth.' Schneider's statement stressed the deterrent value of allied cooperation to keep eyes on the heavens and watch out for potentially dangerous activities by adversaries. 'Our common efforts as allies to increase our Space Domain Awareness will not only lead to a better understanding of the space domain, but it will also dissuade possible adversaries from dangerous and escalatory behavior in space as they will have to take into account that we can closely observe and evaluate each of their actions,' he said. Adam struck a more martial tone in his statement — unsurprising in that France has been one of the few countries to admit to its pursuit of weapons on orbit, albeit characterizing its plans for 'patrol' satellites that can shoot back with lasers at threats as strictly defensive. 'For France, joining the Multi-National Force-Operation OLYMPIC DEFENDER is a return to the spirit of LaFayette, in order to defend together freedom in space against growing threats,' said Adam. 'It marks a new stage in the conduct of military space operations in coalition and sends out a clear message of strategic solidarity with our Allies. 'For those who missed their American history classes, Marie-Joseph Paul Yves Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, was a French nobleman and military officer who voluntarily joined the Continental Army under Gen. George Washington in the American Revolutionary War. He was in command of the last major battle in the war of independence against Britain, the Siege of Yorktown in 1781. Paris and Berlin have been moving closer to the US with regard to space operations for several years. France and Germany in 2020 joined SPACECOM's Combined Space Operations Initiative, following along behind US partners in the Five Eyes intelligence alliance Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Since then, Italy, Japan and Norway have joined. The Combined Space Operation Initiative issued its first public statement of intent in February 2022, calling for future collaboration in defending their interests in outer space — to include potential development efforts to fill gaps in their collective capabilities as well as norm-building efforts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/france-germany-join-us-space-warfighting-plan-olympic-defender/	2024-10-14T07:12:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/18th-SDS-welcomes-FrenchGerman-space-operators-2023-scaled-e1728667270125.jpeg
Bell to manufacture FLRAA fuselage after dumping Spirit AeroSystems ahead of Boeing acquisition	Bell's V-280 Valor tiltrotor won the US Army's Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA) competition. (Bell) AUSA 2024 — Bell Textron will produce fuselages for the Army’s Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft in house, having made the decision to take the work away from Spirit AeroSystems following the announcement of its proposed acquisition by Boeing, Bell and Spirit confirmed to Breaking Defense. Army acquisition executive Doug Bush said the service does not anticipate any risk to the FLRAA program resulting from Bell’s pivot away from Spirit as the fuselage maker. 'We're ahead of that problem. It's already been worked out,' he told Breaking Defense in an interview ahead of the Association of the US Army conference in Washington this week. The transfer of work on the Army’s highest priority aviation program is the direct result of Bell’s concerns that financial and operational instability at Boeing, which is set to acquire Spirit in mid-2025, could have an adverse impact on the FLRAA program. 'Bell has full responsibility for the fuselage scope of work, as we do with many of our product lines,' a company spokesperson said in a statement to Breaking Defense. 'Bell’s Amarillo facility remains the final assembly site for the FLRAA aircraft.' Bell declined to provide further details on the move, including on timing of the transition. 'Spirit and Bell coordinated on an agreement to transition full responsibility for the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft fuselage to Bell,' Spirit AeroSystems spokesman Joe Buccino said. Boeing declined to comment. A source with knowledge of the program said that Spirit’s participation on the program is set to wrap up by the end of 2024, with the company poised to complete its final shipment of government property back to Bell by the end of the month. Industry sources have told Breaking Defense that several defense primes currently working with Spirit had levied concerns about the proposed acquisition by Boeing, which is currently embroiled in a production and safety crisis and taking cost cutting measures due to an ongoing strike at its Seattle-area aircraft plants. In July, sources told Breaking Defense that Bell had decided to oust Spirit AeroSystems as the provider of FLRAA’s composite-skinned aluminum fuselage after Boeing completes its $8.3 billion acquisition of Spirit, a major fuselage supplier on all Boeing commercial jetliners that was originally part of the company until being spun off in 2005. The Army announced in August that the FLRAA program had entered into its engineering and manufacturing development (EMD) phase after receiving Milestone B approval. The decision — made after a successful preliminary design review in April and a June meeting of the Army Systems Acquisition Review Council — allows the Army to exercise its first contract option for six FLRAA prototypes and moves Bell forward into the detailed design of the aircraft. The service currently plans for the first FLRAA aircraft to fly in 2026, the Army said in an August release. Low rate initial production is scheduled to start in 2028, followed by the fielding of the first batch of aircraft in 2030. Bell beat out a team of Boeing and Lockheed Martin’s Sikorsky subsidiary to win the FLRAA contract in 2022. At the time, Army officials said the contract was worth $1.3 billion but could end up being in the range of $70 billion if contract options and export opportunities emerge. Boeing’s acquisition of Spirit would have put Bell back in the position of working with its partner on the V-22 Osprey tiltrotor program. Boeing makes the fuselages for the Osprey under a 50-50 joint venture with Bell, which is responsible for wings, tail structure and rotors.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/bell-to-manufacture-flraa-fuselage-after-dumping-spirit-aerosystems-ahead-of-boeing-acquisition/	2024-10-14T05:25:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/Valor-pic1.jpg
Bombardier Defense – Trusted partner for deep-sensing airborne missions	A generic rendering of missionized Bombardier Challenger and Global aircraft courtesy of Bombardier Defense. The United States Army has repeatedly cited its top modernization operational priority is deep sensing in order to gain and maintain early situational awareness for decision advantage. Such capability relies upon aerial intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) technologies that enable the Army to maintain an asymmetric information advantage and more effectively adapt to the fast-changing nature of the operational environment. Deep sensing is also critical in providing ranged strike options with medium and long-range precision munitions – to overmatch adversaries, shape the battlespace, or neutralize high priority targets in increasingly complex environments at speed and scale. To achieve these objectives, the U.S. Army has contracted Bombardier Defense as the platform of choice for its High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) project. Working in tandem with other partners to integrate the required systems on the platform, Bombardier will be delivering a prototype airframe using the Global 6500 aircraft for this modernized ISR program. A generic rendering of a missionized Bombardier Global 6500, used by the U.S. Army in its latest program for Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) courtesy of Bombardier Defense. HADES will enhance deep sensing capabilities by deploying airborne ISR platforms. These capabilities provide increased collection capabilities to Theater Army Service Component Commanders (ASCCs), Joint partners, and allies – ultimately aligning with the 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS) by aiding in 'building a resilient Joint Force. Previous initiatives leading into the HADES program of record include: Clients from civilian, military and government backgrounds all appreciate the customer-centric approach to Bombardier’s offerings. Both the Challenger and Global families of aircraft can be used for multi-mission, allowing for governments to make a singular acquisition to meet their diverse needs. This kind of flexibility makes Bombardier’s solutions valuable around the world. Defense procurement needs around the world have evolved significantly in the last decade, with more military agencies incorporating modern jets into their operations to maintain information advantage and more effectively adapt to the fast-changing nature of the intelligence gathering and analysis environment. Bombardier also offers maintenance support through a comprehensive aftermarket network, which offers a strategic operational advantage to governments and military agencies. The availability and versatility of skilled workers, and the accessibility of spare parts through a combination of strategically placed service centers, line maintenance stations and mobile response team trucks, play a significant role when choosing the platform that will create the fleet of tomorrow for aerial ISR missions. Flexible, Experienced and Proven Bombardier platforms are agile and rapidly reconfigurable. Bombardier leverages a team of world-class engineers in Wichita, KS, and across North America, that prides itself on being solution-oriented to tailor a platform to meet customer requirements. These capabilities are matched with continuous investment in product upgrades to ensure the reliability, availability and capability of its aircraft. The attributes that set Bombardier aircraft apart are applicable to various geographic theaters and tactical demands, including: From securing national airspace, borders and infrastructure to providing urgent humanitarian assistance or supporting mobility and sustainment needs of governments, Bombardier aircraft are built for the most demanding missions. For decades, Bombardier has provided industry-leading, curated solutions for the most demanding missions of governments and military contractors worldwide – and it will continue to do so by innovating and expanding capabilities that solidify Bombardier’s position as a global aviation leader.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/bombardier-defense-trusted-partner-for-deep-sensing-airborne-missions/	2024-10-14T05:10:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Global-Challenger-Rendering.jpg
Clearing the books: Army kickstarts initiative to strip away legacy requirements	The Under Secretary of the Army, Gabe Camarillo, visits soldiers assigned to 2nd Cavalry Regiment during exercise Dragoon Ready 23 in Hohenfels, Germany on Feb. 1, 2023.(US Army/Staff Sgt. Ashley Low) AUSA 2024 — When members of the Army Requirement Oversight Council (AROC) get together, it’s typically to greenlight new weapon requirements and pave the acquisition path ahead. However, now the advisory council has a new, emerging task: stripping away old, outdated plans. 'Nothing should ever be 100 percent [set] in stone, and we should be able to pivot,' Army Under Secretary Gabe Camarillo told Breaking Defense ahead of the annual Association of the US Army conference in Washington, DC this week. 'We know how to start new programs very, very well, but we have to also learn how to pivot,' he later added. 'That will have implications over how many quantities we buy in the outyears, but I also think it will open up new opportunities for competition and tech insertion as we go through this.' That new effort — dubbed CORA, or AROC in reverse — is set up differently than the Trump era process when senior Army leaders met behind closed doors, often after hours, to rack and stack programs to free up dollars for a comprehensive, weapon modernization overhaul. That process, named after a 1980s sitcom, became known as Night Court and saw program officials defend their pots of money. Instead, the emerging AROC process is homing in on legacy system requirements across different portfolios to see where tweaks need to be made or requirements erased entirely. That could be because the requirements have been in the pipeline for long enough that they've become obsolete or new tech has emerged that could answer a requirement if it's revised or 'significantly changed,' Camarillo explained. As a broad example, he cited tactical unmanned aerial systems (UAS) requirements that were inked nearly a decade ago. 'It was when there was a very, very small market for these systems, probably not too many vendors, and probably systems that were only at one specific size,' he explained. 'Now you see just a proliferation of vendors in this space. And so, did we get that requirement right?' Since the drone market has ballooned in the intervening years, the Army went back and 'recognized that we probably needed a new, directed requirement for company level UAS' and include 'higher-end' drones for different scenarios. As a result, the service 'fundamentally changed and shifted' the requirements within that portfolio, and is on the hunt for a Future Tactical Unmanned System (FTUAS) to replace the RQ-7B Shadow. 'You can see other areas where technology has shifted pretty significantly [too] or where the threat has evolved. We would probably take a similar approach,' Camarillo said, and that could lead to a AROC change. Changing the requirements on the books isn’t just for service leaders, Army acquisition head Doug Bush told Breaking Defense during a separate interview. The process, he added, will provide the service with cover and additional information to present to lawmakers who ultimately ink the checks. 'It's healthy to go back and look at relook assumptions we made many, several years ago… and [ask] ‘Do the requirements work’ before we just arbitrarily make a program decision,' Bush said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/clearing-the-books-army-kickstarts-initiative-to-strip-away-legacy-requirements/	2024-10-14T04:00:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Gabe1-scaled-e1728320871758.jpg
Boeing’s defense unit logs massive $2 billion in losses for third quarter	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s defense unit will take $2 billion in losses on fixed-price contracts when it reports its third quarter results later this month, the company disclosed today, bringing total defense-related charges for the company up to $3.2 billion this year. The wider company also announced plans to slash 10 percent of its total workforce. The charges to its defense arm come as the US planemaker hemorrhages money amid an ongoing strike by its Seattle-area machinists union and as it announced the conclusion of its 767 freighter production — both factors the company states contributed to losses on the T-7A trainer, MQ-25 tanker drone, KC-46 tanker and NASA’s Starliner in the most recent financial quarter. The T-7 trainer logged the largest charge, worth $900 million, due to what the company said were higher estimated costs for production in 2026 and beyond. Behind it, the KC-46 logged a $700 million loss due to Boeing’s decision to end production of the 767 freighter, the commercial aircraft on which the militarized tanker is based. The company also pointed the finger at the ongoing machinists union strike, which has paused production of commercial airplanes, such as the 767 made in the company's Seattle facilities. The company did not lay out a breakdown for the losses incurred by the MQ-25 and Starliner programs. Boeing’s defense unit expects to report $5.5 billion in revenue and declare an operating margin of negative 43 percent. The financial bleeding on in Boeing's defense unit was replicated in its commercial business, which will declare $3 billion in losses for the quarter. The company noted that these figures were 'preliminary' and could change. As a result of financial turmoil across the company, Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg said in a letter to employees that the company would lay off 10 percent of its workforce, 'including executives, managers and employees.' While Ortberg did not say how much of the layoffs would come from Boeing's defense unit, he added that he would provide 'additional oversight' of the defense business and fixed price-development programs going forward. 'In BDS [Boeing Defense Space and Security], our performance on fixed-price development programs is simply not where it needs to be,' Ortberg said in the letter, which was made public. 'We expect substantial new losses in BDS this quarter, driven by the work stoppage on commercial derivatives, continued program challenges and our decision to complete production on the 767 freighter.' Last month, Boeing announced the departure of Ted Colbert, who has led its defense unit since 2022. The planemaker has not announced a full-time successor.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/boeings-defense-unit-logs-massive-2-billion-in-losses-for-third-quarter/	2024-10-11T14:46:13-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: L3Harris, Embraer no longer working together to pitch C-390 to US	L3Harris previously partnered with Embraer on a US version of KC-390 tanker that would have added a refueling boom to the aircraft. (L3Harris) WASHINGTON — A partnership between American defense contractor L3Harris and Brazil’s Embraer to bring the latter’s C-390 Millenium to the US market has fallen apart, the CEO of Embraer’s defense business told Breaking Defense. 'I think it’s fair to say that the L3 partnership is not there anymore for the agile tanker,' Bosco da Costa Jr. said in an interview. 'They decided not to move on [it] because of other priorities.' Unveiled in 2022 in a joint press briefing with Embraer CEO Francisco Gomes Neto and L3Harris CEO Chris Kubasik, the C-390 partnership envisioned L3Harris serving as the prime contractor for the program and providing US mission systems for the plane, including a purpose-built refueling boom that would recast the Millennium as an American KC-390. Yet in the two years since, interest from L3Harris apparently waned, and the partnership has now expired. 'I think they [L3Harris] are very in favor of the [business] case, and they would like to play [as] a major supplier in this potential business, but I think considering other priorities that they have, they decided not to move and not to invest in this partnership,' da Costa said. L3Harris declined to comment. Nevertheless, Embraer 'is completely serious' about its ambitions to become a major player in the US, whether that be as a 'prime [contractor], to be together with other companies, and even [through] M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions],' according to da Costa. That includes potentially going it alone as a prime for an accelerated tanker program, labeled the Next Generation Air Refueling System (NGAS). Embraer responded to a recent request for information on NGAS as a potential prime for the program, but the company is exploring 'several other types of business structures' and is having conversations with several major US defense companies on partnership opportunities, da Costa said. 'We are looking for someone that could add value on our case, bring some capabilities that Embraer doesn't have,' he said. When the L3Harris partnership was announced, the Air Force was still pursuing a three-pronged refueling strategy known as KC-X, KC-Y and KC-Z. The service has now ditched that plan in favor of a potential limited buy of off-the-shelf tankers to replace aging KC-135s, which would then be followed by the NGAS tanker. RELATED: Air Force's interim tanker buy in limbo as service mulls next-gen refueler timeline The limited buy, dubbed the KC-135 Tanker Recapitalization program, has largely been viewed as a dogfight between Boeing and Airbus. But the Air Force’s shifting tanker plans have opened up an opportunity for Embraer as well in the near-term, according to Frederico Lemos, the company’s defense chief commercial officer. 'We are looking at the recap program,' Lemos said. 'And we believe that there might be a space also in the recap.' The C-390 'is a highly capable multi-role aircraft,' Tim Walton, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said in an interview with Breaking Defense. Still, Walton noted that the aircraft would have to overcome some challenges to win over the US Air Force. On the airlift side, Walton said the Millennium would have to contend with the incumbency of the C-130J built by Lockheed Martin, which enjoys advantages like existing infrastructure and training pipelines. And on the refueling side, the C-390 has a 'relatively low fuel capacity compared to a KC-46 or many other NGAS options,' while also having a larger radar signature compared to other potential NGAS candidates, he said. 'For the Air Force to consider the C-390 or KC-390 for the KC-135 Tanker Recapitalization Program, it would likely need to revise the performance parameters it is pursuing,' Walton observed. Despite the aircraft's considerable multi-role capabilities, 'I do not think it would offload enough fuel at relevant radii to meet desired performance parameters. Still, Walton sees options for Embraer as it markets the C-390 in the US: 'That said, the C-390 could address niche mobility missions and complement the Air Force’s C-130s and C-17s,' he added. Embraer already has a significant US presence, with da Costa noting the C-390 is already compliant with the Buy America Act. But the company is looking to expand its US footprint, including by looking to establish a stateside final assembly line for the airlifter, according to da Costa. For the KC-135 recap and NGAS, da Costa emphasized that Embraer is positioning the C-390 to be ready as soon as the US would need it. That includes drawing up plans to outfit the Millennium with a boom, which he said has shown to be 'feasible' based on Embraer’s studies, though he said no production on a boom system has begun. 'What we are trying to fill is a gap that the US Air Force has now with a plane that it's ready,' da Costa said. 'So that's what we are trying to pitch, in a sense, to fill the gap now. To add capabilities now.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/exclusive-l3harris-embraer-no-longer-working-together-to-pitch-c-390-to-us/	2024-10-11T14:16:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/L3Harris-Embraer-Agile-Tanker-for-USAF-1-scaled-e1728679603377.jpg
‘A lot … at once’: Army cyber and network officials take stock 1 year after organizational shuffle	Gen. Ed Barker (PEO IEW&amp;S) and Mark Kitz (PEO C3N) speak on an AUSA Global Force panel in March 2024. (Photo by US Army &#8211; PEO IEW&amp;S/ Facebook) WASHINGTON — It’s been a little over a year since the Army took its three network and cyber Program Executive Offices, rearranged their teams, and emerged with two new offices, ideally set to meet the requirements of modern warfighting. In Pentagon bureaucracy terms, a year isn’t actually that long. But speaking to Breaking Defense in recent weeks, the leaders of the two offices say the reorganization has helped the service create a more holistic environment where warfighters can better communicate with each other — though not without a few bumps in the road. 'It really kind of tested a lot of our theories and a lot of our premises on our organizational agility and our talent management. It probably stressed them to the point where we realized that we're doing the right thing,' Gen. Ed Barker, program executive officer of the Program Executive Office for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors told Breaking Defense. (As a sign of how things are still fluid, PEO C3T this week rebranded as the Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Networks, PEO C3N, which is how the office will be referred to in this story.) PEO C3N absorbed the Integrated Enterprise Networks program from PEO Enterprise and its four product management offices: base emergency communications system, global enterprise network modernization-Americas, global enterprise network modernization-OCONUS and wideband enterprise satellite systems. The office also took charge of the enterprise service’s enterprise identity, credential and access management (ICAM) and allied information technology, the latter being part of the EIS’s defensive cyber operations (DCO) portfolio. RELATED: Here’s how the Army is reorganizing its network, cyberops offices Meanwhile, the PEO IEW&amp;S took over the rest of the DCO portfolio: the technology application office, the cyber analytics and detection program and the cyber platforms and systems program. Basically, IEW&amp;S now houses all of the Army’s cyber efforts from a PEO standpoint, while C3N houses all of the Army’s network efforts. It’s a streamlining that, both men say, better reflects how the service actually operates. A year in, Mark Kitz, program executive officer of C3N, said that his office has seen real movements towards the Army’s goal of creating a unified network — breaking down the dozens of siloed legacy networks, mostly separated by tactical and enterprise portions, to create a more cohesive singular network. Or, as Kitz describes it, 'having the enterprise network and the tactical network integrated into one organization so we can gain efficiencies and deliver a better product to our army customer.' Kitz is open, however, that the direction from here is not always clear, especially when identifying and creating new opportunities to uphold this unified network. 'This vision of a unified network is very ambitious. For a very long time, the Army has been building tactical and enterprise infrastructure in two very different ways,' he said. 'And so how do we identify those opportunities? How do we identify the challenges, and how do we identify the roadblocks?' Another challenge in creating this unified network is the geographic distance between soldiers. Kitz said he is working on 'improving how my organization is geospatially dispersed, how we build a culture that incentivizes getting after one Army network,' which includes both enterprise and tactical elements. While the unified network is his major overarching focus, Kitz pointed to a number of efforts his office has helped guide over the last year that he sees as wins. Those include pushing forward on software-defined networking, where networks are put together digitally instead of relying on hardware, like switches and routers, to manage the system. 'This software-defined network capability could really be a potential game changer for not just how the enterprise solution interfaces with DISA (Defense Information Systems Agency) and the DODIN (DoD Information Network) and our network, but how tactical users can now really diversify the way they enter into the network,' Kitz said. 'As we deliver this capability, over the next year, we'll be able to integrate not just the enterprise users, but also our tactical systems, our tactical users,' he added. This should allow users to access their usual network regardless of their geographic location, he said. One other area of improvement Kitz has seen since the reorganization is with the C3N’s ICAM project, which is a capability designed to help build the Army’s unified network by creating a secure environment for authorized users to access the data they need when they need it. 'This is one of those programs where we have a separate material solution for tactical and enterprise. And so by consolidating under one organization, now we have an integrated approach on how we plan to deliver access management,' Kitz said. 'Whether that's a tactical user who may or may not have a persistent network, or an enterprise user leveraging the enterprise capabilities delivered by PEO EIS. That is one sort of example where the enterprise and tactical network are converging on a single architecture.' As the IEW&amp;S has become the PEO responsible for the Army’s entire cyber portfolio, the office has developed stronger communications with Army Cyber Command (ARCYBER) and the joint force’s Cyber Command. The IEW&amp;S was responsible for the offensive cyber operations in the service, and is now also responsible for defensive cyber operations after the reorganization. Barker added that he’s 'really realized efficiencies of having [the] offensive and defensive cyber operations under one PEO, and how that relates to our relationship with Cyber Command [and] ARCYBER as well.' The 'integration of [defensive cyber operations] is going, going really, really smooth, and they're just really part of the family now. The offense, you know, informs the defense, and defense informs offense,' he said. There was no 'terrible surprise' during the transition process, Barker said, but he acknowledged one wrinkle that was more work than expected: learning to work defensive operations with ARCYBER while CYBERCOM was also undergoing its own major effort in standing up the Joint Cyber Warfare Architecture. 'When you're juggling that level of change internally to us, that level of change — when it comes to Cyber Command and bracing their new authorities, and, oh, by the way, operating in the cyberspace, both from an offensive and defensive standpoint, and the pace associated with the threat in those spaces — it is dynamic,' Barker said. Still, aside from the stress it put on the system, Barker sees positives from the relationship between his PEO shop and CYBERCOM, and the fact they went through a transition together. 'We've been able to help Cyber Command as they've kind of navigated this new mission and growth and what they want things to look like when it comes to the different joint capabilities that they have to provide,' Barker said. 'Then the other part of that is that continued relationship with Army Cyber because while Cyber Command is standing up, there's going to be, think of it in terms of putting a ‘j’ for ‘joint’ in front of, you know, a lot of programs, like the joint development environment and things like that.' Barker said as the Army moves forward in adopting its unified network plan and its Next Generation Command and Control initiative — the service’s plan to create an integrated C2 structure focusing on data centricity 'at every echelon,' which will serve as the data transport portion of the unified network — his office and the C3N must stay in constant communication with each other. 'Anything we do on this, on the cyber, on the defensive cyber front, specifically, is tightly linked with PEO C3N,' Barker said. He said that IEW&amp;S and C3N are 'joined at the hip when it comes to making sure that anything we're doing in, kind of, the day-to-day space matches to where they need to go from a future standpoint.' Kitz echoed the importance of this relationship between the two offices, but also made the bigger point of being in close contact with other forces as well, especially when it comes to standing up the DoD’s sprawling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) program, which works to create an all-seeing, all-connected battle network. 'I have very close relationships with the Navy and the Air Force, and specifically on how we interoperate data. How are we sharing data? How are we defining how we're going to share data? Because in the end, that network is going to provide a pathway, but if I get a pathway to a data that I can't use or consume, that's meaningless, right?' Kitz said. 'So really trying to foster these joint relationships between the PEOs and CDAO (Chief Digital and Artificial Intelligence Office) has become a big part of this conversation. How do I meaningfully understand the situation between the joint forces? So the PEOs are really trying to define and ensure that we can interoperate,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/a-lot-at-once-army-cyber-and-network-officials-take-stock-1-year-after-organizational-shuffle/	2024-10-11T13:06:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Kitz_Barker_Army_Facebook-e1728670855434.jpg
Canada, UK collaborate on nanosat for South Pole space monitoring	The Little Innovator in Space Situational Awareness (LISSA), will incorporate as its primary payload a UK experimental short wave infrared (SWIR) camera. It will be deployed from Canada's Redwing demonstration satellite designed to keep tabs on space objects over the South Pole. (Image: UK Defence Science and Technology Laboratory) WASHINGTON — The UK and Canadian defense ministries are planning a joint on-orbit demonstration to keep eyes on satellites and space junk whizzing over the South Pole as part of an ongoing Canadian pilot project to improve space domain awareness. 'Space objects over the Earth’s South Pole is less monitored than the North Pole and the mission will inform future space surveillance considerations based on findings from the mission,' according to a UK government press release Thursday. The UK's Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, on behalf of the Ministry of Defence (MoD) and UK Space Command, will contribute an experimental sensor package to the 'Redwing' project, managed by Canada's defense research organization, Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC), the release said. 'This international research cooperation between the countries provides the opportunity for joint collaboration and for developing prototype infrastructure and data processing architecture,' the UK release said. Redwing was initiated in March 2023 with a $15.8 million CAD ($11.7 million USD) contract to a consortium led by Magellan Aerospace, headquartered in Winnipeg. The project expects to launch a small satellite in 2027 to an orbit around the North and South poles of about 575 kilometers above the Earth’s surface. The project now has exercised a 'contract option to add a $900,000 subsatellite to the Redwing project &#8230; known as Little Innovator in Space Situational Awareness (LISSA),' the DRDC's Thursday press release explained. LISSA, a nanosat about the size of a cereal box, will be deployed after Redwing is in orbit to fly 'in tandem' with it at about 200 kilometers apart carrying the UK's sensor payload, the UK government release said. The payload is a short-wave infrared (SWIR) camera, Canada's press release explained, that 'records outside the visible light spectrum and will address the technical challenge of reflected light from clouds and ice in the South Pole region during the Antarctic summer. 'Together they will test how to provide better space domain awareness with a focus on mega-constellations, which orbit at less than 2,000 km altitude. However, Redwing will also be capable of monitoring objects in altitudes approaching the Earth’s moon, known as cis-lunar orbits, at roughly 380,000 km,' it added. US Space Command long has been interested in improving space monitoring of the Southern Hemisphere, where the US military has few radars or telescopes. It also has been increasingly interested in keeping eyes on space activities in the vast region of space between the Earth and the Moon, in large part due to concern about China's lunar ambitions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/canada-uk-collaborate-on-nanosat-for-south-pole-space-monitoring/	2024-10-11T12:49:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Screenshot-2024-10-11-at-3.07.00 PM-e1728674161860.png
Tiltrotor: The need for speed & range in response to global threats	V280-Valor (photo courtesy of Bell) The United States (U.S.) Army recently decided to modernize its medium vertical lift fleet with the selection of Bell’s V-280 Valor, a next generation tiltrotor incorporating over 70 years of experience and nearly 800,000 operating hours with tiltrotor. The U.S. Army was part of early tiltrotor developmental programs but decided it was not the right solution at the time. The time is now for the U.S. Army, as witnessed by its approval of the FLRAA Milestone B Acquisition Decision Memorandum. This next generation weapon system is a leap in technology, flying at twice the range and twice the speed of current U.S. Army assets and includes a modular open system approach (MOSA) giving it unmatched flexibility for future mission scenarios. It will lead to a significant revolution in how the U.S. Army conducts missions, enhance its global responsiveness, and reduce deployment timelines and complexity. It will also outpace any vertical lift capabilities of the U.S. Army’s allies and partners. The tiltrotor provides the combination of range, speed, and payload of an airplane, while combining the runway independent characteristics of a helicopter. It can deploy by, and operate from, naval vessels, and is fully capable of self-deployment. It also gives the commander a wide range of flexibility since there is reduced reliance on infrastructure and can be deployed to the point of need in a short period of time, as well as to austere and remote locations from which forces would not normally operate. Such a capability is well placed for operations in locations such as the Indo-Pacific, the Arctic, Europe, and the Mediterranean with reach into the Sahel and the Middle East. With its range and speed, the tiltrotor enables operations from a point of relative sanctuary in dispersed locations, safe from most long-range fires and threats that make current assets vulnerable. This is critical in today’s operational environment where ISR is pervasive, and surprise is elusive. Dispersion enables the commander to think differently and to employ forces from multiple locations and converge on the objective – operational flexibility. This is revolutionary maneuver. It’s about surprise and initiative, and the ability to move people and material flexibly around the battlefield. The U.S. Army has begun the process to redefine its doctrine, tactics, techniques, and procedures as it prepares to field its own tiltrotor capability. The result will enable commanders to do things much differently than in the past, enabling them to think and operate differently, to get inside of adversaries’ decision cycle. It will lead to expanded strategic choices and enhanced competitive advantages. It is also going to have an impact on when, how, and if the U.S. Army operates with its allies and partners unless they jump on the leap-in-capability bandwagon. Why It Matters In the Pacific, the United States and its allies and partners may need to compete with increasingly capable peer and near-peer competitors, leading to changes in operational approaches. This includes potentially operating from dispersed locations over vast distances. In Europe, NATO’s eastern flank includes battle groups from Estonia down to Bulgaria and crosses multiple borders; reinforcing them in a crisis will be challenging. NATO’s border with Russia has doubled since Finland joined the Alliance. The Mediterranean also creates distance challenges that expand into the Sahel and the Middle East. The tiltrotor changes the geometry of the battlefield. It provides the operational reach, responsiveness, and flexibility to the commander to employ forces at distance, speed, and minimize risk. It increases the depth from which maritime and marine forces can conduct littoral operations. It creates strategic unpredictability, offers operational flexibility, and creates decision dilemmas for the adversary, enhancing the overall deterrence value. Its leap-ahead capability is well-suited for the increased complexity in today and tomorrow’s global operating environment. V280-Valor (photo courtesy of Bell) There is, however, an opportunity to mitigate this imminent capability gap. Many Allies and partners are approaching a window to modernize medium vertical lift fleets. At the same time, there is an increased focus on defense and associated budgets. This confluence of aging fleets and rising budgets creates an opportunity for allies and partners to keep pace with the U.S. Army as it makes the capability leap with a tiltrotor. Given increasing competition in the Pacific and the pace of capability development among peer and near-peer competitors, expanding the pool of tiltrotor operators enables interoperability among the joint force. It also enhances the prospects for interchangeability – a growing buzzword in NATO and like-minded allied circles related to interoperability that highlights, inter alia, the ability to apply common sustainment practices and pooling and sharing of supply chains and logistics. It additionally could create savings over the long term in acquisition and sustainment costs. The United States and its allies and partners have acknowledged that no single nation can win the next major conflict alone. The coalitions of the willing must be supplanted by the coalitions of necessity to confront adversaries’ vast and growing capabilities. Tiltrotors have already revolutionized the way the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force Special Operations operate, and the U.S. Navy has revolutionized the way it operates with the recent introduction of tiltrotor and continues to expand its application. As the U.S. Army begins fielding a tiltrotor, air assault missions as we have known them, and other applications yet to be discovered, will change significantly. If the U.S. Army wants to maintain the competitive edge over its adversaries, it needs its allies and partners. The Honorable Doug Bush, Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology, noted in 2022, 'Technological cooperation. . .improves our ability to collectively modernize and increase interoperability ensuring we can train and fight alongside our allies and partners more effectively and efficiently.' The U.S. Army’s allies and partners need to take note and ensure that they are not left behind as it fields an advanced tiltrotor, and work with the U.S. Army as it creates the conditions to make that possible.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/tiltrotor-the-need-for-speed-range-in-response-to-global-threats/	2024-10-11T11:30:23-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/cruise-low-water-scaled.jpg
Army eyeing commercial drones as Shadow ‘gap’ filler	Textron's Shadow RQ-7B V2 Block III (Photo courtesy of Textron) AUSA 2024 — The US Army’s decision to shelve its entire RQ-7B Shadow fleet has created a capability gap for soldiers that previously relied on those drones for reconnaissance and surveillance operations. And although the service is eyeing a developmental new platform to get into soldiers’ hands starting in late 2027, that’s simply too long to wait so it's turning to commercially available options, according to Col. Nick Ryan, the director of the Army Capability Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. 'There's a gap where our units have no assets and no capability to train with right now, to learn with, to build TTPs [tactics, techniques, and procedures] with,' Ryan told Breaking Defense ahead of this year’s Association of the US Army conference. 'We started thinking outside the box about what we can do to help with this.' Army leaders announced their Shadow divestiture plan in early February as part of a larger aviation shakeup. By the end of September, all of those drones had been removed from units, according to Ryan. The longer-term plan is to field a new Future Tactical Uncrewed Aircraft System (FTUAS) at the brigade level and two companies — Griffon Aerospace and Textron Systems — are currently competing for that coveted contract. If that competition stays on track, the Army is expected to crown a winner later this fiscal year and begin receiving the new drones towards the end of fiscal 2027. According to Ryan, that plan is a problem for soldiers who need an interim capability now, and emergent operational need statements have been coming in from an array of units including Multi-Domain Task Forces in both the Indo-Pacific and Europe. Part of the plan forward, at least in part, is to utilize the Defense Innovation Unit’s (DIU’s) Blue UAS List — an initiative designed to help the services more quickly select commercial systems that are fully free of Chinese parts. In theory, if a drone is on the approved list, a unit can buy it. But when the Army turned to that list earlier this year, none of the drones on it would meet the capability gap created by Shadow’s divestiture, so Ryan and others worked with DIU on plans for the Blue UAS List refresh. 'We probably can't put something as large as a Shadow on the DIU Blue List, like a Group 3 that weighs a couple thousand pounds, because that would probably be … over $350,000,' Ryan said. Instead, potential options may be in the Group 2 range, weighing in at less than 55 pounds, with the ability to fly for more than four hours at ranges greater than six miles out, see in both day and night conditions, and possibly the ability to laser designate. 'That’s just enough to fill the gap for the time being, to allow units to at least have something to train with, which is better than the nothing they have right now,' Ryan explained. The service is also eagerly eyeing the addition of first-person view drones for the squad and platoon level, he added. After DIU put out the Blue List refresh call earlier this year, 360 proposals came in from 220 companies for both platform and supporting tech options, Trent Emeneker, the DIU Blue UAS program manager and contractor, told Breaking Defense during a recent interview. That list has now been whittled down to 36 flying platforms from approximately 15 vendors, and those capabilities are bound for an early November testing at the Marine Corps’s 29 Palms in Southern California. After the drones take to the air, they will be physically torn apart to inspect all the components, Emeneker explained. And if parts need to be swapped out, the companies will be given that option. By early December, Emeneker predicts that drones making the final cut will begin appearing on that Blue List and will be continually added on a rolling basis. By the end of February, he added, drones not being picked up by the services will be removed from the list. 'We will list things as soon as we can, we're not going to have end users wait, we don't want to also make the companies wait,' Emeneker said. In the meantime, officials from Army Aviation and Missile Command and Army Combat Capabilities Development Command will be working on securing airworthiness releases so that as soon as suitable drones are officially added to the list, be it a fill in for the Shadow mission or a first-person view drone, the service can make recommendations to units. 'If we can get more systems available that are NDAA-compliant, that the army is actually interested in buying … and Congress provides the funds for the units, then the units will absolutely go there and start buying these things,' Ryan said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-eyeing-commercial-drones-as-shadow-gap-filler/	2024-10-11T11:18:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Textron_ShadowIII_Utah-4404-2-e1663608557790.jpg
GPS shows some Lebanese citizens in Jordan, likely result of combat-related ‘spoofing’: Experts	A phone belonging to a Lebanese citizen shows the person in Jordan, rather than Beirut. (Breaking Defense) BEIRUT — When she got in her car to go to run an errand earlier this week, a Beirut mother of two pulled up her phone as she always did to use GPS, only to find out to her surprise that, at least according to her phone, she was actually in Jordan, 130 miles to the south. On another incident earlier this month, a group of mothers taking their daughters to a birthday in Bqenneya, just outside Beirut, saw that their route to party would take them not the few minutes they expected, but five hours. They realized their phones, too, thought they were in Jordan. The incidents have been reported in and around Beirut, as well as elsewhere in the country like Mount Lebanon, Keserwan and Matn. It has apparently affected phones but also tablets and AirPods. The Lebanese telecom authority did not respond to a request for comment for this report. Freddy Khoueiry, global security analyst for the Middle East and North Africa at the RANE Network, suspects Israel is behind the technological assault. 'In this case, the Israelis are likely broadcasting these fake signals with higher strength than genuine GPS signals, causing the map application to place you in a completely incorrect location,' he told Breaking Defense. Khoueiry said that the real target is likely weapons systems and navigational tools used by combatants, as the spoofing could mislead navigation systems in missiles and drones resulting 'in diverted or misdirected operations, causing units to navigate incorrectly, and compromising mission success by making assets appear in the wrong places or sending them into hostile or restricted areas.' Clayton Swope of the Center for Strategic and International Studies agreed that it is 'almost certainly at attempt to confuse GPS-guided weapons, like drones and missiles,' but he suggested there's no certainty it's the Israelis. 'Since neither Israel, Hezbollah, nor Iran likely wants their munitions hitting anything in Jordan, spoofing GPS so that weapons think they are near [Jordanian capital] Amman undermines their effectiveness,' said Swope, deputy director of aerospace security project at CSIS. 'Israel, Hezbollah, and Iran have reasons to confuse GPS-guided weapons used by their adversaries in the region, and any of them could be behind these incidents.' RELATED: After shooting down Iranian munitions, Jordan defiant in uncomfortable spotlight Swope said there's evidence Iran has previously spoofed GPS signals near the Iran-Iraq border and said he 'would not be surprised if Iran shared that technology with Hezbollah.' 'Using GPS spoofing does not seem to have an escalatory effect, so it is a tool Iran could share and Hezbollah could use without risk of escalation,' he said. The GPS spoofing, and jamming in which the signal is disrupted altogether, is not new in Lebanon. The electronic attacks have affected commercial flights in the country since October 2023, which pushed the Lebanese government to file a complaint against Israel to UN.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/gps-shows-some-lebanese-citizens-in-jordan-likely-result-of-combat-related-spoofing-experts/	2024-10-11T10:22:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241011_gps_jamming_lebanon.png
Army shifting S-MET work over to new acquisition shop	US Army soldiers with the 101st Airborne Division use SMETs during a recent training exercise. (Ashely Roque/Breaking Defense) AUSA 2024 — As one US Army Program Executive Office prepares to pare down the number of commercial vendors vying for a ground autonomy contract, it is also shedding a separate robotic program — the Squad Maneuver Equipment Transport, or S-MET. The service currently has a host of robotic programs in various stages of development spread across different offices. Inside the the Program Executive Office for Combat Support and Combat Service Support (PEO CS&amp;CSS), for example, the team is managing the acquisition of the S-MET robotic mule, while also running the Ground Expeditionary Autonomy Retrofit Systems (GEARS) competition — an initiative to field self-driving trucks. But starting next month, PEO Ground Combat Systems will take over the S-MET reins when the program is handed over to the Robotic Combat Vehicle product manager. 'This transition combines the two [Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology] ground maneuver robotic programs under a single program management office to gain efficiencies in acquisition planning that will soon include modular mission payload integration onto both the RCV and S-MET platforms,' Army spokeswoman Rae Higgins wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. According to Higgins, shifting who is in charge of S-MET is envisioned as a way to better streamline efforts with a host of other offices, including the Army’s Combat Capabilities Development Command’s (DEVCOM’s) Ground Vehicle Systems Center. DEVCOM, for example, is currently internally developing an autonomy package previously known as the Robotic Technology Kernel (RTK) but recently rebranded as Army Robotic Common Software (ARCS). That autonomy work is currently billed as a centerpiece for RCV autonomy plans, and moving S-MET over to the same team could build off that work. But while S-MET Inc I acquisition and the ongoing S-MET Inc II competition are moving out, Higgens said the PEO CS&amp;CSS shop is holding on to GEARS development and in the process of evaluating three vendors’ prototypes — Carnegie Robotics, Forterra and Neya Systems. By the end of the year, she said, the trio will be pared back to two vendors for phase II testing and evaluation, running through the end of September 2025. Then in fiscal 2026, the Army will kickstart phase III by crowning an ultimate victor and potentially awarding a contract for autonomy platform integration on up to 41 Palletized Load System trucks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-shifting-s-met-work-over-to-new-acquisition-shop/	2024-10-11T09:04:48-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/IMG_6862-scaled-e1725888049132.jpg
Rafael rolls out Lite Beam laser, Trophy updates to protect vehicles from drone threats	Rafael's Lite Beam system is shown on top of a ground vehicle. (Rafael) Jerusalem — Israel’s Rafael Advanced Defense Systems this week is introducing its new Lite Beam laser air defense system to counter drone threats, as well as updated capabilities for its Trophy active protection system to counter aerial threats, such as those posed by UAVs whose munitions threaten vehicles from above. The more eye-catching of the two systems is Lite Beam, which may be best thought of as a miniature version of the Iron Beam anti-rocket system Rafael has been developing for years. The system has been reported to have a range of around 2,000 meters, and is made up of a 10 kW laser. Many smaller commercially available quadcopters or similar types of drones fly at altitudes in ranges of a few hundred meters to 5,000 meters, but of course if a loitering munition or kamikaze drone is incoming, the distance would close quickly. Laser defensive systems have some natural challenges, including the need to stay on target long enough for the beam to penetrate the outside of the incoming system. As a result, the company says it has combined Lite Beam with its Samson 30mm Remote Weapon Station (RWS), mounted on a four-wheeled platform. (The 30mm Samson has previously been featured on a Boxer by Rafael’s Pearson subsidiary in 2023. This could illustrate the possible use of the Lite Beam and Samson combination on platforms such as the Boxer.) That combo would provide flexible and mobile force protection for infantry or vehicle-borne forces, providing multiple options to hard-kill against drones. Or, as the company put it, 'These solutions provide maneuvering forces with robust force protection and flexibility against a wide range of airborne threats, including UAVs.' However, Rafael has not said if this system is already operational. For its part, Trophy has been operational and combat proven on Israel Defense Forces Merkava tanks since 2011. The system is also used on the Abrams tanks in the US and was recently chosen for use on Leopard 2 tanks in Germany and Norway. In the past, Trophy has focused on threats from ATGMs and RPGs, which largely attack the vehicle from the sides. The new updates will allow the system to counter more aerial threats from above, which is increasingly the way drones and loitering munitions attack ground vehicles. The updated capabilities of the system come out of real-world application from a year of war in Gaza, where the system has been deployed on hundreds of platforms and has seen its most intense combat historically. The threat of drones and UAVs using munitions that strike from above has been a staple of Hamas attacks, to the point that some Israeli tanks were equipped with temporary ad-hoc 'pergola' cages above them during the Gaza conflict to keep operators safe. While those temporary solutions were largely effective, a more systematic solution is required. The company says that the Trophy system 'has successfully neutralized airborne targets such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs), rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), and UAVs, thus enhancing the survivability of armored vehicles.' In addition, the company adds that it will showcase its 'unique modular Counter-Unmanned Aerial Systems (C-UAS) capabilities, combining advanced detection and interception technologies.' Rafael noted in its statement that its 'cutting-edge technology is operational on over a dozen platforms worldwide, including Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs), Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFVs), and Main Battle Tanks (MBTs). It has consistently demonstrated its adaptability and reliability in complex combat scenarios, providing comprehensive protection for vehicles and crews.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/rafael-rolls-out-lite-beam-laser-trophy-updates-to-protect-vehicles-from-drone-threats/	2024-10-11T08:02:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/LITE-BEAM-.jpg

CMMC 2.0 final rule released: New compliance standards set to begin next year	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) WASHINGTON — The final rule for the long-awaited Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, which sets new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information (CIU), was released today for public inspection and will hit the federal register on Oct. 15. Starting in 2025, the Department of Defense will begin to implement its requirement that all defense contractors be CMMC compliant at the time a contract is awarded. However, in order to avoid a scramble to meet the new regulations with little notice, those requirements will become mandatory after a three-year phase-in period. 'The DoD’s follow-on Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) rule change to contractually implement the CMMC Program will be published in early to mid-2025,' a DoD press release said. The main change from CMMC 1.0 to 2.0 is that CMMC 1.0 had a five-level scale for compliance, while CMMC 2.0 has a three-level scale. Additionally, a third-party assessment is being introduced depending on the level of CUI a contractor handles. Contractors at Level 1, who handle 'basic' protection of CUI and some contractors at Level 2 who handle 'general' CUI protection can undergo self-assessments to ensure they are CMMC compliant. The remaining contractors who classify as Level 2 and all Level 3 contractors have to undergo a third-party assessment. Additionally, the new rule also 'clearly identifies' all 24 security controls from NIST SP 800-172 requirements mandated for CMMC Level 3 certification. A recent study reported by Breaking Defense showed that there was a notable discrepancy between companies who completed self-assessments and those who obtained third-party assessments: only 4 percent of respondents were actually CMMC compliant based on third-party assessments, but 75 percent thought they were based on self-assessments. Furthermore, today's release confirmed that contractors have to adhere to controls set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-171. 'CMMC provides the tools to hold accountable entities or individuals that put U.S. information or systems at risk by knowingly misrepresenting their cybersecurity practices or protocols, or knowingly violating obligations to monitor and report cybersecurity incidents and breaches,' the press release stated. The CMMC program 'implements an annual affirmation requirement that is a key element for monitoring and enforcing accountability of a company’s cybersecurity status.' Officials have been teasing CMMC 2.0 since November 2019 as an updated version of CMMC 1.0. The new model was designed to reduce complexity by eliminating unique processes and security practices that industry sees as redundant and costly, David McKeown, Deputy Chief Information Officer for Cybersecurity and Senior Information Security Officer at the Department of Defense. said back in June.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/cmmc-2-0-final-rule-released-new-compliance-standards-set-to-begin-next-year/	2024-10-11T05:45:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
There’s a solution to the Army’s enduring gap in its extended-range artillery fire	It’s not often that anyone would think of the U.S. as being outgunned in this day and age, but in the realm of artillery it’s likely true. While most NATO countries, much of Europe, and near-peer adversaries like Russia and China went to longer L52 cannon barrels years ago that provide greater range, the U.S. Army still uses and only manufactures the smaller L39 barrel that provides what can only be called 'last-generation' capability for 155mm field guns. Download this Game Changer article to read how the DoD's artillery gap can be addressed with a system in production today that can also be manufactured in the U.S.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/theres-a-solution-to-the-armys-enduring-gap-in-its-extended-range-artillery-fire/	2024-10-11T05:28:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Rheinmetall-gamechanger-Artillery-Featured-Image-1.png
Eyeing Australia’s missile money pot, Anduril aims to join solid rocket motor market Down Under	Mulwala site in 2013. This is the only plant in Australia where explosives and propellants are made today. (Australian National Audit Office) SYDNEY — The Australian arm of American defense startup Anduril is hoping Canberra's push for sovereign defense production capability and plans to buy large amounts of long-range precision munitions may help it win a contract to build a brand new solid rocket motor facility using advanced technology. There's a large pile of money to be tapped since Australia has committed up to $21 billion AUD ($14.1 billion USD) for what it's calling the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO) over the next decade, and rocket motors are a key part of that enterprise. There's a wide array of platforms that Australia either owns or plans to buy, including Evolved Seasparrow (ESSM), the SM-2 (already in the inventory) and the SM-6 for the Navy, the Sidewinder (AIM-9X) and AAMRAM for the Air Force, and Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), and two missiles that can be fired from HIMARS mobile launchers, Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS) and PRSM (Precision Strike Missiles) for the Army. 'Having a manufacturing complex in Australia will enable production of solid rocket motors for ourselves, firstly and then ultimately, from an export perspective, to our allies and partners around the world. And there is, at the moment, an inability to meet that demand,' David Goodrich, Anduril Australia's CEO, told Breaking Defense. Australia has a request for information out to industry for solid rocket motor production, so this competition is in the early stages. The person behind Anduril's solid rocket motor enterprise, Brielle Terry, has been here for a week-and-a-half, immersing herself in Australia's unique military and procurement culture. She said the work the company has done in Mississippi setting up their first solid rocket motor plant should be replicable here. 'So we have shovels in the ground. We've got equipment that we've had several years on order, and designs, form, fit and function bespoke for our full-rate production capabilities. All that's coming together,' she told Breaking Defense in an interview, referring to the Mississippi facility, an expansion of which was announced in June. Anduril's foray into solid rocket motor production in the Lucky Country joins Lockheed Martin Australia and Thales Australia, who signed a teaming agreement on Sept. 11 to pursue 'development and production of solid rocket motors for the Australian market,' a joint statement said. The two companies plan to use the existing facilities for production of propellants and munitions at Mulwala in New South Wales and Benalla in Victoria. Thales manages the sites. In an interesting tidbit in that joint statement, the companies say they want to build a plant here 'that is globally competitive and may include the domestic manufacture of SRMs [solid rocket motors] ranging from simple rockets to large, complex strategic motors.' Lockheed already has related business here, as its GMLRS will be built in Australia from 2025, which the Australian Defense Ministry says will be 'an important first step towards establishing domestic missile manufacturing on a larger scale. It will facilitate the transfer of technical data from the United States, establish processes for engineering certification, and begin to build the technical skills of an Australian workforce.' In addition to the team of Lockheed and Thales, NIOA, the Australian privately owned munitions company, is interested in moving into the SRM market, as is Northrop Grumman, the world's largest maker of such motors. Northrop told Defense News recently they have been working for three years to get ready for entry into the market here. Terry said Anduril hopes to lean on tech to push their facility ahead, pointing to the company's Mississippi Solid Rocket Motor Complex as an example. 'So right now, if you look at what is being done in the industry, it's a blast from the past of the 1950s and 1960s technology, which was state-of-the-art at that time. But as you know, with qualification of weapon systems, once you have a qualified system, it's very hard to change the manufacturing line,' Terry said. 'And unfortunately, that means that many of the practices that are found in the United States, as well as here in Mulwala and Benalla, are, you know, still baselined in those 1950s and 1960s technologies. But we've been really looking at automation, increases in quality and safety and keeping humans out of the loop in in very critical quality and and hazardous operations, and using robotics and automation in order to do those.' The combination of building and expanding the new American plant and investing in long-lead items for a possible Australian factory means that 'we feel like we're in a very good place to basically copy and paste everything here that we've been doing in coastal Mississippi,' Terry added. Terry and Goodrich said that the company's tech should allow them to quickly scale up production for either the domestic or export markets when needed without having to expand the size of the facility because of improved efficiency. The smaller footprint of the more efficient plant means they could build in new locations, if the Australian federal and state governments approve. And the company has been scouting other sites than the existing pair, they said. The final cherry on top of the Anduril pitch is a new solid rocket fuel in development, called ALITEC, which Terry claims will 'bring the largest change in performance to the solid rocket motor industry that we've seen in our lifetimes since 1954 when the existing propellant was manufactured.' The new fuel uses lessons learned from the automobile battery industry, uses an aluminum lithium alloy and could boost GMLRS' range by more than 40 percent, she said. The fuel is not ready for use yet, but Terry said 'we're looking for a fieldable solution next calendar year.' The Australian plant could produce both existing fuel and ALITEC.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/eyeing-australias-missile-money-pot-anduril-aims-to-join-solid-rocket-motor-market-down-under/	2024-10-10T23:33:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Mulwala-Site-in-2013-e1664978071869.jpeg
Secretive space plane X-37B to test ‘first of a kind’ maneuvers for shifting orbits	Artist rendering of the X-37B conducting an aerobraking maneuver using the drag of Earth’s atmosphere. (Courtesy graphic by Boeing Space) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's X-37B experimental spacecraft is about to begin taking a series of 'novel maneuvers' to safely dispose of its service module that carries extra payloads, the service announced today in a rare public statement about the activities of the mysterious spaceplane. 'The X-37B Orbital Test Vehicle (OTV-7) will begin executing a series of novel maneuvers, called aerobraking, to change its orbit around Earth and safely dispose of its service module components in accordance with recognized standards for space debris mitigation,' the Space Force said. Aerobraking uses the drag of Earth's atmosphere to slow a spacecraft and allow it to move into a lower orbit without relying solely on firing its propulsion engines, in essence making a series of orbits that look like a spiral to achieve a lower orbit. (Think about those spiral wishing wells that used to populate shopping mall corridors, where a coin put on the top surface spirals its way down into a small hole and plonks into a collection box.) The maneuver 'enables the spacecraft to change orbits while expending minimal fuel,' the Space Force release said. The X-37B OTV-7 was launched into highly elliptical orbit (HEO) on Dec. 28, 2023 to conduct a number of tests, described by the Space Force at the time as including 'operating the reusable spaceplane in new orbital regimes, experimenting with future space domain awareness technologies, and investigating the radiation effects on materials provided by NASA.' Earlier missions took place in low Earth orbit (LEO). 'Once the aerobrake maneuver is complete, the X-37B will resume its test and experimentation objectives until they are accomplished,' the Space Force said. Asked about the specific trajectory of the maneuvers, a Space Force spokesperson declined to give details. To safely deorbit, however, the service module would need to be placed in LEO at a low enough altitude to allow it to eventually fall into the Earth's atmosphere due to drag. Current US debris mitigation standards call for defunct spacecraft in lower orbits to be stationed where they will deorbit within 25 years, although the Federal Communications Commission is requiring companies to reduce that time to five years. And aerobraking would allow the spaceplane to efficiently move from HEO to a stable LEO position to eject the service module, which is attached to the back of the X-37B to provide more cargo space. The module would then burn up in the atmosphere. In its previous mission, the reusable space plane simply jettisoned the module as itself began its de-orbit maneuvers to land safely. Thus, it is the maneuvering that is the new element of the spaceplane's recent activities. 'This first of a kind maneuver from the X-37B is an incredibly important milestone for the United States Space Force as we seek to expand our aptitude and ability to perform in this challenging domain,' said Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman in the service press release. US Space Command has been clamoring for new technology to enable 'dynamic space operations,' which include 'sustained' maneuvering that doesn't eat up fuel to allow US military spacecraft and satellites to outrun suspect adversary satellites — or potentially be able to chase those suspect birds down both to assess any threats they pose and possibly take action to neutralize them. The Defense Department has been coy about X-37B's missions, capabilities and whereabouts when on orbit since taking the space plane program over from NASA in 2006 — and the robotic craft long has been the subject of speculation, including by Russia and China, that it in reality is an on-orbit weapons platform. According to Secure World Foundation's latest 'Global Counterspace Capabilities' report [PDF], that speculation was fueled in recent years by the October 2023 release of the Space Force's first official painting, which showed a military space plane described only as a 'futuristic intercept vehicle' getting ready to engage with an enemy satellite. At the time, the service said the painting was strictly a result of the artist's imagination. Low-cost maneuvers such as aerobraking could be one method of doing the job of approaching adversary sats — although rather slowly. While the X-37B program has been managed since 2010 by the Air Force Rapid Capabilities Office, Space Force's Delta 9 now responsible for oversight of X-37B's on-orbit operations. Delta 9, according to the service's website, conducts 'protect and defend operations and providing national decision authorities with response options to deter and, when necessary, defeat orbital threats' and preparing Guardians for 'orbital warfare.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/secretive-space-plane-x-37b-to-test-first-of-a-kind-maneuvers-for-shifting-orbits/	2024-10-10T14:02:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/X-37B-aerobrakes-scaled.jpeg
Driverless systems are ready for the next gear	Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary (ROGUE) &#8211; Fires vehicle with Forterra’s self-driving system called AutoDrive navigates off-road terrain. (Photo courtesy of Forterra) Marines and Soldiers operating manned missile batteries are vulnerable to counter-battery fire once they fire their systems, which are highly visible to enemy sensors. Autonomous, driverless systems can counter this threat, which is multidimensional. For example, an enemy warship with advanced sensors can quickly identify the threat track of an anti-ship ballistic missile and return fire. Or it can be as simple as a first-person-view quadcopter transmitting the position of a missile battery back to an adversary for counter fire. 'Counter-battery fire is a real problem,' said Scott Sanders, former Marine Special Operations Officer and chief growth officer for Forterra. 'I would not want to be next to anything that fires a weapon system in modern combat like a HIMARS battery or anti-ship missile. 'If you don’t move fast enough and end up taking counter-battery fire from a ship, you’ve lost not only millions of dollars in hardware but the Marines who are in it and who will be much harder to replace than hardware. It would be huge to get humans away from those vehicles and platforms.' In those very real scenarios, what’s needed are mobile launch systems that can fire and actually be on-the-move even before a Navy/Marine Corps Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) missile, for example, strikes its target. Field-based artillery teams operating those systems are already trained like NASCAR pit crews. However, our adversaries’ advanced capabilities in the electromagnetic spectrum still make them vulnerable and targets before they can get away. The solution is bringing autonomy to those platforms so they can maneuver and fire faster than any crewed system could, while keeping operators safe at standoff distances. Sanders said it simply: 'Robots can displace faster and there is less risk to force if they are hit by enemy fire.' In addition to the life-saving impact of standoff capability, autonomous systems address multiple use cases related to: counterterrorism and counterinsurgency; search and rescue; route clearance; logistics and supply; explosives ordnance disposal; surveillance and reconnaissance; urban warfare; critical infrastructure and base protection; chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear (CBRN) threats; anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) environments; and border security. The use cases for autonomy also extend to all systems that emit electronic signatures like radar and other sensors that can be detected. There’s a reason the AGM-88 HARM (High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile) is stockpiled by the U.S. Marines, Navy, and Air Force, as well as more than a dozen countries around the world. Any active radar system is easy to find on the battlefield because they stand out in the electromagnetic spectrum, so you’re inducing a lot of risk every time one lights up. Driverless, robotic ground systems counter counter-fires by letting the USMC and others project more firepower and sensing capability forward without risking Marines or Soldiers. Presently, Forterra is executing the first successful deployment of self-driving systems for the Marine Corps’ Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary (ROGUE) Fires under the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System program (NMESIS). Built on an unmanned ground vehicle platform, ROGUE Fires abets ground-based anti-ship missile operations.

(Photo courtesy of Forterra) Autonomy for USMC and Army platforms The Marine Corps and Army have recognized the value of developing robotic programs and injecting autonomy into legacy platforms for the reasons discussed. 'The potential benefits of autonomous/robotic platforms to the Army may prove to be advantageous to all warfighting functions’ mission sets,' states the Army Futures Command Concept for Fires 2028. 'These technologies may decrease cost, improve effectiveness, allow the Army to operate dispersed over larger areas, and importantly help keep Soldiers out of harm’s way. They may prove useful for providing logistical support (such as, fuel delivery, and missile or artillery resupply capabilities) enhanced common man-machine interfaces, improved targeting, and ability to process mega-data.' There’s a large community out there that says they can solve some of those challenges in ground autonomy, but few other than Forterra can say they’ve brought reliability, predictability, trustworthiness, and a proven ability to scale autonomy solutions over two decades. Forterra is a leading provider of autonomous systems for ground-based movement and it was among the earliest innovators in the field of driverless technology that focused on building systems that protect front-line troops and enable civilian workers in the industrial base. Today the company is one of the main providers of autonomy systems to all of the DoD’s ground autonomy programs. In September Forterra announced its $75 million Series B fundraising that will enable the company to accelerate and scale the deployment of their autonomous driving system (ADS) called AutoDrive with defense and industrial customers. Forterra’s two decades of experience in the industry, combined with recent venture-capital, positions the company to more rapidly conduct research and development, iteration, and testing needed to quickly field autonomous systems. 'I’m confident to say that we have integrated on more defense vehicles than any other company on the planet over the last 20 years,' said Zach LaCelle, head of product for Forterra. 'As a result, we are intimately familiar with the pitfalls and challenges of everything from base vehicle to sensor integration and mounting, what radios to use, the power-conditioning requirements, the brake systems needed – every capability a vehicle needs to enable autonomy.' A Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (SMET) is capable of a wide range of CONOPS from casualty evacuation to surveillance and reconnaissance. (Photo courtesy of Forterra) Commonality across program offices The robotic programs discussed enable the DoD to grow logistics capabilities, surveillance and reconnaissance, and firepower without adding personnel to combat units or putting them in harm’s way. There are differences between the programs, however, in so far as each has their own requirements, acquisition strategy, and pathways. Due to the fact that these initiatives also report up to different program offices such as Army PEO Soldier, PEO Combat Support &amp; Combat Service Support, Marine Corps Systems Command, and others, there’s overlap in the capability sets, whether that’s on a robotic combat vehicle or a PLS truck. That raises the question: what synergies, acquisition efficiencies, cost savings, requirements definition, technology sharing, and overall effectiveness can be wrought by coordinating autonomy programs between offices and services – especially when the programs often employ the same autonomy technologies, have many of the same goals and outcomes, and have mutual interests in seeing autonomous ground vehicles programs become successful. 'We’re in a unique position to work across all of those programs and know the answers to those questions after decades of doing autonomy, so we could certainly shed light on this,' said LaCelle. 'We use that knowledge to communicate with both our defense and OEM partners.' Autonomy that works Autonomous systems in the ground domain are ready to be fielded today and will have an immediate impact on the lives of Marines and Soldiers. Autonomy is complex and unique with dual-use applications that the military can leverage to save development costs and get capabilities fielded faster. Forterra is on the forefront of thinking about not just how autonomy is going to protect troops, but how it’s going to be applicable across multiple different warfighting domains. 'The most important part about this is that it’s not a science project,' said Sanders. 'This technology works well and reliably, and we’ve spent 20 years making it functional and scalable.' Forterra has developed mission-relevant ways to demonstrate robotic systems by developing the tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as the Concepts of Operation, around how they can be most effective in accomplishing tasks without risking the lives of servicemembers. Forterra’s autonomy platform is part of military operations today safely conducting reconnaissance, troop supply missions, and related tasks during ground warfare to keep Marines and Soldiers safe. Forterra has shipped more than 100 vehicles that have operated a cumulative 400,000 miles. Its technology is currently operating in U.S. military programs and have operated in over 10 countries in both defense and commercial applications.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/driverless-systems-are-ready-for-the-next-gear/	2024-10-10T12:50:54-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Header.png
New Hanwha Defense USA exec sets sights on Navy contracts for Philly Shipyard	A petroleum tanker stands while being built at the Aker Philadelphia Shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, U.S., on Tuesday, June 19, 2012. Photographer: Bradley C. Bower/Bloomberg via Getty Images WASHINGTON — The new chief executive of the US unit of South Korean industrial conglomerate Hanwha Group wants to restore naval shipbuilding at Philly Shipyard, once the acquisition of that business is finalized this fall. Mike Smith, who took the top job at Hanwha Defense USA in August, acknowledged that winning US Navy shipbuilding contracts is 'going to be challenging' for the shipyard, which currently builds ships for the Department of Transportation’s Maritime Administration as well as commercial customers. 'I don't see us building destroyers in Philadelphia,' he said during a briefing with reporters today. 'I do see us building the fleet the Navy needs next.' That could include constructing large or medium-sized unmanned surface vessels, as well as 'specialty ships' like icebreakers, replenishment oilers, naval training vessels and other auxiliary ships, Smith said. Beyond the construction of new ships, the company could also pursue opportunities to build modules — essentially a smaller section of a ship — that would be incorporated into a Navy vessel during final assembly at a prime contractor’s shipyard, he said. Smith said the company isn’t focused on one specific shipbuilding program, noting that many programs need 'relief valves.' 'I think the smartest thing for us would be to be flexible and support where the need is greatest,' he said. 'So it could be Columbia [class ballistic missile submarines], it could be Virginia [class attack submarines], it could be Ford [class aircraft carriers], could be the [Arleigh Burke-class] destroyer program. 'I don't know about the [Constellation-class] frigate. I know they're still looking for a second source, or second production yard. You want to be positioned to give the Navy as many options as possible,' he said. The bigger issue, Smith said, is ensuring Philly Shipyard has the necessary facilities and infrastructure to take on work as it becomes available. 'We have a couple consultants who are saying the opportunities are a lot closer than we might be ready for,' he added. Another near-term opportunity is the maintenance, overhaul and repair of existing ships, which Smith said could help 'relieve some of the under-capacity that you have throughout the East Coast.' Hanwha Systems and its shipbuilding arm Hanwha Ocean announced plans to buy Norwegian-owned Philly Shipyard in June in a $100 million deal, which is set to close by the end of 2024, pending regulatory approvals. At the time, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro called the agreement a 'game-changing milestone in our new Maritime Statecraft' that could shake up the competitive landscape among US shipbuilders. Bryan Clark, a fellow at the Hudson Institute, told Breaking Defense in July that Philly Shipyard belongs to a group of commercial shipbuilders that constructs what he called the 'Jones Act fleet,' named for the US law stating that goods shipped between American ports must be transported on US-built vessels and operated by American crews. Because work on these ships comes in waves, Clark predicted that Hanwha would position Philly Shipyard to take on work building Navy ships during an upcoming dearth of contracts for Jones Act ships. Specifically, he pointed to the Ready Reserve Fleet, a group of auxiliary ships the Navy and other government agencies rely upon for non-combat tasks, as a ripe opportunity for the shipbuilder. Justin Katz contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-hanwha-defense-usa-exec-sets-sights-on-navy-contracts-for-philly-shipyard/	2024-10-10T12:50:43-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/GettyImages-146565286-scaled-e1718904824503.jpg
NATO to define national space contributions to allied warfighting	NATO Allies from 23 Nations and two Partner Nations, Australia and Japan, participate in the second ever NATO Space Operations Commanders’ Conference at Allied Air Command, June 12-13, 2024. Participants discussed space capability and capacity through collaboration and cooperation with a focus on Space Security and Space Warfare. (NATO AIRCOM photo by OR-9 Arnaud Chamberlin) WASHINGTON — NATO's planning directorate is working to identify what space capabilities each allied nation can bring to the collective fight with the goal of assigning national contributions of kit and people power, according to a senior NATO officer. 'There's an effort right now from the headquarters to survey all 32 nations to tell us exactly what space capability you have. That way, we can assign targets to you, and we can direct you to provide that capability to NATO,' said Maj. Gen. Devin Pepper, deputy chief of staff for strategic plans and policy at NATO's Allied Command Transformation (ACT). ACT, based in Norfolk, Va., is the only NATO headquarters based in the United States. It serves as NATO's 'Strategic Warfare Development Command' responsible for the development of military structures, forces, capabilities and doctrine, according to a NATO fact sheet. NATO's other strategic command, Allied Command Operations (ACO) headquartered in Mons, Belgium, is the alliance's warfighting command. Pepper, who is the first US Space Force general officer to be assigned to NATO headquarters, told the Mitchell Institute today that, at the moment, the US provides the bulk of space capabilities 'that NATO can leverage today in an exercise or in a potential conflict.' This includes, he said, everything from GPS to ballistic missile warning to satellite communications (SATCOM) to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR). 'But there's other nations out there that that have space capabilities that can contribute as well, in addition to commercial capabilities,' he said. Pepper explained that while NATO in 2019 agreed to its first space policy, and in June 2024 created a Space Branch under ACT, the alliance up to now has only laid out what space missions are important and the general types of capabilities it needs to face up to threats from Russia and China. 'My director is responsible for what's called the NATO Defense Planning Process [NDPP]. That is a &#8230; four-year process that we go through to look at what capability targets that we assign to the nation,' he said. First, ACT takes stock of national capabilities and assets — 'such as carriers or fighters or medical groups or battalions.' Based on that assessment, the command determines 'these are the things that are required in order to prosecute the deterrence and defense plan from ACO and from [the Supreme Allied Commander Europe]' from each member state. 'Right now in the NDPP, we only have qualitative requirements that we assign it to the nation,' Pepper said. 'So: &#8216;Please deliver us [electromagnetic spectrum] capability or SATCOM or ISR.' We have not gotten to the point where we have assigned quantitative targets to the nations. So, in other words, until we know exactly what a nation has that they can offer, we can't task them to provide it yet. We're working through that right now.' ACT is 'at the beginning' of the process, Pepper noted. 'Where do we go from here? What space capabilities to each of the nations have that NATO can leverage?' he asked. 'How do we leverage all of the nations' capability, and then where do we direct them to provide investments to?' To help the allies work out exactly what will be required by the collective force, Pepper said ACT is creating a tabletop exercise going through 'thought scenarios' and 'vignettes' on 'where space is relevant and appropriate' to allied operations for NATO's Military Committee. 'I'll give you an example. In the NDPP, we have asked nations to provide offensive space capability,' he said. 'But in order to leverage that capability, you have to get consensus from all 32 nations. Well, we have a war game on how you get to consensus.' The Military Committee, which meets three times a year at its top level of allied defense chiefs, 'is responsible for translating political decision and guidance into military direction, and for recommending measures considered necessary for the defence of the NATO area and the implementation of decisions regarding military operations,' according to a NATO fact sheet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/nato-to-define-national-space-contributions-to-allied-warfighting/	2024-10-10T12:15:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8498041-e1728583927978.jpg
AI ASAP: Army wants OSD’s help to speed algorithm acquisition	Mr. Young Bang, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army (Acquisition, Logistics and Technology,) addresses the moderator and members of the panel during the Under Secretary of the Army’s Digital Transformation Panel at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C., Sept. 10, 2023. (US Army photo by Henry Villarama) WASHINGTON — Army acquisition officials are working with their counterparts in the Office of the Secretary of Defense on how to speed up AI programs. The service has even suggested developing a special AI variant of the existing Software Acquisition Pathway (SWP), although OSD seems less than enthused about that proposal, according to statements by both Army and OSD officials Tuesday at the annual Professional Services Council conference on defense. Software development in general moves fast, but AI specifically can evolve even faster, said Young Bang, the principal civilian deputy to Army acquisition chief Doug Bush. 'Once you make the algorithm, really, you can extend and retrain them at the edge, [and] you can do that quickly,' Bang told the PSC conference. In some cases, 'I can train algorithms literally overnight,' he said. 'Some of these take actually take a little bit longer … [maybe] a week.' The ability to update AI in days is an even tighter cycle than envisioned by the standard Software Acquisition Pathway, which was created in 2020 to accelerate development of software in general by adopting best practices from the private sector. (SWP was part of a larger package of reforms first proposed in fall 2019 by then-Under Secretary for Acquisition Ellen Lord). 'There’s great utility in the Software Pathway,' Bang said. '[But] the requirement in there is that you do an MVCR [Minimum Viable Capability Release] in a year. … We’re endeavoring to get capabilities out faster. 'We’re actually working with OSD A&amp;S [Acquisition and Sustainment] to … see how we can actually create a sub-path in the Software Pathway for AI,' Bang said. 'We don’t know all the details, we’re still working it out.' 'It is something that I’m sure that we’re continuing to sort through,' said Deborah Rosenblum, the acting deputy to DoD acquisition chief Bill LaPlante, when asked about the topic later during the same conference. '[We’re] definitely not looking at a new pathway. … I do believe it’s likely to be through the Software Pathway, if only because we’re trying to expedite and move quickly, and we feel the way in which the pathway is designed has enough flexibility and agility to be able to accommodate for that.' But Rosenblum didn’t explicitly rule out Bang’s suggestion of carving out a 'sub-pathway' within SWP. Neither did one of her senior aides, contracting expert John Tenaglia, in a sidebar conversation with Breaking Defense. The system is intended to be flexible, Tenaglia emphasized: 'In reality, there’s mixing and matching' of different accelerated procurement authorities, he said, for example by hybridizing a SWP procurement with other contract types. Bang, too, touted the ability to mix-and-match: The service’s high-profile XM-30 program to replace the Reagan-era M2 Bradley troop carrier, he noted, involves both a Software Pathway acquisition for the code and a Mid-Tier Acquisition (MTA) for the physical vehicle, allowing software updates to race ahead independent of the slower development cycles for hardware. (The even more ambitious Robotic Combat Vehicle program has a similar software-hardware split). But he still wanted more agility than he believed the current system could provide. 'I’m about disrupting the status quo,' Bang told the PSC conference. 'Let’s figure it out, let’s be creative, let’s put things together, let’s put an MTA with the Software Pathway and work with OSD to get to something faster for AI.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/ai-asap-army-wants-osds-help-to-speed-algorithm-acquisition/	2024-10-10T11:35:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240523_young_bang_8063486-scaled-e1716469935189.jpg
Strengthened government-industry collaboration will keep capable adversaries off balance	Scott Alexander, Missile Solutions President, L3Harris, participates in a discussion on the 'The future of weapons development' at the 2024 AFA conference. The threats facing the U.S. and its allies continue to proliferate. With peer and near-peer adversaries deploying increasingly advanced weapon systems across all domains the diversity, sophistication and quantity of challenges continue to increase. Even those with limited industrial capacity and technological prowess have access to relatively low-cost, modern weaponry capable of inflicting significant damage. To stay ahead of this complex and dynamic threat environment, the U.S. military requires a robust and agile industrial base capable of rapid prototyping and development, high-volume manufacturing and the ability to surge or redirect production based on shifting demand. This was one of many important topics discussed at the Air and Space Forces Association’s conference held in the nation’s capital recently. In an ever-complex geopolitical environment, what does the future of weapon development look like? And how can industry and government best work together to push these critical systems into the hands of our military faster? Here are four key pillars that can offer the U.S. this decisive advantage in an age of growing threats. Collaboration at the core To accomplish our shared goal of enabling our warfighters to stay ahead of the rapidly evolving threat environment, our government customers are smartly embracing new acquisition philosophies that encourage collaboration amongst industry. Initiatives like the Weapon Open System Architecture (WOSA), being used by the U.S. Air Force and now the Navy, are encouraging modularity and interoperability between component vendors. For example, the inclusion of these WOSA standards within Eglin Air Force Base’s Weapons Government Reference Architecture will support high-volume production and rapid technology iteration as future threats evolve. The government can take additional steps to encourage open standards and plug-and-play modularity, especially at the subcomponent level. They might consider, for example, providing solicitation information directly to major subsystem providers through contracting vehicles such as Eglin’s Wide Agile Acquisition Contract. This would ensure major contributors within the weapons ecosystem have the same information &#8211; regardless of prime-subcontractor relationship. It also opens the door for the government to deal directly with major subsystem vendors. Regardless of the mechanisms, continued robust government-industry dialogue is essential. This dialogue helps align expectations with industry capabilities, while keeping industry responsive to the government’s objectives. Communicating requirements early and often on acquisition programs will lead to better outcomes for all. At L3Harris, we’re also focused on seeking collaborative opportunities not just with the government but also with our industry peers and emerging new entrants. From incorporating new technologies into our manufacturing processes to partnering with academic institutions and strategically aligned start-ups, we are working with other disruptive innovators to cultivate teaming opportunities that bring robust, discriminating capabilities to the fight – and ultimately continue to give the U.S. an outsized advantage over those who would do us harm. Investment in sub-tier suppliers Russia’s war in Ukraine and emerging global issues have made it clear that the United States must reinvigorate defense production supply chains that went dormant or slowed over the past several decades. Solid rocket motors (SRMs), in particular, power the vast majority of U.S. weapon systems and are rightly a key focus as it relates to strengthening the industrial supply base. One easy action we can take to quickly strengthen the industrial supply chain as it relates to SRM components is directly investing in suppliers of cases, igniters and nozzles. In some cases, we’re down to a single provider of these critical SRM subcomponents, which makes production scalability a challenge – especially when multiple primes are vying for the same resource. After all, no matter how many SRM providers come into the market, we will all still rely on the same sub-tier suppliers. We’ve taken this action seriously at L3Harris by directly investing our own capital into critical SRM component suppliers. Over the last 18 months, we have provided more than $25 million to our sub-tier SRM suppliers to expand their capacity and modernize their manufacturing processes. More investment in these critical suppliers is necessary by government and industry alike. Direct and multi-year contracts When we know what’s coming, we can be ready. Multi-year contracts encourage private sector investment at the subcontractor level, boosting industrial-base stability and capacity while fostering innovation and reducing costs. Accurate and consistent demand signals support investment in infrastructure and facilities needed to provide capacity and drive affordability. In fact, where it makes sense, direct-to-supplier contracts with the government can also be an effective tool to increase affordability and get these systems in the hands of our government customer more swiftly. Leveraging additive manufacturing for rapid prototyping While not always the answer, additive manufacturing (AM), along with 3D modeling and digital engineering, is well suited for rapid prototyping of critical components – especially on complex hardware like hypersonic propulsion systems. On L3Harris scramjet engines, for example, AM has led to a more than 75 percent reduction in manufacturing time and costs, and a 95 percent reduction in parts count. Targeted application of AM is just one example of how industry can quickly collaborate with our government partners to design, model, prototype and test at the speed of relevance. America and its allies are facing a world where increasingly capable adversaries are probing for weaknesses across multiple domains. Government and industry must continue to work together to make informed and timely acquisition decisions to get critical weapon systems into the hands of our warfighters. By embracing modularity and interoperability initiatives like WOSA, and through robust dialogue where government requirements are communicated clearly, early and often, industry can rise to meet the challenges posed by rapidly evolving threats. Our ability to deploy weapons in large numbers quickly and affordably, and to rapidly innovate against evolving threats, will keep our adversaries guessing and ultimately create a safer world.

Breaking Defense launches Defense Business Report, a new channel and newsletter	Breaking Defense today is launching the Defense Business Report, a new channel and weekly newsletter on the most important news about the business aspects of defense, including innovation, mergers and acquisitions, finance and the industrial base. Our Defense Business Report will provide a focus within Breaking Defense for those interested in the rapidly evolving business dynamics of defense, at a time of immense change in technology, global threats and the business milieu. Defense Business Report will be a channel on Breaking Defense and, starting the week of October 14, its own bespoke newsletter. Breaking Defense made an investment earlier this year to double-down on our coverage of the business of defense because of a simple fact: This is arguably the most transformational moment for the defense industrial base since the end of the Cold War. At a policy level, leaders across the western world are talking about production and investment in the industrial base in a way they never have before. Technologically, capabilities like AI, cyber, directed energy, hypersonics, drones and 3D printing are likely game changers. And a new wave of small entrepreneurial firms are hoping to upend the hold legacy defense companies have on the global military budget. All of this reporting — guided by Valerie Insinna, a highly respected veteran journalist with deep experience covering the industry — will now have a home and channel on Breaking Defense. This isn’t 'tick-tock' coverage of stock prices or mundane details, but news that matters, analysis, interviews with key business leaders — the view towards what is driving the defense business today. Val, along with the rest of the Breaking Defense team, will make sure that everything you need to know about where the industry is going is laid out cleanly on a regular basis on the new channel, and then weekly, in an easy-to-digest newsletter. Sign up for the Defense Business Report today. You can’t afford to miss it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/breaking-defense-launches-defense-business-report-a-new-channel-and-newsletter/	2024-10-10T09:57:11-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Breaking-Defense-Atlas-3-1.png
After purported IDF strikes on UN peacekeepers, what comes next?	Spanish peacekeepers of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) coordinate their patrol with the Lebanese army, in Marjayoun in south Lebanon on October 8, 2024. (Photo by AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — United Nations peacekeepers are sounding the alarm today as its forces and facilities have been struck by Israeli forces, including at least two incidents the UN organization says were conducted 'deliberately.' 'This morning, two peacekeepers were injured after an IDF Merkava tank fired its weapon toward an observation tower at UNIFIL’s headquarters in Naqoura, directly hitting it and causing them to fall,' the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL) said in a statement. 'The injuries are fortunately, this time, not serious, but they remain in hospital.' The statement added that on Wednesday 'IDF soldiers deliberately fired at and disabled the position’s perimeter-monitoring cameras. They also deliberately fired on UNP 1-32A in Ras Naqoura, where regular Tripartite meetings were held before the conflict began, damaging lighting and a relay station.' In its statement UNIFIL reminded IDF and all other actors of their 'obligations' and that 'any deliberate attack on peacekeepers is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and of Security Council resolution 1701' that all sides involved agreed to in 2006. The statement said UNIFIL was following up with Israeli forces on this issue, who do not appear to have responded publicly to UNIFIL's statement. The incidents threaten to throw more gasoline on the fire that is the conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, and puts UNIFIL's already controversial and contentious peacekeeping mission in an even tighter spot. The UNIFIL force is made up of international troops from 49 UN nations, including an Irish contingent that was involved in a tense standoff with Israeli forces over the weekend. At the end of September Israeli forces called on UNIFIL to withdraw from some positions in southern Lebanon, but UNIFIL declined to move. Senior Middle East and North Africa analyst at the RANE Network Ryan Bohl told Breaking Defense that there are two likely possibilities to explain IDF's purported actions. Despite UNIFIL's declaration that two of the incidents were deliberate, he said it's possible 'IDF troops on the ground mistook a UNIFIL post for Hezbollah and opened fire. Less likely, but still possible is that the IDF or at least some of its commanders on the ground want to pressure UNIFIL to withdraw in order to increase the IDF’s operational space in the Southern Lebanon.' Retired Lebanese Brig. Gen. Andre Bou Maachar agreed with Bohl’s second proposal, suggesting that today’s attack might have been conducted by IDF as a leverage to pressure UNIFIL countries to withdraw their troops and imposing a different security system in the region. He added that it also 'indicates that UNIFIL and LAF [Lebanese Armed Forces] can’t be distanced from the conflict, as these incidents will probably take place.' After today’s attack, Bohl expected UNIFIL to 'likely reassess where it can position forces in the south, though without a full mandate to pull out I suspect some will remain in the area. Israel will likely face intense pressure to coordinate military action with UNIFIL to prevent more of these incidents.' Bou Maachar said UNIFIL could respond by withdrawing a few kilometers north. After about two decades of deployment in the south, the two experts said they believe that the UNIFIL is unlikely to stop military actions between Israel and Hezbollah, despite the peacekeeping moniker. 'UNIFIL is also just as unlikely to stop Israeli military action, though it could slow or shape it as Israel has little interest in the diplomatic blowback that would come from striking UN troops,' Bohl agreed, Bou Maachar said the recent attacks indicated 'that nothing stops Israel from achieving its military and political goal, and it doesn’t respect any international or humanitarian law.' Israel has pushed back on international condemnation regarding civilian deaths caused by its offensive in Gaza and Lebanon, saying it is targeting terrorists who endanger civilians by hiding among them. Resolution 1701 referenced in the UNIFIL statement refers to the agreement that ended the one-month long Israeli war with Lebanon in July 2006, and greatly increased the number of UNIFIL troops in Lebanon deployed along the border to a maximum of 15,000. Earlier in August this year, UNIFIL’s mandate was renewed for the first time, while the country saw virtual daily clashes in the south — the kind of violence the peacekeeping mission has struggled to dampen. As of August, about 10,000 troops are operating there, UNIFIL deputy spokesperson Kandice Ardiel told Breaking Defense previously. 'From 2006 until October 2023, under the framework of resolution 1701, we did not see major conflict in the south. We saw occasional incidents, but those were de-escalated relatively quickly. The situation now is far worse than anything we saw since 2006,' Ardiel said in an August interview. According to their mandate, UNIFIL have the right of self-defense that they haven't exercised yet. 'In addition to the use of force beyond self-defence, and without prejudice of the primary responsibility of the Government of Lebanon, UNIFIL may under certain circumstances and conditions resort to the proportionate and gradual use of force to ensure that its area of operations is not utilized for hostile activities,' Chapter 6 of UN charter states.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/un-peacekeepers-struck-by-israeli-fire-in-lebanon-warn-of-grave-violation-of-international-law/	2024-10-10T09:47:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241010_unifil_lebanon_GettyImages-2176702453-scaled-e1728577082547.jpg
The ‘Cost Plus’ boondoggle that hobbles US defense	Capitol Hill seen on a cloudy day. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images) As traditional defense contractors and outsiders alike gather for the Association of the US Army mega-conference this month, the latest Army acquisition policy just reinforces old dysfunctions that keep the most innovative firms away. Above all, the Army’s March directive on 'Enabling Modern Software Development &amp; Acquisition Practices' [PDF] encourages the service to buy custom-built software, developed under arcane cost-plus accounting rules, 'to the maximum extent possible,' instead of following best private-sector practices. Even the official Senate Armed Services Committee report [PDF] warns that the Army directive 'appears to deviate from the current law' and requires the service report back by Jan. 15 on how it 'will implement the Directive in a manner that supports the participation of small businesses and nontraditional defense contractors.' The Army’s fumbling is just the latest and most blatant manifestation of the antiquated business model in place across the Department of Defense. It’s an approach that consistently fails to seek out, absorb, and deploy innovative new technologies as fast as the commercial world or our adversaries. There are pockets of excellence — like DIU, AFWERX, SOFWERX, and SDA — that have entrepreneurial culture baked into their DNA. They are funded by a disorganized hodgepodge of well-meaning, if uncoordinated pots of money — including Hedge Portfolio, APFIT, RDER, RCCTO, and RIF — and deliver cutting-edge products, including software, to the warfighter at the speed of relevance using commercial purchasing methods. But the Army directive appears to be doubling down on the legacy system that everyone else is trying to move away from as quickly as possible. That current system, resembling the Soviet centralized economy model, notoriously ignores currently available technology and products made by commercial companies, and instead fantasizes impossible-to-make exquisite weapons through the 'requirements' process, runs a fiction-writing contest to select from one of the five remaining large prime contractors that can write such proposals, then awards the winner a monopoly for decades for an item they have never made. Because the DoD locks themselves into purchasing that product only from that contractor, no private company would invest out of their own pocket in a superior product, as there is no way for the DoD to switch. The prime contractor is free to burn billions of taxpayer dollars for years, unmolested by competitive pressures from other vendors or adversaries whizzing by us. The worst part, however, is the way these prime contractors get paid, specifically the so-called 'Cost Plus' model — which particularly drew ire in the SASC report. Media reports often liken the Cost-Plus model to an hourly time and materials arrangement. It is not. It is much, much worse. Imagine you need to replace the heating system in your house. You prefer the plumber bid for the job using a firm fixed price with everything included so there are no nasty surprises at the end. Many plumbers work this way: pad the estimate a little for safety, then perform the work while aggressively keeping expenses in check to maximize the profit left over at the end. Thousands of years of economic evolution have made this the most popular business model as it rewards efficient work by the vendor with higher profits and rewards the customer with certainty of cost. If the job is too complex for firm fixed price — say, there are unknowns inside the walls — the plumber might say, 'It will be $85 per hour for my labor, plus the cost of materials'. This is still a normal commercial practice. The plumber will be rewarded for driving the underlying cost of that hour as far below $85 as possible to maximize the profit on each hour. This is where the DoD goes off the rails. Imagine then telling your plumber: 'OK, inside that $85 per hour, I need to see exactly how much you are paying yourself and your workers in salary, benefits, and all your internal business costs, so I can make sure you’re not making too much profit'. After some very colorful language, the plumber will tell you it’s none of your business. But a defense contractor can’t tell the US military to go to hell. There’s no commercial market for tanks and submarines. So the hardcore defense industry has had no choice but to implement laborious, bespoke accounting systems — and, in fact, has used them not only as a barrier to entry, keeping competitors from entering the defense business, but as a tool to extract more profit from the Pentagon. In the Cost-Plus world companies are rewarded for increasing their business expenses. Instead of $85, you get $125, then add all the unnecessary auditing and accounting expenses just to keep track of all this nonsense and you’re up to $150. Then, because you have a locked-in monopoly, the hours spent performing each task magically inflate once the work starts. The customer can’t cut the contractor off and switch to someone else. The excellent article The Law the Department of Defense Loves to Break accurately describes the misguided philosophy that drove DoD to create this dystopian model in the first place. (The article was written by an employee of non-traditional tech contractor Palantir, but is not an official company statement). But needless to say, it is perhaps the worst way to buy anything that one could possibly imagine. The net result of the Cost Plus incentive structure is to skew the 'make or buy?' decision towards 'make' wherever possible. Buying a finished off-the-shelf item that could shave years off of deployment to the warfighter, and save billions in the process is anathema to a Cost Plus contractor. It would cost them a boatload of profit they could make reinventing wheels. Lawmakers are no dummies. In 1994 they passed the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, which amongst other things, mandates that before a Cost-Plus custom development contract can be solicited, the DoD must first search the commercial market for something that already exists, and is 'close enough' to what is needed, and if it exists, buy it with whatever commercial business model that vendor uses (which is invariably some kind of fixed price arrangement). This is codified in 10 U.S.C 3453. As the Senate report language spells out, it’s very hard to see how the Army’s March directive does not 'deviate' from that law — and even if the service can somehow satisfy the letter of FASA, it very much violates the spirit. And while FASA is far from consistently enforced, it’s not a dead letter, as shown by the Army’s loss to Palantir in a 2017 lawsuit over this very matter. In the future, a new suit over the new policy could cost the Army hundreds of millions and years of delay. Yet the Army seems to be heading, undaunted, towards the cliff, as shown by this declaration by the service’s acquisition chief, Doug Bush: 'If some companies don't want to bid on a contract, it's a free country. Don't bid. Others will. My goal is simply to get the capability for the Army, not to make everybody happy.' But the very best software companies in the world all work on firm fixed price: By pre-ordaining Cost Plus, the Army effectively excludes the very best in the business right from the get-go. What possible reason could one have to do this? The only beneficiaries of this policy are the incumbent defense contractors, who are rejoicing at the affirmation of business-as-usual, and our adversaries around the world, who will take aid and comfort in this opportunity to surpass the United States’ competitive advantage. It's incumbent on Congress to step in, conduct rigorous oversight, and if necessary pass new legislation to hold the Army to both the letter and the spirit of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act. It's clear the Pentagon won't do it themselves.

Eyeing export orders, Northrop unveils counter-UAS Bushmaster M230LF dual-feed gun	Northrop Grumman's new M230LF Bushmaster dual feed chain gun can switch between ammo and target types (Northrop Grumman) BELFAST — Northrop Grumman has launched a new Bushmaster M230LF (Link Fed) dual-feed chain gun, designed to neutralize UAS and ground threats, with the manufacturer targeting export customers for future orders. Integrated on a remote weapon system, the new 30x113mm medium caliber cannon can be equipped on 4&#215;4, 6&#215;6 or 8&#215;8 land vehicles and allows operators to shift between ammunition types and target types, according to John McCollum, director of business development, guns operating unit, at Northrop Grumman. He also shared that Northrop has developed a prototype of the new gun, completed a phase of 'internal live firing' and plans on new live fire trials based off a 4&#215;4 sized vehicle, 'similar to a JLTV [Joint Light Tactical Vehicle]' type, in the 'next six months.' RELATED: To counter drones, US Army seeks layers rather than &#8216;silver bullets' The new gun, evolved from the US Army's AH-64 Apache attack helicopter chain gun, has reached Technology Readiness Level 6 (TRL) maturity. 'What this canon allows us to do is to add the functionality to be able to address Group 1 and Group 2 UAVs, as well as seamlessly, still address the ground targets and have the anti-armor capability that we have in our current M230LF cannon,' McCollum told Breaking Defense. He noted the firing rate of the cannon is adjustable — a new feature compared to the single feed configuration, with an output of 50 to 200 shots per minute. Group 1 and Group 2 unmanned aerial vehicles are at the lighter end of a five-level aircraft weight classification, with a maximum take off weight of up to 55 pounds, per DoD documents [PDF]. Despite Northrop debuting the product in advance of the AUSA trade show in Washington, DC, the US Army does not have a requirement for a dual feed gun, said McCollum. The US Army operates a 30mm single feed cannon under the Counter-UAS, Mobile, Low, Slow, Unmanned Aircraft Integrated Defeat System (M-LIDS) effort, led by prime contractor Leonardo DRS. 'But we're seeing some current requirements come from Europe and other regions for' the capability. No live demonstrations have been planned yet for international customers as development continues. In September, Northrop Grumman and Lithuania signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) committing the manufacturer to support local suppliers in the production of medium-caliber ammunition for Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). Motivation for bringing the dual feed gun to market is linked to Northrop assessing the 'UAV problem' for 'several years' and determining that there's 'always going to be a place for a kinetic solution' to counter the aircraft, said McCollum. 'Layered defense is absolutely key, and there are other technologies that can be used &#8230; and really as that last line of defense from 1,000 meters and in. There are really no other solutions in the marketplace that can be as effective as a kinetic solution, such as this' M230LF dual-feed gun,' he said. Customers interested in acquiring the gun, would need to first make sure they have a 'heavy enough remote weapon station' to support it, said McCollum, 'because it brings so much more capability than a 50 [caliber] remote weapon station.'

IAI, Aerotor planning APUS family of quadcopter drones	IAI's APUS-25 drone takes flight. The Israeli firm hopes that this will be the start of a new family of drones. (IAI) JERUSALEM — Israel Aerospace Industries has a new quadcopter vertical-take-off-and-landing family of drones that it says has a longer flight time and payload-to-weight ratio than other similar designs. The new platform, dubbed the 'APUS' family, was developed in partnership with Aerotor, a company which IAI has acquired a stake in. The first version of the system, the APUS 25, will make its American debyt at next week’s AUSA conference, but the plan is for IAI to roll out a large family of variants, with different weights and payloads, over the coming years. 'Our perspective is that in small tactical UAVs [being used today] will trend more toward VTOL,' Moshe Levy, manager of the Military Aircraft Group at IAI, told Breaking Defense in an interview. The biggest advantage of such a VTOL design, he said, is that the systems can take off and land on pretty much any surface, including ships, without use of runway or parachute. What separates APUS from the kind of quadcopter systems widely available in the commercial market, Levy said, is payload and distance. A company brochure claims the APUS-25, which is just under five and a half feet long, is a 25 kilogram platform that can carry around 10 kilograms in payload and fly for up to eight hours; depending on payload, Levy said, the system could go further than 100 km. The drones can also fly up to 11,000 feet in height, according to the brochure, which means any noise they emit would be reduced to near zero after 1,000 feet. At the core of the design is a decision on power. IAI has been building remotely piloted vehicles for decades and was one of the world’s first companies to pioneer these platforms. Larger UAVs use engines, such as the Rotax that was used on the Predator, basically an aircraft engine. By contrast, when quadcopters became more common at the tactical level, most of these drones were electric, which requires batteries — and the longer you want to go, the larger the battery needs to be, meaning less space for payload. 'What we did is take a different approach to go to use a heavy fuel engine,' Levy said. This can accommodate fuel such as JP-5, Jet A1 or gasoline, according to company literature. Levy added that since militaries are familiar with combustion engine, the systems should be simple to maintain and be able to slide easily into existing supply lines. 'These drones are very capable. The advantage is they can carry substantial weight. It can be E/O or Radar,' Levy said, predicting that this size drone will become a large portion of the market share. Speaking alongside Levy was Raz Geva, the co-founder and CEO of Aerotor, who noted that when the smaller company was founded in 2017 they 'tried to map the drone market and look at what is the next demand. What they found is that the market 'asks about endurance and heavy payload and range, and also the variant capacity for logistics. To solve these barriers, we understood if you [use an] electrical drone, it can’t match this task.' Through a series of demonstrations, 'We showed that we can take around 8kg payload for two hours, but the main advantage is 3.5 kg payload for six hours endurance and four kg for five hours, etc. And this didn’t exist before in a small drone.' Levy and Raz point to several types of missions these drones, and the larger ones they expect to develop, can accomplish. This can include carrying supplies that soldiers may need, or landing on ships for naval missions.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/iai-aerotor-planning-apus-family-of-quadcopter-drones/	2024-10-10T07:24:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IAI-APUS-25-2-e1728420953640.jpg

The National Training Center conducts tough, realistic, Unified Land Operations with our United Action Partners to prepare Brigade Combat Teams and other units for combat while taking care of Soldiers, Civilians, and Family members. (U.S. Army Sgt. Michael Spandau/Released) Army formations face threats that extend from kinetics to unmanned ISR drones to electronic warfare, which means much of their situational awareness comes from displays and visualization systems inside vehicles like Bradley infantry fighting vehicles. We discussed these challenges and how advanced capabilities in visual displays present data for decision making with Neal Toso, director of technical business development for ScioTeq. Breaking Defense: What are the lessons learned from Ukraine as they relate to rugged visualization solutions for mission and/or safety critical applications? Toso: Lessons from Ukraine show that if you're stationary you’re an easy target. Instead of having a fixed shelter for a command post – they're too easily detected because of electronics and their digital signatures – the military needs to find modern ways to keep command posts mobile. That's our focus, giving the Army larger-size, qualified display options for mobile command and control. Neal Toso, director of technical business development for ScioTeq. What is the value of visualization from the standpoint of force protection so that the soldiers and marines inside vehicles have situational awareness around them? It’s essential that they have access to a real-time common operating picture sourced by multi-domain and joint service C5ISR data streams in large-scale combat operations. Visualization technology is the mechanism for such information conveyance. The screen is the system that must give warfighters the data that's necessary for mission success, and what they want more than anything else is for the display to do what it's supposed to do by providing them with situational awareness. The display is the ultimate endpoint where the warfighter's eyeballs meet mission data. Beyond clarity or pixels or sunlight readability, ruggedization and reliability are of critical importance – otherwise the warfighter is flying blind. The display simply must work. It’s got to be accurate, it’s got to be available, and it’s got to be timely and readily understood. Describe the integration challenges of installing visualization onto a vehicle for command and control. A maneuver battalion has about 20 Bradley fighting vehicles, and they pick three or four to convert into complete command posts. In the back of those vehicles are operators that need to control a UAV, for example. To do so, the Army is upfitting the interior of these vehicles with big 24 or 32-inch displays so that soldiers can have a visualization system that displays multiple sources of data for a full operational picture. They'll also have smaller displays to operate the actual sensors. Regardless of whether that unmanned system is a drone or a robotic combat vehicle that the Army's developing now, their ability to control them is through the visualization systems. To assist the Army in that endeavor, ScioTeq is stepping away a bit from the traditional small-size-form-factor displays that you find in a typical vehicle. We’re developing new visualization solutions that strike a balance between providing soldiers the ability to process the streams of data coming in and the advanced video processing capabilities they need to view the data in the most suitable manner. ScioTeq provides hardware systems to vehicle manufacturer OEMs. What are the demand signals you are hearing from them and from the DoD about what’s needed in visualization and display technologies? We see a shift toward standardization and the introduction of open formats both from an integrator's perspective and from the end-user community. The first initiatives were launched in the UK with the DEF-STN 00-23 GVA (generic vehicle architecture) introduction, and this has become a baseline in many NATO countries with the NGVA standard. In the U.S., the introduction of MOSA (Modular Open Systems Approach) and GCIA (Ground Combat Systems Common Infrastructure Architecture) show a clear shift toward a more open standard platform, avoiding vendor lock-in. For displays and computing, this change has required us to design and qualify our products, supporting multiple standards and offering low-risk integration for vehicle OEMs. End users expect common strategic views for situational awareness. They want to understand the technical risks, and be able to manage a lifecycle from concept to design to manufacturing and lifetime support because they want to reduce technical risk and lower the system cost for the end users. They want to decrease operator stress and distraction because that has an impact on the mission, and they want to provide real-time situational awareness prior to the engagement. The key here that I've heard all the way up to Army Futures Command Commanding Gen. James Rainey is that he wants data, he wants knowledge, and he wants decision-making. From another angle, we hear repeatedly about the requirement for obsolescence management. Deploying new systems is tremendously expensive, and retrofitting existing systems to remain operational, sometimes for decades, is a continuous struggle. Partnering with a company like ScioTeq that has the knowhow and processes in place to maintain equipment for extended periods of time, coupled with exacting quality standards that yield minimal field failures, greatly reduces the total cost of ownership and provides a tremendous value to the government. A key element of force protection is the speed at which data from on-vehicle sensors like thermal imagers is disseminated across the vehicle. How does ScioTeq’s visualization and display technologies reduce latency? Presenting timely information is critical to the warfighter decision loop. The information stack is often a synthesis of data from multiple sources combined and presented to soldiers in such a way that they can rapidly identify alternatives. ScioTeq displays allow the warfighter to switch views at the press of a button depending on the tactical situation. Low-latency video from a camera can be prioritized and projected directly on the screen without processing for applications such as driving or fire control. The ability to support both this lowest video to glass latency (80-100 ms glass to glass) together with the advanced and rapid video processing on the order of 20 ms, as well as overlays combining data packages, provide the users with the best options during operations. Breaking Defense: Final thoughts? ScioTeq considers itself the leader in rugged visualization, computing, and networking hardware solutions. We take pride in collaborating with the OEM’s and end users to define architectures that provide a common strategic view for situational awareness. By working upfront with the OEM’s we provide a better understanding of the technical risks, how lifecycles are managed, and the logistical support demands of warfighters. That translates into visualization systems for mission-specific implementation, all within a defined budget and timeline that meets the demand for decreased size, weight, power and cooling required for today’s maneuver forces.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/display-screens-are-the-eyes-for-maneuver-forces-needing-to-command-and-control/	2024-10-10T05:25:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Stryker-with-TL-824-scaled.jpg
Anduril debuts new ‘Bolt’ quadcopter for sensing, strike missions	Anduril's new Bolt quadcopter. (Anduril photo) AUSA 2024 — Defense tech startup Anduril Industries today continued its streak of new product launches, unveiling a vertical takeoff and landing quadcopter dubbed 'Bolt' that’s already on order with the Marine Corps. Weighing roughly 12 to 15 pounds depending on configuration, the small, portable drone can be launched by hand and fly roughly 20 kilometers, with an endurance of over 40 minutes, according to Anduril. The base Bolt configuration can conduct intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance missions or search and rescue, while the armed Bolt-M can deliver an explosive payload of up to three pounds. The Bolt is specifically on contract for the Marine Corps's Organic Precision Fires-Light (OPF-L) program, being one of a 'handful' of systems under evaluation by the service, Brose said. He added that the Bolt will be tested over the next six months to inform a potential acquisition and fielding in fiscal year 2025. Regardless of the outcome for OPF-L, Anduril believes that '[t]here are multiple global military organizations and programs where Bolt-M is aligned to existing requirements, and we expect the number of relevant programs and opportunities to increase significantly in the coming years,' the company told Breaking Defense. 'In round numbers,' Anduril says that 'typical Bolt configurations are in the low tens of thousands of dollars,' though that largely depends on payloads and configurations. Additionally, pointing to the proliferation of relatively cheap, commercially-derived first-person drones in modern conflicts, Anduril argues that Bolt helps fill the US’s need for similar weapons with the help of the company’s Lattice software. The Bolt quadcopter can fly autonomously and be operated manually in GPS-denied environments, Anduril says, with features like customizable engagements. When in data collection mode, the platform can share information across Anduril’s other platforms and those belonging to third-party vendors to enhance awareness of the battlespace, according to the company. And if an operator using the Bolt-M configuration decides to strike, the weapon can guide itself to the target even if it loses connection with the operator. The Bolt-M can also fly back if an operator decides against attacking a target. 'What we are doing with Lattice is deliver[ing] as much autonomy across that entire kill chain to put that human being on the loop so that they can make better decisions faster,' Brose said. 'It's the processing and fusing of sensor data that's coming off of those sensors or those vehicles, whether Anduril will build them or others do. It's the actual orchestration of those systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/anduril-debuts-new-bolt-quadcopter-for-sensing-strike-missions/	2024-10-09T21:02:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/2024-Bolt-Hero-2-scaled-e1728497965874.jpg
‘The homeland is no longer a sanctuary’ warns new TRANSCOM boss	Gen. Randall Reed, the new U.S. Transportation Command commander, salutes the colors during his change of command ceremony at Scott Air Force Base, IL. (Photo by Brien Vorhees/USTRANSCOM) WASHINGTON — The rise of great power competition means that American soil is at risk, the newly-minted head of US Transportation Command (TRANSCOM) warned today — requiring an updated mindset as well as better defenses against 'non-kinetic' threats and operations in the 'gray zone.' Speaking before a meeting of the National Defense Transportation Association in St. Louis, Air Force Gen. Randall Reed harkened back to the time of nuclear drills during the Cold War to evoke a collective sense of urgency he argued has gone by the wayside. 'There was a national consciousness that somebody could do something to us,' he said. 'We’ve lost that.' While not calling out Russia and China by name — only referring to them using Pentagon parlance as respective 'acute' and 'pacing' threats — Reed said viewing the two countries as able to properly threaten the continental US should motivate new thinking to 'shore up' domestic operations. 'The homeland is no longer a sanctuary,' he continued. 'We have great, great power to deter in the kinetic realm. The question will be, how do we continue to get stronger in the non-kinetic and the gray zone realm? And there's a lot of work to be done there.' (Gray zone refers to the space between peace and war, where adversaries can engage in activities like cyber attacks.) Reed, who took over command of TRANSCOM from outgoing chief Gen. Jacqueline Van Ovost in an Oct. 4 ceremony, inherits a series of conflicts ruled by daily logistics operations. TRANSCOM has been instrumental in shipping aid to Ukraine, for example, as well as providing weapons to Israel and aid to civilians in Gaza. The specter of conflict in the Indo-Pacific promises to further stress TRANSCOM’s operations, particularly as increasingly sophisticated Chinese defenses pose threats to bases and relatively vulnerable key assets like shipping vessels, refueling aircraft and cargo planes — a concept often called 'contested logistics.' Reed said a critical need for the command is to enjoy a 'decision advantage,' or essentially the ability to quickly make the right choices in any circumstance and at all levels. Still, even in relatively more peaceful settings like operations today, the general disputed the notion that logistics operations aren’t currently contested. 'Logistics is always contested. If nothing else, it is the perfect home for Murphy's Law,' he said. 'The mechanical nature of things has a vote. The level of training of our people has a vote. Things are going to go wrong.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-homeland-is-no-longer-a-sanctuary-warns-new-transcom-boss/	2024-10-09T13:36:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/gen-reed-scaled.jpg
Army PEO C3T changes name to PEO C3N, as unified network plans advance	Mr. Michael C. Monteleone III, Director, Assured Positioning, Navigation and Timing/Space Cross-Functional Team, Army Futures Command, MG Jeth B. Rey, Director, Network Cross-Functional Team, Army Futures Command and Mr. Mark C. Kitz, Program Executive Officer, Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors, US Army, discuss how the Army of 2030 will fight in a GPS denied and degraded environment at AUSA Global Force Symposium &amp; Exposition 2023 on May 28, 2023 in Huntsville, Alabama. (US Army Photo by Patrick Hunter) WASHINGTON — The Army’s Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications- Tactical (PEO C3T), the office responsible for developing and supporting the Army’s network, is officially rebranding to better reflect its mission set. Goodbye, PEO C3T, and hello PEO C3N: Command, Control and Communications &#8211; Network. 'This is deeper than just a simple rebranding. This event signifies and recognizes the changing environment and how we must evolve, and the importance of our network and command and control capabilities.' Lt. Gen. Rob Collins, principal military deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Army Acquisition Corps and former PEO for C3N, said in a press release. The change comes nearly a year after the office underwent a revamp in which it absorbed several organizations from the PEO Enterprise Information Systems (PEO EIS), combining a number of the Army’s enterprise and tactical network capabilities under one roof. 'Last year, the Army decided to merge the enterprise and tactical network efforts under a single portfolio, resulting in a streamlined effort to develop the unified network as part of the Army’s network modernization strategy,' a PEO C3N spokesperson told Breaking Defense in an email ahead of today’s announcement. Hence, today's decision to drop the 'tactical' portion of the name serves as a signifier of its mission to create a single network. 'Recent real-world operations in the Middle East continue to validate the need for a unified network,' the press release said. 'Events are changing at the velocity of which we have never seen before,' Collins said in the press release. 'We have to be agile, mobile and lethal. We still have to be able to shoot, move, communicate, but now you have the land, sea, air and cyberspace domains that have to be interconnected and transparent to the warfighters.' The Army’s unified network, which was announced nearly three years ago, is the service’s goal of breaking down the dozens of siloed legacy networks, mostly separated by tactical and enterprise portions, to create a more cohesive singular network. 'We can't afford separate and disparate tools for a tactical and enterprise network if there's opportunities for us to streamline and deliver the same purpose, right?' Mark Kitz, program executive officer of C3N, told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. 'I feel like it's something we have to do. We have to build a more secure, integrated network,' he later added. When the Army first announced this initiative three years ago, the service had 69 networks, with the goal of getting down to one by 2027. Last month Lt. Gen. John Morrison told an audience at a Defense News conference that the Army is down to nine networks. However, PEO C3N noted in the release that creating the unified network will never be 'finished' due to the ongoing advancements in technology and the 'shifting nature' of military conflicts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-peo-c3t-changes-name-to-peo-c3n-as-unified-network-plans-advance/	2024-10-09T12:31:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/07/7733634-scaled-e1689010284959.jpg
To attack enemy space capabilities, Army eyes doubling expert cadre	Two British Army Special Operations Brigade soldiers, left, and a Soldier with the US Army 18th Space Company, 1st Space Brigade, right, guard a small tactical vehicle equipped with a miniaturized tactical space system during Project Convergence Capstone 4 experimentation at White Sands Missile Range, Feb. 28, 2024. (US Army photo by Brooke Nevins) WASHINGTON — The Army could more than double the number of soldiers with expertise in space operations if top brass approves a proposal by Army Space and Missile Defense Command (SMDC) to implement the service's new(ish) space vision, according to SMDC officials. The idea is to create a new space-centered military occupational specialty, called '40D Space MOS,' that for the first time would include non-commissioned officers, Col. Mark Cobos, head of SMDC's 1st Space Brigade, told Breaking Defense on the cusp of the annual Association of the US Army (AUSA) conference. Right now, he explained, only about 500 commissioned officers have space specialities, with another 874 enlisted soldiers essentially being 'borrowed' from other specialty units such as intelligence or air defense for short periods of three to four years. The new MOS is envisioned to initially include 'upwards of 1,800 billets' for enlisted personnel by fiscal 2030. The plan also would bolster the officer corps up to some 800 by FY32. SMDC is hoping for a decision from Army leadership by the end of October, Cobos added, although obviously the command hasn't any authority on the timeline. The Army long has had officers specializing in space under its F40 designation given that, as officials are always keen to point out, the service is the biggest military user of space capabilities. The new plan to pump up space personnel has two goals, SMDC officials explained. First, more operators are needed to help the land service ensure that crucial satellite communications (SATCOM) and positioning, timing and navigation (PNT) capabilities are available during conflict. This includes, for example, acquiring commercial SATCOM services to augment limited military satellite access. Second, and perhaps more importantly, trained soldiers are needed to run offensive operations against enemy satellite capabilities deep inside hostile territory. For example, this could include deploying small numbers of soldiers far forward with mobile jamming equipment. Cobos noted that 1st Space Brigade soldiers already are starting to train in realistic environments where space operations are taking place 'within hand grenade range' of enemy forces. In a recent exercise, he said, a 1st Space Brigade soldier 'conducted a high altitude, low opening (HALO) tandem parachute jump with the 10th Special Forces Group at the National Training Center' to practice penetrating deep into enemy territory to conduct counterspace activities — though he did not provide details related to the secret squirrel-style exercise. OP ED: The Army doth protest too much: In Space, jointness must come first The two 'principle bullets' in the 'Army Space Vision Supporting Multidomain Operations [PDF]' published in January stipulate that the service needs to both 'integrate' US space capabilities into its operations and 'interdict' adversary space operations 'simultaneously,' said Col. Donald Brooks, commandant of the Space and Missile Defense Center of Excellence in Colorado Springs, Colo. 'One of the Army's core competencies is Joint Forcible Entry Operations, where an Army Task Force projects combat power deep in order to be able to establish the conditions so that follow-on Army forces can can move through that seized airfield or [other territory],' he told Breaking Defense. 'And all of those Army core competencies, from a purely geometry standpoint, are what what you refer to as &#8216;behind those lines.' We use terms like to be able to &#8216;penetrate,' to be able to &#8216;isolate and disintegrate' an adversary.' Army Multi-Domain Operations includes space control activities, especially deep inside enemy territory. (Image: Army 4th Infantry Division) 'Disintegration' is a term of art defined in the Army's Field Manual 3.0 [PDF] that establishes the service's overarching doctrine; although it is not a term included in the capstone space doctrine governing joint force operations, Joint Publication 3-14. (Individual service doctrine feeds into joint doctrine, but joint doctrine in the end takes primacy over collective US military operations.) 'Disintegrate means to disrupt the enemy’s command and control, degrading the synchronization and cohesion of its operations. Disintegration prevents enemy unity of effort and leads to a degradation of the enemy’s capabilities or will to fight. It attacks the cohesion of enemy formations and their ability to employ combined arms approaches and work effectively together,' the Army manual explains. EXCLUSIVE: New Joint Force space doctrine clarifies Space Command's &#8216;offensive,' &#8216;defensive' ops The stress on the concept's application to space operations, according to Brooks and Cobos, is something relatively new in the Army Space Vision. 'The new part of it really is the requirement at tactical echelons for tactical organizations to be able to interdict an adversary's use of space,' Cobos said. The personnel with the new 40 MOS designation would be integrated with a number of different Army units. First, they would serve in the seven 'space control planning teams' under the 1st Space Brigade, that work with the various regional combatant commands, Cobos said. Those planning teams already are embedded in 'multiple theaters,' he said, and coordinate with Space Force components to provide the combatant commander with planning and 'targeting' solutions — based on what capabilities are required for a specific task. 'That is exactly how we do fires across a whole bunch of things, from cruise missiles that come off of submarines or destroyers to the fires that the Army can bring and the fires that the Air Force can be able to service,' Cobos explained. 'Fires' is a military term signifying using weapons to create lethal and/or nonlethal effects on targets. Army officials have previously said that they only intend to take 'non-kinetic' actions to disrupt, degrade or destroy adversary space systems, such as electromagnetic warfare and cyber operations. OP ED: The Army has a vital role in space, and it continues to grow So for space 'fires,' Cobos said the Army can provide tactical capabilities for discreet, close-up-and-personal operations against enemy facilities or systems that perhaps the other services can't. A commander thus could decide that 'instead of this really large system over right here that's tethered — and it requires a lot of power and bandwidth and has a huge footprint and signal,' it was better to choose a 'surgical tool' such as a 'small force' that could get into the 'extended deep' region of the battlefield 'to be able to do this very small thing,' he said. Space specialists also will make up a 'space control company' under the new Theater Strike Effects Group (TSEG) pilot at Indo-Pacific Command. That TSEG, which is designed to undertake those interdiction operations, was approved along with the Army Space Vision. That pilot will achieve initial operating capability on Oct. 1, 2027, Cobos said. 'It will initially stand up with space control electronic warfare capabilities,' Brooks said. Over time, the TSEG will move on to 'fielding and building the counter-surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, high-altitude and [navigation war] formations as well.' SMDC also hopes to soon be able to add a TSEG for European Command, following a month-long 'experiment-slash-exercise' that he said has helped prove the unit's value. 'I'm a little biased; I was the commander of the TSEG for that exercise, but I really do believe that we won over a lot of the leaders in EUCOM,' Brooks said. Finally, the specialists also will support the Army's Multi-Domain Task Forces, which each will have a space control company. The service has three such task forces and is 'soon going to grow the fourth and fifth,' Brooks said. 'We're very much complimentary to the Space Force and to the other services, but we truly do see space as that critical component to set the theater well in advance of phase one operations &#8230; when the first round is shot, the missile is shot, space needs to be there months, if not years, in advance to help set those conditions,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/to-attack-enemy-space-capabilities-army-eyes-doubling-expert-cadre/	2024-10-09T11:44:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Army-1st-Space-brigade-exercise-with-UK-soldiers-Feb.-2024-e1728492154389.jpg
Trump wants NATO to hit 3 percent GDP on defense. The US could fall short	On March 11, 2024 the Pentagon and military services presented their fiscal year 2025 budget requests. (Graphic by Breaking Defense, original images courtesy DVIDS, Getty) Donald Trump wants to raise the bar for NATO, with the former president pledging that if he wins in November he will push NATO allies to raise the target for their defense budgets from two to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP). US allies and partners can and should spend more on defense. A NATO in which allies spent 3 percent of GDP would undoubtedly mean a stronger alliance and a safer Europe. But to meet that standard — and more importantly meet the military challenge posed by China — the United States will have to spend more on defense too. It is simple mathematics that the United States cannot meet a '3 percent of GDP' standard in the coming years without a significantly higher defense budget. Pushing that standard abroad while advocating flat defense spending at home verges on strategic hypocrisy — an assertion of '3 percent for thee but not for me.' The United States barely meets the 3 percent of GDP standard today. But according to budget projections from the Congressional Budget Office, meeting that goal four years from now, at the end of a potential second Trump administration, would require a US defense budget of $1.03 trillion, roughly $109 billion more than today. To hit that target, defense spending would need to grow by 2.9 percent each year until 2029, and even faster in future years. But over the last decade, the average annual increase to the military’s budget was just 0.9 percent. Even with its budget growing at 3.4 percent per year, the Department of Defense could still lose the buying power it needs to achieve and sustain an advantage against China in the Indo-Pacific. That’s because inflation and other sources of cost growth for the military regularly exceed inflation in the rest of the economy. Put simply, defense budgets that rise at inflation result in a shrinking, aging and less advanced military. Making matters worse, DoD appears to be underestimating the cost of its own plans. According to the CBO, if cost growth follows long-term trends, defense costs from 2024 to 2038 would be nearly $600 billion higher than Pentagon leaders assume. 'Accommodating those higher costs,' warns the CBO, 'would require DoD to scale back its plans or request larger budgets than it anticipated.' The US defense budget isn’t set to meet arbitrary spending targets but to defend the nation against its adversaries. And with China first among them, a historically-low 3 percent of GDP simply will not do. President Ronald Reagan spent roughly 6 percent of GDP to defeat the Soviet Union. The United States spent almost 5 percent at the peak of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Bipartisan civilian and military experts have recognized the need for increased defense spending for years. Back in 2017, Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joe Dunford recommended that defense spending increase by 3 to 5 percent above inflation annually. That target was endorsed by the bipartisan 2018 Commission on the National Defense Strategy (NDS). The US has not met that goal over the last 6 years, leading the most recent 2024 NDS Commission to say 3 to 5 percent annual growth above inflation is the 'bare minimum' required. But many self-described 'realists' in Trump’s camp say higher defense budgets are politically unrealistic or would take too long to yield results. For instance, his former national security advisor predicts, 'Spending smarter will have to substitute for spending more.' More dramatically, Chris Miller, Trump’s former acting defense secretary who helped craft the Project 2025 document seen by many as a blueprint for a second Trump term, has called for cutting the defense budget in half. Ironically, many of those 'realists' are cheering on Trump’s demand that European nations provide 3 percent, arguing that that refusal to spend more on defense reveals naivete in allied capitals about the dangers that confront us. Perhaps, but much the same could be said here at home. The idea that the United States can prevail in a long-term competition with China with flat or declining budgets is fundamentally unserious. Higher defense spending will not be easy in Washington or in any NATO capital, but the perceived politics of the moment must not prevent us from answering the real demands of the future. It is far cheaper to deter a war than to fight one. That’s why a greater commitment to defense is needed on both sides of the Atlantic.

After troubles, a future upgrade, better availability should put NH90 in clearer skies: NHI CEO	A Swedish NH90 maritime helicopter on display at the Uppsala Air Show (Breaking Defense) BELFAST — After a series of high-profile toubles, the NH90 multirole helicopter program is set up for long-term success, built off plans for a future Block 2 upgrade, new commercial sales opportunities, better fleet availability rates, supply chain improvements and reduction in maintenance processes, according to the aircraft manufacturer’s top official. Cancelled orders, delivery delays, poor availability rates and high operational costs have long damaged the reputation of the platform, but Alex Aloccio, NHIndustries (NHI) CEO, told reporters on Tuesday that he expects it to be 'around for at least another 50 to 60 years' and that the program has entered 'a very exciting time.' He referred to the timeframe target as 'a fact' not an 'ambition' because it correlates to the level of investment customers have placed in the rotorcraft. 'There is plenty of potential left in the platform,' Aloccio added, during an Airbus Helicopters press day held at the company’s production facility in Marignane, France. NHI is a joint collaboration between Airbus, Leonardo and GKN Aerospace/Fokker Technologies. (Breaking Defense accepted travel and accommodation for the trip.) Aloccio shared that the manufacturer has been in conversation with current NH90 customers for 'close to one year' about the new Block 2 upgrade, though 'main technologies' have not been agreed. 'We talk about [potentially] increasing the payload of the aircraft, because there's still some juice left in the airframe, in the engine, dynamic components &#8230; and how do we connect the drone,' he noted, referring to the option of introducing manned-unmanned teaming capabilities. Separately, Belgium, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands signed up for development of the NH90’s Software Release 3 upgrade in June, which includes integration of the new Link 22 datalink, Leonardo's LEOSS-T Electro-Optical gimbal, sonar equipment and 'additional weapons integration,' according to an NHI statement. Additionally, Aloccio said 'lots of commercial opportunities' are available and noted The Netherlands commitment in September to acquire additional NH90s. He not disclose any potential new customers by name. Opening up on past supply chain problems, Aloccio admitted that 'there was a lack of understanding from everyone, including ourselves, on the speed at which we need to deliver and to resupply &#8230; parts into the system,' and that 'we were a bit undersized against what was expected from our customer.' As part of a company-wide improvement push, with availability rates as the 'main topic' to resolve, individual action plans for suppliers have been established, in addition to an effort to simplify aircraft maintenance plans. NHI also increased speed of deliveries for Priority Item List (PIL) — critical supply chain items — by 15 percent last year and is on track to hit a target of another '15-20 percent' again by the end of this year, said Aloccio. A number of the PIL items are manufactured by companies belonging to NHI, effectively meaning supply chain issues are, in part, the manufacturers' own fault. He noted 'limiting factor' parts cover items like main gear boxes, blades, mission equipment and cargo hooks. The industrial mistakes of the past have cost NHI dearly in recent years. Australia, Norway and Sweden have all decided to walk away from NH90 acquisitions even after they had received aircraft. In a stinging assessment upon axing the program in June 2022, Norway’s Defense Minister Bjørn Arild Gram, said, 'Regrettably, we have reached the conclusion that no matter how many hours our technicians work, and how many parts we order, it will never make the NH90 capable of meeting the requirements of the Norwegian Armed Forces.' Oslo vowed at the time to fight for compensation worth nearly 5 billion kroner ($525 million); NHI said then it refuted Norway's allegations and said the termination of the agreement was 'legally groundless.' During the recent trip Aloccio revealed that mediation between NHI and Norway has since 'failed,' resulting in the initiation of legal proceedings. 'They took us to court and we are taking them to court,' he said, suggesting NHI has put forward a counter claim to Norway's compensation demand. 'There are two claims which are merged into one claim,' added Aloccio. 'So in the end, it's just one big dispute and and it's just one judge.' An Oslo court will begin hearing the case 'next year,' he added. Norway's NH90 fleet, 14 aircraft in total, have not flown since the decision was made to cancel the acquisition, according to Aloccio, and they remain in storage. Elsewhere, a buy back plan with Australia to return 4,000 MRH-90 Taipan (NH90 TTH) parts, valued at €250 million ($273 million) has commenced. Around 300 parts have so far been sent back to NHI, said Aloccio. The move was prompted by Canberra's decision to prematurely retire its MRH-90 Taipan (NH90 TTH) fleet, after initially grounding it when an aircraft involved in the Exercise Talisman Sabre crashed off the Whitsunday Islands in July 2023.

AUKUS, Red Sea ops, unmanned systems: A chat with former Under SECNAV Erik Raven	Undersecretary of the Navy Erik Raven testifies before the Senate Armed Services Committee on military recruiting challenges, Washington, D.C., March 22, 2023. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — Erik Raven stepped down from his job at the Pentagon this past August, but he still has a lot to say about the US Navy. And just this week, his new employer, the Washington, DC-based strategic advisory firm Beacon Global Strategies, reached out to Breaking Defense to sit down with the former under secretary for a wide-ranging discussion about everything from AUKUS to unmanned systems. With two decades as a staffer in the Senate and just over two years as the Navy’s second most senior civilian, his arrival in the private sector is a significant change of pace. Sitting at a quaint café in northeast DC, just a few blocks from the White House, he was dressed comfortably in a suit with no tie, and lacking the usual entourage of aides, staffers and security guards that routinely shadow the Pentagon’s top leadership. He said since leaving his post as the under, he’s been thinking about the Navy’s operations in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean. While Raven appreciates the laudatory coverage given to the sailors who have conducted those operations, he said, in his view, there is something missing in the conversation. 'What we’re seeing today in the Red Sea could be replicated in many other regions and key critical straits and nodes across the world,' he explained. 'And so, I think taking apart what naval capabilities are bringing to that region today can be very instructive in how future conflicts may play out.' The following is a continuation of Breaking Defense’s conversation with Erik Raven. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: I’m sure you’ve seen the public discussions around the issue of the Navy using $1 million missiles to defeat drones that are worth a fraction of that cost. Is there a nuance the public doesn’t understand in this cost equation, or does the Navy just not have a better solution yet? ERIK RAVEN: There are probably a couple dimensions of this. One is the cost exchange. Everybody is right to be concerned about how much a missile costs that is defeating a drone that might cost $50 or $100,000 that’s being used to threaten commercial shipping. I would say the cost calculation that needs to be added to that $2 million missile against a $100,000 drone, [is that we’re] defending a ship or some other asset that may be worth hundreds of millions or perhaps even a billion dollars, depending what cargo it’s carrying. So, that has to enter the equation somehow. There are many promising technologies that could alter the balancing power on this exchange question, but I think a little peek into the operational context is also important here. The main reason we’re using long-range interceptors to defeat these threats is because we don’t want them to be within several kilometers [of] either a Navy ship carrying several hundred sailors or a commercial ship carrying hundreds of millions of dollars worth of cargo. Directed energy has a lot of promise, but right now it’s a short-range solution. Do you really want to have that threat be so close to the target before you can prosecute it? The USV Mariner, a US Navy research and development vessel, docked at the United States Naval Academy where it will be christened on Aug. 23, 2022. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) Let’s talk about another emerging technology. The Navy for several years now has been pitching Congress on the use of unmanned and autonomous systems to varying degrees of success. Do you think the Navy’s pitch is landing with Congress or are things getting lost in translation? I would say that this is broader than Navy and congressional discussion. I think it’s really about the Joint Force and where unmanned and autonomous technologies fit into present operations and future operations. I recall very well being in Congress, perhaps it was 10 years ago, when there was a lot of discussion about future aircraft. Do they really need to be manned? That autonomy is right around the corner. And if we look back to how far autonomy has advanced in the last 10 years, I think most people would say that’s a good conversation to have, but maybe at the time, it was a little premature. Autonomy is advancing. But do we have autonomy to the point where it can replace not only human capabilities to fuse information, often aided by AI and other exquisite technologies, but also make life or death decisions? I think we’re still at the cusp of a really robust debate about not only what the technology can do, but what policy makers and the American public is comfortable with in terms of autonomous systems making very important decisions. You announced during the budget rollout the Navy is aiming to hit its two-submarines-per-year delivery cadence by 2028. It’s an ambitious goal given the service’s history on this subject and will be crucial to make AUKUS’s first pillar a success. What’s the biggest hurdle to making it happen? I think that what we’re seeing now is challenges in the supply chain and challenges in workforce as the two top items that the Navy is really tracking [and] trying to trying to tackle. All credit to Congress that several years ago, even before it was built into Navy budgets, leaders in Congress were aware of the strain that was facing the submarine industrial base and started putting in hundreds of millions of dollars annually to get the suppliers up and running. I think that there has been really good progress made so far in terms of expanding the number of suppliers [and] attracting new entrants. On workforce, I think the underlying challenge here is that many Americans have a changing relationship with work, that they have different expectations of a career. They may have more interest in not staying with one company for their whole career, but moving around, maybe even between different industries. There’s going to be a continuing dialog [between Navy and industry] on not only how to attract workers and train them, but how to keep them interested in the submarine industrial base for the long term. The reason why that's so important is because if you’re training a welder or an electrician or a pipe fitter every couple of years, they don’t get that rich experience and productive capability that a journeyman or master welder has. That saves time, that saves money. That sort of experience is what puts the whole program on a better cadence to deliver for the national security goals.

(Breaking Defense/ Ashley Roque) What has struck me about AUKUS’s second pillar is that it seems as though a lot of people are talking about inviting new countries to join the agreement. But most of the people extending invitations are not actually the power brokers with the authority to do it. What’s your sense of things inside the government? Is there an enthusiasm for other nations to join Pillar II? Let me separate the two issues. First is AUKUS, especially in regard to Pillar II. The objectives of that, as announced, are really to join with our two closest allies and create a defense innovation ecosystem that’s going to tackle some of the hardest but most promising technologies that we see that make a difference for military capabilities. That is kind of a prelude to a much larger discussion that I think is kicking off right now, and that is, how do we join with our allies and partners in creating defense ecosystems that serve all our national security needs? How do our allies and partners contribute to the needs of not only our national security, but their national security? I think what we’re seeing is a greater exploration of what it means to have an integrated and robust defense innovation ecosystem that includes our allies and partners, and it’s going to be an interesting policy discussion moving forward about how to reconcile the interest to make sure that we have a strong American industrial base with the fact that we have allies and partners who also need their own armaments and systems.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aukus-red-sea-ops-unmanned-systems-a-chat-with-former-under-secnav-erik-raven/	2024-10-09T07:48:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/7696295-scaled-e1713379680313.jpg
Experts see Hezbollah ‘escalation’ in use of new missiles, as group weathers Israeli bombardment	A scaled model of Iran's first ultrasonic missile (Fattah) is carried by a truck during a protest gathering in Tehran, Iran, on September 28, 2024. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) 'Hundreds of rockets and dozens of aircraft, a great number of settlements and cities have come under rocket fire,' Naim Qassem, deputy leader of Hezbollah, said today in a televised speech in Arabic, with his use of 'aircraft' likely referring to drones. 'I would like to reassure you that our capabilities are fine.' Hezbollah's capacity to fight is a key question as the conflict in Lebanon intensifies, after the Israeli military said it has managed to take out several of the groups top leaders, in addition to striking hundreds of its members. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a video posted online today that Hezbollah is 'weaker than it has been for many, many years.' But as Israel has been striking Hezbollah, the group has been firing back — over 3,000 rockets and missiles in the last two weeks, according to the Israel Defense Forces. Experts specifically pointed to Hezbollah's use of several new projectiles, including the Qadr 1 ballistic missile, Noor cruise missiles and Fadi 4 and Falaq 2 rockets. Hezbollah claimed to have used the Qadr 1 last month and the others more recently, according to public statements. 'The use of new, more sophisticated missiles by Hezbollah signals an escalation as well as a political message to show off strength for deterrence, especially amid the step up by Netanyahu,' defense analyst Sine Özkaraşahin told Breaking Defense. She added that level and sophistication of the systems seen in the recent strikes show that 'Hezbollah is taking the fight deeper, most likely with Iran's support.' Ozkarsahin specified that the newly introduced missiles 'come with a greater payload, longer-range. For example, Qadr-1 is a guided ballistic missile with deep-strike capabilities, [a] significant shift from the unguided short-range rockets that used to dominate Hezbollah strikes.' Likewise, Stockholm International Peace Research Institute senior researcher Pieter Wezeman said that after Israel escalated its fight with Hezbollah in Lebanon, the use of the new missiles like likely the group's attempt to 'counter-escalate.' Wezeman also said that Hezbollah, likely spooked by Israel's ability to locate and kill senior members, may have opted a 'use-over-lose' approach to the missiles, firing them before they can be struck by Israel. IDF has been bombing what it considered Hezbollah missile and rocket warehouses in South Lebanon, the Beqaa Valley and the southern suburb of Beirut. In several instances, open sources and televised video footage show secondary explosions after a number of Israeli raids, suggesting explosives or armaments of some kind were stored in the facilities. Behnam Ben Taleblu, an analyst at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies think tank, said, however, that Hezbollah's current missiles and rocket barrages still aren't what the use of the Qadr 1 may have signaled at the time. '⁠With the exception of the Qadr, which is Hezbollah’s first ballistic missile fired ever at Israel — and is a variant of Iran’s older Fateh family of short-range ballistic missiles — most of the projectiles Hezbollah has fired at Israel have been unguided and spin-stabilized rockets, larger artillery, drones, and anti-tank weapons. This includes the Falaq and Fadi systems,' he said. He stressed that Hezbollah 'used this cocktail to incrementally widen the war of attrition imposed on Israel starting on October 8 last year. The use of the Qadr several weeks back however as a guided projectile had the potential to be a game changer if part of a larger campaign to move towards more missile use than rockets. But Israel’s rapid and bold string of military successes against Hezbollah prevented this trial ballon from being floated.' Ben Taleblu also said Hezbollah isn't the only enemy of Israel apparently escalating its use of missiles 'Iran’s employment of more solid-propellant systems in its October barrage against Israel, and in general employing nearly double the amount of ballistic missiles marks a clear shift,' Ben Taleblu said, adding that the use of a new Fattah missile was a 'historic first and a sign that Tehran indeed wanted to strike at Israeli targets and was willing to up the ante compares to the April attack.' 'Iran chose to escalate after absorbing a series of setbacks to its regional terror network that did away in days what the Islamic Republic took years to build and cultivate,' Ben Taleblu said. As for whether the new missiles have actually been more effective, Israel reported no deaths outside a man killed in the West Bank in the more recent barrage by Iran. Still, Wezeman said reports indicate some projectiles launched then appear to have gotten through, suggesting they 'have a higher chance of penetrating the missile defenses that Israel and its allies have available.' Hezbollah's Qadr-1 missile, the Israelis say, was intercepted before it could strike its target.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/experts-see-hezbollah-escalation-in-use-of-new-missiles-as-group-weathers-israeli-bombardment/	2024-10-08T12:41:36-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241008_iran_fattah_missile_model_GettyImages-2174646049-scaled-e1728415175396.jpg
An Army helicopter takes on new roles, including as a FLRAA testbed	UH-60M Black Hawk in flight. (Lockheed Martin photo). It’s fair to say that with 4,000 UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters flying worldwide, the next important role for the utility helicopter is going to be interoperability with the U.S. Army’s newest aircraft type coming into the fleet – the Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft (FLRAA). To prepare UH-60s for that eventuality and to serve as a present-day Future Vertical Lift testbed for new capabilities such as launched effects, the Army’s modernization efforts are largely focused on re-engining under the Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP), plus Modular Open Systems Approach (MOSA) and the digital backbone. 'The Army has made a significant capital investment in rotary wing platforms up and to this point,' said Army Col. Ryan Nesrsta, program manager for Utility Helicopters at U.S. Army PEO Aviation. 'In light of that decision and investment, there’s going to be an extant requirement for interoperability [and] pacing the threat with respect to survivability. 'There’s going to be continued relevance for the rotary wing fleet to interoperate with tiltrotor aircraft in any theater of operations. It requires judicious and continued investment in the portfolio to ensure that the Future Vertical Lift family of systems is enabled.' A key piece of that strategy was the delivery earlier this year of two GE Aerospace T901 ITEP flight-test engines for the UH-60M Black Hawk, replacing the GE T700 powerplants. 'We [recently] had a meeting with the enterprise – our partners from GE and Lockheed Martin – on how we address the nuanced challenges of engine airframe compatibility,' said Nesrsta, noting that the last time such an integration was done was in the 2007 timeframe, when GE’s YT706 turboshaft engine was fitted to an Army special operations MH-60M helicopter. A key piece of the Army's strategy for rotary wing modernization is the Improved Turbine Engine Program, under which two GE Aerospace T901 ITEP flight-test engines for the UH-60M Black Hawk were delivered earlier this year to replace GE T700 powerplants. (Lockheed Martin photo). 'There’s lessons learned from previous experience, but knowing that there’s a significant learning curve with respect to the integration of an engine on even a mature platform,' he said. 'Design for integration has been ongoing on the UH-60M with the delivery of the engines; physical integration has begun in earnest.' Sikorsky notes that the ITEP engine offers 50 percent more power than the T700 and an increase in fuel efficiency, giving the aircraft more range and payload. 'The new ITEP will give division commanders more options for planning and executing assault missions,' said Hamid Salim, vice president for Army &amp; Air Force Systems, Lockheed Martin Sikorsky. 'This will be a game changer for the Army, and also for the National Guard units. The ITEP also enhances safety, reduces operating costs and provides growth for the future needs of the warfighter.' For the next steps, the Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UHPO) and the Aviation Turbine Engines Project Office are working toward a first flight of the ITEP-powered Black Hawk in late FY25, early FY26. MOSA and interoperability for multi-domain operations The ongoing transformation in the role of rotary wing aircraft, in particular the UH-60M Black Hawk, in a 21st century security environment will allow it to play a critical role in multi-domain operations and Joint All Domain Command and Control. 'In multi-domain operations, Army Aviation will be able to ‘extend’ to distances at 500 km with ITEP,' an Army Aviation Center of Excellence spokesperson noted. 'Combined with launched effects, Army aircraft will be able to ‘reach’ and prosecute targets at double the current range. Combined with support of layered air defense, electronic attack and preparatory fire missions creating multi-domain effects, Army Aviation [can] reach beyond the FLOT (forward line of own troops) in support of the ground commander. 'Rotary wing aircraft will still move people and equipment faster than ground vehicles or watercraft. In JADC2, Army rotary wing aircraft will link into mesh networks to pass data to commanders across the battlefield to foster a joint common operating picture, either as a deliberate airborne node or while executing their other mission tasks. A common joint air picture enhances survivability, improves engagement times, and provides situational understanding reducing the fog of war.' Lockheed Martin Sikorsky's modernization efforts for the Black Hawk are largely focused on the ITEP engine, MOSA with the digital backbone, and launched effects. (Lockheed Martin graphic). MOSA is the lens through which much of that will occur, with the UHPO focused on delivering a Black Hawk that supports the Army of 2040 plan, is capable of operating within the air-ground littoral, and maintains fleet reliability and relevance through 2070. 'We intend to do this through Modular Open Systems Architecture, general obsolescence management, IT integration, and survivability and air vehicle modernization opportunities,' said Nesrsta. 'UHPO continues to work closely with industry partners to provide demand signals around these initiatives. We’re receptive to industry input for providing more adaptable, affordable systems that are capable of incorporating rapid technologies and upgrades to counter evolving threats.' For its part, Sikorsky is leveraging significant MOSA investments from the discontinued Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program and applying that to Black Hawk to demonstrate rapid integration of new capability such as crewed-uncrewed teaming. 'We’re demonstrating the benefit of digital infrastructures that allow our customer to make organic changes to the aircraft while enabling distributed situational awareness,' said Salim. 'Black Hawk could carry and manage a squadron of launched effects drones to be the forward-deployed eyes and ears for the division commander. We’ve been doing this both in Future Vertical Lift and Black Hawk simulators and aircraft, showing how these assets can seamlessly work together to give our ground commanders a tactical edge.' Autonomous Black Hawk In late 2022 at that year’s Army Project Convergence demonstration, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Lockheed Martin successfully demonstrated an uncrewed Black Hawk performing a battlefield resupply of blood, a simulated casualty evacuation, and an external sling load cargo resupply mission at high speed at 200 feet of altitude to simulate the battle environment. DARPA and Lockheed Martin Sikorsky fly the optionally piloted Black Hawk, which includes the MATRIX autonomy solution. (Lockheed Martin photo). 'We’ve continued to explore that capability, and have worked with DARPA on what is a planned technology transition agreement to further mature those technologies that lend to tech maturation and risk reduction of what are FLRAA’s requirements for an optionally piloted vehicle capability,' said Nesrsta. 'We’re actively pursuing multiple efforts to further mature sensor fusion, autonomous algorithms, and full authority fly-by-wire flight controls as part of our general modernization strategy within the utility office. These three distinct but interrelated lines of effort will evolve from a spectrum of cognitive offloading, to minimally crewed, to ultimately an optimally or optionally crewed system.' It is this approach that the Army expects will reduce technical risk for the acceleration and integration of autonomy, not just in Black Hawk, but also for FLRAA’s subsequent Increment 2, which in addition to autonomy is also expected to include advanced avionics and an expansion of launched effects. Lockheed Martin has also continued to expand the autonomy system it calls MATRIX, which forms the core of DARPA's ALIAS (Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System) project that enabled the autonomous Black Hawk demonstrations. In addition to the PC22 demo, Sikorsky has demonstrated how the autonomous Black Hawk demonstrator can quickly launch and navigate itself to drop water on a wildfire soon after detection, and how an uncrewed Black Hawk controlled by MATRIX can resupply troops in contested airspace. Continuing relevance Black Hawk operators in Europe are focused on Ukraine, while in the Indo-Pacific it’s security and deterrence. U.S. priorities for the UH-60, other rotary wing platforms, and the next-generation of Army aircraft include those requirements in addition to modernization for greater range and payload, interoperability, contested logistics, and leveraging crewed-uncrewed capabilities. 'The FLRAA platform provides a great capability to air assault soldiers from relative sanctuary in friendly and secure areas to deep into adversary territory, far beyond what we can do today,' noted the Army Aviation Center of Excellence. 'Black Hawks will still be needed for shorter distances, while the Chinook remains the only heavy lift vertical aircraft and the Apache the only attack aircraft in the Army Inventory. Army Aviation exists to support the soldier on the ground, regardless of the aviation platform – manned or unmanned.' As such, it’s likely that the modernizations across those platforms – including the newest version of the AH-64E Apache with V6.5 software and the CH-47F Block II program – means that Black Hawk, Apache, and Chinook will likely remain a part of military operations for the next half century. 'In lower-tier air domain, nothing performs better than a helicopter,' said Salim. 'Black Hawk offers versatility, reach and access across varying terrain for a wide array of missions from air assault to frontline resupply and humanitarian relief. 'But we’ve got to evolve that capability for tomorrow’s missions, like installing new engines for improved turbine power to ultimately provide lift and fuel efficiency, giving commanders more flexibility. MOSA will make upgrading the enduring platform faster and easier. Crewed and uncrewed teaming will deliver critical network capabilities and intelligence in contested environments while keeping pilots and soldiers out of harm’s way.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/an-army-helicopter-takes-on-new-roles-including-as-a-flraa-testbed/	2024-10-08T11:34:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Black-Hawk-Photo.jpg

AFRL moves toward flight testing satellite internet radios under Global Lightning	Air Force Research Laboratory is developing antennas and radios that can link with multiple satellite internet constellations from aircraft, ships and ground vehicles. (Photo: AFRL) WASHINGTON — The Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) is planning flight tests in late 2025 and early 2026 of prototype antennas and radio receivers capable switching between multiple commercial satellite internet constellations — a capability that would both make them more difficult to jam and serve as an enabler of the Pentagon's planned Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) network. Under the program nicknamed Global Lightning, AFRL researchers hope to see this kit eventually make its way not only into airborne systems used by the Air Force, but also to platforms used by the other services, said Brian Beal, principal aerospace engineer at AFRL's Strategic Development Planning and Experimentation Office. 'I've talked the most about aircraft, because in a lot of ways, that's the most technically challenging, and also, as an Air Force employee it's my primary focus. But we do also work with Navy, Coast Guard and Army for tests on ground vehicles and ships, as well as stationary [ground systems]. Although you don't need anything as complex as what we're doing for stationary applications; you kind of get that as a bonus,' he told Breaking Defense. 'The end game is, if we're wildly successful &#8230; I would expect different program offices to start adopting this and and fielding it,' he added. This could include having the Space Force's Commercial Satellite Communications Office serve as a middleman for contracting out services from commercial providers, as Beal explained already has happened with two of the vendors AFRL worked with under its initial Global Lightning contracts. Beal noted that AFRL further is working closely with the Space Development Agency (SDA), which is developing its own version of a space-based internet in low Earth orbit (LEO) under its Transport Layer program. 'One of the guiding principles of what we're trying to do is that these radios should be able to talk to many different constellations, and they should be able to add waveforms and control for new constellations as they become available. So, one of the constellations that that the radios will be able to talk to is the SDA Transport Layer.' AFRL launched the Global Lightning program with contracts in 2018, somewhat confusingly under the formal title 'Defense Experimentation Using Commercial Space Internet (DEUCSI).' Up to now, the lab has spent almost $500 million in experimental contracts to 11 different vendors. 'There's about seven key contracts between the antenna vendors and the multiband radio vendors,' Beal said. 'So the the multiband radios are L3Harris, Northrop Grumman SES Space and Defense, and Intelsat General. Whereas the antennas are Northrop Grumman, RTX and Viasat. Those are the primes. And then there are also relevant subcontracts to additional antenna providers.' AFRL currently has an annual budget of about $160 million for Global Lightning, he said, but that the sum varies somewhat year-to-year as new contracts are signed and others are phased out. The most recent contracts were issued under what is known as DEUSCI Call 4, aimed at prototyping multiband antennas that can link to Ku-band and Ka-band satellites in LEO, medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO). RTX in August was awarded $51.7 million; Viasat in September was awarded $33 million. Air Force Research Laboratory is experimenting with antennas and receivers capable of linking to multiple satellite internet constellations. (Image: AFRL) The goal is for these antennas to be able to interface with modems and transceivers developed in the previous contract stage, called DEUCSI Call 3. Under that solicitation, AFRL in 2023 contracted with Intelsat General, SES Space and Defense (the American arm of Luxembourg-based SES), Northrop Grumman, L3Harris and RTX for a total of some $250 million according to government contracting documents. Beal explained that 'at the highest level, there's sort of been two stages of Global Lightning.' The earliest awards were experimenting with linkages to individual satellite constellations, such as SpaceX's Starlink. AFRL has moved on from 'single vendor testing' to 'multi-vendor, multi-constellation SATCOM,' he said. 'What I mean by that is we are developing with our commercial partners, and then flight testing and tech transitioning, systems that can communicate with multiple constellations using the same hardware,' Beal said. 'In particular, we care a lot about being able to be multi-orbit. So, we're in the process of making systems that will communicate with LEO, GEO and MEO orbits, both commercial and military, and across multiple frequency bands.' In other words, the idea is to create what sometimes is known in Pentagon circles as a 'hybrid SATCOM' network. The 'real impetus' of the Global Lightning program is that 'one of the biggest barriers to entry on using a new SATCOM system is actually getting the hardware, in particular the antenna, installed and integrated into an aircraft,' Beal explained. 'So, the thought process here is put on very capable hardware that can communicate with multiple systems, and then we can move from constellation to constellation as business needs dictate. ' Beal said the goals for the upcoming flight tests will gradually increase in complexity, starting with ensuring the antennas and radio receivers can keep 'reliable, stable connections to any particular constellation.' Then tests will be run that stress those connections with aircraft maneuvers to find out, for example, how far a plane can bank before dropping connectivity. 'We'll measure some basic technical parameters like that, and then we move into the real heart of it, which is the multi-constellation piece. So, we'll measure things like when we switch from Spacecraft A to Spacecraft B, how long does that transition take? What are any wrinkles that we run into when making that switch?' Beal said. 'The expectation is that we will bounce between those constellations in the same flight, so we'll move between them. Now, I don't think anybody should be guaranteeing that on flight one,' he stressed. 'We're going to improve as we go and get to that, but that is the goal of the program.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/afrl-moves-toward-flight-testing-satellite-internet-radios-under-global-lightning/	2024-10-08T11:06:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/global-lightning0124_SS2_feature.png
DIA ‘almost done’ with JWICS tech refresh goal to enhance network resiliency	Doug Cossa, Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) Chief Information Officer (CIO), speaks on the Intelligence Community CIO Panel at the 2021 Department of Defense Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) worldwide conference on December 7, 2021. (Myles Scrinopskie / Defense Intelligence Agency WASHINGTON — The Defense Intelligence Agency is on the verge of completing a much-needed update to the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communication System (JWICS) to make the system more resilient to outages, DIA Chief Information Officer Doug Cossa said this morning. Over the past two years, the DIA set the goal of performing a 'tech refresh' on the JWICS, the Pentagon’s secure network that hosts top secret and sensitive compartmented information. The JWICS was created during the Gulf War as the DIA had to figure out how to transmit secure voice and video to the Pentagon. 'We are almost done with tech refresh. We're essentially there,' Cossa said during an Intelligence and National Security Alliance webinar this morning. 'That has been the focus over the past two years, since we started the program, really replacing the antiquated infrastructure, especially where we have critical nodes.' He added that this 'tech refresh' doesn’t necessarily mean just updating the JWICS at the device level, meaning routers, switches and encryption, but includes 'everything that goes along with providing connectivity' and making the JWICS more resilient. The goal is to catch outages before they occur, Cossa said. 'It's a mesh network to where, if one point goes down, you've got alternate routes, just like a highway system, right?' he said. 'You don't want to just have one exit. You want multiple on ramps and off ramps. That’s where we are on the tail end of completing.' 'So how do we move into software-defined networking, to where we can identify error issues or errors early? You know, in the past, as we've experienced networking problems, it's always an after-the-fact of, ‘Okay, what happened?’' he said. 'How do we move that question up front before an outage occurs?' The tech refresh is only one part of modernizing the JWICS, which has been in the works since 2021. Cossa said the DIA is also focused on enhancing the cybersecurity and automation capabilities of the system. Related: Top secret info-sharing: DIA info chief sees modernizing JWICS as top priority in 2024 This automation process, which will harness artificial intelligence, will eventually help in catching errors before they cause serious consequences like outages or the theft of information — whether by foreign hackers or insider bad actors. 'Really the aim over three years, it's enhancing the monitoring of network traffic and connectivity, and then, of course, automating the management of that as we start to see anomalies. And then especially from the cybersecurity side, is how do we isolate parts of the network that aren't operating towards their norm? And that's where a lot of that AI as I mentioned comes in,' Cossa said today. At the upcoming Department of Defense Intelligence Information System, or DoDIIS, conference later this month, the DIA will continue looking for industry solutions to transforming the JWICS from a manual system to an automated system. 'That's really what the next generation of the JWICS architecture looks like. It's taking the person out of the loop, and the management of that, and then looking at ways to automate that in a smart kind of way. That's definitely a big priority [and] will remain a big priority for the next several years,' Cossa said today when asked about this year's DoDIIS themes. 'So you'll see a lot of discussion on that, but you will also see a lot of breakout sessions on the automation of networks and the security of networks,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/dia-almost-done-with-jwics-tech-refresh-goal-to-enhance-network-resiliency/	2024-10-08T10:11:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/6969382-scaled-e1728406222375.jpg
America’s greatest adversary? Kamala Harris says Iran is ‘an obvious’ answer	Vice President Kamala Harris waves after arriving at Ellington Field JRB and being greeted by Chief Master Sergeant Bennie Bellvin, 147th Attack Wing Command Chief and Colonel Bif French, 147th Attack Wing Commander, July 24, 2024. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Tech. Sgt. Stacy Cooper) WASHINGTON — Though the Defense Department and the Intelligence Community have long identified China as America's number one geopolitical challenge, when Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was asked who America's top 'adversary' is, she said one 'obvious' answer, right now, sits 5,600 miles west of Beijing. 'I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran,' Harris said during an excerpt of a '60 Minutes' interview. 'Iran has American blood on their hands, okay? This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles, what we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power, that is one of my highest priorities.' After the vice president declined to answer a 'hypothetical' about how the US would respond to evidence Iran was pursuing a nuclear weapon, '60 Minutes' interviewer Bill Whitaker asked a follow-up question: 'What about China?' In her response, Harris framed America's relationship with the Pacific power in economic terms, saying the US 'must win the competition for the 21st century with China.' 'We must be able to compete and win. We should not seek conflict, but we have to understand that there are parameters in which we much operate that include ensuring, for example, that we protect American business interests,' she said. Asked if the US would intervene should China invade Taiwan, Harris declined to get into that hypothetical as well and reiterated the Biden administration's adherence to the one China policy, 'but that includes supporting Taiwan's ability to defend itself, including what we need to do to ensure freedom of the Taiwan Strait.' Harris's assesment of Iran as the number one adversary doesn't quite match official statements from the Pentagon and IC, which put China as far and away the most pressing geopolitical challenge — impetus for the DoD's years-long, stop-and-start 'pivot to the Pacific' effort. For instance, in the Biden administration's official National Defense Strategy, Bejing is described as America's 'pacing challenge,' compared to Russia's 'acute threat.' Iran is typically relegated to a group of dangerous 'regional' actors. The IC's 2024 Worldwide Threat Assessment [PDF] likewise first addresses China as having the 'capability to directly compete' with the US to challenge the global order and Russia as a 'threat' to that same order. Iran, it says, threatens US 'interests, allies, and influence in the Middle East and intends to entrench its emergent status as a regional power ....' But analyst Becca Wasser told Breaking Defense that observers shouldn't read too much into Harris's answer as forecasting a change in priorities in a potential Harris administration, as much as a 'recognition of what the current challenge is.' 'Maybe that answer doesn't comport with what the current National Defense Strategy says, but there is the reality of acknowledging the ways in which Iran has, time and time again, complicated US efforts to focus elsewhere,' said Wasser, a senior fellow for the Defense Program at the Center for New American Security. The '60 Minutes' interview was broadcast amid a devastating conflict in the Middle East between Israel and Iran-backed proxies in the region, including Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, and just a week after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. Millions of civilians are caught in the middle, and it's a conflict that perpetually threatens to spiral into a wider regional war that could draw in American forces. Wasser said she wouldn't have necessarily put Iran at the top of her list of adversaries, but said she didn't believe Harris was 'wrong' that Iran is 'an obvious answer for one of the potential threats that faces America today and could face America tomorrow.' 'If you looking at the current threat environment, the current world in which [we] stand, Iran does stand out as truly one of the most relevant adversaries that is actually causing problems for the United States at this very moment,' she said. 'You hear a lot about China as a DoD &#8216;pacing' challenge, but that is a long-term challenge. And so here I think we have to sort of view her answer in different time frames.' Wasser also suggested it's possible Harris may have taken issue with Whitaker's use of the word 'adversary' in the original question, as the Biden administration, including the Pentagon, has attempted to frame American competition with China as just that — a competition, not a conflict. 'It is a US-China strategic competition; war with China is not inevitable,' Wasser said, noting that it's an eventuality the Biden administration has been trying to avoid 'at all costs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/americas-greatest-adversary-kamala-harris-says-iran-is-an-obvious-answer/	2024-10-08T09:23:31-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241008_DVIDS_kamala_harris_8552393-scaled-e1728403539598.jpg
The incubator from whence tomorrow’s radars, missiles, and jammers emerge	Raytheon’s Advanced Technology business makes extensive use of modeling and simulation in sensor and weapons development. Shown are renderings of the SPY-6 naval radar. (Raytheon image) The torpedoes, radars, missiles, and satellites that will be in the Defense Department’s arsenal of the future are being defined and crafted today by Raytheon’s Advanced Technology business whose job it is to turn next-generation technologies into real-world warfighting capabilities. This is the organization, for example, where the Air Force’s hypersonic air-breathing weapon, HACM, was conceived, designed, and matured. Colin Whelan, president of Raytheon’s Advanced Technology (AT) business, gave us a high-level look at the team. In two follow-up stories, AT will discuss: the flexible foundational building blocks it uses when developing new radar and weapon capabilities (such as software defined-apertures and composable weapons); and the importance of modeling and simulation in demonstrating radar and weapon system capabilities through its Rapid Campaign Analysis Demonstration Environment (RCADE) that analyzes capabilities at the theater level. Breaking Defense: Advanced Technology is RTX’s capability incubator business for Raytheon. How do you address future defense challenges? Colin Whelan is president of Raytheon Advanced Technology. Whelan: RTX is transforming innovative research into technologies that shape the future of aerospace and defense. At Advanced Technology, we approach our customer’s challenges from theater- and mission-level perspectives. I’ve spent the last 25 years working across the company to ensure we give our warfighters an unfair advantage on the battlefield. The output of the ‘AT team’ as we like to call it, spans the development of individual components to full-scale solutions, early ideation to production readiness, and from seabed to space. AT works to understand the future threat landscape and we shape our technology development for what our warfighters will need for the future fight, rather than only what may be written in a requirements document today. The team operates seamlessly across the entire RTX enterprise that also includes Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney, while routinely partnering with small businesses and academia to ensure we’re always bringing our customers the best, most innovative and capable solutions. What are some of the well-known DoD programs that were birthed and matured within the Advanced Technology business before they were handed off to the other Raytheon business units? This team has helped define, architect, and propel some of Raytheon’s most well-known franchise programs such as: the Navy’s SPY-6 radar on carriers and destroyers; the Army’s Air and Missile Defense LTAMDS radar complementing our Patriot system; the Air Force’s hypersonic air-breathing weapon, HACM; and the Next Generation Jammer, the Navy’s latest electronic warfare system for the EA-18 GROWLER. Why are you pulling back the curtain, so to speak, on Raytheon AT at this point? It’s always been hard to say much about what we do. The world has changed rather significantly in the recent past, but the AT team has been thinking about ways to solve for the emerging need for faster fielding, with more capabilities and at lower costs, for a long time. We are delivering many of those systems today. We leverage our expertise in systems integration and mission-level solutions to help define future product roadmaps. And thanks to the flexible foundational building block architecture that I mentioned earlier, our solutions can quickly receive customizable features enabled through software. How is AT translating that into new capabilities in radars/sensing and weapons? From a sensing system development perspective, AT is focused on harnessing the full capabilities of the RF spectrum. We’ve created a software-defined aperture architecture rather than a conventional radar approach to produce flexible hardware solutions that serve multiple missions with ‘software apps’ like on your cell phone. Fielded and future programs are receiving these upgrades today. From a new weapon-development lens, reuse once again becomes a catalyst for speed. Over the last decade, we have architected the use of common, scalable, Lego-like hardware and software building blocks, allowing us to go faster and streamline our factories. Final thoughts? I’m incredibly fortunate to be a part of Raytheon’s Advanced Technology business, and I see the impact our work makes to ensure the safety of our nation and allies around the world regularly. Our team is an agile one, built for speed. We take the challenge of developing next-generation defense technologies very seriously, and I look forward to being able to share more about our work soon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-incubator-from-whence-tomorrows-radars-missiles-and-jammers-emerge/	2024-10-08T05:20:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Raytheons-Advanced-Technology-business-makes-extensive-use-of-modeling-and-simulation-in-sensor-and-weapons-development.-Shown-are-renderings-of-the-SPY-6-naval-radar.-Raytheon-image-scaled.jpg
