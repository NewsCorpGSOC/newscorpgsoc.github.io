(U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Anthony J. Rivera) SPACEPOWER 2024 — Not only has China's space fleet ballooned over the past decade, but Beijing is increasingly using maneuvering satellites to crisscross geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) in order to keep eyes on, and potentially do harm to, their US counterparts, according to Space Force and industry officials. Chinese satellites are 'zigzagging' from altitudes above GEO, through the belt and then to slightly lower altitudes, often coming uncomfortably close to US satellites, Clint Clark of sky-watching firm Exoanalytics said today. 'China doesn't sit still. They're all over the sky. Why are they doing this? It's because they're coming for you. In their strategy documents, they will tell you, whoever controls space controls the Earth,' he told an audience made up largely of Guardians at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando. 'They go up and down the belt. They hold everybody at risk. Periodically, they do crazy stuff. They'll get on top of a satellite,' Clark said. 'And sometimes they'll pick it up and move it away. They're practicing those tactics.' US Space Force Chief Master Sgt. Ronald Lerch said that Chinese authors have openly written about imaging the Space Force's own eyes in the heavens, the Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program (GSSAP) satellites, and the brand new SILENTBARKER inspection satellites the service is operating jointly with the National Reconnaissance Office. China's on-orbit fleet has gone from 36 satellites in 2010 to more than 1,000 this year, he stressed. Beijing's current space fleet includes 292 electro-optical and 43 radar satellites for imaging targets on Earth, and 74 signals intelligence gathering satellites, according to a slide he presented — along with a slide showing a Chinese rendering of a GSSAP bird and a synthetic aperture radar image of the US naval base at Norfolk, Va. Also included in the fleet are the 60 satellites making up the Beidou positioning, navigation and timing constellation, Lerch said. 'So, they went from no or barely any capability in 2010 to now they have their own [reliable] GPS. 60 of them — 24 in MEO [medium Earth orbit], three in GEO, and then another three in IXO or inclined GEO, and then one backup for each individual spacecraft,' he elaborated. Beijing's growing space capabilities have meant an increase in the PLA's ability to threaten US forces both in space and on Earth, according to Space Force and industry officials here. 'Norm-shattering behaviors have been enabled because of their ability to have space and what that's able to offer,' Lerch said, noting that Chinese behavior has been 'increasingly assertive' as their space power has grown. 'Their specific goals are to be able to track and target us high value assets at the time and place of their choosing,' Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of US Space Force Indo-Pacific, told reporters. 'We're seeing all signs pointing to being able to target US aircraft carriers, as well as high value assets in the air like tankers and AWACS [Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft]. This is a strategy to keep the US from intervening, and that's what their space architecture is designed for.' Clark said China for the past 10 years also has 'been practicing' space-based methods for US space capabilities, with systems for rendezvous and proximity operations; docking and capture; characterization and inspection; and counter inspection; as well as developing co-orbital and direct ascent anti-satellite weapons. 'And it's not just that they've been practicing them. They've been doing them in very specific ways, with huge delta-v's relative to what we're able to produce, and they're doing them in ways that challenge our kill chains,' he said. Mastalir said that in order for the US Space Force to counter China's increasing threat, it is important for the service to 'scale our capabilities to meet and exceed what's required in the future, because the PRC is moving. &#8230; As they continue to evolve, we must be prepared to take on those challenges.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/chinas-space-moves-highly-mobile-satellites-stalking-geo-spook-space-force/	2024-12-10T13:40:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/7526919-scaled-e1733867404835.jpg
Israel seeks to defang Syria, as 350-plus strikes destroy military sites and equipment	Air defense radar burns at Mezzeh Air Base on December 8, 2024 in Damascus, Syria. (Ali Haj Suleiman/Getty Images) JERUSALEM — The Israel Defense Forces have carried out more than 350 strikes in Syria since Dec. 7, as Israel seeks to dismantle the Assad regime’s arsenal before it can be taken over by the rebel forces that shockingly took control of the country over the weekend. Dubbed Operation Arrow of Bashan, the Israeli strikes included attacks from the land, sea and air. According to an IDF statement, the strikes have destroyed 'Scud missiles, cruise missiles, surface-to-sea, surface-to-air and surface-to-surface missiles, UAVs, fighter jets, attack helicopters, radars, tanks, hangars, and more.' 'I approved the Air Force bombing of strategic military capabilities left by the Syrian military so that they will not fall into the hands of the jihadists,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Dec 10. 'We have no intention of interfering in Syria's internal affairs; however, we do intend to do what is necessary for our security.' Netanyahu compared the large-scale precision airstrikes to the British raid on French naval ships in the wake of France’s fall to the Nazis in 1940s. England wanted to prevent the Nazis using French naval ships at the time to expand the relatively small German navy. The IDF said the Israeli Navy carried out a raid on two Syrian naval facilities at the Al-Bayda and Latakia ports, targeting fifteen naval vessels. In addition 'dozens of sea-to-sea missiles with ranges of 80–190 kilometers were destroyed. Each missile carried significant explosive payloads, posing threats to civilian and military maritime vessels in the area,' the IDF said. אריאל כהנא: שרידי ספינות טילים של חיל הים הסורי בנמל טרטוס. תמונות שמהדהדות את השמדת חילות האוויר של מדינות ערב במלחמת ששת הימים pic.twitter.com/J1O0ATz3Le &mdash; זירת החדשות (@ZiratNews) December 10, 2024 The Alma Research and Education Center, which focuses on threats to northern Israel noted that in the wake of the collapse of the Assad regime 'anything from basic military equipment to advanced conventional weapons, strategic capabilities, and even unconventional weapons, such as chemical weapons,' could be taken by various groups, something the group calls 'a clear and immediate danger.' Ksenia Svetlova, a former member of Knesset and Executive Director of the NGO Ropes, also noted this sense of concern in Israel in a conversation with Breaking Defense. 'When Israel pounds Syrian military objectives, this is because of the fear it might fall into the wrong hands — and there are many wrong hands in Syria as we know,' said Svetlova. 'There are no guarantees that the new rulers of Syria will be able to maintain control or be able to prevent from military factions that with them of doing something that can jeopardize Israel’s interests.' Yaakov Katz, who wrote a book called Shadow Strike on the Israeli strike on Syria’s nuclear program in 2007 and is a fellow at The Jewish People Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense that 'Syria has amassed significant strategic weapons over the last few decades &#8211; ballistic missiles, chemical weapons and aircraft.' He agreed with Svetlova and the Alma center that there should be real concern that these weapons might fall into the wrong hands. The IDF 'is doing it to keep Israel safe, but this is a benefit for the entire world,' Katz said. The Syrian regime historically possessed a large arsenal of both conventional and, although its chemical arsenal was officially destroyed year ago, unconventional weapons. Many of the conventional weapons are of Russian origin, including Mig-23 jets and attack helicopter, plus air defenses systems. Syria’s main military arm was its ground forces, although these were badly damaged in more than a decade of intense fighting during the Syrian civil war that began in 2011. Photos and footage posted online showed a number of the sites allegedly struck, including military airfields. Because the strikes were carried out at night, it was not always possible to confirm which strikes were Israeli strikes and which may have been other incidents. Richard Kemp, a former commander of British forces in Afghanistan who led the international terrorism team at Britain's Joint Intelligence Committee, described the strikes in a post online as a 'strategic masterstroke by Israel. In perhaps the most intensive bombing campaign in its history, Israel has destroyed the Syrian air force, air defences, navy and army assets plus defence industries and C2I.' Svetlova noted that in the wake of the strikes it was interesting to see a lack of statement from the new rulers in Damascus about the attacks. The strongest faction in Damascus today is Hayat Tahrir al Sham and its leader Mohammed el Jolani. Mohammed al-Bashir, an HTS loyalist, was appointed the new Prime Minister of Syria on Dec. 10. Ksenia said she had seen criticism online among Syrian activists about the silence in Damascus. 'Some label it and frame it as support for Israel, or even cooperation or collaboration with Israel, which is of course not true. Israel was surprised by this development just like everybody else.' She noted the strongest reactions were condemnation by Iran and Hezbollah. Turkey, Qatar and other countries have also condemned the Israeli strikes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israel-seeks-to-defang-syria-as-350-plus-strikes-destroy-military-sites-and-equipment/	2024-12-10T13:05:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/syria-air-defese-scaled-e1733864604640.jpg
In NDAA, Congress aims to move ball forward on solving drone incursion problem	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019.(Photo by Staff Sgt. Mylinda DuRousseau) EDWARDS AFB, Calif.— Congress wants more information from the Pentagon on what authorities and technologies it needs to protect military installations from the threat of drone incursions, as a spate of high-profile incidents spark concerns that adversaries could use drones to exploit weaknesses in US base security. The compromise version of the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act, released on Saturday, includes several provisions aimed at improving the US military’s response to potential drone threats to its installations, including the creation of a counter-drone strategy. In addition to the mandate for the strategy — which was originally included in the Senate Armed Services Committee’s version of the bill — it requires that the department conduct an assessment of the existing counter-UAS enterprise. The bill also calls for the department to provide recommendations for how to change existing policy to reduce the requirements that the Pentagon coordinate certain responses to drone incursions with other federal organizations. Other language would compel the Pentagon to create and maintain a c-UAS threat library, which would include information on counter-drone solutions and catalogue all drone incursions that occur at US military installations. 'We agree that U.S. troops have the inherent right of self defense, including from UAS attacks, wherever they may be,' the explanatory statement accompanying the bill said. At the same time, the conference version of the bill did not include a Senate provision that would require the Pentagon to provide a plan to speed up the testing, demonstration and validation of technologies needed to support the strategy. The release of the new NDAA comes just days after Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin signed off on a classified strategy on countering unmanned systems on Dec. 2, leaving it unclear whether the Pentagon has already done enough to satisfy Congress’s mandate. The classified strategy document lays out a roadmap for near-term and future solutions for mitigating drone threats, the department said in a news release. 'A critical portion of our efforts, particularly in the near-term, comes from improving our defenses, with an emphasis on detection as well as active and passive defenses,' said an unclassified fact sheet for the strategy. 'The Department will ensure our forces and priority installations have protection.' The Pentagon has documented hundreds of drone incursions over US military installations over the past few years, US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) leaders said in October. RELATED: NORTHCOM head wants new integration role in counter-UAS ops Those include multiple incursions at Joint Base Langley Eustis in Virginia in December 2023, which involved varying numbers of drones in different sizes and configurations, the Air Force said in a statement earlier this year. As a result, F-22 stealth fighters located at the base were forced to temporarily relocate and suspend nighttime training missions, the Wall Street Journal reported in October. Another acknowledged incident involved incursions at Plant 42 in Palmdale, Calif., — an Air Force installation where tenant contractors like Lockheed Martin’s Skunk Works and Northrop Grumman develop and produce experimental, classified aircraft. The location is technically a component of Edwards Air Force Base, which is located about 20 miles northeast and provides base security. An Air Force spokeswoman told the War Zone that the service had 'observed multiple UAS [uncrewed aerial systems] activities over Plant 42 during the last few months,' and worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to impose temporary flight restrictions around Plant 42. So far, the drone incursions have been limited to Plant 42 and have not projected into Edwards AFB, Brig. Gen. Doug Wickert, commander of its 412th Test Wing, told reporters during a visit to the base last week. Wickert said he 'felt very supported' in the wake of the incidents by NORTHCOM, which is taking a leading role in synchronizing counter-drone activities across the department. Edwards is currently in the process of testing and deploying several additional c-UAS systems, he said, adding that the open desert skies of the base provides an easier detection environment than more urban, congested locations like Langley AFB. While he said he has the authorities to direct security forces to take action to protect the base against drones, he acknowledged that some situations require coordination with outside organizations like the FAA. The Defense Department is making an effort to tackle the incursion problem, but it’s difficult to solve, and particularly challenging to differentiate when a drone is flying near a US installation for nefarious purposes like spying, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'Some of it is hobbyists who lose control of their drone or decide to do something stupid and fly it over a military base to just take a look and see what's over there. I mean my mother-in-law gave me one, and what do you do with it? Fly it, take off, It's got a camera on it … [so] you’re going to go look at something, going to find interesting stuff to look at,' said Kelly, who leads the Senate Armed Services airland committee. 'But some of it, I'm pretty sure, is our adversaries. Why wouldn't they?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/in-ndaa-congress-aims-to-move-ball-forward-on-solving-drone-incursion-problem/	2024-12-10T12:33:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/240322_cuas_army_5816892-scaled-e1711130176663.jpg
Army Material Command head relieved of duty following investigation	Then US Army Brig. Gen. Charles Hamilton poses for a command portrait in the Army portrait studio at the Pentagon in Arlington, VA, Sept. 05, 2017. (US Army/Monica King) WASHINGTON — Army Secretary Christine Wormuth has officially relieved Army Material Command head Gen. Charles Hamilton of command following an investigation into intervening with the selecting of senior commanders, the service confirmed. 'Based on the findings of a Department of the Army Inspector General investigation, the Secretary of the Army has relieved General Charles Hamilton of command,' service spokesperson Cynthia Smith wrote in a brief statement today. Military.com first reported on the decision, and wrote up the initial investigation into the allegations that Hamilton helped secure a leadership role for a subordinate officer that has previously been deemed unfit for command. After those allegations surfaced in March, the four-star general was suspended from his post overseeing the service's global supply chain, logistics, and sustainment. The command’s deputy, Lt. Gen. Christopher Mohan, then stepped in to perform the duties of his boss and is still currently at the AMC helm. Meanwhile, the Army IG office got to work conducting an investigation into just what transpired and penned its finding. While Breaking Defense has not obtained that report, Smith said it found that the Command Assessment Program (CAP) 'withstood an attempt to interfere with its process' but changes need to be made. 'Secretary Wormuth will be issuing a directive that formally establishes CAP as an enduring Army program in order to reinforce the integrity of CAP and increase transparency,' Smith wrote.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-material-command-head-relieved-of-duty-following-investigation/	2024-12-10T12:16:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Hamilton-scaled-e1733861396459.jpg
Ships for America Act coming ‘really soon,’ says cosponsor Sen. Mark Kelly	The Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and Cavour Carrier Strike Group sail in formation on Aug. 9, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Daniel Kimmelman) RNDF 2024 — Rep. Mike Waltz is set to head the White House next year as President-elect Donald Trump’s national security advisor, but the pro-shipbuilding legislation he helped helm is still very much alive and will be introduced in Congress soon, the bill’s Democratic cosponsor told Breaking Defense. 'We’re really close,' Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Arizona, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of Reagan National Defense Forum. 'We've made, you know, just some recent little tweaks that my potential Republican Senate co-sponsor wanted, and we're about to announce something really soon, and we'll get the legislation introduced and then start working building support for it.' Kelly and Waltz, R-Fla., had planned to introduce their 'Ships For America Act' following the November election. While Kelly will have to find another House Republican co-sponsor to replace Waltz, the latter's advocacy for shipbuilding issues could be a positive for forthcoming legislation, Kelly said in an interview Saturday. The Arizona Democrat added that there’s a 'reasonable path' to passage if the Trump administration gets behind the bill. 'I know he [Waltz] really cares about it, and having him in the White House as the National Security Advisor, in my view is a very positive thing,' Kelly said. 'I look forward to continuing to work with him when he's in the administration on this issue.' During a September event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies where Waltz and Kelly laid out their vision for the bill, the duo said that they supported the creation of a maritime czar inside the executive branch who could oversee shipbuilding issues that touch both the Defense Department and the Department of Transportation. 'We need to make it more cost effective to operate US-flagged vessels with some cargo preference,' Kelly said then. 'We need regulatory reform and some financial support to the industry, like tax credits, and then building up our shipbuilding capacity to make sure that we’re going to be able to have more US-flagged ships here at home, and then the workforce [shortage] issue. 'This legislation addresses all [of] those areas extensively,' he continued. The Ships Act codifies much of what the Navy is trying to do with its Maritime Statecraft initiative, which focuses on expanding shipbuilding capacity by strengthening the government’s relationships with industry and boosting commercial shipbuilders, Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said during a speech Monday at the American Society of Naval Engineers conference. Del Toro added that the Ships Act could he introduced as early as 'the next couple of days or the next week or so.' 'But another part of the equation that … probably isn't going to be addressed directly in the Ships Act, that I think our nation needs to address is the issue of blue collar workforce in this country,' Del Toro said. 'If you care about economic security across the entire threshold, if you care about having more workers in shipyards or more workers in all our industries, you've got to pay attention to immigration, and we have a requirement in, my humble opinion, to increase legal immigration to this country. … Unemployment is really low right now, and that's part of the problem that we all face, and it's why our shipyards, both commercial and private shipyards, have been struggling the way they have.' Justin Katz in Washington contributed to this story.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ships-for-america-act-coming-really-soon-says-cosponsor-sen-mark-kelly/	2024-12-10T11:10:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/8580602-scaled-e1733847381422.jpg
What ‘really’ worries the head of the Space Development Agency	Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear (R) addresses the audience at the Space Foundation's 2024 Space Symposium. (Space Foundation) SPACEPOWER 2024 — The head of the US Space Development Agency isn't really scared of a potential anti-satellite attack by an adversary, given the large number of low Earth orbit satellites being planned for the agency's Proliferated Warfighter Space Architecture. Instead, Derek Tournear said he's worried about two potential problems that could undercut SDA's primary goal to enable fast as possible sensor-to-shooter connections: weak cybersecurity across the constellation and shaky supply chains. 'There are two threats out there that I am really worried about. They're common mode failure threats,' Tournear said during a panel discussion during the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. 'Number one is cyber. If we have a cyber vulnerability. It doesn't matter whether I have two satellites or 2,000 satellites, we could be vulnerable to that. So it is a big deal. We take a lot of protections against that,' he said. 'The second one is, is supply chain — the ability to actually produce these satellites at scale — and then supply chain interdiction.' He explained that becuse of SDA's networked architecture, the agency needs to have 'assurance for the providence' of all the 'parts and pieces' that go into each one of the satellites being developed by different providers. The question of the provenance isn't only applicable to hardware, he stressed, but is also a critical question for software. '[We] also need a robust industrial base that can create software, test software, get the software ready to go and build that capability up right now,' Tournear elaborated. 'Our industrial base relies a lot on on foreign entities to write our software. It's one of the things that we've kind of said we were worried about that at the Space Development Agency. We want our flight software and our satellites to be written in the US, because that's one of the supply chain interdiction things that I'm worried about. So that's been a bottleneck.' Another key issue is the current fragility of the defense supply chain that Tournear said 'is always going to be a problem' and 'always going to cause delays.' SDA experienced delays in launching its initial prototype satellites due to supply chain woes during the COVID-19 pandemic, with resistors being a key problem, he noted. Further, the planned launch of its first operational set of data relay and missile tracking satellites, called Tranche 1, has been set back by about seven months to the spring of 2025 due to another supply chain problem — this time involving optical communications terminals needed to create satellite-to-satellite links. Gen. Michael Guetlein, Space Force vice chief, told the Reagan Forum panel that while SDA is 'the canary in the coal mine' with regard to supply chain woes, the problem is more widespread. James Taiclet, Lockheed Martin's CEO, chimed in that solid rocket motors are yet another commodity where there are only a couple of suppliers — to the point where the Defense Department weighed in with investment last year to bolster production. Guetlein explained that the defense supply chain issue is systemic, due to general industry push in recent decades for 'efficiency.' 'We have spent decades optimizing our industrial base for efficiency and consolidating, and we are single suppliers deep across multiple different fronts,' he said. 'We're going to have to start getting comfortable with lack of efficiency in the industrial base to start getting excess capacity so that we have something to go to in times of crisis or conflict. 'These challenges are significant, and we need to figure out how to get after them,' Guetlein said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/what-really-worries-the-head-of-the-space-development-agency/	2024-12-10T09:27:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240411_space_symposium_tournear_space_foundation-e1712859283861.jpg
What to know about what’s in the compromise NDAA	The early morning sun strikes the U.S. Capitol November 6, 2006 in Washington, DC. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Congress’s compromise fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act language, released Saturday, kept within the budget cap topline, which means there were few major movements compared to what had been requested from the Pentagon earlier this year. According to numbers compiled by Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners, the compromise language increases overall procurement and R&amp;E funding by roughly $2 billion over the Pentagon’s FY25 request. Army procurement is roughly equal, Navy procurement is down about $500 million, and the Air Force is up around $800 million. The House plans to vote on the bill on Thursday. But the NDAA Is primarily a policy bill, not, as any Congressional appropriator would be quick to tell you, the final funding bill for the military. As a result, a few highlights did stick out to the Breaking Defense team. Below is our roundup: The NDAA language moves to slow or block a series of retirements requested by the Air Force. While many divestments would largely be approved, the bill would reject F-15E and F-22 retirements while extending limitations on offloading the RQ-4 and C-130, according to an explanatory statement accompanying the bill. The legislation would also permit continued A-10 retirements alongside older models of the F-15 and F-16 and ensure the service maintains 16 E-3s until the radar plane can be replaced either by the forthcoming E-7 or other capabilities. Keeping with that theme, the bill would add in six F-15EXs, three C-130s — including an ski-equipped LC-130J — two C-40Bs and inject an additional $400 million for E-7 'acceleration,' which in the past has typically meant money funneled to long-lead procurement. The language also prevents the Pentagon from accepting more than 30 F-35As, nine F-35Bs and nine F-35Cs until the Secretary of Defense takes several steps to improve the program, like formulating a plan to address deficiencies identified in a recent testing report. It further calls on subcontractors to follow prime manufacturer Lockheed Martin’s lead and invest their own dollars to improve the jet, and slashes $345M from Air Force procurement for 'excess cost growth.' While cutting $102 million earmarked for the service’s Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS) effort and $159 million from the KC-46 program, the language adds in a requirement that the Secretary of the Air Force develop a plan to establish 'air base air defense sites' at Air Force installations, as service officials fret whether their air bases can be properly defended against attacks from a peer adversary like China. The NDAA authors seem to enjoy tasking the Army with a series of reporting requirements. Among the must-dos: a requirement for the Secretary of the Army to develop and implement a 'plan for the procurement and fielding of additional kinetic effectors for low, slow, small-unmanned aircraft integrated defeat system.' Another provision requires a report on the procurement of energetic material — key components in bombs and missiles — from sources outside the US. It keeps going: There’s a mandate that the Army Secretary deliver a Black Hawk modernization report, as well as a report on the 'testing, procurement, integration, and fielding of vehicle protection systems on Army ground combat vehicles.' And finally, a reporting requirement means the Army provides an update on the service’s long-term Stryker investment plan. Lawmakers in the bill’s explanatory statement admonished Navy leadership for, what they called, a 'lack of transparency' and communication with both Capitol Hill and the White House’s Office of Management and Budget. The controversy is centered on an allegation from lawmakers that service leadership negotiated a significant plan with industry to bolster the Virginia-class submarine program without informing Capitol Hill or OMB. Now, according to the statement, lawmakers are left with an expensive new supplemental funding request from the service and, they say, 'few options' that will truly resolve the problems at hand and its root causes. At the time of publication, a Navy spokesman had not yet responded to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. Related: Lawmakers admonish Navy for ‘lack of transparency’ on sub funding requests Elsewhere in the bill, Congress is poised to impose new technical and design requirements on the Constellation-class frigate and Medium Landing Ship programs before either can proceed. While the prohibitions are unlikely to halt either program, the detailed requirements reflect increased congressional interest in both endeavors. The Medium Landing Ship is a relatively new program that the Marine Corps says will be crucial to any island hopping campaign in the Indo Pacific. Constellation class is a more advanced program that has gotten the personal attention of the Navy Secretary — and numerous lawmakers — following significant delays that are already putting it years behind schedule. Lawmakers also appear to agree with the Navy’s move to delay spending for its next-gen fighter, as the bill would not alter the service’s funding request of $454 million — roughly a billion dollars less than previous projections. Asked last month about the status of FA/AX, a spokesperson said 'All we can comment on regarding this is that we have received proposals and they are being evaluated.' The biggest takeaway from Space is that the NDAA approves the Air Force’s plan to transfer Air National Guard members to full time Space Force, without seeking the approval of governors. The National Governors Association already is out protesting the move, which they describe as 'deeply concerning and breaks with more than a century of important precedent surrounding state’s rights – as well as a violation of federal law.' The NDAA also approves the creation of the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR), and gives the Air Force Secretary — and notably, not the National Reconnaissance Office — milestone authority for space-based ground moving target systems. It also elevates authority for the Contractor Watch List to Frank Calvelli, in his role as Space Acquisition Executive, and requires the Defense Secretary to designate a senior official 'to be responsible for a national integrated air and missile defense architecture for the United States.' Congress's plans to study a potential independent cyber force have been scaled back in the final NDAA language. Prior drafts of the bill called specifically for an evaluation of a separate cyber force conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine — shortened to the 'National Academies' in the bill language. However, Saturday’s compromise language was vaguer, calling only for the assessment of 'cyber organizations' instead of a separate cyber service — an important change, as advocates of a future cyber force had been hoping to hang their argument off of a report from the academies. The idea of an independent cyber force has long been a point of contention within the DoD, as the Pentagon formally requested that lawmakers shut down a legislative proposal that would mandate an independent assessment of the establishment of a separate cyber service back in September, three sources familiar with the matter told Breaking Defense at the time. The final draft language comes after Texas Republicans Rep. Pat Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell authored the amendment in a draft version of the 2025 NDAA that called for the independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. Fallon told Breaking Defense last month that the study could be cause for the upcoming administration to stand up a cyber force. 'Incumbent on the results of the commission, which I think will affirm the need for a cyber service, I believe there’s a good chance we will see [a cyber service] come to fruition in soon. The Trump administration has shown that they will not put up with the status quo, and will opt for bold action, if necessary, especially when US national security is at risk,' Fallon said.

(DVIDS) WASHINGTON — The US military announced today the first-ever test intercept of a ballistic missile from its Guam-based missile defense system, in what a military official called a 'critical milestone' for what's seen as America's first line of defense in the case of war with China. The test just off shore from the US territory 'confirmed our ability to detect, track, and engage a target missile in flight, increasing our readiness to defend against evolving adversary threats,' Joint Task Force-Micronesia Commander Rear Adm. Greg Huffman said in a Missile Defense Agency (MDA) release. The release said that during the 'experiment,' the Aegis air defense system used a new AN/TPY-6 radar to track the target and a Vertical Launching System to fire a Standard Missile-3 Block IIA at an incoming, air-launched medium-range ballistic missile flying over the ocean near Andersen Air Force Base. 'The AN/TPY-6 radar tracked the target shortly after launch to intercept in the first end-to-end tracking use of the radar during a live ballistic missile flight test,' the Pentagon said. RELATED: Tying it together: Army eyes evolving test plan new capabilities bound for Guam The MDA described the event as a 'pivotal step' towards a larger, more holistic Guam Defense System designed to take on multiple threats at once — a 'persistent layered integrated air and missile defense capability.' According to CSIS missile defense expert Tom Karako, that will be where the rubber meets the road for an island that lies 9,000 miles from the California coast but a relatively scant 3,000 miles from mainland China. 'The defense of Guam is one of the most important and hardest missile defense development challenges underway. While these engagements are eye watering in many respects, today’s test was comparatively routine in terms of a single ballistic missile target,' he told Breaking Defense. 'The Guam Defense System will ultimately integrate multiple independent fire control systems into something that can cope with complex and integrated attacks with salvos across the air and missile threat spectrum.' RELATED: Army awards Raytheon $12 billion to begin LTAMDS production Such a robust defense would be necessary if war breaks out with China. Karako said Beijing can be expected to launch missile salvos that are 'an order of magnitude greater than what we saw in [Iran's] April 14 attack on Israel.' For several years, US military leaders from the Indo-Pacific region have emphasized the need to build up Guam as both a military staging point and an air-defense hub. However, the process hasn't been easy, and in October, the MDA proposed scaling back the number of missile defense sites on the island from 22 to 16 due to environmental impact concerns. In today's announcement MDA chief Lt. Gen. Heath Collins praised the 'tremendous group effort' and coordination between different Pentagon organizations, but the US military is still sorting out exactly who will be responsible for what when it comes to standing up the different elements of the broader, complex missile defense system on Guam. 'Not only do I have to get those individual programs across the goal line, they all have to work together,' Brig. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army’s Program Executive Officer for Missiles and Space, said at a CSIS event in August.

3 immediate tasks for the secretary of the Navy nominee	Graduating Sailors stand in ranks during U.S. Navy Recruit Training Command's Pass in Review in Great Lakes, Illinois, Jul. 25, 2024. More than 40,000 recruits train annually at the Navy's only boot camp (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Christopher M. O'Grady) President-elect Donald Trump has recently announced his intent to nominate John Phelan to be secretary of the Navy. Phelan, a businessman with no military experience, is going to have his hands full trying to right-size a service that has been on the wrong track for almost thirty years. His lack of military experience should not be an inherent handicap in this job, because the role of the service secretary is to organize, train, and equip their respective services. But what will immediately trip him up is if he does not work right away to establish a good relationship with the legislative leaders who can make or break his plans going forward. While Phelan will be focused on the Senate Armed Services Committee because they will guide his nomination through the Senate, he should use this time to meet and engage with key members of the Senate Appropriation Committees, as well as the key committee members in the House — and come armed with near-term fixes that he needs Congress to make in order to enable him to hit the ground running. If he cannot convince Congress to act now, he will essentially spend the next year sailing in circles. Here are three areas he should ask Congress to help him out: recruiting, acquisition, and resources. Recruitment: One of the most important issues he will need to tackle are the shortfalls in manpower across the Navy. These shortfalls are so critical that failing to fix them may send the Navy into a near-term operational death-spiral, which would leave Phelan unable to meet the needs of the president should a crisis erupt. The multi-service recruiting crisis has been years in the making and therefore will likely take several years to fix. However, the incoming secretary can take a huge leap forward in fixing the problem by endorsing the House proposal to increase the pay of junior enlisted service members by 19 percent. Inflation, along with higher minimum wages and a looming demographic cliff that will result in fewer potential recruits, all point to the need for this very large pay raise. If not enacted in the 2025 NDAA, the incoming secretary will have to wait another year. Therefore, this is something Phelan should address with the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation prep. Acquisition: Phelan will need to move fast to change the acquisition paradigm of the Navy. The recent PPBE reform commission outlined key reforms that can only be implemented by the Appropriators; however, the current FY25 Appropriation bill reports contain language that essentially state that the committees will not provide additional funding flexibility. With the probable delay into March of the appropriation process, Phelan can work with the leaders of the Appropriation Committees in the Senate and House to create flexible funding lines to enable him to rapidly alter procurement within the Navy. For example, he can ask them to consolidate into one funding line the research, development, and procurement for all unmanned sea and air systems within the service. Failure to gain this flexibility will result in the secretary spending the next year fighting to align resources rather than improving the warfighting capabilities of the Navy. Resources: Perhaps the most important change he needs to ask the Congress for is to support additional time and resources for the National Commission on the Future of the Navy. As my colleague Mackenzie Eaglen has noted, Congress waited 439 days to seat the eight commissioners. Having the NDAA extend the commissions timeline and funding will be critically important as this Commission will need to work closely with the incoming secretary to align on the strategic shift for the Navy and more importantly, the decade-long resources needed to accomplish fix the Navy. If Phelan attempts to implement his strategic pivot alone, he will be forever inviting alternative plans from the Joint Staff, OSD, OMB, Defense Industry, and Congress. If, however, his plan for reforming the Navy aligns with the Commission, a strong case can be made that the plan will outlive Phelan’s tenure. During normal times, it is sage advice that the nominee should speak sparsely and get confirmed. These however, are not normal times. The Navy is broken, the President wants to disrupt the status quo, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are leading a government reform effort, and China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea are actively fighting proxy wars with the United States. Phelan needs help from Congress, help that cannot wait until next year. He ought to walk in and ask for the pay raise for junior enlisted, acquisition flexibility from the appropriators, and an extension to the timeline for the National Commission on the Future of the Navy.

With first test fire, Aussies joins tiny Tomahawk club with US, UK	HMAS Brisbane fires a Tomahawk cruise from Hobart-class HMS Brisband off of the coast of San Diego. (ADF POIS Craig Walton) SYDNEY — Australia has joined the US and UK as one of the tiny club of countries that can launch the Tomahawk cruise missile, with its legendary accuracy and range of more than 2,500 kilometers. The Royal Australian Navy test fired the weapon for the first time from HMAS Brisbane, the second of three Hobart-class destroyers, during a test and evaluation event 'off the west coast of the United States,' according to a statement issued today. Defense Minister Richard Marles said the first Tomahawk firing 'demonstrates the strength of our alliance and defense cooperation with the United States, in support of a peaceful, stable and prosperous region.' Canberra is investing $1.3 billion AUD ($830 million USD) to buy 'more than' 200 cruise missiles, which the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said is being 'introduced into service several years faster than originally planned.' They will be fired from Hobart-class destroyers, Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines and, possibly, the Hunter-class frigates. 'This Tomahawk firing follows the firings of the Naval Strike Missile and Standard Missile 6 earlier this year and is a practical demonstration of the speed at which the Albanese Government is delivering on its commitment to enhance the lethality of Navy’s surface combatant fleet,' added the MoD. 'The Tomahawk is the jewel in the crown and a step change in our firepower, deterrence and ability to strike land-based targets at ranges never before available to the Royal Australian Navy,' Pat Conroy, minister for defense procurement said in the MoD statement. 'This is about keeping Australians safe. But in conjunction with our other investments in long-range strike, as well as the decision to manufacture NSM in Australia, it’s also about delivering more jobs and a safer future made in Australia.' The US State Department notified Congress of the potential sale of Tomahawks to Australia in March 2023, at the time saying Canberra was interested in 200 Block V All Up Rounds, as well as 'up to' 20 Block IV versions. The sale includes the Tactical Tomahawk Weapon Control System (TTWCS) and the Theater Mission Planning Center (TMPC). In keeping with most FMS sale, it will also include extensive support, including unscheduled missile maintenance; spare parts; training; communication equipment and operational flight test. The estimated total cost then was $895 million. Marles made clear that the cruise missile is being bought to deter countries that may pose a threat to Australia. 'By enhancing our own defense capabilities, and by working with partners, we change the calculus for any potential aggressor so that no state will ever conclude the benefits of conflict outweigh the risks,' he said. Following Australia, Japan plans to buy twice as many Tomahawks — 400 missiles, including 200 Block IV and 200 Block V — as well as 14 control systems, plus software, hardware, training and other add-ons. The cost for that program is estimated to be $2.4 billion.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/with-first-test-fire-aussies-joins-tiny-tomahawk-club-with-us-uk/	2024-12-10T06:10:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/20241203ran8611998_0235-scaled.jpeg
‘Eroding readiness’: US Coast Guard Commandant warns of looming crisis	The icebreaker USCGC Healy (WAGB 20) keeps station while conducting crane operations alongside a multi-year ice floe for a science evolution in the Beaufort Sea, Aug. 9, 2023. (US Coast Guard/ Petty Officer 3rd Class Briana Carter) RNDF 2024 — A multi-billion shortfall in operation and maintenance coffers is hampering US Coast Guard operations with a steep cliff looming on the horizon, according to Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan. 'I can feel it out there, but I don't know what that tipping point is where there's been some really profound sort of budget shortfall risk that we need to work to address,' Fagan told Breaking Defense Saturday on the sidelines of the Reagan National Defense Forum in Simi Valley, Calif. The four-star admiral estimated that her service funding really needs to grow from $13 billion up towards the $20 billion range, and that right now it could 'ingest' $3 billion for operation and maintenance accounts to keep helicopters in the air and vessels mission ready. That additional $3 billion, Fagan added, could be used to shore up infrastructure, buy additional parts, maintenance, and for command, control, communication, computer, cyber and intelligence (C5I) initiatives. As the service under the Department of Homeland Security umbrella moves to purchase and field new vessels, she said it's becoming increasingly challenging to keep the assets it has up and running. Part of that problem revolves around a part shortage requiring the USCG to regularly pilfer parts from three or four ships just to fix one. 'On the large ships, we've normalized taking good parts,' Fagan added. 'When a ship comes in from patrol, you take the good part off, you put it on the ship across the pier, so that that ship can get underway. We call it controlled parts exchanges. That's not okay that we don't have enough parts &#8230; and we're deferring on dry docks. That will all begin to compound for more costs, not less, and it is eroding readiness.' For example, in 2023 alone the service experienced a 200 percent increase in cannibalizing navigation and mission sensors, and there isn’t an end in sight. In fiscal 2025, a projected funding shortfall will mean the service is only able to do about half of its planned maintenance and inventory requirements. That burgeoning crisis, she explained, has already prevented the USCG from meeting its commitments — including to the Joint Interagency Task Force (JIATF) South — because too many ships are undergoing unplanned maintenance, and there are not enough helicopters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/eroding-readiness-uscg-commandant-warns-of-looming-readiness-crisis/	2024-12-09T13:22:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/240711_DVIDS_icebreaker_7966479-scaled-e1720703191686.jpg
Lawmakers admonish Navy for ‘lack of transparency’ on sub funding requests	The Virginia-class attack submarine Pre-Commissioning Unit Minnesota (SSN 783) pulls pierside at Naval Station Norfolk from a scheduled underway. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Alex R. Forster/Released) WASHINGTON — Lawmakers are rebuking the Navy for negotiating a plan with industry to bolster the Virginia-class submarine program's industrial base without, they say, informing either Capitol Hill or the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), potentially putting in jeopardy the service’s recent supplemental funding request. 'We are concerned with the lack of transparency that has occurred between the Navy and Congress over the last 18 months,' lawmakers wrote in an explanatory statement accompanying a compromise version of the next defense policy bill published over the weekend. 'The Navy negotiated a funding strategy with industry that would have addressed cost growth, future cost to complete, workforce wage increases and infrastructure investments at both shipyards,' the statement continues, referring to General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding, where Virginias are produced. 'The Navy did this in isolation and failed to not only inform Congress but also the Office of Management and Budget.' The statement goes on to reference the Navy’s $5.7 billion supplemental funding request to address shortfalls in the program that the OMB sent to lawmakers last month. That plan 'will require an undisclosed amount of additional appropriations above the future years’ estimates in the president’s budget for fiscal year 2025,' according to the explanatory statement. Lawmakers said the Navy failed to alert them to the 'large cost growth' on the submarines in question, and the service’s 'lack of communication' leaves 'Congress with few options to address this situation and likely none that will rectify it going forward.' Breaking Defense has reached out to the Navy for comment. As it is, the compromise NDAA language authorizes $3.9 billion for Virginia-class program procurement, $357 million above the president's budget request. That money will need to be matched by congressional appropriators before it makes it to the Navy. The statement’s inclusion in the explanatory text means it has the backing of both chambers of Congress and defense-oriented lawmakers on both sides of the aisle — a veritable warning shot across the bow for Navy brass who remain in place when the new administration takes power in January. It comes just weeks after OMB sent an emergency supplemental to lawmakers that would shore up the production for three Virginia-class submarines, as well as provide authorities to keep the Columbia-class submarine program on track in the event of a continuing resolution. 'Our Virginia-class fast attack submarine program is not where it needs to be right now. The program and the shipyards are not producing submarines at the rate that our national security strategy and the national defense strategy require,' a senior Navy official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told reporters at the time. Additionally, that funding would be used to boost wages at General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII’s Newport News Shipbuilding.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lawmakers-admonish-navy-for-lack-of-transparency-on-sub-funding-requests/	2024-12-09T11:35:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/960845-1-e1717099304303.jpg
Sen. Deb Fischer on nuclear modernization, hopes for defense under Trump and Ukraine [VIDEO]	RNDF 2024 — Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., is the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on strategic forces and a member of the powerful Senate Appropriations committee. As a result, she is seen as a key advocate for defense on the Hill, particularly for nuclear modernization. In this exclusive one-on-one with Breaking Defense's Valerie Insinna, Fischer walks through the status of Pete Hegseth, Trump's defense secretary nominee; what she hopes to see on the nuclear modernization front under the Trump administration; and what the future of Ukraine might look like. One note: This interview was conducted hours before the National Defense Authorization Act was released, so the question about what the topline will look like has obviously been answered — we now know it conforms to the budget caps, a lower number than Senate leaders had wanted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/sen-deb-fischer-on-nuclear-modernization-hopes-for-defense-under-trump-and-ukraine-video/	2024-12-09T10:45:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/deb-fischer-scaled-e1733764088511.jpg
V-22 fleet operations restricted following new incident	A CV-22 Osprey assigned to the 21st Special Operations Squadron takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Jan. 8, 2021, during a training mission. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon is once again pausing operations of the troubled V-22 Osprey after a recent incident involving an Air Force variant of the tri-service tiltrotor, officials confirmed to Breaking Defense today. In a statement, Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) said that '[o]ut of an abundance of caution, NAVAIR recommended an operational pause for all V-22 Osprey variants Dec. 6, 2024' following a 'precautionary landing of a CV-22' that caused no injuries. 'The safety of our V-22 aircrew is our top priority. We are committed to ensuring our Sailors, Airmen and Marines are able to successfully complete their missions and return home safely,' NAVAIR said. The Associated Press first reported the pause. Osprey variants include the Air Force’s CV-22, the Marine Corps’ MV-22 and the Navy’s CMV-22B. NAVAIR hosts the lead program office for the V-22 across all fleets, though the individual services all make their own decisions for how to operate the Osprey. This is the latest in a series of issues that have plagued the V-22 over the last two years. In August 2022, Breaking Defense first reported that the Air Force was grounding its CV-22 fleet over safety concerns with the clutch of the aircraft. At the time, the Marine Corps did not follow suit, instead insisting their pilots could compensate for the issue and had been doing so for some time. While the Air Force returned to flight weeks later, the issue re-emerged and a Pentagon-wide grounding across a 'subset' of the Navy, Air Force and Marine V-22 models was instituted in February 2023. That was followed by a November 2023 crash off the coast of Japan that killed 8 airmen, with the Osprey only returning to operations months later. In a statement to Breaking Defense today, Air Force Special Operations Command (AFSOC), the Air Force component that operates the CV-22, confirmed that its Osprey operations would be paused after AFSOC Commander Lt. Gen. Michael Conley ordered it for 'all CV-22 flight training operations.' The pause 'allows time and space for us to understand what happened in the most recent event before we accept risk with unknown variables,' according to AFSOC. A spokesperson for AFSOC said an initial investigation showed a 'material failure' precipitated the recent incident, which the Associated Press reported occurred in November. The spokesperson additionally clarified that for AFSOC V-22s, the pause falls short of a full grounding, as restricted flight operations may be permitted under certain circumstances. Representatives for the Navy and Marine Corps did not immediately respond to inquiries regarding the status of their Osprey fleets, though the AP reported the Navy is adhering to the pause. The Osprey is jointly manufactured by Bell and Boeing. Bell did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Boeing referred inquiries to the Pentagon. Ashley Roque and Valerie Insinna contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/v-22-fleet-operations-restricted-following-new-incident/	2024-12-09T09:26:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/cv22_2-scaled.jpg
UK joins US-Bahraini security agreement, as officials push for it to spread further	HMS Penzance leads HMS Shoreham out of Mina Salman Port in Bahrain whilst deployed on Op KIPION on Feb. 1, 2021. (UK MOD) BEIRUT — The United Kingdom has officially become the third member of a security framework with the United States and Bahrain, in what a top Bahraini official said was a step towards a broader 'multilateral framework' of nations 'with an equal interest in delivering stability and prosperity' to the Middle East. 'It is in this context that we will see the United Kingdom being formally invited by the Kingdom of Bahrain and the United States of America to become C-SIPA’s third member this weekend,' Bahraini Foreign Minister Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani told the audience at the Manama Dialogue on Friday, referring to the Comprehensive Security Integration and Prosperity Agreement. The UK parliamentary under-secretary of state for Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan and Pakistan, Hamish Falconer, said on Saturday, 'Only together can we find ways to bring peace and stability to the region. 'That is why, earlier today [Saturday], alongside Bahrain and the US, I was pleased to celebrate the UK's decision to join the showing our resolve to work even more closely with partners in the region to contribute to stability and prosperity,' he said. Falconer said he hoped that the agreement 'will encourage others in the region and beyond' to keep working together toward such goals. C-SIPA was first signed on September 2023 in Washington as a cooperation framework between US and Bahrain. The agreement was relatively short on specifics, but mandated regular meetings and consultations on defense; deeper military, economic and tech ties; and an emphasis on deterring outside aggression, according to a State Department fact sheet. The agreement 'supports the goals of, but is distinct from' other security cooperation agreements like the Abraham Accords, the governments said. The UK's new participation is 'a major step forward in fostering broader regional security integration, bolstering mutual deterrence against external threats, and expanding cooperation in the fields of commerce, science, and technology with like-minded states in support of peace and prosperity in the Middle East,' the State Department said. Bahrain-based strategic expert and political researcher Abdullah Al Junaid told Breaking Defense that the agreement appears to build on significant UK security investments in Bahrain already. Britain has had a permanent naval presence there since 2016, and Bahrain serves as the headquarters of the Gulf Cooperation Council's Combined Maritime Forces, of which the UK is one of 46 members, he noted. 'The agreement will definitely represent a new security framework, and it could aid in fostering a wider or even serves as regional model,' Al Junaid said. Elsewhere at the event, a top Canadian official announced that Ottawa also signed a defense cooperation agreement during the Manama Dialogue, but it was unclear how that agreement relates to C-SIPA. The new arrangements came just days before the Middle East was rocked by the fall of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. The leader's departure sparked hope for many Syrians but also concern among officials in the region and in Washington about the potential for spiraling violence in the region and a resurgence of extremist groups like ISIS.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/uk-joins-us-bahraini-security-agreement-as-officials-push-for-it-to-spread-further/	2024-12-09T09:05:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241209_uk_ships_bahrain_UKMO-scaled-e1733763475719.jpg
ULA expects to be certified for national security launch ‘momentarily’	ULA’s first Vulcan rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex-41 at 2:18 a.m. EST on January 8, 2024.(Photo: United Launch Alliance) SIMI VALLEY, Calif. — United Launch Alliance (ULA) expects to gain Space Force certification for national security payloads within a few months, company CEO Tory Bruno told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. Speaking in California, Bruno said he expects certification 'momentarily,' though he noted that '’momentarily,’ in our world, that means this month, next month, next few months.' He added that no further testing of the Vulcan Centaur will be needed to meet certification, saying the company has met all the requirements from the Pentagon. Two well-executed launches are requisite to achieve certification for carrying payloads under the Space Force's National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program. A January launch was deemed a success, but there was an anomaly during the second flight in October with one of Vulcan’s solid rocket boosters that currently is under investigation. Bruno also expressed confidence that ULA would meet two manifested launches scheduled for early next year for NSSL. Overall, he said, the company has 20 launches manifested for 2025, with 16 Vulcan rockets stored away for use, and no worries that production won’t be able to keep up with demand. The company also has 43 of the Blue Origin BE-4 engines tucked away; current production on those engines is one per week, with two needed to launch the Vulcan, the ULA boss said. While Bruno said he would love to one day have production at a higher rate, he stressed that the current pace is enough for ULA’s current needs. Looking forward, Bruno said he hopes to have 20-30 Vulcan launches a year, about 'half' of which would be for national security. He noted that 'When I got to ULA, I think we were less than a quarter commercial, and the rest was government, and now it's nicely balanced, half and half between the two markets…. It’s healthier.' Bruno declined to comment on reports that ULA is on the market. And while ULA is a partnership between Lockheed Martin and Boeing, the executive said that the current troubles at Boeing — including plans to lay off 10 percent of the workforce — are not impacting the rocket firm, which operates independently. ULA’s largest competitor for military space launch is the Elon Musk-backed SpaceX, and the two companies have a rivalry dating back a decade to when Musk was the upstart trying to break what he described as a 'monopoly' on Pentagon launches. Now, Musk is in the lead, and is poised to have an outsized impact on the incoming Trump administration, both as an unofficial advisor and through his role with the DOGE government efficiency effort. Asked about concerns that Musk could influence ULA’s business prospects, Bruno said that 'It is great that the administration has a real focus on space, because I think it's vitally important to our national security, and I think that that [Musk] will help with that, and help keep a focus there. 'I don't know what he will do. I'll just reiterate that this is not the time when it would be healthy in the market or good for the government to have a monopoly in any of this stuff. There's plenty of work. There's multiple providers. That's the best place for the country to be. I hope he understands that as well.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ula-expects-to-be-certified-for-national-security-launch-momentarily/	2024-12-09T07:00:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/ULA-Vulcan-Certification-Flight_010824-e1704739766586.jpg
Anduril self-funds robot submarine testing to court US customers	Anduril's Dive-XL (Anduril) COSTA MESA, Calif. — Anduril is putting a new autonomous submarine known as Dive-XL through endurance runs off the coast of California, as it seeks to tap into what company executives tell Breaking Defense they see as a growing commitment from the Pentagon to use unmanned underwater vehicles. The first test vehicle — a non-missionized version of the Ghost Shark robotic submarine in development for the Royal Australian Navy — recently wrapped up a voyage where it spent 100 hours underway, a precursor to an upcoming demonstration where the Dive-XL will complete a mission in excess of 1,000 nautical miles while fully submerged. 'That's in the coming months — weeks, if you will. And that'll be the longest that we believe anyone's really done,' Shane Arnott, Anduril’s senior vice president for programs and engineering, said during an interview at the company’s headquarters in Costa Mesa, Calif. So far, the tests around the California coast has allowed Anduril to pick up valuable data that will allow it to optimize Dive XL to operate in diverse undersea environments, where undersea terrain and water salinity could have an impact on performance, Arnott said. 'The coast here is kind of like the Grand Canyon of subsea,' he said. 'It is wild off California. Some of the terrain, it's like Star Wars.' Dive-XL is conceived as a modular uncrewed undersea vehicle (UUV) that can be purchased by both government and commercial customers and outfitted with payloads to serve various missions, whether that’s inspecting offshore oil rigs for energy companies or helping potential military users hunt down enemy submarines. A few sections of the vehicle are standard no matter the customer, including a nose section packed with avionics and sensing equipment that allows for autonomous movement, a tail containing the drive propulsor and a mast on top with communications gear such as acoustic and radio frequency systems. The middle portion of the vehicle, however, can be customized by the customer to house whatever payload they need, and can be configured either as a single extra-large container or up to three smaller ones. The smallest version of the Dive-XL can be housed in a 40 foot shipping container, which allows for it to be transported on roads or via a C-17 cargo plane, Arnott said. From there, it can be made bigger by adding additional payload compartments that stretch the size of the vessel, which Arnott said can be bolted on in a matter of hours. Anduril self-funded the construction of the first Dive-XL, as well as the ongoing demonstrations, due to growing confidence in a US market for the drone, including with the US Navy as a potential customer, executives said. 'We literally had to go to Australia to find an excited customer in 2022 who wanted to do this work,' said Anduril Chief Strategy Officer Chris Brose in an interview on the sidelines of Reagan National Defense Forum on Saturday. 'At the time, the belief was that the United States was not that partner yet, but if we showed them a different way to do this, you know, they might be a partner in the near future.' Although the Navy has shown interest in underwater drones for years through programs like the canceled Snakehead large displacement UUV, industry has struggled to build affordable vehicles capable of autonomously performing missions while withstanding the harsh deep sea environment, leaving some of those efforts to wither on the vine, Brose said. 'They haven't generated a lot of systems that sailors can take out on and under the water and really begin to operate and start to understand capabilities and limitations, experiment with new ways of using them [and] beginning to build out how would we man units to operate these systems,' he said. One opportunity to break into the US market could arrive through a provision in the newly-released National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal 2025, which requires the Navy to conduct a competitive demonstration of extra large and large UUVs. The bill is set to be taken up by the House this week. 'I think that people are starting to realize that these technologies are available and I think that what we have been able to do with the Australian navy has begun to make believers,' Brose said, adding that the Navy will likely need a mix of capabilities to meet the threat. 'We're not trying to get the Navy or US government or anybody to pick us as the sole winner always and forever,' he said. 'We would like to be part of the winner's circle.' One extra-large UUV already in the hands of the Navy is Boeing’s Orca, which was delivered to the service last year. Lessons learned from testing that prototype will inform the development and build of five additional Orca production vehicles, the service said in December 2023. The construction of the first unit, known as XLE-1, is complete, and it is expected to be delivered in early 2025, the service said this month. 'Orca, and other platforms like her, are an important step forward as we drive towards our future hybrid fleet, which is going be composed of manned and unmanned platforms,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said in a statement after touring Boeing’s Orca manufacturing facility in Long Beach, Calif., on Dec. 6. Cost could be a deciding factor for whether the Dive XL finds a home with the Navy, as questions about price continue to dog unmanned programs. Arnott declined to give specifics on the price point for the Dive XL but said it would be available for a fraction of the price of other extra-large UUVs under development. RELATED: Top senators urge Navy to change course on large USV program 'Other companies building XLs are taking a different approach than us that are perhaps a bit more exotic in the capabilities. … They're fundamentally much, much more expensive. A lot of it came down to the philosophy,' he said. 'The problem is about numbers. … If we're going to be effective as the West against what China's doing, we need this many, and it’s a lot.' One advantage to the Dive XL’s design is that it is electric powered, which means that it does not need to surface to allow a diesel engine to 'breathe' and get the air necessary to function, Arnott said. It’s also 'free-flooded with all the electronics housed in protective containers — meaning water can freely flow inside the vessel, as opposed to having pressurized compartments — which helps drive down cost and complexity, he said. Anduril is establishing a 100,000 square foot manufacturing plant in Quonset Point, R.I., that would take on commercial and US government orders and produce up to 'dozens' of Dive XLs annually, the company said in a news release.

The second of three Ghost Sharks ordered as part of the research and development program is currently under production, Arnott said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/anduril-self-funds-robot-submarine-testing-to-court-us-customers/	2024-12-09T05:00:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/2024-DiveXL-Hero-3-scaled-e1733708794177.jpg
Rounding up the big themes from the Reagan Defense Forum [VIDEO]	RNDF 2024 — Every year, the defense community performs a magic trick: lifting the Pentagon up from Virginia and transporting it to the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., for the annual Reagan National Defense Forum. Ok, maybe the Pentagon stays physically still, but it sure does feel like a majority of the key players from DoD, Congress and industry decamp for the weekend to California. The result: Some of the best, and often times more honest, conversations around defense and national security issues. The Breaking Defense team was on hand for this year's event, and you can read all our coverage (with more to come) by clicking here.

‘Wait and see’: As Syrian regime falls, Middle East and US officials watch warily for what comes next	An aerial picture shows members of Syria's White Helmets civil defence service clearing vehicle carcasses and rubble from a street in Aleppo on December 5, 2024.

(OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT and WASHINGTON — As shockwaves from the sudden downfall of the Syrian regime reverberate throughout the Middle East and around the world, government officials in the region and in Washington appear to be taking a hopeful but cautious approach as they weigh what might come next. 'It's really &#8216;wait and see,'' Anwar Gargash, diplomatic advisor to the president of the United Arab Emirates, said at the Manama Dialogue in Bahrain, adding that 'ultimately salvaging the situation' would mean Syria emerges as a 'credible nation-state.' After over a decade of civil war, the end of Assad's regime came shockingly quickly. In just a few weeks, rebel forces swept through the country, and on Sunday morning local time captured Damascus. Per a Russian government statement, Assad had fled the country, and Syrian officials remaining inside the country have issued statements announcing they will work with the victorious forces to develop a new Syrian government. Gargash emphasized that 'it's still a very tense and difficult time in the region,' adding that sudden collapse of the Assad regime 'is a clear indication of political failure, and the destructive nature of conflict and chaos.' (Gargash also reportedly said he didn't know if deposed Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad, whose location is unknown, had fled to the UAE.) Gargash said the UAE was concerned about the future of Syria's territorial integrity, about more broadly 'getting out of this spiral of chaos and violence' since the Arab Spring in 2011, and about the potential rise of extremism in the power vacuum left behind. Saudi Arabia, the most powerful Sunni-dominated nation in the region, said in a statement that it 'expresses its satisfaction with the positive steps that have been taken to ensure the safety of the brotherly Syrian people, stopping the bloodshed, and preserving the institutions and capabilities of the Syrian state.' Qatar announced today that it is 'closely monitoring the developments in Syria, and underscores the necessity of preserving national institutions and the unity of the state to prevent it from descending into chaos,' according to a statement by its Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Qataris called 'upon all parties to engage in dialogue to safeguard the lives of the citizens, protect the national institutions of the state, and ensure a better future for the brotherly Syrian people and fulfill their aspirations for development, stability, and justice. Furthermore, the Ministry affirms Qatar's unwavering support for the Syrian people and their choices.' The ministry of foreign affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain called upon all parties and components of the Syrian people to 'give priority to the best interests of the country and citizens, and to preserve the state’s public institutions and the safety of its vital and economic facilities.' A senior Turkish official, likewise, reportedly said the international community must help the Syrian people rebuild the nation, and keep extremists at bay. The caution was reflected among US officials as well. At the Manama event, Daniel Shapiro, the deputy secretary of defense for the Middle East, said that 'no one should shed any tears over the end of the Assad regime' and said it was the 'direct result' of Assad's 'ongoing atrocities.' But he called on all parties in Syria 'to protect civilians, particularly those from Syria's minority communities, to respect international humanitarian norms and to work to achieve a resolution through an inclusive political settlement, consistent with UN Security Council at Resolution 2254.' Shapiro said the US will maintain its presence in eastern Syria, and 'as we watch developments in Syria change by the minute, we will continue to consult closely with regional partners who are affected by this crisis to support their security needs. Our commitment to them remains stronger than ever.' Speaking at the Reagan National Defense Forum the day before Assad's government collapsed, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said that the regime had been left 'naked' and unprotected by its usual backers: Iran, the armed Lebanese group Hezbollah, and Russia — all of whom have themselves been dramatically weakened by other conflicts. The US, however, has long been concerned about what happens next, and whether extremists could take advantage of the power vacuum. ISIS, for instance, was already attempting to 'reconstitute' itself in the Syrian desert. 'We are going to take steps ourselves directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to make sure that does not happen,' he said. Beyond containing ISIS, Sullivan said the US would work to protect allies in the region, like Israel and Jordan, from a spillover of violence and would do what it could to head of any humanitarian crisis that followed the change of power.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/wait-and-see-as-syrian-regime-falls-middle-east-and-us-officials-watch-warily-for-what-comes-next/	2024-12-08T09:52:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/assad-down-e1733680280194.jpg
$895.2 billion compromise NDAA released, sliding under Fiscal Responsibility Act cap levels	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) RNDF 2024 — The House and Senate today released their compromise version of the National Defense Authorization Act, with a $895.2 billion topline. The newly revealed topline means the NDAA will come in under the congressionally mandated budget caps imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), despite a push in the Senate to go over that number. The Senate had approved a total of $878.4 billion for the Defense Department and $33.4 billion for defense-related activities in the Department of Energy. When combined with an estimated $11.5 billion in non-NDAA defense activities, the total national defense topline sought by the SASC was $923.3 billion — blowing past the $895.2 billion defense bspending cap imposed by the FRA by a significant margin that staffers previously put in the range of $25 billion. In contrast, the House version put forth $883.7 billion, including $849.8 billion for the Pentagon, in numbers designed to squeeze under the FRA topline. Of course, the NDAA is the defense policy bill, not a funding bill. The ultimate topline will be decided by appropriators, and it is unclear when that will come. The expectation among attendees at this year's Reagan National Defense Forum is that the continuing resolution funding the government, which expires on Dec. 20, will be extended to March.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/895-2-billion-compromise-ndaa-released-sliding-under-fiscal-responsibility-act-cap-levels/	2024-12-07T16:17:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/congress_building-scaled-e1711030694393.jpg
Wilkie: ‘No reason’ not to seek Japanese help for ship repair work	The aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75), front, passes the aircraft carrier USS George H. W. Bush (CVN 77) as it departs Norfolk Naval Shipyard after completing a 10-month regularly scheduled extended carrier incremental availability. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Steven Edgar) RNDF 2024 — The Pentagon should seek aid from the United States' allies in Asia for overseas ship repair and maintenance, given the American fleet's requirements and lacking capabilities at home, a senior official on President-elect Donald Trump's transition team said today. 'I think given the scope and the breadth of the Chinese threat — and I mentioned this earlier about knocking down some old Cold War barriers to cooperation — there's absolutely &#8230; no reason why we shouldn't be in shipyards in Japan for repairs, looking to expand that capability,' Wilkie said. Wilkie, who said several times throughout the event that he was not attending in his capacity on the transition team, added that the United States should also seek aid from Sweden for 'their ability to build icebreakers,' without mentioning the trilateral pact President Joe Biden announced several months ago with Canada and Finland, dubbed ICE Pact, which is focused on just that. Wilkie's idea — to outsource US Navy ship repair and maintenance requirements to foreign shipyards — is not new, but it is contentious on Capitol Hill. Lawmakers, particularly those lawmakers who represent constituents who work in American shipyards, are fiercely protective of the lost jobs associated with allowing ships to be serviced in foreign yards. Discussions of outsourcing work also trigger backlash from labor unions, as it did earlier this year when Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro floated such a plan.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/wilkie-no-reason-not-to-seek-japanese-help-for-ship-repair-work/	2024-12-07T14:23:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/210512-N-LX838-1230-scaled-e1659707922643.jpg
Austin announces $1B in new Ukraine aid, warns against abandoning Kyiv	Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin conducts a press briefing at NATO headquarters, Brussels, Belgium, June 16, 2023. (US Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders) RNDF 2024 — With major question marks lingering about the incoming Trump administration's strategy for Ukraine, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin used his last speech at the annual Reagan National Defense Forum event to tout the importance of Kyiv’s success and unveil a new weapons package. 'This administration has made its choice. So has a bipartisan coalition in Congress,' Austin told an audience today at the defense gathering. 'The next administration must make its own choice. But from this library, from this podium, I am confident that President [Ronald] Reagan would have stood on the side of Ukraine, American security, and human freedom.' There is much speculation about President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to support Kyiv, as he has publicly praised Russian President Vladimir Putin in the past and on the campaign trail called to end the war quickly. That uncertainty has NATO members bracing for uncertainty over how Trump will approach the Ukraine war and if he could force a peace deal that would benefit Putin long term. (Hours before Austin's speech, Trump was in Paris and met with Ukrainian president Vladimir Zelenskyy.) Since the election, the Biden administration has rushed to provide as much aid as possible to Ukraine, including an announcement from Austin today of a new $1 billion Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative package with more drones, rockets and sustainment assistance. 'We understand that Putin’s assault on Ukraine is a warning. As I said in October in Kyiv, we are seeing ‘a sneak preview of a world built by tyrants and thugs — a chaotic, violent world carved into spheres of influence; a world where bullies trample their smaller neighbors; and a world where aggressors force free people to live in fear,’' Austin said in prepared remarks. 'So, we can continue to stand up to the Kremlin,' Austin added. 'Or we can let Putin have his way — and condemn our children and grandchildren to live in a world of chaos and conflict.' With concerns about Trump's plans permeating European capitals, there is a sense that NATO nations are scrambling to ensure Ukraine's survival. But they're having to be circumspect about it. Just two weeks ago at the annual Halifax International Security Forum, European defense leaders opted out of the doom and gloom scenario of Trump abandoning Ukraine or NATO itself, instead putting on a brave face when the topic was repeatedly broached. Tobias Lindner — Germany’s Minister of State at the Federal Foreign Office and the Coordinator of Transatlantic Cooperation with the US — declined to offer up a 'self-fulfilling prophecy' that could hamper Ukraine. 'My prediction would be that any precondition to any agreement from the Ukrainian side would at least include security guarantees and a mechanism on accountability, both on war crimes as well as in reconstruction and on security guarantees,' Linder said. From his vantage point, the Netherlands Chief of Defence Gen. Onno Eichelsheim said other NATO members need to prepare to 'fill in the gaps' if Washington pulls back its support from Ukraine and the alliance. 'It is, once again, our continent. So, it's our safety first, and that's why, that's what we have to take into account, European nations, what we have to do, how we're going to deal with this,' he told Breaking Defense during an interview on the sidelines of the Halifax forum on Nov. 23. 'The US has been the best partner in this forever. So, I hope it will continue like this. But if not, then we have to have the discussion in Europe, how to pick it up.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/austin-announces-1b-in-new-ukraine-aid-warns-against-abandoning-kyiv/	2024-12-07T13:56:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/austin3-scaled-e1707770033173.jpg
Trump’s threat to abandon CHIPS Act ‘horrific idea’ Raimundo says	Gina M. Raimondo, United States Secretary of Commerce, speaks onstage during the first day of the Democratic National Convention at the United Center on August 19, 2024 in Chicago, Illinois. (Alex Wong/Getty Images) RNDF 2024 — President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to abandon the CHIPS Act would be a 'horrific,' 'reckless' act that would only benefit China, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo warned today. During the campaign, Trump criticized the CHIPS Act, which seeks to fund domestic production of semiconductor chips that are now primarily produced in Taiwan, and indicated a desire to kill the effort. Speaker of the House Rep. Mike Johnson had said the House would seek to follow through, but later walked it back. Raimondo, who is the lead on implementing CHIPS, didn’t hold back when asked about Trump’s threat during today’s Reagan National Defense Forum event in Simi Valley, Calif. 'It’s a horrific idea. It’s a reckless idea,' she said. 'Sometimes you say things on the stump, and I can only hope that was something to be said on the stump and won’t be acted out. 'It is untenable that the United States of America buys 100 percent of leading-edge chips used in fighter jets, AI technology, nuclear simulation, drones — a hundred percent of those chips are made in Taiwan and tested in China. Do something about it. Fix it. That’s what we’re doing, that’s what the CHIPS Act is doing. If you want to hold us accountable, say go faster, be clearer, do a better job, fine, I’ll listen to that. But if you want to say undo it, that’s not right. It’s reckless, its not fair, and it makes us less safe.' Part of Trump’s argument was to replace the CHIPS Act, which Raimondo said has allocated $35 billion in funding, with tariffs on chips coming in from abroad. While stating that tariffs 'have their place,' the commerce secretary emphasized that they are 'not a substitute' for what CHIPS is trying to accomplish. 'We need investments in research and development, in workforce, in infrastructure, so we can be great in the US,' she said. 'It’s a race. Tug on [China’s] shirt where you can to slow them down, but you better just be prepared to run faster.' 'Export controls matter. Sanctions matter. Holding China back matters. But it’s just a speed bump,' she continued. 'We are not gonna beat China by trying to slow them down. We’re going to beat them by going faster. So invest in America, invest in our technology, invest in our companies, invest in our infrastructure, invest in our talent, and do it with our allies.' Coincidentally, Raimondo’s appearance came days after Intel’s CEO was forced to resign by the board of directors. Intel has been a leading focus of CHIPS support, leading to a question about whether that is a blow to the efforts from the Biden administration. For her part, Raimondo conceded that 'There’s no secret Intel has struggled,' but said 'I believe they will come out of this' and be successful as a chip producer in the long run.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/trumps-threat-to-abandon-chips-act-horrific-idea-raimundo-says/	2024-12-07T12:52:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/raimondo-scaled-e1733599464537.jpg
NATO to launch new cyber center by 2028: Official	Navy Commander Kevin Blenkhorn, a computer sciences professor at the U.S. Naval Academy, works with his Joint Services teammates during the U.S. Army’s ‘Cyber Center of Excellence’, Fort Gordon in Augusta, Ga., hosted a multi-service ‘NetWar’ to show, and build, cyber Warrior capabilities Tuesday, June 10. (Georgia Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Tracy J. Smith) NATO EDGE 2024 — In order for the alliance to be better equipped at dealing with cyber threats, NATO is in the process of standing up a new cyber center — to go online by 2028 — that will meld parts of its various cyber entities into one, a NATO official told Breaking Defense this week. 'This center will allow us to better combine the way in which we are monitoring the threat, the way we are controlling the attack surface of the enterprise [and] the way we are managing the risk,' Stefano Piermarocchi, head of the Enterprise Cyber Risk Management portfolio within NATO’s chief information office, said in an interview. 'So it's a way to facilitate the conduction of certain processes and make sure they are at the pace of the security for the enterprise itself.' Coined the NATO Integrated Cyber Defense Center, the joint entity will combine NATO's Cyber Security Center, Cyber Operations Center and Cyber Threat Analysis Branch, as well as parts of the CIO’s office, Piermarocchi said. He added that the center plans to engage industry partners from across the alliance as well. 'The idea of the center is to facilitate the dialogue with the industry, and to be sure that we're able to speed up certain processes, to increase our ability to communicate &#8230; or to have a really more concrete dialogue with nations,' he said. Brig. Gen. Sam Raeves, who serves as the assistant chief of staff of J6 Cyberspace at NATO, also expressed the benefits of standing up such a center, saying that combining these existing cyber entities with industry will create 'cohesion' in terms of cyber operations. 'Putting all those elements together, instead of having them dispersed all over the alliance, it will really improve the situation and the cohesion of information sharing,' Reeves said during an interview on the sidelines of the NATO Edge 2024 conference. There will be multiple centers located across NATO countries, Piermarocchi said. But the headquarters will be in Mons, Belgium, NATO CIO Manfred Boudreaux-Dehmer, said during a panel at the event. 'It will be set up as a physical colocation space where people can sit together if an incident happens, people are working together real time,' Boudreaux-Dehmer said. 'That's a major, major building block in getting us working together more closely and supporting each other in this colocation place.' Related: US, allies warn of Russian cyber sabotage aimed at disrupting aid to Ukraine Though the idea to stand up such a center was approved by the alliance, Piermarocchi said the center likely won’t be stood up until 2028 as more logistics like hiring need to be sorted out among the 32 countries. 'There is a need to recruit other people, to have other people on board, because this is one of the challenges that we have, we cannot do all the work that the center has to do, including, for example, 24/7 capabilities without hiring additional resources,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-to-launch-new-cyber-center-by-2028-official/	2024-12-06T13:27:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/1398028-scaled-e1660682409929.jpg
Lockheed Martin shrinks F-35 simulator to squeeze more units into secure facilities	A pilot sits in an F-35 simulator. (Lockheed Martin) I/ITSEC 2024 — Lockheed Martin generally reserves plenty of floorspace at defense shows, but this year at I/ITSEC the aerospace behemoth is showing off a development in its simulation capabilities designed to save space as much as possible: a smaller, leaner F-35 simulator. The point, according to Lockheed’s Erik 'Rock' Etz, is to fit more of the simulators in secure facilities — the only places where F-35 simulators can be housed due to the plane’s still-sensitive nature — enabling more dynamic joint training. 'The MMRT [Modified Mission Rehearsal Trainer] reduces the overall hardware footprint of the platform and increases the options for high-fidelity pilot training,' said Etz, the company’s director of Strategy and Business Development. 'You can get more of these devices inside of a SCIF [sensitive compartmented information facility], which affords the simulating of larger missions. In many cases this now means the ability to conduct a four ship versus eight ship training event,' which was not possible with the previous generation simulators. Lockheed began an internal R&amp;D project to develop the first of this newer, smaller simulator in 2021 that evolved into the current MMRT configuration. 'Growing the capacity for a greater number of sims creates the option to link more devices together. Recently at a final mission simulation at Luke AFB it was demonstrated that it is possible to datalink 12 devices together,' Etz said. 'Other than offering more sims in the same space, the MMRT also presents additional capability. The result is a holistic training capability.' Etz said Lockheed initially shrank the MMRT for the US Air Force but the 'requirement will undoubtedly grow with the export customers of the aircraft.' (Nineteen countries currently fly the plane.) RELATED: Romania signs LOA to secure entry to F-35 club Simulated training for the F-35 can be far more complex than for other airframes, as much of the fifth-generation jet’s selling point is not dogfighting, but battle management. The aircraft is sometimes given the nickname of the 'quarterback in the sky' as it can accept data from multiple sources — including satellites — and then hand targeting and other cues off to other aircraft, air defense batteries, ground forces and naval vessels. It’s a role that one Lockheed official said 'markedly increases the training burden.' At a Red Flag exercise more than two years ago, one of the F-35 pilots described the near sensory overload of being in the cockpit, saying 'we have so much situational awareness in the F-35 and there is a lot of information coming at you. From the radar and the sensors and the radio chatter is going crazy.' Simulators can also stand in for live training exercises, which may become more relevant with reportedly low mission-capability rates for the actual airframes. 'These stresses and complications with training are inevitably going to fall even harder on some of our export customers,' said one former US Air Force pilot now working at Lockheed, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'A bunch of these countries that have now signed up for the F-35 that are right on the border with Russia — or at least close to it: Poland, Finland, Norway, the Czech Republic, etc. Upping the game in the simulator business is probably the only way of keeping their pilots up to speed while the programmatic problems with the aircraft are sorted out,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/lockheed-martins-shrinks-f-35-simulator-to-squeeze-more-units-into-secure-facilities/	2024-12-06T12:56:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241206_F35_sim_LOCKHEED-e1733514776351.jpg
House intel’s Himes: Chinese invasion of Taiwan in 2027 would be ‘really dumb’	Chinese president Xi Jinping and a PLA Navy honor guard await the King of Bahrain (Photo by Feng Li/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee said today he doesn't buy that China will make a move on Taiwan in 2027, for several reasons, including his contention that it seems it would be 'really dumb.' 'I'm skeptical, frankly, of that statement, which is everywhere, you know, &#8216;Xi [Jinping] has ordered the PLA [People's Liberation Army] to be ready to invade Taiwan in 2027,'' Rep. Jim Himes told the audience a Brookings Institute and CSIS event. 'First of all, it may not happen.' 'It also feels like a really dumb way to go, right? You know?' he said later. 'There are islands that are claimed by Taiwan that are two miles off the coast of China, right? You could implement a blockade. You know, what? If you invade Taiwan, what happens? A. You may lose. B. You may reduce the place to smoking rubble, in which case, what have you really achieved economically? You know, you'd have incredible brain drain. You've risked a nuclear war with the United States, I presume. You destabilize the region for a generation.' The year 2027 has been referred to as the Davidson Window, named so after then-head of US Indo-Pacific Command Adm. Phil Davidson testified before lawmakers in 2021 that Beijing might try to annex Taiwan within six years. In 2023, CIA Director Bill Burns reiterated that timeline, saying US intelligence showed Xi had given the Chinese army a 2027 deadline to be ready to invade should he give the order. 'Now, that does not mean that he's decided to conduct an invasion in 2027 or any other year, but it's a reminder of the seriousness of his focus and his ambition,' Burns said then. Last month, the head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse, said China did appear to be on track to meet Xi's 2027 preparedness goal, but it wasn't clear if Beijing had thought through a long-term invasion plan. Himes, who is briefed on classified American intelligence assessments, said today that while he wouldn't flatly 'reject' the contention that China could invade in the next three years, it would be impossible to know if China had achieved the 'objective' to be ready. And it probably wouldn't work out well if they tested it. 'You know, just ask Vladimir Putin how predictable invasions are, even of neighboring countries, much less across 100 miles of blue water,' he said. Himes said the 2027 warnings are the 'kind of thing that hawks in the House say and I'm supposed to be really scared by that, rather than by saying, &#8216;Okay, well how do we take the steps to make that eventuality less likely?' 'And those steps can range from &#8216;Let's keep or really accelerate deterrence by arming Taiwan' to &#8216;Let's stress those areas where there are deep common interests with the Chinese to make that less likely,'' he said.

(SKIFTECH) I/ITSEC 2024 — Twenty years ago, the Ukrainian firm SKIFTECH focused on battlefield tech, but only the kind of weapons weekenders would shoot each other with for fun: paintball guns. But in 2014, the same year 'Russian-backed separatist' invaded eastern Ukraine, the company pivoted to the real thing, turning itself into a high-tech military simulation and training specialist. The company’s biggest customers are in Ukraine, but most recently the company has expanded into the US, according to Mikhail Obod, chief of the US branch. It’s a small footprint for now – just a dozen employees stateside — but Obod said the firm expects to grow here, potentially with the help of a US Army contract the company says is in the pipeline. Through its work, the company said it sought to address what it sees as flaws in current generation training simulations, including by failures to account for a high level of casualties within the first 30 minutes of a fight to a dearth of more detailed after-action feedback for soldiers. Obod claimed that the 'final results are that the current Ukraine commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi, has told us that units completing the entire one month-long course utilizing the latest SKIFTECH hardware and methods suffer 30 percent fewer casualties.' Obod said the training system draws on the wide body of battlefield experience and the years of data accumulated since 2014. 'Rather it is our experience in this automated simulation technology — the ability to engage simulations in operating against drones, against aircraft and against ambush scenarios' he explained. Since the war in Ukraine became locked into a positional dynamic with limited movement in the lines, 'the ‘trench warfare’ dimension has also been embedded into the simulation software modules.' These real-world interactions are embedded in the software modules. Simulations include factoring in all kinds of weapons from tanks to small arms to drones – even hand grenades and anti—personnel mines. Obod also claimed the company’s tech is 'considerably more accurate' than other laser-based systems, built on a new 2024 design. 'It is not a two-dimensional training regime where if you are hit and there is a ‘beep’ that it means you are automatically dead,' he said. Instead, the detectors worn by servicemen and those used on vehicles are 'layered and graduated. A ‘hit’ registered by the laser sensor is not necessarily scored as a kill. The system calibrates the weapon used, the range, the velocity, the ballistic protection of the target, etc. to then rate the level of damage inflicted.' Obod said the company added Stinger MANPADs to a simulated environment in just five months 'not five years.' This truncated fast-track incorporation of real battlefield data to rapid prototyping to fielded product cycle is a competitive advantage for SKIFTECH. What the company lacks at present is a diversified portfolio. The company’s current contracted profile is a 90 percent Ukraine customer database, Obod said. 'We would like to sell to other nations outside of Ukraine,' he said, adding the company does work in a couple European countries and as far away as Malaysia and Ecuador. In the end, 'we are producing training using laser-based simulations which means not wasting a live round, which for tanks, armored vehicles, artillery is expensive. Our system does not conduct training against a target but against a simulated live-action adversary.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ukraines-skiftech-went-from-paintball-to-battlefield-simulation/	2024-12-06T11:32:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241206_skiftech_soldier_lasers_HANDOUT-e1733513163668.jpg
Denmark and Sweden sign $2.5 billion CV90 IFV joint procurement for over 200 vehicles	A CV-90 takes a shot. (BAE Systems Hägglunds) BELFAST — The Nordic nations of Denmark and Sweden have signed a 25 billion SEK ($2.5 billion) joint procurement contract with BAE Systems for the acquisition of 205 new Combat Vehicle 90 — CV9035 MKIIIC — Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFVs). Sweden’s Defence Materiel Administration (FMV) and the Danish Ministry of Defence Acquisition and Logistics Organisation (DALO) inked the deal today with BAE Systems Hagglunds, the CV90 manufacturer. Denmark will receive the majority of vehicles — 115 in all. Sweden will acquire 50 to replace vehicles supplied to Ukraine, while the remaining 40 units are bound for Kyiv 'and financed through previous donations from Denmark and Sweden,' said the Swedish Ministry of Defence (MoD) in a statement. 'These investments will enable more Swedish combat vehicles to make Europe — and particularly Ukraine — safer,' added Pål Jonson, Sweden’s Minister of Defence. 'The Swedish defence industry is a unique and strong asset to our national and collective defence capabilities.' In a supporting statement from BAE Systems, Chief of the Royal Danish Army Maj. Gen. Peter Boysen said, 'The infantry fighting vehicle is an essential component of the heavy brigade we are currently building. The 115 new vehicles will significantly enhance Denmark's contribution to collective security and international operations.' Boysen added that with '44 existing vehicles, we will have a total of 159 vehicles, providing us with substantial strength.' Stockholm also noted that the CV90 has proven 'highly valued' in Ukraine, highlighting the platform’s 'high level' of protection and frontline success, including saving 'soldiers’ lives in direct hits.' At a capability level, the new CV9035 MKIIC is fitted with 'the latest turret solution and gives its crew improved situational awareness and increased mobility, protection and effectiveness against enemy targets,' added the Swedish MoD. The new turret will be built to the same standard as that under development for the Netherlands as part of its CV90 mid-life upgrade program, according to BAE Systems. In Sweden’s case, the latest order builds off a prior contract signed between FMV and BAE Systems in May for new CV9035 MkIIIC vehicles and integrated logistic support. In October, Breaking Defense first reported that Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden had entered talks to evaluate joint procurement of a future IFV. Should discussions progress as anticipated, the new platform could be acquired in the 2030 to 2040 timeframe. Each nation currently fields the CV90 and, at the time, Commander of the Swedish Army Maj. Gen. Jonny Lindfors told Breaking Defense it would be a 'natural development to buy more of them,' although other systems are under consideration. Across 17 different variants, 1,900 CV90 vehicles have been ordered to date and it has been selected by 10 European nations, according to BAE Systems. Alongside operations in Ukraine, it has previously been deployed in Afghanistan and Liberia.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/denmark-and-sweden-sign-2-5-billion-cv90-ifv-joint-procurement-for-over-200-vehicles/	2024-12-06T09:32:31-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/230131_cv90_bae_sweden.jpg
Bomber fleet size target ‘probably’ needs to be reassessed: Air Force Global Strike chief	A B-21 Raider conducts flight tests, which includes ground testing, taxiing, and flying operations, at Edwards Air Force Base, California. (Air Force photo) WASHINGTON — Amid a high tempo of operations and rising threats throughout the globe, the head of Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC) suggested officials should take another look at a years-old, long-term target for fielding a fleet of 220 bombers. 'We have 141 bombers in the inventory between the B-1, the B-2 and the B-52,' Air Force Gen. Thomas Bussiere said during a discussion hosted by the Mitchell Institute on Thursday. 'The demand signal for the bombers is greater than any time I’ve seen in my career, across the fabric of every geographic combatant command.' The Air Force plans to retire the B-1 and B-2 as the new B-21 Raider comes online, and extend the life of the B-52 via a fleetwide overhaul. The service has stated it will buy at least 100 B-21s, which would be complemented by the updated fleet of 76 newly-designated B-52Js. According to Bussiere, previous Air Force officials have stated that once the long-range strike force drops to a two-bomber fleet, the service should aim for an inventory of 220 bombers. However, the general then said officials should consider reassessing that number, especially given the high demand for the bomber fleet from places like Europe to the Middle East. 'That data, and that fleet size probably needs to be reevaluated based on the world as we see it today,' Bussiere said. Though he did not recommend a specific number for the fleet or explicitly call to increase it, Bussiere said in a statement to Breaking Defense that '[a] bomber force of 220 has been a number suggested in the public sphere for a while. The number we field will be guided by the fact that no other U.S. ally or partner has an active bomber force, and our bombers provide the backbone of our military’s flexible global strike capability, which is also the foundation of our extended deterrence umbrella for our allies and partners. 'The number of bombers in the fleet will be informed by the threat, the National Defense Strategy, the budget, deployment/employment demand signals, and most importantly decisions by policy makers,' he continued. 'We will get at least 100 B-21s, modernize the B-52J and retire B-2s and B-1s as new platforms come online and are Fully Operationally Capable. We must have the number required to provide both strategic and conventional deterrence, and if our deterrence fails, we must have the number required to deliver a decisive response.' Upping the bomber force would likely entail buying more B-21s beyond the service’s minimum target of 100. However, officials this year testified that a decision to increase the Raider’s procurement won’t be needed for another decade, at which point an alternative could be available. The Air Force has limited resources to increase the Raider buy, though lawmakers, including incoming Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), have called for doubling the bomber’s procurement. And when asked, Air Force officials are hardly coy about wanting more, including by speeding up its current production rate so that more bombers are built in the short term. 'I think most national security professionals would look at the B-21 and the current production schedule and go, ‘We might want to consider evaluating whether or not we can accelerate that based on the age of the B-2 and the B-1 fleet.’ That's a prudent question in light of the threats that are out there and the demand signals for bombers,' Bussiere said. 'Normally, the answer is, &#8216;who would not want more long-range strike platforms?'' he added. 'And it really gets down to the fundamentals of the budget. It's a service budget issue, it's a department budget issue. It's a national budget issue. So I'm a firm believer that if the nation decides they need something, they'll invest in it and invest in it in an agile way to make something happen.' Northrop builds the bomber at its Palmdale, Calif., production facility. Buessiere said that if officials decide to ramp up production of the bomber, 'there’s some capability growth within the current complex.' Ultimately deferring to acquisition professionals, the general added that if the Raider’s production was supercharged in the near term, 'more than likely, it would require opening up another production complex if the nation decides to do that.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/bomber-fleet-size-target-probably-needs-to-be-reassessed-air-force-global-strike-chief/	2024-12-06T08:27:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/B-21-e1733497979392.jpg
BAE betting on AI to train imagery analysts	The Space Force sees digitization as fundamental to all of its operations. (Getty images) I/ITSEC — At this year’s I/ITSEC show, it was hard to miss that everyone seemingly wants in on the artificial intelligence craze. It’s easy to see why: simulation, after all, is ultimately about managing data, with machine learning or AI at the heart of those efforts. So it’s no surprise that companies are touting what they can do in the artificial intelligence space. One such firm is BAE Systems, which has zeroed in on the use of AI for image processing as a growth market. 'With the advent of so many unmanned airborne combat system concepts there are people who will declare ‘the last fighter pilot has already been born,’' Benjamin Kennedy, an account manager for BAE’s electronic systems division, said on the show floor. 'In the same vein of future requirements, we look at the functionality of our system for processing imagery we like to say that the last imagery analyst has been born.' High-resolution imagery, whether it is from commercial-based satellite systems or from airborne platforms &#8211; both manned and unmanned &#8211; can be processed at a speed far beyond that of that conducted by the individual imagery analyst using BAE’s SOCET GXP geospatial intelligence software, according to Kennedy. With this software users and operators can rapidly identify, analyze, and extract information on specific locations or installations to a level that supports action-oriented decision-making. Kennedy claimed that the package has been a successful property for BAE, and been provided to over 65 countries. There are several aspects to its functionality that make it attractive to numerous clients. One is that the program can run in a server-based environment or on a desktop. All the system requires is adequate graphics processing hardware. Secondly, the SOCET package is also not limited to imagery processing solutions. It has 'a myriad of functions, which include a learning process of how to convert imagery data to intelligence data and then form that processing imagery into simulator data,' per the company. And thirdly, the entire system can be operated on unclassified hardware as the software itself is also unclassified. 'This has supported situations where an allied or friendly was able to input commercial imagery and/or their own self-generated or collected data and use the SOCET software to analyze it in real time, said Kennedy. 'In this way we have been able assist our friends and allies' in certain theatres of operation. Data provided by a customer can be put through a long list of analytical process and moreover the type of formats of imagery that can be processed is not limited. The SOCET GXP program supports literally 'thousands of different sensors. The customer also does not have to purchase any minimum number of licenses or copies of the software – customers can have as few as two copies or thousands or any number in between.' 'The way to think about SOCET package is to look at it as the main weapon of an imagery analyst. It is to that analyst what the Smith and Wesson M-4 carbine is to a Marine infantryman,' explained Kennedy who is himself a former Marine. 'SOCET is that analyst’s version of an M-4.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/bae-betting-on-ai-to-train-imagery-analysts/	2024-12-06T07:35:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_map_ship_movements_GettyImages-875327078-scaled.jpg
Army’s new compact electronic warfare kit goes on everything from backpacks to balloons	A soldier tests out the Army's new TLS-Manpack electronic warfare kit. (US Army photo) FORT BELVOIR, Va. — The first two combat brigades to get the Army’s long-awaited backpack-portable electronic warfare kit are already experimenting with new tactics, officers and NCOs told reporters here on Tuesday. Formally known as the TLS-BCT (Terrestrial Layer System — Brigade Combat Team) Manpack, the system fills a longtime gap in the Army's digital arsenal: It gives frontline troops on foot the ability to detect enemy radio transmissions, pinpoint their sources for precision strike and, in some configurations, jam the signal. Such electronic warfare capabilities are more critical than ever on battlefields dominated by radio-controlled drones. 'I think that some of the soldiers were surprised by how they were able to use it at JRTC [the Joint Readiness Training Center] to identify enemy drones and things like that,' said Lt. Col. John Cross, the Army’s product manager for the system. 'It kind of has opened the minds of the commanders as to what's possible.' 'One of the units was able to actually take one of these systems [and] put it up on an aerostat' — that is, a tethered balloon — to expand its field of view beyond what they could scan from ground level, Cross continued. 'That's not something that we necessarily told them to do, that's something that they came up with. &#8230; We take that feedback and then we share it across the Army.' That approach embodies the Army’s new emphasis on what it calls 'transformation in contact': issuing new kit to combat units early on, often while it’s still in development, and incorporating real soldiers’ feedback on how it works in field conditions, or doesn’t, so improvements can be made. 'We're using this user feedback to inform our tactics, techniques and procedures … to understand how we need to drive new software development &#8230; [and] to drive our new requirements' for future systems, Cross said. Based on such soldier feedback, the TLS-Manpack program is already streamlining how it distributes software updates. Rapid updates are important for any modern weapons system, but especially so for electronic warfare: Combat experience in Ukraine has shown that a new technique can emerge, be employed to devastating effect against enemy drones or other radio-dependent systems, and then be countered, all within a matter of weeks. 'The evolving nature of the threat … is going to require agility and flexibility we haven’t seen,' said Brig. Gen. Ed Barker, the Army’s program executive officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, and Sensors (PEO-IEW&amp;S). 'Whatever kit we’re providing to [units] now, it can’t be the same in two or three years. &#8230; We have to constantly evolve, based on all this feedback.' RELATED: Drones, jammers and big balloons: In Morocco, Army’s Multi-Domain Task Force tests EW tech But traditionally, the Army has distributed software updates for sensitive equipment by periodically sending compact discs full of new code to unit headquarters, with soldiers or contractors then bringing in each item to update it. The TLS-Manpack program started with that 'older model [of] let’s ship a CD,' Cross said, but 'we moved away from that.' Soldiers can now download software updates from an online portal, using the military’s secure but unclassified NIPR network, he said, then load the updates onto removable media to take back to their units. The service is even looking at the possibility of distributing updates 'over the air,' via wireless networks, the way commercial companies like Apple and Tesla do, although the military needs greater security for its software. 'We're moving toward the Tesla model,' Cross said. 'We're not there yet.' Meanwhile, as the program continues to evolve, production is kicking into higher gear. The first set of six TLS-Manpack systems went to a brigade of 10th Mountain Division in August, followed by a second set to a brigade of the 101st Airborne by the end of October. 'Now,' Cross said, 'we are on pace to field one brigade a month in FY [fiscal year] 25 and two brigades a month in FY26.' A soldier tests out the Army's new TLS-Manpack electronic warfare kit, showing the backpack configuration. (US Army photo) After years of experiments with different electronic-warfare systems and small-scale, ad hoc deployments abroad, the Army launched a formal competition in early 2023 and picked CACI Mastodon to build a prototype TLS Manpack with a $1.5 million award last September, followed by a $99.99 million award this July to begin production. 'In just under 18 months, we were able to buy a commercial off-the-shelf solution developed by CACI Mastodon and begin to field that,' Cross said, using streamlined processes such as Middle Tier Acquisition and Other Transaction Authority. The TLS-Manpack was designed, as its name implies, to be operated by a single soldier wearing it like a backpack. But the system is flexible and configurable enough to be used in other ways, explained assistant product manager Capt. Austin Knighton. Soldiers can strip it down to just the basic sensors — able to detect enemy transmissions but not to actively jam them — and get a handheld configuration weighing less than five pounds. They can also add additional sensors, extra batteries and electronic attack capabilities, with the maxed-out configuration weighing over 30 pounds — best suited for use at a static observation post or on a vehicle (or, apparently, in some cases, from a balloon). In a typical configuration, one Army sergeant told reporters, TLS-Manpack can operate for 72 hours without going back to base for more batteries, while being 'easily half the weight' of the portable systems the service has tried out in the past. A single system can operate on its own, but it can also share data over Army tactical networks. That lets multiple Manpacks work together to triangulate the precise coordinates of an enemy transmitter; future upgrades should let it share data and even take temporary control of other Army EW systems as a well. The Manpack's data can also flow back over the network to Army command posts, populating digital map displays — such as the widely-used Tactical Assault Kit (TAK) — with real-time intelligence on hostile, neutral, and friendly signals. 'It integrates very well with the TAK family of software, [so] this is very easy for the commander to understand,' instead of the data only being intelligence to EW specialists, the sergeant said. 'We’re getting a lot of capability out of this.' Manpack, in turn, is just one piece of a much larger renaissance in US Army electronic warfare. The Terrestrial Layer System, which combines EW and signals intelligence capabilities, is also being developed in much larger, vehicle-mounted versions: TLS-BCT for Brigade Combat Teams and the even more powerful TLS-EAB for divisions, corps, and other 'echelons above brigade.' Meanwhile, the much-delayed airborne Multi-Function Electronic Warfare (MFEW) system is set to enter service as a pod for Grey Eagle drones in 2026. Electronic warfare 'requires a layered approach,' said Brig Gen. Barker. 'There’s not just a single silver bullet to solve the problem.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/armys-new-compact-electronic-warfare-kit-goes-on-everything-from-backpacks-to-balloons/	2024-12-06T04:58:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Army-TLS-Manpack-8771417.jpg
‘Campaign mindset’: Pentagon unveils new, formal strategy to defend against rising unmanned threats	A senior Observer Coach/Trainer fires a Dronebuster Electronic Warfare System at the Counter Unmanned Aircraft System Training in the Rotational Unit Bivouac Area on January 30, 2020. (U.S. Army photo by PFC Gower Liu, 11th ACR Public Affairs) WASHINGTON — Citing the growing threat of unmanned systems in the air, on land and at sea, the Pentagon today unveiled a new, whole-of-department strategy to shore up counter-drone defenses in the near term and to more thoroughly design future forces to fend off autonomous threats. 'These threats are changing how wars are fought,' the Pentagon said in the strategy's announcement. 'By producing a singular Strategy for Countering Unmanned Systems, the Secretary and the Department are orienting around a common understanding of the challenge and a shared approach to addressing it.' The strategy is classified, but its broad strokes were outlined in an unclassified fact sheet provided by the Pentagon today. Calling for a 'campaign mindset,' the document sets out five pillars, or 'strategic ways,' that the DoD intends to tackle the unmanned threat across different domains at home and abroad. According to the fact sheet, those are: Pointing to conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East as well as an attack on an American installation in Jordan that killed three American servicemembers in January, the DoD recognizes an 'increasingly urgent and seemingly enduring threat that unmanned systems are posing to our people, to our facilities and to our assets overseas,' a senior defense official told reporters in a briefing today ahead of the strategy’s release. 'The real sort of emphasis of the strategy is to say, as we're taking on the effects of unmanned systems, we need to think about this temporally,' the official said, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In the near term, the official said the strategy will focus on boosting counter-drone capabilities with 'a particular emphasis on detection,' including by ensuring installations have the active and passive defenses they need. Looking ahead, the strategy intends to 'mak[e] sure that we're developing and designing our future force to reduce vulnerabilities and increase resilience to threats,' the official said. As other Pentagon officials explained at a recent set of counter-UAS tests dubbed Falcon Peak, convened in the wake of hundreds of drone incursions over DoD installations on US soil, the drone threat can look very different in the homeland — not just because systems in question tend to be small, hobbyist drones, but also because policy constraints can limit commanders’ ability to respond. RELATED: ‘It’s not a war zone’: Pentagon ponders policy shifts to protect homeland bases from drones The new strategy is 'really trying to make sure that we are making a conscious effort to mitigate the threat in the homeland today in the unique ways in which it manifests in the homeland,' a second DoD official said during the briefing. Going forward, a formal part of the strategy will also ensure commanders and personnel are properly trained and equipped for the homeland defense task, including by educating them on authorities and improving interagency coordination, the official said. According to the first official, the ongoing initiatives like the Replicator 2 program are 'part and parcel with this effort.' Noting that the appropriate type of counter-drone capabilities depends on the operational environment, a third official who spoke with reporters today said that scaling up newer solutions like directed energy 'is probably closer to the mid- to long-term' to give officials more confidence in the systems’ performance and then integrate them into a layered defensive approach. RELATED: Pentagon homes in on counter-drone tech in Replicator 2 initiative With the reins of the Pentagon set to switch hands with the incoming Trump administration, yet another official said that 'any successor to [Defense] Secretary [Lloyd] Austin will undoubtedly have to deal with this challenge, and I think what we're seeing now is really just the beginning.' The strategy, therefore, is meant to 'lay a foundation for the Department to be able to get after this threat in a way that will be successful and get ahead of the evolution that we're seeing.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/campaign-mindset-pentagon-unveils-new-formal-strategy-to-defend-against-rising-unmanned-threats/	2024-12-05T13:45:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/counter-drone-scaled-e1733433091935.jpg
Saab unveils new counter-drone trainer, taking lessons from Ukraine	Sweden's Saab displays a new anti-drone training module at I/ITSEC 2024. (Reuben F. Johnson / Breaking Defense) I/ITSEC 2024 — Swedish defense firm Saab is stepping further in the realm of counter-drone capabilities with a new c-UAS training system, unveiled here at I/ITSEC in Orlando. The new trainer is designed to connect to Saab’s existing EXCON live tactical training system and involves putting a multiple integrated laser engagement system (MILES)-type sensor array on a UAV so that it can simulate attacking and being attacked during training. 'Designed to replicate aerial threats from opposing forces, the Saab UAV trainer, utilising an ‘off-the-shelf’ UAV platform, can be engaged and defeated whilst capturing troop activity on video and is able to drop ‘virtual munitions’ on soldiers on the ground,' the company said in a press release this week. What is accomplished for very little expense is a system 'that can train soldiers in techniques of shooting down UAVs,' Saab spokesperson Magnus Palmer told Breaking Defense. 'This anti-drone module is an add-on to the base training system. We accomplish it by putting this laser sensor and targeting package on to a commercial UAV. This is now become a very critical functionality for training infantrymen — thanks to what has been happening in Ukraine.' There, Palmer is referencing the expansive use of small drones both by Ukrainian and Russian forces — a fast-moving evolution of tactics that has caused no small amount of alarm for international militaries who are now racing to find ways to counter the relatively cheap, flying robotic scouts and munitions. The US military, for instance, has held several exercises for industry to demonstrate ways to take out the aerial threats. Saab’s system appears to be designed to train soldiers to directly engage threats, what can be a tricky endeavor for frontline soldiers going against high-speed systems, as CNN reported. Electronic warfare has emerged as a potent option, at least for the time being. In recent Russian drone attacks, dozens of Iranian-designed Shahed and other attack drones used by Russia reportedly have been jammed or spoofed so that they turn around and either return to base or head off course for the neighboring nation of Belarus. (Jamming refers to severing the drones connection to its pilot, whereas spoofing involves feeding the drone incorrect location data so it goes off course.) 'In some situations where there is a live operator controlling the drone, we have been able to not only cause the Russian drone to return to base or veer off course into Belarus, but to crash into the site where the operator who launched it is located,' one company representative told Breaking Defense, speaking on the condition of anonymity. RELATED: NATO eyes solar-powered high altitude platforms to counter GPS jamming That, too, is a cat-and-mouse game as Russian forces have learned to dodge electronic warfare attacks by using different frequencies, and then Ukrainian forces have adapted to those changes to target the drones once again. The same process takes place in reverse for Russian forces. But it’s possible electronic warfare systems will grow so sophisticated that it will be impossible for drones to be flown remotely. 'If this trend continues, Putin’s troops will be unable to depend on these UAVs to terrorise the Ukrainian front lines,' said the director of one of Ukraine’s leading night vision and infantry weapons firms. 'The great terror that Ukraine troops at the front have been suffering under could be coming to an end before too long.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/saab-unveils-new-counter-drone-trainer-taking-lessons-from-ukraine/	2024-12-05T13:11:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_saab_cuas_trainer_REUBEN-scaled-e1733432252553.jpeg
NATO eyes solar-powered high altitude platforms to counter GPS jamming	The Zephyr high-altitude drone (Airbus) 'These are big, high-altitude planes that can stay for weeks in the air based on solar energy, and they can capture the GPS signal and send it down to earth with much more power that is more difficult to jam,' Brig. Gen. Sam Raeves, who serves as the assistant chief of staff of J6 Cyberspace at NATO, said in an interview on the sidelines of the NATO Edge conference here. Extremely high-altitude platforms (HAPS), which can come in the form of balloons in addition to light-weight drones like the spindly Airbus-made Zephyr, are not yet in widespread use by NATO, Raeves said. But their potential for them to serve as GPS relays comes as officials have grown increasingly concerned about electronic warfare, a now-ubiquitous feature of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. When and if NATO does actually start implementing these types of HAPS, it could help improve the situational awareness issues that arise with GPS jamming, Raeves said. 'So this is what we try to do, to have combined situation awareness fusion,' he said. 'This is really something that can solve it.' In a separate interview, Artem Martynenko, the deputy head of the Center for Innovations and Defense Technologies at the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, bemoaned the constant need to stay ahead of Russian forces in the EW realm. Raeves acknowledged what he called the current 'cat and mouse game' in Europe. He said although NATO is not at war with Russia, the alliance still experiences jamming from the Kremlin. In May NATO publicly accused Russia of 'cyber and electronic interference,' among other acts of 'hybrid activity' — though it didn't appear to do much to slow Moscow down. RELATED: As Baltics see spike in GPS jamming, NATO must respond 'Of course, then we know where they are, but we can do nothing, because we are not at war with Russia,' Raeves said.

West drawing near to ‘third nuclear age,’ says head of UK armed forces	The UK plans on replacing Vanguard-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) with a new fleet of Dreadnought-class vessels (UK MoD) BELFAST —The Western world is closing in on a new nuclear age, the third of its kind, because of malign activities carried out by Russia, China, North Korea and Iran, the head of the British Armed Forces has said. 'We are at the dawn of a third nuclear age … defined by multiple and concurrent dilemmas, proliferating nuclear and disruptive technologies and the almost total absence of the security architectures that went before,' said UK Chief of the Defence Staff Adm. Tony Radakin, during a Wednesday speech in London hosted by the British Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank. 'From Russia, we have seen wild threats of tactical nuclear use, large scale nuclear exercises and simulated attacks against NATO countries, all designed to coerce us from taking the action required to maintain stability.' He said that China’s nuclear build up offers a 'two-peer challenge' to the US. Further afield, Radakin labelled Iran’s failure to engage with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) a 'concern.' He also accused North Korea of 'erratic behavior' and said such action, in conjunction with its ballistic missile program, 'presents a regional and increasingly a global threat.' Radakin strongly defended the UK’s nuclear deterrent amid criticism over high costs and claimed it alone 'has more impact on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin than anything else.' For that reason, 'successive British governments are investing substantial sums of money to renew both our submarines and warhead and to recapitalize our nuclear enterprise after decades of underinvestment,' added Radakin, 'and this is even though the real benefits won't be realized for another decade, at least.' A wise general once told me that the role of senior leaders at points of tension is to reassure the nation &amp; stiffen our resolve Global power is shifting &amp; a third nuclear age is upon us. My RUSI Lecture explores how Britain stays safe in dangerous timeshttps://t.co/Ylgo2xVzAS &mdash; Chief of the Defence Staff 🇬🇧 (@AdmTonyRadakin_) December 5, 2024 The UK’s Continuous At Sea Deterrent (CASD) is overseen by Royal Navy Vanguard-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) fitted with Trident 2 D5 missiles. The aging vessels are set to be replaced by four BAE Systems Dreadnought-class types from the early 2030s onward, with each capable of carrying up to 12 Trident munitions and four Spearfish medium-range torpedoes. Overall, the Dreadnought program has an estimated through life price tag of £31 billion ($40 billion), excluding a £10 billion contingency fund. Parliamentary figures [PDF] also indicate that by March 2023, £15 billion had been spent on the 'concept, assessment, and early delivery phases' of the effort. In a November report on UK nuclear modernization, the Federation of American Scientists said that Dreadnought delays 'could threaten the [Royal] Navy’s ability to maintain their Continuous At-Sea Deterrent (CASD) as it would put additional stress on the Vanguard fleet that has already been pushed past its service life.' It also noted that the UK holds an estimated stockpile of 225 nuclear warheads, which is forecast to increase long term, 'based on shifting posture to counter Russia, modernization, and alliance efforts.' Radakin also said there is only a 'remote' chance that Russia attacks the UK — a projection that is also true for NATO as a whole — while Moscow understands that a retaliatory response would be overwhelming, 'whether conventional or nuclear.' Radakin also urged the MoD to consider a two tier equipment and acquisition approach, distinguished by opposing 'fail safe' and 'safe to fail' systems. Fail safe systems would see major projects delivered in much the same way as they are currently, but safe to fail systems would prioritize an 'investor' style whereby, as an example, nine out of 10 projects might end up failing but the remaining one would offer a 'step change' in capability.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/west-drawing-near-to-third-nuclear-age-says-head-of-uk-armed-forces/	2024-12-05T11:17:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/45159434.jpg.iCeS4I3rMWATAA.bg5Be7PyCV-e1733414373997.jpg
NGAD’s fate in Trump’s hands as Air Force punts decision to next administration	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — The US Air Force today announced that the incoming Trump administration will officially decide the fate of a planned sixth-generation stealth fighter, which has been on pause as officials reevaluate the platform’s design and requirements. 'The Secretary of the Air Force will defer the Next Generation Air Dominance way ahead decision to the next administration, while the Department of the Air Force continues its analysis and executes the necessary actions to ensure decision space remains intact for the NGAD program,' Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement today. Stefanek added that the Air Force 'is extending the current Technology Maturation and Risk Reduction contracts for the Next Generation Air Dominance program to further mature designs/systems while ensuring the industry teams remain intact.' To reflect the impact of delays with the program, the Air Force has also requested that bidding vendors 'update their proposals,' Stefanek said, noting that they are a 'schedule/milestone update only.' Observers expected such an announcement after weeks of non-committal statements from Air Force officials all the way up the Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall, who has said a decision on NGAD would need to be made in time for the fiscal 2026 budget. That budget will now be crafted by Trump-appointed officials following the November election. The Air Force in 2023 set a target to award the NGAD contract to a winning vendor this year, though that plan hit a rough patch this summer after officials announced a pause in the plane’s development process to ensure they have the right design, as well as to attempt to bring its cost down. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are believed to be in a dogfight for rights to build the stealth fighter after aerospace prime Northrop Grumman publicly exited the competition last year, though Northrop has recently entertained the possibility of reentering the fray if the jet’s requirements change.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ngads-fate-in-trumps-hands-as-air-force-punts-decision-to-next-administration/	2024-12-05T10:28:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
‘Too early’ to rule out China-Russia cooperation in Baltic seabed cable incident, says Pentagon official	The Chinese ship, the bulk carrier Yi Peng 3 is anchored and being monitored by a Danish naval patrol vessel (unseen) in the sea of Kattegat, near the City og Granaa in Jutland, Denmark, on November 20, 2024. (Photo by MIKKEL BERG PEDERSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A Pentagon official said she's unsure whether the recent damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea was the result of an intentional act and part of a broader Russian-Chinese plot, but the circumstances are suspicious enough to raise questions. 'I think that even a rational person, though, would say ‘Why is a Chinese vessel doing this and operating in this area?’ Some of our partners I've heard say this potentially leads back to Moscow,' Iris Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for arctic and global resilience, said during an event with the Center for Strategic and International Studies.'It's still too early to say, obviously, investigations are ongoing, but these are the kinds of dual use of one another's assets that I think we need to just be mindful of.' The incident in question took place in mid-November, when the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3 reportedly dropped its anchor and dragged it across a stretch of the Baltic seabed, in the process damaging undersea cables near Sweden and Denmark. While US and European officials have expressed confidence the ship is responsible for the damage, what is less clear is whether the act was deliberate. Soon after the incident, the Swedish government declined to directly assign blame but said that 'situations like these must be assessed with the growing threat posed by Russia in our neighbourhood as a backdrop. This includes an increased number of hybrid activities in Europe.' China has rejected accusations of sabotage. 'I would like to reiterate China's consistent support working with all countries to maintain the security of international submarine cables and other infrastructure in accordance with international law,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters last month, Reuters reported. Russia has also denied involvement. Since the incident occurred, Danish navy ships have been monitoring the Yi Peng 3, while Sweden and other European countries have sought the crew’s cooperation. Because the ship is in international waters, authorities are unable to force it to come into port. The incident is one in a series of events in recent years featuring European officials discovering damage to seabed cables running between their countries — sometimes the causes are known and other times they have been a mystery. RELATED: UK Naval Chief On Threats To Undersea Infrastructure: &#8216;We Don't Fully Understand' Solutions Regardless, the Pentagon has taken notice and made defense of underwater infrastructure a priority area for the trilateral security pact AUKUS. Equally, American officials and Ferguson in particular, have warned about Russia and China’s increasing cooperation. Just this year, Ferguson spearheaded a new arctic strategy for the Defense Department. 'Increasingly, the PRC and Russia are collaborating in the Arctic across multiple instruments of national power,' according to the document. 'Russia’s isolation as a result of its full-scale invasion of Ukraine has made it increasingly reliant on the PRC for financing energy export infrastructure in the Arctic. Over 80 percent of Russia’s natural gas production and nearly 20 percent of its petroleum production comes from the Arctic, and Russia is increasingly turning to the PRC to fund this extraction and purchase these resources.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/too-early-to-rule-out-china-russia-cooperation-in-baltic-seabed-cable-incident-says-pentagon-official/	2024-12-05T09:42:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_yi_peng_3_GettyImages-2185111873-scaled-e1733418510214.jpg
Anduril, OpenAI enter ‘strategic partnership’ to use AI against drones	The 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the Threat Systems Management Office operate a swarm of 40 drones to test the rotational units capabilities during the battle of Razish, National Training Center on May 8th, 2019.(US Army Photo by Pv2 James Newsome) WASHINGTON — Defense startup Anduril is teaming up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in a 'strategic partnership' that Anduril says will 'develop and responsibly deploy advanced artificial intelligence (AI) solutions for national security missions' — particularly in countering drones. 'By bringing together OpenAI’s advanced models with Anduril’s high-performance defense systems and Lattice software platform, the partnership aims to improve the nation’s defense systems that protect U.S. and allied military personnel from attacks by unmanned drones and other aerial devices,' Anduril said in a press release Wednesday. 'The Anduril and OpenAI strategic partnership will focus on improving the nation’s counter-unmanned aircraft systems (CUAS) and their ability to detect, assess and respond to potentially lethal aerial threats in real-time.' The collaboration comes as the Pentagon is racing to find ways to defend its troops and facilities, both abroad and at home, from the threat of drones of all sizes, a threat that's come to the fore rapidly since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, especially. RELATED: Hundreds of drone incursions reported at military installations over past few years, NORTHCOM says Breaking Defense recently observed a military exercise in the Colorado mountains during which different companies demonstrated their own counter-drone solutions for the homeland, from cyberattacks to nets. In July, the Pentagon conducted a similar experiment, this time attempting to defend against drone swarms. 'No one capability, whether kinetic or non-kinetic, in itself could really just beat this kind of [attack] profile,' Col. Michael Parent, chief of acquisitions &amp; resources at the Army-led Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft System Office, said at the time. 'What we saw was they really do need a full system of systems approach, a layered approach.' Officials and experts have held up AI as a potential key aid in defeating drone swarms, allowing much faster identification of several threats that would otherwise overwhelm current systems and their human operators. In October, defense industry giant Northrop Grumman announced it was adding AI to an Army command system to better defend against the drone threat. However, the Pentagon is also grappling with the policy and ethical considerations of integrating AI into its operations, especially any missions involving kinetic fires. In other applications, like chat programs, the DoD has shown it's especially wary of potential mistakes current popular AI systems can make. Anduril appeared to acknowledge that concern, and in its release Wednesday said the two firms' 'shared commitment to AI safety and ethics is a cornerstone of this new strategic partnership.' The collaboration, Anduril said, will be 'subject to robust oversight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/anduril-openai-enter-strategic-partnership-to-use-ai-against-drones/	2024-12-05T08:53:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241205_DVIDS_drone_swarm_5356116-scaled-e1733415596741.jpg
And then there were 3: NRO extends contracts for radar imagery to Capella, ICEYE, Umbra	Umbra SAR satellite image of Cannes, France (Umbra) WASHINGTON — The National Reconnaissance Office has granted new two-year contracts to three providers of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite imagery: Capella Space, ICEYE US and Umbra, an NRO spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Wednesday. 'NRO's Commercial Systems Program Office provided a two-year period of performance extension under NRO's Strategic Commercial Enhancements Broad Agency Announcement (SCE BAA) which were initially awarded on Jan. 20, 2022. The period of performance extension for SCE BAA Stage III &#8211; Commercial Radar Capabilities is from July 2024 through July 2026,' the spokesperson elaborated. There were five SAR-sat firms in the original set of study contracts — the three Stage III winners, plus the US arm of European aerospace behemoth Airbus and Florida start-up PredaSAR. Airbus in October announced it had plans to cut up to 2,500 staff due to losses primarily in its Space Systems business. Reuters reported Wednesday that the firm announced 2,043 job reductions, more than half of which came from the Space Systems business. PredaSAR's parent company, Terran Orbital, in October 2022 abandoned plans for its SAR satellite constellation, and NRO dropped PredaSAR from its roster when the contract lapsed in September 2023. After a year of struggling with debt, Terran Orbital was acquired by Lockheed Martin on Oct. 30. The new Stage III contracts are expected by industry officials to be the last of the short term, relatively small dollar awards under the SCC BAA — with senior NRO officials pushing to create a longer term program of record in the fiscal 2026 budget. NRO's budget is classified, but it is an open secret that the agency has been slated only about $10 million a year for about 15 study contracts with providers of SAR, radio frequency geolocation and hyperspectral satellite imagery. 'From our perspective, it's another sign that the Commercial [Systems Program Office] is committed to supporting SAR, and that they're serious about it,' Joe Morrison, Umbra's vice president and general manager for remote sensing, told Breaking Defense on Tuesday. 'And despite the fact that, to date, they have not yet been able to stand up a program of record, they are very concertedly, explicitly working to transition the study. In the meantime, they're creating these additional phases that are substantive and very meaningful for the industry,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/and-then-there-were-3-nro-extends-contracts-for-radar-imagery-to-capella-iceye-umbra/	2024-12-05T07:18:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/Umbra-SAR-sat-photo-e1685046168368.jpeg
Israel, Argentina to expand defense cooperation	Javier Milei (L), President of Argentina shakes hand with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (R) in West Jerusalem on February 07, 2024. (Photo by GPO, Handout/Anadolu via Getty Images) JERUSALEM — Argentinian Minister of Defense Luis Petri traveled more than 12,000 miles earlier this week to ink an accord with his Israeli counterpart pledging the countries to a 'multi-year' effort to strengthen defense ties. The agreement, while short on details, said the effort would involve a focus on joint projects 'in cyber defense, unmanned aerial vehicles, border protection, satellite communications, and future government-to-government (G2G) contracts in light arms, light munitions, radios, and related equipment,' according to a Israeli Ministry of Defense statement on Monday. It would also establish a 'joint program for strategic workshops and seminars across various fields of mutual interest.' Israel’s Director General of the Ministry of Defense Eyal Zamir, who has sought to step down from his post recently, met with Petri during the visit. The two discussed 'strategic issues, including Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East and Latin America. Both emphasized the importance of continued collaboration and fostering stability in their regions,' the Ministry said. Argentina has grown closer to Israel under President Javier Milei. He was elected in 2023 and visited Israel in May 2024, where he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Two months later, in solidarity with Jerusalem, Argentina declared Hamas a terrorist organization. The Israeli government described his visit at the time as marking a 'new milestone' in friendship between the countries. Israel’s Ministry of Defense characterized the recent visit by Petri as 'a testament to Argentina's unwavering support for Israel in the current war, strengthening the deep and strategic partnership between the nations.' Argentina would be an important partner in South America because Israel has faced struggles in several countries in that region. Colombia, for instance, broke ties with Israel in May 2024 due to the Gaza war. Bolivia has done the same, and Venezuela has been a harsh critic of Israel for years. A number of Israeli defense companies have made deals in Argentina in recent years. IAI subsidiary Elta’s Drone Guard system was used to protect the G20 meetings in Argentina in 2018. Rafael’s Cyber Dome also won a contract in the country. A report in June said Argentina was considering Rafael’s Spike LR2 anti-tank missile system. In addition, Elbit Systems has upgraded Argentina aircraft in the past. Other reports suggest Argentina has contracted with or expressed interest in other Israeli systems, although the tendency of Israeli companies to not identify their customers makes it difficult to quantify and confirm. Israeli companies may see the new strategic initiatives and Argentina’s interest in key technologies such as UAVs as a reason to focus on the market. For instance, in 2021 Bird Aerosystems, which makes missile protection systems and surveillance solutions for aircraft, opened an office in Argentina as part of its expansion in Latin America. During the meetings in Israel, Petri also brought a message from President Milei 'reaffirming Argentina's steadfast support for Israel's right to self-defense. He emphasized that Israel's current struggle represents not only a national fight but also the free world's collective battle against terrorism and civilization's stand against barbarism.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/israel-argentina-to-expand-defense-cooperation/	2024-12-05T05:29:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241204_milei_netanyahu_shake_GettyImages-1984952448-e1733327850764.jpg
Ahead of defense gathering, poll finds majority agree on US as global leader, but then it’s complicated	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III delivers the keynote address during the 2021 Reagan National Defense Forum at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Dec. 4, 2021. (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) REAGAN NATIONAL DEFENSE FORUM — As president-elect Donald Trump prepares to reclaim the oval office, a new poll found that while most Americans generally agree the US has a key leadership role to play on a global stage, they can be bitterly divided along political lines over exactly what that means when it comes to global hotspots like Ukraine and Israel. Each year the Ronald Reagan Institute releases its annual defense and national security poll before high-level officials and key lawmakers descend on Simi Valley, Calif. for a weekend forum. Pollsters this year conducted the survey just after Trump won the presidential election, and sought to shed a bit of light on Americans’ view of the security and defense landscape. According to this year’s bipartisan survey of more than 2,500 people, 57 percent of Americans believe the US should be more engaged leading international events — a 15 percent jump over 2023 findings. 'The strong preference for US leadership resonates across voters for both 2024 presidential candidates: six in 10 Trump voters (61 percent) and nearly as many [Kamala] Harris voters (59 percent) say the United States should be more engaged and take the lead,' it later added. Despite the widespread backing, however, divisive partisanship was apparent on what that should entail with responses swinging on issues like the wars in Ukraine or support for Israel. Opinions about the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, for example, proved more fraught than a year ago. Pollsters reported that 59 percent of participants now support peace negotiations, even if Kyiv was required to cede land to Moscow. And when it comes to providing military aid to Kyiv, there was a slight drop in support from 59 percent last year down to 55 percent this year — with 74 percent of Harris voters backing the deliveries compared with just 42 percent of Trump voters. At the same time, though, 78 percent of participants reported fears that the war could expand into NATO countries. Meanwhile in the Middle East, another stark partisan divide emerged over whether Israel should continue military operations inside Gaza or pursue a ceasefire. In total, 45 percent of respondents said they believe Israel has the right to continue military action there until the threat posed by Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran is removed — 64 percent of Trump voters and only 30 percent of Harris voters. In a similar vein, another 45 percent of participants backed a ceasefire with 63 percent of Harris voters in favor versus only 28 percent of Trump voters. Continued military aid to Israel was a less divisive topic, with 54 percent of Americans favoring continued military aid for Israel that left Trump voters coming in at 67 percent and Harris voters at the 46 percent mark. 'A wide range of issues drive Americans’ perception of China as our greatest adversary, with particular concern about its military ambitions,' the Reagan Institute said in a press release. 'When asked to choose their top concern, 28 percent identify China’s military buildup — an eight-point increase from last year.' When it comes to trust in the US military, respondents were more favorable in their assessment this year, with a five-point hike to 51 percent of Americans reporting a 'great deal of trust and confidence in the military.' 'Little partisan difference exists here, with 56 percent of Trump voters and 50 percent of Harris voters expressing high confidence in the military,' the Reagan Institute explained. 'There has also been a six-point increase since last year in those under 30 years old who express willingness to serve in the military.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/ahead-of-defense-gathering-poll-finds-majority-agree-on-us-as-global-leader-but-then-its-complicated/	2024-12-04T21:01:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/12/6964966-scaled-e1641177794262.jpg

(Photo by Lance Cpl. Juan Diaz / Marine Forces Reserve) NATO EDGE 2024 — At a time when leaders from NATO countries and their allies are striving to share more data more securely, the Pentagon and the Canadian Armed Forces announced that they achieved federated identity, credential and access management (ICAM) connection between their armed forces in a joint pilot program. It's a relatively small step, but Ross Ermel, the defense chief digital officer for the Canadian Armed Forces said this week that when he and his team 'took this to the warfighting use case — I'll just keep it general for now — and they realized what they could do now that they could log on and share, eyes were open. It was a light bulb moment.' RELATED: As adversaries attack, Pentagon's zero trust office shifts focus to protecting &#8216;operational technology' With this federated, or in other terms shared connection, users in the US and Canada were able to securely access the other country’s data on an existing platform that they share, Pentagon acting chief information officer Leslie Beavers said today during a panel discussion. (Beavers did not specify the specific platform used in the pilot.) 'Identity management enables those two, those clouds, people within those clouds, organizations, equipment within those clouds, to trust each other and work together,' Beavers said. Adding that 'it is key to unlocking the modern capability that we all crave within our Department of Defenses and our alliances.' Beavers said that when she was in the US Air Force she often couldn’t connect to the systems she needed to, and those experiences inspired her to bolster interoperability not only within the DoD but also with foreign allies. 'I couldn't understand why as an Air Force member, when I traveled around to a number of different locations ... nothing would work, and it drove me nuts. So that is why I'm extremely passionate about taking on these foundational challenges and getting them solved, and solving these problems is through cooperation,' she said. Such cooperation, Beavers said, was made possible through her work with Ermel. 'If we can't talk and we can't trust each other, nation to nation, entity to entity, we truly don't have that interoperability that we seek in the future,' he said, adding that such ICAM interoperability is 'absolutely vital.' Now that the US and Canada have achieved federated ICAM connection with each other, Beavers said the next step is to expand this capability to all of NATO countries and other allies. 'We're starting really small [with the] US and Canada. We're writing the recipe, the playbook, the technology piece, the policy piece. We're going to then try and scale it to 32 [nations] and then to take it beyond to other allies and partners, but we need everybody's help,' she said. 'I just would ask everyone to focus a little bit on the mundane, and let's get this problem solved, and that will unleash the power of NATO.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/a-light-bulb-moment-us-canada-achieve-vital-federated-icam-connection-through-joint-pilot/	2024-12-04T13:24:39-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241204_canadian_us_computers_8377708-scaled-e1733347402569.jpg
Boeing fighter chief, Steve Nordlund, retiring	Storm clouds gather over Boeing's St. Louis headquarters. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Steve Nordlund, who has led Boeing Defense’s fighter jet business for the last two years, is retiring, Breaking Defense has learned. Nordlund, whose official title is vice president and general manager of Air Dominance, will be replaced by Dan Gillian, currently the vice president of Mobility, Surveillance &amp; Bombers. Gillian, in turn, will be replaced by Jamie Burgess, Boeing Defense’s current vice president for program management. A Boeing spokesperson confirmed the moves in response to an inquiry from Breaking Defense but declined further comment. Before taking over the air dominance unit, Nordlund spent a year running the company’s Phantom Works unit; that combined experience lined up with Boeing’s attempt to win the US Air Force’s Next-Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) effort, which is now facing budgetary headwinds from the service. Overall, he spent 15 years at Boeing, having come over when the aerospace giant purchased drone firm Insitu. His exit comes amidst the backdrop of uncertainty at Boeing. New CEO Kelly Ortberg announced in October plans to lay off roughly 10 percent of the company as he seeks to get the aerospace giant back on track, and the company's defense sector remains without a full-time leader since Ted Colbert was ousted in September. On the whole, the defense unit has logged $3.2 billion in charges on the year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/boeing-fighter-chief-steve-nordlund-retiring/	2024-12-04T13:11:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-HQ-e1719847032260.jpg

(Photo by Sgt. Derrick Irions / U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Europe and Africa) NATO EDGE 2024 — The NATO Communications and Information Agency (NCIA) has released its first technology strategy, aimed at bolstering innovation so the alliance can reach the digital capabilities it needs to conduct full scale multi-domain operations by 2030. The strategy introduces the NATO Digital Foundry, a project that will provide opportunities for NCIA, industry, not-for-profit organizations and other NATO stakeholders to collaborate on new technologies. The idea is to get products from the prototyping stage into the hands of warfighters faster all while being secure and interoperable, Calderon said. 'It's about creating a secure, open platform for industry or academia or national centers,' Calderon said. 'Then you can bring your products or prototypes or DIANA [Defense Innovation for the North Atlantic] startups ideas, and then we will offer those innovators [the products] to the rest of NATO. We can offer you connections to our air command-and-control labs, ballistic missile defense labs, our crypto labs, our network reference facilities and all those, whether physical or virtual.' The strategy focuses on six technology themes which include: 'Even though we selected six technology teams, the power is about interconnecting different technologies, because when you bring them together, then you have that force multiplier that brings innovatio,' Calderon said. 'It took months of discussion to confirm that those are the ones that will bring the most value, because we have thousands of technologies to choose from.' The data exploitation focus aims to 'leverage data as a strategic resource to contribute to cognitive and decision superiority and enable [multi-domain operations],' the strategy reads. This theme heavily focuses on exploring artificial intelligence and machine learning for improved data management so the alliance and its warfighters can make better, quicker data-informed decisions. The focal point of the strategy’s cloud computing theme is cloud adoption. The strategy explains that NATO needs to move its data to a cloud environment because as 'capabilities become increasingly software-based and software-defined, the cloud’s role as an open, secure and scalable platform driving modern innovation and collaboration approaches has become essential.' Cloud adoption also includes the federation of clouds, which means the ability for different cloud providers and systems to work together. RELATED: Pentagon plans secure cloud pilot to defend small businesses from hackers The strategy explains that the next generation networks focus area is designed to provide communication services that are 'resilient' in 'high throughput and low latency' environments. This includes implementing safeguards when using 5G networks and putting 'severe pressure on the radio frequency spectrum, particularly the one for primary military use, at every World Radio Conference cycle,' according to the strategy. The space technologies focus area expands on NATO’s 'need to guarantee' access to data, products and services (DPS) and to 'assure' the defense capabilities that will limit adversarial use of space enabled and space-based systems against NATO. That means harnessing SATCOM, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR); positioning, navigation and timing and other technologies. NATO also wants to establish responsive launch capabilities that will allow new satellites to be launched on a 'ready-to-go' basis so the alliance can have quicker access to DPS. RELATED: 24 hours to launch: Space Force, DIU kick off new &#8216;Tactically Responsive Space' mission For cybersecurity, the strategy outlines two aims. The first is the introduction and implementation of modern cyber architectures in all member nations. It highlights the need for zero trust principles and 'secure integration' when using information and operation technologies. The second aim is focused on supporting cyberspace operations both offensively and defensively. For example, the use of ISR, counter AI technologies and 'cyberspace targeting.' In the realm of AI, the strategy aims to establish a 'cyber immune system' which will not only defend against cyber threats but also autonomously 'self-repair and adapt in case of breaches.' Lastly, the strategy highlights NATO’s role in quantum technologies. This was the 'more controversial' theme when building the strategy, Calderon said, because some involved in the process 'don't believe quantum will ever be reality.' Still, NATO plans to invest in quantum sensors to maintain the alliance’s 'technological edge.' Furthermore, the strategy warns of the potential dangers of quantum computers and calls for developing quantum key distributors and quantum number generators that can protect against quantum computer’s ability to break cryptography that protects the alliance’s machines.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-agency-unveils-first-of-its-kind-tech-strategy-for-multi-domain-operations/	2024-12-04T11:48:11-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241204_NATO_computer-1541984-scaled-e1733334412102.jpg
Rapid pace of modern conflict requires modern pace of training: Officers	Ukrainians train with handheld drones. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) I/ITSEC 2024 — One of the key advantages the US believes it has over its peer competitors is the sophistication and depth of the training that its members must pass through before they depart for their given missions. That belief has only been reinforced after more than two and a half years of the war in Ukraine, where reports emerged of Russian recruits having as few as two weeks of training before being sent to the front and suffering horrendously high casualty rates. Speaking with the different firms and organizations present at this year’s Interservice/Industry Training Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC), it is clear the training and simulation community is trying to take lessons from real-world conflicts in order to keep training as relevant as possible for the modern warfighter. New and rapidly-evolving elements on the battlefield of today are not so much turning training and simulation requirements upside down as they are adding new modules to the training syllabus, according to speakers at this year’s conference. During the opening ceremonies here today, Vice CNO Adm. James W. Kirby and Lt. Gen. Benjamin T. Watson, the head of the USMC Training and Education Command, highlighted how critical the training function has become in a time when weapon systems are becoming increasingly complex and expensive. Describing one ground vehicle as 'an F-35 on wheels,' Watson pointed out that this kind of hardware is too expensive to procure and operate to be putting endless op-tempo 'hours on these platforms just to build proficiency.' That means a 'steeply increasing need for simulation' in order to keep costs down and vehicle lifespans up. The two officers noted that everyone’s favorite buzzword, 'artificial intelligence,' also has an important function in the training and simulation space, where it could enhance the effectiveness of the warfighter through 'predictive analysis.' In a panel following the industry keynote address, Watson elaborated on this point by sketching the terrain likely to be confronted by many US military commanders in any coming conflict, noting 'You cannot train units and personnel once the fighting begins without leaving gaps in then-operational forces.' 'If you believe you are going to have insufficient time to be prepared, insufficient force capacity when the conflict begins and that we are going to be tested,' then having the most realistic, high-end training possible is vital, Watson said. 'If you do not have your assets in a position to be relevant when the conflict arises then you will not get to a point where you will be prepared within a relevant timeline.' He also emphasized that any future combat scenario will involve being under near-constant surveillance, something the US military needs to be adapting to and training on now. The comments from the two officers were largely in line with what exhibitors were discussing, or showing off, on the conference floor. I/ITSEC, which originally began as largely a US Navy and other military services event, has since evolved into a conference that pulls in all the service branches, US federal agencies, major defense contractors, healthcare firms, transportation specialists and cyber warriors. 'It is one of those few defense industry events where you see snake-eaters, wrench-turners and computer nerds in the same room — and talking with one another in a common language about common problems,' said one of the participants on the floor. Although not a major focus of the officer’s opening comments, a tour of the show floor reveals a clear acknowledgement of the overwhelming presence of drones of all shapes, sizes and mission profiles on the modern battlefield. But training and simulation for drone warfare is expanding well beyond the need to create capable and competent drone pilots. More than one contractor was displaying a product line that enables the warfighter to now hit back against the wave of these low-altitude battlefield drones. At one end of the scale are simple training systems that teach an infantryman the easiest and most effective ways to shoot down a UAV, while the other end of the scale features a new electronic warfare simulation of how to take out large numbers of Russian drones. In one of the more recent large-scale Russian drone attacks, Ukrainian EW systems managed to take out more than 50 suicide, one-way drones and 'disoriented' several others that returned to base when their guidance packages were scrambled, meaning that kind of large-scale EW effort is going to be important for the US and its allies to keep concurrent on.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rapid-pace-of-modern-conflict-requires-modern-pace-of-training-officers/	2024-12-04T10:33:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/230526_ukraine_quadcopter_GettyImages-1468749342-scaled-e1693994223641.jpg
Shipbuilder HII to acquire facilities from South Carolina company for sub construction	An aerial view of W International's facilities in South Carolina. Navy shipbuilder HII plans to purchase 'substantially all' assets from the company. (Photo courtesy of HII.) WASHINGTON — Navy shipbuilder HII today announced its plans to acquire 'substantially all of the assets' of South Carolina-based metal fabricator W International and use the new location to begin submarine module construction beginning next year. HII said the deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024 pending regulatory approvals though did not disclose any information about the costs. The facilities are in Charleston, SC, roughly 400 miles south of HII's Newport News Shipbuilding, which manufactures US Navy aircraft carriers and works with General Dynamics Electric Boat to produce Virginia and Columbia-class submarines. 'HII is committed to increasing build rates for our Navy customer, and this investment in capacity alongside the Navy will help us do that,' HII President and CEO Chris Kastner said in a statement. 'It lets us efficiently add trained talent and state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities to the urgent job of building ships, making it a unique opportunity to accelerate throughput at Newport News Shipbuilding in support of the Navy and AUKUS.' The deal includes 480,000 square feet of manufacturing space on a 45-acre site as well as access to a barge and rail lines to transport completed modules back to either Newport News or General Dynamics Electric Boat. HII said it plans to offer employment to 'substantially all' of W International’s current employees. 'Submarines will be the first priority. That’s where we're starting,' Jennifer Boykin, Newport News Shipbuilding’s outgoing president, told reporters today. 'But we do see the opportunity to — because of the size of the of the facility — also include aircraft carrier unit builds.' The acquisition comes amid the backdrop of numerous efforts by the Navy and industry to bolster the submarine industrial base. The service has spent the past year working with Texas-based non-profit BlueForge Alliance to recruit more shipyard workers with an initial goal of adding 100,000 workers over the next decade. Speaking at a Tuesday event hosted by the Center for Maritime Security, Navy officials told attendees they had recently upped that goal closer to 140,000 workers. The service also recently inked a deal with a private investment firm and shipbuilder Austal USA to purchase and develop a piece of land in Mobile, Ala, for submarine module construction. Austal itself has recently become a more active player in the submarine industrial base, getting work from General Dynamics Electric Boat and making facility expansions to support those efforts.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/shipbuilder-hii-to-acquire-facilities-from-south-carolina-company-for-sub-construction/	2024-12-04T10:26:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Goose-Creek-SC-Aerial-4-scaled.jpg
To counter China and support national security, Congress must empower NIST	The US Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) building is seen October 9, 2012 in Boulder, Colorado. (Photo by Dana Romanoff/Getty Images) America’s future competitiveness will be driven by our ability to capture the economic and national security benefits of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, biotechnology, and quantum computing. Within government, these efforts are underpinned by the research and standards development done at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency with a remarkable track record of success supporting American innovation. Given this success, it’s no surprise that China is seeking to manipulate international standards organizations to its own benefit. In fact, global standards leadership is a stated aim of the Chinese Communist Party and President Xi’s Jinping’s China Standards 2035 plan, specifically to lessen American influence. In contrast, NIST is being underprioritized. The agency has crumbling buildings and leaking ceilings. The rapid growth of industry salaries for emerging technology jobs means that NIST finds it increasingly hard to compete with the private sector for top talent. Federal agency limitations further currently constrain NIST from bringing the results of its research into commercial practice to benefit the US economy. And during an era of rapid progress in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, the agency is limited in its ability to respond due to the slow pace of new funding and hiring. NIST’s legacy is at risk, and we are not equipping the agency to meet this challenge. But if it is willing to grasp it, the outgoing Congress has an opportunity to reverse these trends and poke a thumb in China’s eye. A solution lies with the bipartisan Expanding Partnerships for Innovation and Competitiveness Act (EPIC) Act, endorsed by more than forty American companies, universities, and think tanks, as well as by heads of NIST that have served under Presidents Trump, Obama, and Bush. EPIC would equip NIST with a non-profit foundation, enabling it to harness philanthropic investment to complement its mission. While NIST will always answer to Congress and operate within its authorized mission, a foundation can help connect this important work to the private sector where the market can accelerate the best ideas forward. For NIST, a foundation could help further basic R&amp;D and support innovation in critical technologies like AI, while countering China’s manipulation of international standards for new technologies. As we enter a world where US leadership in emerging technologies is inextricably linked to national security, Congress should support NIST’s important work by prioritizing the full passage of EPIC as part of this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). As an agency, NIST is not the sexiest of items to be argued about in the NDAA. It doesn’t blow things up, nor does it fly at hypersonic speeds. To understand its importance, one needs to understand how NIST actually works. NIST’s role among federal agencies is unique. It is not a regulator, and it doesn’t focus on a particular set of applied scientific or technical domains. Rather, its focus is at a higher level: advancing the leading edge of measurement science — and using that science to help push the boundaries of research and create standards for technologies, opening new domains of innovation. Why are measurements and standards useful for pushing the frontier of innovation? Once it’s possible to measure something, it then becomes possible to test it and make it better. Technical standards provide American industries with a common language to facilitate trade and enable scientists and engineers to work on common goals that cut across technical disciplines. NIST’s mission is thus tightly linked with American innovation and technological competitiveness — making sure everyone is on the same page allows the full force of American industrial might to be brought on a particular problem. In pursuit of its mission, NIST has punched far above its weight: Agency scientists have been awarded 15 percent of the Nobel Prizes in Physics awarded to Americans since 2000, with two further prizes directly enabled by measurement work done at NIST. These achievements have come despite NIST receiving less than half a percent of federal R&amp;D funding. Cutting edge defense technologies stand to benefit going forward. In biotechnology, NIST has developed reference molecules that labs across the United States use to develop new tools. In quantum computing, NIST has run a successful program to identify new encryption algorithms that are resistant to powerful quantum computers. In AI, NIST developed the 'MNIST' database, which has been one of the most important benchmarks used to help develop neural networks, the technology behind today’s most powerful AI models. However, NIST faces challenges in its future capacity to deliver on its mission: the recent rapid pace of progress in emerging technologies has made it hard for the agency to flexibly scale its projects in response. Many agencies have in the past found a similar mismatch between their basic structure as a federal body and the rapidly changing science and innovation landscape they are expected to respond to, and there exists a proven solution for addressing them. Congress has long used 'agency foundations' as a solution, complementing agencies’ missions by enabling the deployment of philanthropic investment. The Foundation for the National Institutes of Health runs fellowships to attract top scientists to the agency. The Center for Disease Control’s foundation hosts an emergency response fund, which raised nearly $600 million in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic to distribute 8.5 million pieces of PPE and hire more than 3,000 surge health workers. The Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research supports the Department of Agriculture by hosting ambitious prize competitions, and innovation and entrepreneurship initiatives. These and other agency foundations have been an efficient mechanism for amplifying their agency’s work, averaging a return of $67 for every $1 in federal contributions. And compared to more ad hoc solutions like the use of the Intergovernmental Personnel Act to allow an agency to employ technical experts funded by external organizations, an agency foundation provides a more transparent and well-governed alternative. One key area where a non-profit foundation could be especially useful for NIST’s work is in international standards. American businesses do better when they have a voice in international standard-setting. Today, the Chinese government is manipulating the global standards-setting processes by paying its experts to participate, and incentivizing them to all vote in the same direction. Because the US approach is industry-led by design, NIST cannot directly support US experts to counter China’s efforts. A NIST foundation could fill this gap by supporting US experts (especially from small and medium-sized enterprises) to participate in international standard-setting, ensuring a level playing field for American enterprises. Congress should act now to give NIST the necessary tools it needs to deliver on its core mission — promoting US leadership in technical standards, and accelerating the development and adoption of critical emerging technologies, in a voluntary process involving both large and small firms. To do this, NIST should be equipped with its own Foundation, a proven, effective tool that other federal R&amp;D agencies already enjoy. Walter G.

Trump taps Driscoll as Army secretary, Navarro as trade advisor	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Trevor Raney/Digital Media Division) 'As a former soldier, investor, and political advisor, Dan brings a powerful combination of experiences to serve as a disruptor and change agent,' Trump announced on Truth Social. According to the statement, Driscoll is a graduate of Yale Law School and former Army soldier. Trump praised Driscoll’s work in the private equity arena and said he will be a 'fearless and relentless fighter for America’s soldiers and the America First agenda.' The Pentagon's video repository features an interview with a young officer, Daniel Driscoll, whose deployment to Iraq matches that noted in Trump's description. If confirmed by the Senate to be the 26th Army secretary, Driscoll will take over a service in the throes of modernizing its weapon portfolio, ramping up the defense industrial base and grappling with recruiting. In Navarro, Trump is bringing in a loyalist who served roughly four months in jail for refusing to comply with a Congressional subpoena investigating the events of Jan. 6, 2021 — something Trump, in his announcement today, described as Navarro being 'treated horribly by the Deep State, or whatever else you would like to call it.' In his new role, Navarro, 75, will be asked to 'help successfully advance and communicate the Trump Manufacturing, Tariff, and Trade Agendas,' per the announcement. During the first Trump administration, Navarro was a key voice pushing the theme of 'economic security is national security,' which manifested in advocating for greater defense exports. He also helped shepherd through a review of the defense industrial base to identify weak points in the supply chain. The announcements come amidst reporting that the nomination of Pete Hegseth to be Defense Secretary has hit some rocks, with Florida governor Ron DeSantis reportedly emerging as a backup should Hegseth fail to find support in the senate.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/trump-taps-driscoll-as-army-secretary-navarro-as-trade-advisor/	2024-12-04T08:54:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8605018-scaled.jpg
Amid high north race, Coast Guard to seek green light soon to start building first new icebreaker	The Coast Guard Ice Breaker Polar Sea works the ice channel near McMurdo, Antarctica. (USCG photo by Rob Rothway) WASHINGTON — The US Coast Guard plans to seek approval from the Department of Homeland Security later this month to begin production of the lead ship in the Polar Security Cutter program, a major milestone for the first American icebreaker to be produced in decades. Adm. Kevin Lunday, the Coast Guard’s vice commandant, told attendees at a Tuesday event hosted by the Center for Maritime Security the service is seeing a 'significant increase in design maturity.' 'Bollinger [Shipyards] is learning quickly how to rebuild the knowledge base that disappeared since we hadn’t built an icebreaker in so long — but we are making progress and we are moving forward,' he said, referring to the program’s prime contractor. The Polar Security Cutter is one of the Coast Guard’s top acquisition programs, and will see the design and construction of three new heavy icebreakers. The program has seen its share of challenges since inception — including one recent independent government watchdog warning the costs will skyrocket over Coast Guard projections — but the service’s current schedule projected the lead ship’s production would begin in 2024. Icebreakers are a unique class of ship, and lead vessels are almost always more expensive than originally projected due to unexpected challenges during construction. Making PSC a particularly challenging build is the fact that, unlike submarines and destroyers, the United States hasn't produced a new heavy icebreaker in decades, resulting in atrophy of the subset of the industrial base that once specialized in their construction. At one point this past summer, the two American icebreakers that are still operational were both stuck in maintenance at a time the Coast Guard would have preferred to have a ship patrolling in the High North. RELATED: ICE Pact: Why The US Had To Recruit Help In Race With Russia, China For Arctic Icebreakers In the meantime, the service has successfully acquired a commercially available icebreaker, Aiviq, which Lunday said has already been repainted and branded with US Coast Guard markings. He expects that ship to be 'operational here shortly.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/amid-high-north-race-coast-guard-to-seek-green-light-soon-to-start-building-first-new-icebreaker/	2024-12-04T08:37:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/1071546-e1733326815916.jpg
South Korean crisis likely to have military, geopolitical reverberations: Analysts	Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on December 4 2024, after South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol on December 3 declared martial law, accusing the opposition of being 'anti-state forces' and saying he was acting to protect the country from 'threats' posed by the North. (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — South Korea appears to have survived a brief, stunning attempt by its president to impose martial law, but the aftermath may lead to lasting damage in its relations with allies and partners, including the US, analysts told Breaking Defense. President Yoon Suk Yeol had based his foreign policy around being tougher on North Korea, a tighter embrace of the United States and, perhaps most controversially inside South Korea, pushing for closer defense relations with Japan, including by restarting a major intelligence sharing agreement with Tokyo. His fall — which seems inevitable 24 hours after his martial law declaration, with his defense minister offering to resign over the plan and an impeachment process underway — will have 'profound' effects on those foreign policy goals, according to Chun In-bum, a former deputy commander of South Korea’s First Army. 'The entire ordeal lasted only six hours, yet its implications are profound. It was bizarre, embarrassing, and politically damaging for the Yoon administration. The short-lived declaration of martial law raises significant questions about the president’s judgment, the advice he received, and the decision-making process within the government,' Chun wrote in an email to Breaking Defense, adding that the 'political fallout will be severe and long-lasting.' The extent of that fallout, predicted Euan Graham, will be global. 'If Yoon's impeached and the progressives regain power then I think the outlook for bilateral relations with Japan and the US trilateral will darken,' Graham, a regional expert with IISS, told Breaking Defense. However, don't expect immediate changes. 'Yoon is unlikely to resign but there is already enormous public outcry and bilateral political support for his impeachment. The National Assembly already has impeachment bills moving, and they will likely pass quickly,' said Jenny Town, an expert on the Korean peninsula at Washington's Stimson Center. 'Yoon will be removed from duty and Prime Minister Han [Duck-soo] will assume interim presidential duties.' Under South Korean law, Parliament may impeach the president. If it does and it is upheld by a Constitutional Court then a successor must be elected within 60 days. Yoon would serve in the interim for at least part of that time. 'It should be noted that Lee Jae-myung, the most prominent of the opposition leaders, is currently ineligible to run for president due to his own legal problems,' Town wrote in an email to Breaking Defense, raising questions about who will run to replace Yoon. 'The incident leaves lingering doubts about the future of the nation's political climate and the ability of its leadership to navigate complex challenges. It will serve as a sobering case study in the delicate balance of power, the risks of executive overreach, and the resilience required to uphold democratic principles,' Chun wrote. Once Yoon is forced out, there may be a retrenchment against tighter relations with Japan, analysts said. Yoon's desire to tighten bonds with Tokyo, while championed in Washington by national security officials who always view Japan and South Korea as natural allies, has never been popular domestically, where the wounds from World War II remain raw for the public. Notably, the impeachment resolution introduced in the National Assembly specifically calls out Yoon's approach to Japan as part of the reason he should be forced out, including accusations he 'adhered to a peculiar Japan-centric foreign policy,' per a translation. Chun was blunt, saying that if Yoon goes and the more liberal opposition wins, 'Japan-Korea relations will go down the drain.' One area where a new president may reverse gains made with Japan is on the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA), an intelligence-sharing system originally set up in 2016, paused in 2019, and then restarted by Yoon and his Japanese counterpart, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, in 2023. Both Chun and Leonid Petrov, a Korean expert at the Australian National University in Canberra, said that freezing participation in GSOMIA would be an easy anti-Japanese move for the next government to make, with Petrov adding that Yoon's actions might raise serious concerns among the Japanese about the stability of South Korea's leadership.

(Kiyoshi Ota &#8211; Pool/Getty Images) As for the bedrock relationship for South Korea, that with the United States, Town said much will ride on who South Korea elects as their next leader — who will regardless likely start on a back foot with President-elect Donald Trump. 'This reminds me a bit of 2017 in the sense that no matter who the next president of South Korea is, they will be late to the game with Trump. South Korean leadership was in flux the first time Trump took office, meaning others had the advantage of making a strong first impression,' Town wrote. 'While there was some speculation that Trump and Yoon would get along well, the opportunity to get in early and make a strong first impression is gone.' How much all of that will change will depend a great deal on how Trump, who appears skeptical of alliances in general, actually approaches the one with South Korea and the one with Japan, Town said. That may drive South Korea to move 'back toward greater strategic ambiguity in balancing its relations between the US and China.' 'If Trump takes aim at [South] Korea for more host nation support payments, then obviously that spells trouble,' Graham noted. 'The Korean president is not the only variable' in the Washington-Seoul relationship. Will all this uncertainty lead to saber-rattling or more dangerous moves by North Korea? Town doesn't think so. 'If [former President] Park Guen-hye's impeachment [in 2016] is any indication of how Pyongyang may be assessing the situation, they are unlikely to do anything overtly provocative toward South Korea in the coming weeks or months to disrupt the process. They will likely get in a few rhetorical jabs at Yoon on his way out, but otherwise see how the situation plays out,' Town said. She added that Pyongyang is deeply engaged in helping Russia in Ukraine, and 'those efforts will not be put on hold because of what's happening in the South.' Petrov is also skeptical North Korea will look to make a move, even though, he said, Pyongyang will likely interpret the South Korean military's unwillingness to use force against civilians during the six-hour crisis as a sign of weakness. Instead, Petrov said, expect North Korea to use the political and military disorder shown in the last two days for propaganda purposes and let it speak for itself. For its part the US has been quick to stress that peace and order is maintained. 'The United States has watched closely developments over the last 24 hours in the Republic of Korea,' said Antony Blinken, US Secretary of State in a statement on Tuesday. 'We welcome President Yoon’s statement that he would rescind the order declaring emergency martial law in accordance with the ROK Constitution, after the National Assembly’s unanimous vote to reject the declaration. We continue to expect political disagreements to be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law. We reaffirm our support for the people of Korea and the U.S.-ROK alliance based on shared principles of democracy and the rule of law.'

‘Huge implications’ as top Chinese military leader under investigation, joins 3rd defense minister	Chinese President Xi Jinping is applauded as he waves to senior members of the government upon arrival at the opening of the 20th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party at the Great Hall of People on October 16, 2022 in Beijing. (Kevin Frayer/Getty Images) SYDNEY — A public announcement that one of the most important figures in the Chinese military is under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline' — the latest in a string of moves against senior defense leadership — has 'huge implications' for Beijing, analysts told Breaking Defense. Last week, while much of the US defense establishment was enjoying the Thanksgiving holiday, Chinese state television announced Miao Hua, director of the Political Work Department at the Central Military Commission, had been suspended. The announcement marked a departure from Beijing's actions against two previous defense ministers, all of whom vanished from public view before it became clear they were being investigated for corruption. It's also a departure, according to expert Dean Cheng, because Miao can be considered more senior than the defense ministers. Miao Hua, a member of Central Military Commission (CMC) and director of CMC&#39;s Political Work Department, is suspended from his post due to suspected serious violations of discipline, CCTV reported. https://t.co/CTwFrTC8UZ pic.twitter.com/x77SY4OGlJ &mdash; Global Times (@globaltimesnews) November 28, 2024 'This would DIRECTLY concern the top CCP leadership, as the PLA is a party-army, the armed wing of the CCP. If there are problems in the PWD, the implication is that the PLA may not be seen as 100% reliable,' he said, adding that Chinese President Xi Jinping has repeatedly given speeches about the importance of the military being subordinate to the will of the CCP civilian leadership. Exactly how this will all play out is unclear, Cheng and another analyst agreed. 'It's clear that the corruption investigations of the PLARF [People's Liberation Army Rocket Force] were not a one-off, but have led to a larger and more systematic investigation across the PLA,' Meia Nouwens, a China defense expert at London's International Institute for Strategic Studies, said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'I suspect two things matter here: Xi getting on top of corruption in service branches that are of vital importance to any PLA priority mission, and, secondly, personal connections between those investigated,' she said. But overall, it's the extraordinary prospect of three Chinese defense ministers being investigated for corruption, and now someone senior to the defense ministers being suspended. A day before the announcement about Miao, The Financial Times reported that China's current defense minister, Adm. Dong Jun, was also under investigation. (A spokesperson for the Chinese military reportedly called that allegation 'just shadow-chasing' without further explanation.) Prior to Dong, former Defense Minister Li Shangfu's removal from office was announced on Oct. 24 last year. He had not been seen in public since late August. The last Chinese foreign minister, Qin Gang, vanished from sight for weeks and was formally removed in July that year. Before Li’s official departure, there were clear signs of turmoil in the Chinese military, with several top leaders of the Rocket Force having been ousted. 'Having three Defense Ministers investigated, and two publicly accused of corruption, does not give a sense of stability within the PLA. The reports of Miao Hua (on the CMC) also being investigated makes this more serious as his position makes him more senior,' Nouwens opined. 'It also raises questions' about contacts between foreign militaries and the PLA as they usually occur through defense ministers. Though Nouwens suggested Xi is genuinely attempting to root out corruption, Cheng said that the Chinese Communist Party has used 'corruption' charges liberally as a tool against those who have displeased the leadership — for whatever reason. 'This goes to the fundamental reality that Chinese officers (and officials more broadly) may be removed on charges of corruption, but that does not mean that they are, in fact, corrupt. &#8216;Anti-corruption' is a catch-all phrase that is convenient (given Xi's ongoing anti-corruption efforts), but is not necessarily the REAL reason for an officer or official being removed,' Cheng said. Opposition to Xi's policies can 'be a trigger for removal,' Cheng added. 'The PLA has been undergoing major changes throughout the Xi era. In 2015, the PLA underwent massive reforms, including a restructuring of the services and the CMC itself. So, Miao and Dong Jun's investigation should be examined in light of the removal of a number of PLA Rocket Force leaders including Wei Fenghe, and the removal of Li Shangfu (previous defense minister).' Though hard information is scant, Cheng hypothesizes that the removals may be reflective of attempts by the leaders 'to make changes to PLA doctrine and strategy that run counter to Xi's thoughts and preferences. Gaining more resources, but not necessarily gaining more missions and tasks (e.g., more theater command slots) might lead to resentment at the senior level, leading in turn to purging by Xi.' He added, 'The PLA is probably overdue for a new set of doctrine. Unlike the US military, the Chinese take doctrine VERY seriously, and changes in doctrine leads to changes in acquisitions and even changes in organization.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/huge-implications-as-top-chinese-military-leader-under-investigation-joins-3rd-defense-minister/	2024-12-04T05:32:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/xi_20th_congress-scaled-e1671476420682.jpg
NATO CIO: Alliance-wide classified cloud system is in the works	Solider monitors air and ground position location information (PLI) on the Windows Tactical Assault Kit (WINTAK) and Android Tactical Assault Kit (ATAK) to get a common operating picture that enhances situational awareness and data sharing. (US Army photo by Justine Ruggio/Released) NATO EDGE 2024 — In an effort to move toward data centricity, NATO is in the process of creating a classified cloud system in which member nations can share secret information, NATO's chief information officer told Breaking Defense. 'It puts data together that right now is in different repositories,' Manfred Boudreaux-Dehmer said in an interview. 'The very fact of collocating the data in the same instance, or within the same environment or infrastructure, is very, very helpful. Moving into a common cloud environment also forces you to think about data differently and to prepare it for the move, which in itself will be conducive to analyzing the data later.' He said that the ultimate goal is to get all 32 member nations on the classified cloud, but the timeline of this depends on how quickly each country is capable of moving its data. 'It's not an easy process, because you've got subject matter experts coming in from nations, and there's a lot of concerns and technical considerations that the team has to work through. So it's moving fast, but I don't have a definite timeline,' he said. Currently, there is a group of about five to 10 nations who volunteered to draft an implementation directive which will serve as a framework for how the alliance can handle secret data in a cloud environment, Boudreaux-Dehmer said. He added that he did not know all of the countries on the drafting team, but confirmed that the United States and the United Kingdom are part of the group and that all the countries are 'experienced in the cloud journey.' After the drafted directive is completed, all 32 nations must agree on it before it is approved and nations can start working toward accreditation and pilot processes. Once one country is accredited, it makes it easier for other countries to follow suit, Stephen Lewis, who serves as the acting chief of the cloud portfolio at the NATO Communications and Information Agency, told Breaking Defense. However, 'this doesn't mean it's an easy bar for all of NATO' to be accredited, he said. Chief of Staff of the Allied Command Transformation at NATO Simon Asquith shared the CIO’s sentiment of needing a classified cloud during a panel discussion, saying that data centricity is vital in bolstering NATO’s technological innovation. 'Number one, focus on digital transformation and move to a classified cloud,' Asquith said when listing his priorities for digital innovation. 'Without that, we won't be able to [conduct] multi-domain operations. So we need a good digital backbone. We need a classified cloud as quickly as possible so we can integrate machine learning tools and deliver information at a speed of relevance and allow commands to make decisions. If we can't do that, I think we will fail.' Boudreaux-Dehmer explained that following suspicious Russian cyber activity right before the Kremlin invaded Ukraine, Ukraine moved its sensitive data out of data centers and into the cloud. He said this served as an 'inspiration' for NATO to move to move data to the cloud and eventually build a classified cloud system. 'Situations cannot be compared between NATO and the Ukraine, but it has been very, very inspirational whenever I had conversations with people in the Ukraine who were involved in the cloud migration. It's inspirational moving faster and giving it a good push for us, the cloud really is a prerequisite for a lot of things.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/nato-cio-alliance-wide-classified-cloud-system-is-in-the-works/	2024-12-03T13:32:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240405_DVIDS_atak_monitors_6369124-scaled-e1712349705569.jpg
Advances in radar are key to countering the modern drone warfare and missile threat	Raytheon recently entered into an agreement with NATO to provide Patriot PAC-2 GEM-T (Guidance Enhanced Missile) interceptors, and NATO can now collectively manage the distribution of the missiles. (Raytheon photo) The evolution of air and missile defense threats – including challenges posed by threats ranging from drone swarms to ballistic and hypersonic missiles – necessitates development of advanced radar and sensing systems that will allow air defense systems like Patriot to remain lethal for years ahead. Breaking Defense discussed this challenge with Tom Laliberty, president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems at Raytheon, an RTX business, and how they can be addressed with radar advancements like the U.S. Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), internationally through the GhostEye MR radar for the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS) developed jointly by Raytheon and Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace (KDA), and in the counter-UAS role with the KuRFS radar and Coyote kinetic and non-kinetic effectors for the Army’s integrated counter-UAS solution called LIDS (Low, slow, small UAS Integrated Defeat System). Breaking Defense: How have the threat scenarios evolved this decade given what we’ve seen in Europe and other AORs? Tom Laliberty is president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems at Raytheon, an RTX business. Tom Laliberty: What we're seeing today is massive raid sizes with hundreds of missiles launched by the adversary and arriving from every direction. The adversary is trying to overwhelm air defense systems with a huge number of threats that must be dealt with simultaneously. The strategy is that if you’re busy dealing with all these low-cost threats, then the high-value ones – the ballistic missile, the high-speed cruise missile – will find its target. For us, this means we have to build 360-degree systems that are robust enough to handle that complexity with sensors having the capability to manage that massive data set, ensuring that we're prosecuting threats in a way that prioritizes those that could potentially cause the highest level of damage. Tell us about Raytheon’s legacy in air defense systems that includes Patriot and NASAMS. In air and missile defense, Patriot is probably the most well-known system. It’s now the system chosen by 19 countries, the latest being Ukraine. What’s advantageous about Patriot is that with those 19 customers, the community of users can essentially coordinate with the Army to share threat information, which enables us to continuously upgrade the system and make sure it's operating at the highest level of maturity and at the cutting edge of dealing with any threat. NASAMS is now the chosen medium-range air defense system for 13 countries. That's a great system in terms of integrating capabilities from Raytheon’s Sentinel radar, to command and control from Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace, and missiles from the Air Force and Navy portfolios, which are also produced by Raytheon – AIM-9X, AMRAAM, and AMRAAM-ER. NASAMS’ capability will be improved with the new GhostEye MR radar that is now undergoing integration testing. NASAMS with GhostEye MR and its family of effectors can deal with different classes of threats in the most cost-effective way. For counter-UAS, we have the KuRFS radar and Coyote interceptor, providing the warfighter highly tuned radar capabilities paired with a cost-effective Coyote Block 2 effector to deal with low-cost threats. We also have a non-kinetic effector called Coyote Block 3 non-kinetic. Essentially, it flies out and performs a non-kinetic effect to disable a UAS, and then moves on to disable the next. We’ve done some recent testing, and it shows a strong capability against threatening drone swarms. Staying with Patriot and NASAMS, you probably didn’t imagine pre-Ukraine that they would play such an important role in air and missile defense? The two systems have been incredibly successful. While I can't give you the actual number, there have been hundreds of successful intercepts, which has saved countless lives. The Ukrainian air defenders I’ve talked to say that NASAMS and Patriot are really the backbone of their air defense architecture. There’s such amazing capability between the two systems. How is Patriot evolving to meet these threats, including eventual integration with LTAMDS? LTAMDS provides 360-degree coverage, whereas the Patriot is a sectored radar. LTAMDS provides about two and a half times the range and altitude than you have today for Patriot. We've produced six urgent material release prototypes for the Army that are going through a wide range of testing. The most recent being just a month ago, which was a flight test against a sophisticated ballistic missile surrogate. That's put us on a steady path to Milestone C, which is set to happen in the first quarter of next year. The LTAMDS Army radar from Raytheon provides 360-degree coverage and about two and a half times the range and altitude than today's Patriot. (Raytheon photo) Describe the missions that LTAMDS and GhostEye MR support, and how they’re able to address evolving threats. LTAMDS operates in the lower tier of air defense, which consists of a wide range of threats, both manned and unmanned aircraft, along with cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, and hypersonic missiles – the most threatening of the emerging threats. GhostEye MR is a derivative of LTAMDS where we've scaled the LTAMDS radar down for NASAMS to address a wide range of air-breathing threats like cruise missiles, helicopters, aircraft, and UAS. Both the LTAMDS and GhostEye variants share common features like AESA (active electronic scanned array) technology, digital beam-forming technology, and substrate technology called GaN (Galium Nitride). When you bring all these technological innovations together, you have radars with a robust radio frequency that operates at a very wide bandwidth, which can be optimized for the integrated air and missile defense mission. Dealing with the high volume of threat objects in the air today, and being able to manage and guide the interceptors that you're launching, is what the GhostEye and LTAMDS technology has brought to the table. It has created a transformational capability for the warfighter. What’s the commonality/modularity between your Army radars like LTAMDS and the Navy’s SPY-6 radar? The GaN, AESA, and digital beam-forming capabilities that I mentioned are all from a common set of technologies that Raytheon has developed for our radars. In addition, we now have a common software product line to build software in one common source code base that’s usable on all these radars. This translates into faster fielding and more efficient support. Let’s move to counter-UAS and the combat-proven systems you have in that space, including both kinetic and non-kinetic solutions, especially for the LIDS program. As part of the LIDS program, we provide the sensor, which is the KuRFS radar. It’s a Ku-band, highly sensitive and precise radar that’s useful for a UAS mission because it can distinguish non-threatening objects like birds from small UAS. The Army discussed the program recently and said there have been about 170 successful engagements – primarily with the Coyote Block 2 kinetic interceptor, which is a low-cost missile that intercepts UAS Groups 1 through 3. The Block 3 effector has the ability to use a non-kinetic effector to go after multiple UAS. It then returns to the station, is recharged, and sent back up to continue the mission. It's essentially a reusable effector, which delivers the advantage of increased magazine depth. Then there’s our high-energy laser weapon system, HELWS, which has been integrated on Stryker vehicles as part of the U.S. Army’s DE M-SHORAD (Directed Energy Maneuver-Short Range Air Defense) program. Four units were deployed to CENTCOM for operational testing. The technology has performed well, and one of the things we continue to work with the Army on is the appropriate way to maintain those systems so that they can effectively operate in austere environments. Raytheon is competing for the next-generation short-range interceptor (NGSRI) to replace the Stinger missile, which Raytheon produces as the long-time prime for Stinger. Tell us about the program and what Raytheon brings to the table. The Army is looking for a next-generation MANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) to address evolving threats. I can't say too much about the program because it’s competitive, but we believe our offering will provide the Army with a transformational short-range air defense capability. We’ve been producing Stinger for decades, back to the Korean War, and with great success. This is going to be a revolutionary change in capability for a manageable, modular system that will serve the Army and Marine Corps well for decades to come. Integrated air and missile defense and C-UAS solutions are in high demand across the globe, and Patriot and NASAMS, as we’ve discussed, have a large international customer base. What’s your outlook on the international market for IAMD? Yes, there’s a widespread use of Patriot and NASAMS –19 countries for Patriot and 13 for NASAMS – and dozens that use Stinger. We service a wide range of customers for their air defense needs. Given all the conflicts going on around the world, there’s a tremendous demand for these capabilities, and one of the advantages of using a system like Patriot is that it provides the ability for coalition forces to interoperate far more easily and even go beyond interoperation. It gets them to the point of being interchangeable – where you can take one country's missiles and use them in the same air defense system, as well as sharing spare parts, soldiers, and specifics on tactics and ops for how to operate with the systems. For example, at the end of 2023, we entered into an agreement with NATO to provide Patriot PAC-2 GEM-T (Guidance Enhanced Missile) interceptors. NATO can now collectively manage the distribution of the missiles as they come off the production line, and multiple partners can essentially aggregate their demand and leverage economies of scale. With the investment from NATO, we can partner with additional suppliers in Europe and stand up a test and final assembly facility for these PAC-2 missiles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/advances-in-radar-are-key-to-countering-the-modern-drone-warfare-and-missile-threat/	2024-12-03T12:18:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Raytheon-In-Focus-lead.jpg
IAI targets US, Russian-built jets with upgraded Ehud ACMI pods	Israel Aerospace Industries' Ehud Next Generation pod on display at I/ITSEC. (Breaking Defense/Reuben Johnson) I/ITSEC 2024 — Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) used this year’s Interservice/Industry Training, Simulation and Education Conference (I/ITSEC) to show off its newest Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) pod, as the company targets both Western and Russian-designed aircraft for potential markets. At present, 17 air forces are operating one or more versions of the company’s Ehud-series autonomous ACMI pods, which allow air forces to conduct air-to-air combat engagements without actually firing a missile. The ACMI pod, shaped like a missile, is loaded onto a jet, and pilots are able to engage in as-close-as-possible-to-real-world combat without the weapons being launched. The first Ehud ACMI pod was originally introduced over a decade ago, designed to go on a Raytheon infrared homing air-to-air AIM-9L Sidewinder. The company also worked with non-Russian users of the Sukhoi Su-30 and Mikoyan-29, in order to develop a version that works on any aircraft that is capable of firing the Russian-designed Vympel R-73 (AA-11), which was the mainstay infrared-homing air-to-air weapon for Russian aircraft for years. The newest version the company is showing off at I/ITSEC is the Ehud Next Generation pod, which is designed to work with fifth-generation Western jets. In essence, that gives IAI a chance to market at the three biggest military aviation user bases: older Western jets like the F-16, older Russian jets like the MiG-29, and modern Western fighters like the F-35. While ACMI pods have been around for years, IAI’s design gives extra oomph for the training customer, according to Ari Maman, head of business development for the company’s MLM modeling and simulation group and a former F-16 pilot with the Israeli Air Force. He called out three specific capabilities the company talks about when marketing their tech. 'The first is that the use of the Ehud pods creates real-time high-fidelity datalink training networks between groups of instrumented aircraft in an engagement of multiple platforms,' he said. 'Once you make a simulated launch [using the pod] it takes into account what the other targets are doing. 'Secondly, once the exercise is complete there is the ability to carry out a complete and comprehensive debriefing of the entire engagement and all other factors that are programmed into the simulation,' he continued. 'This can be done from a ground station that has recorded all of the simulated firings conducted by the pod or downloaded from the pod itself.' Like all modern weapon systems, the data is the driver, Maman emphasized: 'All of these recordings can then be used to build out a database with each successive exercise pairing up all of the elements that would be involved in an airland battle. The data can then be used to conduct an evaluation of large-scale exercises using database and incorporating all air-to-air, air-to-ground, ground-based air defense firings into an integrated air data picture.' The third function that the Ehud pods are capable of is being a safety feature in those situations where there are multiple aircraft engaged in an exercise. The Ehud design 'has a unique ability to prevent midair collisions. The computerized system on board will send a signal to a pilot if it projects the aircraft flying into an unsafe situation by sending a signal to the pilot. 'There are other features that enhance safety outside of the training range. The system has an option where the pilot can be wearing a small tablet in place of the normal pilot’s clipboard attached to his thigh that gives the complete air date picture of all the aircraft participating in the exercise. This gives the pilot who is operating as the &#8216;Red' or opposing force the location of all the aircraft in his flight as well as all of those in the ‘Blue’ force.' But perhaps what makes the Ehud most unique goes back to that willingness to design a system that can work with both Western and Russian aircraft. It is not a simple task to be able to design the different connectors that the two types of aircraft utilize, have the correct programming and algorithms in order to design one model to work with a US or European MMC and another with the Russian on-board electronic infrastructure. 'IAI are the only company who has been both invited by different governments to develop these different pods in order cover all types of fighters. It is the company’s long-running strength of being able to work with both ‘worlds,’' Maman said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/iai-targets-us-russian-built-jets-with-upgraded-ehud-acmi-pods/	2024-12-03T11:17:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/IAI-ehud-Reuben-Johnson-IITSEC-scaled-e1733252568654.jpeg
Franco-German land systems firm KNDS appoints new CEO	The KNDS Enhanced Main Battle Tank (EMBT) technology demonstrator fitted with the new EMBT-ADT 140 uncrewed turret, on display at Eurosatory (Andrew White/Breaking Defense) BELFAST — The Franco-German land systems manufacturer KNDS has appointed Jean-Paul Alary as its new CEO, succeeding Frank Haun, who will step down from post later this month. Alary, who has worked in the defense industry since 1991, will formally take charge of the firm on April 1, 2025, according to a KNDS company statement. He is due to depart as France's Safran Aircraft Engines CEO at the end of December. 'With Jean-Paul Alary, KNDS could win an outstanding expert in technology and management,' said Philippe Petitcolin, KNDS Chair of the Board of Directors. 'He will further drive KNDS's innovational power and economic growth. We are pleased to welcome him to the KNDS leadership team.' Alary said, 'The defense industry is facing challenging yet opportunity-rich times. I look forward to actively shaping these developments as the CEO of KNDS. As a leading company in European land defense, KNDS plays a central role in security policy considerations and efforts.' Formed in 2015, KNDS is a joint venture between France's Nexter and Germany's Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMV), two of Europe's largest land system manufacturers. The company makes the Leopard 2 main battle tank, Puma infantry fighting vehicle and PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzer, among other vehicles. In 2023, it recorded turnover of €3.3 billion ($3.5 billion) and an order backlog of approximately €16 billion, according to company figures. Philippe Balducchi, Group Chief Financial Officer of KNDS, will take on CEO responsibilities on top of his current remit between Haun stepping down and Alary's succession commencing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/franco-german-land-systems-firm-knds-appoints-new-ceo/	2024-12-03T10:43:37-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/KNDS-e1718788745738.png
Army eyeing new PrSM Inc. 5 weapon to fire from autonomous launchers beyond 1000 km	The Army's PrSM weapon is seen during a test launch. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — The US Army is developing a fifth Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) that it could potentially launch from an autonomous launcher to hit targets beyond 1,000 km, according to two service leaders. At an Association of the US Army event today, the commanding general for the service’s Fires Center of Excellence Maj. Gen. Winston Brook showed a slide with a PrSM Increment 5 weapon listed as a future capability. The director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team, Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, separately explained that work on a fifth increment is in fact underway but is currently relegated to the science and technology arena. The idea, he explained, is to design a missile that can be fired from an autonomous vehicle. 'If you're familiar with an [M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System] MLRS pod, it's about 13-feet long,' the one-star general told the audience. 'If you have something without a cab, that's autonomous, you might be able to employ something longer than that.' 'We're in the science and technology phase of something that we'll maybe, eventually call Increment 5,' Crooks added. 'You might be able to employ something that's actually longer … and you might be able to achieve ranges that, right now, don't seem realistic.' While there are science and technology funds to examine this potential new weapon, Crooks said there is not yet a timeline to compete and formally develop it. Over the past several years, the Army has been developing four other PrSM rounds, broadly designed to replace the MGM-140 Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS), and be launched from both the M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) and the M270A2 MLRS. The service is currently in the process of fielding initial Increment 1 rounds from Lockheed Martin billed as a way to strike targets at least 500 km away. Future versions of the weapon also include an Increment 2 with a multimode seeker, known as the Land-Based Anti-Ship Missile (LBASM) seeker, and a PrSM Inc 3 which would seek to add in enhanced lethality payloads. The Army has also tapped a Lockheed Martin team and a Raytheon Technologies-Northrop Grumman team to work on competing PrSM Inc 4 designs that can fly more than 1,000 km, possibly double the range of the current version.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-eyeing-new-prsm-inc-5-weapon-to-fire-from-autonomous-launchers-beyond-1000-km/	2024-12-03T09:36:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/10/PrSM-2-scaled.jpg
Half of Navy’s amphibious fleet in ‘poor condition,’ some ships out for years, GAO warns	A joint light tactical vehicle attached to the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) is transferred from dock landing ship USS Carter Hall (LSD 50) to Landing Craft Utility 1661 during vehicle and equipment loading operations in the Arabian Gulf, July 16, 2021. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by 1st Lt. Mark Andries) 'Amphibious warfare ships are critical for Marine Corps missions, but the Navy has struggled to ensure they are available for operations and training,' reads a new report from the Government Accountability Report, published today. The Navy is required by law to maintain a fleet of at least 31 amphibious vessels; it currently counts 32. But the report found that as of March this year, nine of the Navy's 10 dock landing ships were in 'poor material condition,' as were five of the seven amphibious assault ships and two of the 13 amphibious transport docks. The Navy's two amphibious assault ships were both in 'satisfactory material condition.' GAO's rating of the Navy's 32 amphibious vessels as of March 2024. (GAO) The report notes several factors that contributed to the problem, including 'challenges with spare parts.' But a summary of the report also noted that in order to 'save money, the Navy proposed early retirement for some ships and cancelled critical maintenance on them. But the Navy is still relying on these ships — which haven't been well-maintained — while it waits for new ones to be built. As a result, it will be hard to continue meeting the 31-ship requirement.' Amphib readiness has been a topic of much discussion, as service leaders and lawmakers have scuffled over just how many of the ships the Marine Corps really needs, and how relevant they are to modern combat operations. OP ED: To cool the war over amphibs, the Navy and Marines need a clearer justification By this summer the Navy and Marine Corps leadership had 'locked shields' in defense of the fleet, and in July the heads of both organizations announced they had jointly signed off on new guidelines that were meant to 'ensure consistency and uniformity in Navy and Marine Corps amphibious force planning, assessment, and operational mission execution.' (The GAO report also pinged the services for disagreeing with each other 'on the number of ships that should be available at any given time to conduct operations and training.') As for the GAO report, in the end the oversight body makes four recommendations, three of which dealt with still better defining readiness terminology as well as establishing clear timelines and performance goals related to assessing and improving readiness. The Navy concurred with all of those. RELATED: Short on amphibs for Turkey and Sudan, the Marines grapple with crisis response ethos The Navy partially concurred with the GAO recommendation that the Navy update its amphibious ship depot maintenance policy 'to clarify that, absent operational needs, the Navy should not cancel depot maintenance for amphibious ships proposed for divestment that have yet to reach the end of their expected service life.' In that case, the Navy said it's currently 'prohibited by law' from modifying vessels destined for the boneyard, and waivers to do so have a narrow timeline. 'However, the statute permits normal Hull, Mechanical, and Electrical (HM&amp;E) work within the five-year window prior to a ship being removed from service. The Navy will schedule this work, including depot-level repair as necessary, to maintain the ship in operational condition.' It also noted the Navy Secretary may grant waivers for that statute in the 'national security interests' of the US.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/half-of-navys-amphibious-fleet-in-poor-condition-some-ships-out-for-years-gao-warns/	2024-12-03T09:11:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/03/6755223-scaled-e1679336812778.jpg
‘It’s not a war zone’: Pentagon ponders policy shifts to protect homeland bases from drones	Gen. Gregory Guillot, Commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command and U.S. Northern Command hosted distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak on Fort Carson, Colorado, Oct. 30, 2024. (U.S. Department of Defense photo by Josh Armstrong) FORT CARSON, Colo. — When industry representatives gathered with military officials in the Colorado mountains to test different counter-drone tactics, another enemy lurked in the background, threatening to hamstring efforts to take on the increasing threat of small drones: red tape. In some ways, officials said during the Falcon Peak event, the focus needs to be on figuring out the complex rules and regulations governing domestic airspace, which largely limit options military commanders have to respond to small unmanned aircraft systems, or sUAS. 'The threat, and the need to counter these threats, is growing faster than the policies and procedures that [are] in place can keep up with,' US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) chief Gen. Gregory Guillot told reporters during a visit to the exercises last month. Working in concert with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), NORTHCOM used Falcon Peak as an opportunity to get smart not only on the nets, streamers and cyberattacks meant to defeat sUAS, but on the regulatory side as well. Guillot, for instance, envisions his command acting as a homeland 'synchronizer' to coordinate interagency efforts and distribute defensive capabilities to installations. 'One of the key things about Falcon Peak is it offers not just the opportunity to look at the technology that's being tested, but also at our processes,' a senior DoD official who attended the demo said in a roundtable with reporters, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 'A lot of the tasks we have in the homeland, it's a very sophisticated environment in that it's complicated from a regulatory perspective. It's a very civilianized environment. It's not a war zone,' they added. The DoD already has authority to conduct anti-drone missions on US soil, but the law 'restricts our ability to use counter-UAS to certain types of covered rules and missions, covered assets' like nuclear or special operations, the official explained. The statute also requires coordination with the Department of Transportation, mainly through the FAA. To help address the sUAS problem, the official said the Pentagon has pushed a legislative proposal that would help clarify what facilities are covered under the federal statute that allows DoD to enforce perimeter security. The Pentagon is also seeking changes that would improve interagency counter-UAS coordination, they added. The official stressed that if needed, the US government writ large has authorities to defend military bases domestically. But the challenge is in ensuring 'authorities knit together at the seams so that the whole homeland is protected.' Any policy changes likely would not be a one-off either, as the official noted drones themselves will change along with the technologies necessary to defeat them. New tech would then need to be coordinated with other domestic agencies to ensure any impacts are fully understood. 'As our counter-UAS abilities grow and change, we have a responsibility to make not just the FAA, but any civilian agency that we think could be adversely affected by the system that we're fielding aware [of it] and talk to them about how this could affect them,' the official said. Heeding domestic protections, traditional tools like guns and missiles were shunned at Falcon Peak in favor of low- and non-kinetic options, such as nets and signal interference. Those tactics appeared to successfully demonstrate a non-intrusive, low-collateral way to bring down an sUAS, but the senior defense official noted that even with seemingly non-threatening techniques like net capture, some kind of wider coordination would be required before it could be approved beyond ad hoc cases. 'And so there is a process, I think, that we need to continue to refine that will determine how we get those approvals and whether that approval can be a blanket approval,' the official said. Other options like jamming radio frequency links and denying navigation systems required extremely tight coordination with the FAA, as any spillover interference that affected civilian navigation systems could spell danger. 'That is probably one of the biggest hurdles that we have in the counter-UAS space,' Jason Mayes, counter-small unmanned aerial systems deputy test director for NORTHCOM told reporters regarding tools like signal interference. 'It is a very, very difficult capability to get permission to utilize.' NORTHCOM planners had a total of 90 days to plan and execute the Falcon Peak event, Mayes said, requiring a compressed process with the FAA to get the right approvals for the technology. The bureaucracy moved more quickly once the need to use signal interference tech was established as a one-off, 'but I think in real time, we would probably be able to do it very quickly,' Mayes said, pointing to Guillot’s envisioned role of NORTHCOM serving as a domestic synchronizer. 'There’s some areas where we’ve got one policy saying one [thing] and another policy saying another. And the parts where they cross over get a little blurry, you know, and just confusing,' Mayes. 'So I think we need to solidify all of that.' Working with the FAA could one day yield the possibility of approving 'kinetic-type' weapons, said another official, though such an agreement might not be reached in the near-term. 'The FAA and other authorities are looking at this capability and understanding the safety mechanisms that we're implementing into these systems. For example, directed energy: We're implementing things into the directed energy system where it has significant safety avoidance,' Lt. Gen. Sean Gainey, commander of the Army’s Space and Missile Defense command and former director of the Pentagon office tasked with countering small drones, told reporters. 'We can mitigate a lot of the challenges of using kinetic-type of capabilities. So I think, over time, working closely as an enterprise … [and trying] to find out what are the best ways from a reduced risk mitigation, can we get there with some of these kinetic effectors, and what are the right kinetic effectors we actually want to employ,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/its-not-a-war-zone-pentagon-ponders-policy-shifts-to-protect-homeland-bases-from-drones/	2024-12-03T04:31:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Guillot-falcon-peak-scaled-e1733170045719.jpg
Global defense revenues grew in 2023 amid Ukraine, Middle East conflicts: SIPRI report	The 'separate' Russian pavilion at IDEX 2023 is actually situated on the NAVDEX grounds. (Lee Ferran / Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The world’s largest 100 defense contractors amassed $632 billion in combined revenue in 2023, a real-term annual growth of more than 4 percent that comes as conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East continue to propel weapons demand, according to a new Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) report released today. The latest figures show that revenues have 'bounced back after a dip in 2022,' as companies push to increase production capacity to meet a demand signal that shows no sign of subsiding in the near term, the report stated. 'There was a marked rise in arms revenues in 2023, and this is likely to continue in 2024,' said Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher with SIPRI’s military expenditure program. 'The arms revenues of the Top 100 arms producers still did not fully reflect the scale of demand, and many companies have launched recruitment drives, suggesting they are optimistic about future sales.' While US-based companies made up 41 companies in the top 100 — and half the total revenue recorded — Russian defense firms boasted the largest increase in revenues in 2023 by percentage, growing by 40 percent compared to 2022. The report attributed that gain to an intensified campaign by Russia’s Rostec defense conglomerate and United Shipbuilding Corporation to surge production capability for key weapon systems like missiles, aircraft and drones needed to replace equipment lost fighting against Ukraine. According to the report, 'this expansion was facilitated by several strategic adjustments, including increased state orders backed by a larger military budget, new administrative structures to manage production and ensure implementation of orders, and multi-shift working conditions at many arms manufacturing facilities.' Overall, US defense companies saw revenue go up 2.5 percent in 2023. But despite a growth in orders, the two largest contractors, Lockheed Martin and RTX, recorded a slight drop in real-term revenue due to continued supply chain constraints for specialized components and subsystems like solid rocket motors, which has caused headwinds for the companies’ plans to expand production on key aerospace and missile defense programs. RTX saw defense revenues fall by about 1.3 percent to $40.7 billion in 2023, while Lockheed’s revenues dipped by 1.6 percent to $60.8 billion, according to SIPRI. Meanwhile, Northrop Grumman, which SIPRI counts as the third largest defense contractor, registered a 5.8 percent increase to revenue on the back of increased sales of ammunition in the wake of the conflict in Ukraine, as well as more than 9 percent growth in its space unit. RELATED: Lockheed on &#8216;campaign-like' hunt for new solid rocket motor supplier While Russian defense contractors recorded a surge to their bottom lines, Chinese companies saw their year-over-year revenue growth stagnate, with a 0.7 percent increase that was its lowest rate since 2019, the report said. The slowdown of Chinese industrial growth was met by a huge increase of defense revenues by Japanese and South Korean companies, as two of the largest US allies in the region strive to increase the capacity and technological know-how of their respective defense industries. South Korea saw an increase of 39 percent to $11 billion in 2023, with Hanwha, the country’s largest defense contractor, recording an increase of 53 percent in defense revenue after finalizing the acquisition of the shipbuilder DSME and increasing exports of armored vehicles and artillery due to contracts with Poland, Australia and the United Kingdom. Meanwhile, Japanese defense contractor revenues expanded by 35 percent to $10 billion in 2023, with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries leading the way with a 24 percent increase and Kawasaki Heavy Industries netting 16 percent growth on defense. RELATED: Japan looks to revamp defense industry after years of downsizing After Russia, the Middle East was the region with the largest levels of revenue growth that year, with six Israeli and Turkish companies in the top 100 increasing a combined 18 percent to reach $19.6 billion. Notably, Israel Aerospace Industries and Rafael netted increases of 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively. Meanwhile Turkish Aerospace Industries reported 45 percent revenue growth, the largest for a Turkish company. Among the 27 European defense companies on the list, revenue was largely flat in 2023. The biggest gains were boasted by JSC Ukrainian Defense Industry, the Ukrainian conglomerate formerly known as Ukroboronprom, which saw arms revenues increase by 69 percent to $2.2 billion as it increased production of weapons needed for Ukraine’s military. The four German defense companies included in the top 100 recorded a 7.5 percent increase in revenue, while all seven UK-based defense companies also recorded revenue growth. However, SIPRI reported that combined revenues of five French companies went down by 8.5 percent, led by a 41 percent defense revenue decrease by Dassault Aviation Group as sales of its Rafale fighter decreased. Italy, which had Leonardo and Fincantieri in the top 100, saw defense revenue fall 10 percent between the two companies due to a decrease in aircraft sales by Leonardo and the conclusion of an export deal between Qatar and Fincantieri.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/global-defense-revenues-grew-in-2023-amid-ukraine-middle-east-conflicts-sipri-report/	2024-12-02T13:21:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/230223_IDEX_russia_pavilion_Ferran.png
Japan OKs potential sale of Mogami frigate to Australia, in first of its kind move	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches the fourth Mogami-class frigate, Mikuma. (Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force) SYDNEY — Japan has taken an important step forward in its burgeoning efforts to sell a major weapon system to another country, with its National Security Council formally approving the sale of Mogami-class warships to Australia for its General Purpose Frigate program. The Foreign Ministry released a statement Nov. 28 detailing the decision, noting how important is Japan's relationship with Australia. Japan has never sold a modern major weapon system to another country. 'As stated in the National Defense Strategy, Australia will establish a close cooperation relationship second only to Japan-US defense cooperation as a &#8216;special strategic partner' in the Indo-Pacific region,' the statement says. 'Based on such a policy, the joint development and production of this case will contribute to a significant improvement in interoperability and compatibility with Australia, as well as strengthening the shipbuilding and maintenance infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region and improving the capacity of our ships in the future, and is of great significance to the country's security.' The Mogami, built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI), is currently in service in the Maritime Self Defense Force. For the $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) competition, MHI is up against ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (KTMS), builder of Australia's current Anzac-class frigates, who is offering the Meko A-200, an upgraded version of the 30-year-old Anzacs. Michael Shoebridge, founder of Strategic Analysis Australia, told Breaking Defense in an email that should Australia decide to buy the Mogami-class instead of a German ship, 'It would fundamentally increase [Japan and Australia's] militaries' ability to operate together and strengthen the defense industrial bases of both nations.' 'Japan has an excellent chance of success in this program, particularly if the broader technological partnership it will enable is understood clearly at government level in both nations,' wrote Shoebridge, well-known as an acquisition expert here. The Germans do not have any formal defense ties with Canberra, while Japan has been strengthening its military ties to Australia through moves such as the Reciprocal Access Arrangement and new troop rotations announced just last month. 'The Australian navy's ageing ANZAC frigates are a German design, but that construction project is decades old, so any incumbency benefits have shrunk,' Shoebridge said. 'German companies are well-practiced at overseas defense sales, however, so if Australia runs the selection like a normal commercial activity, then Japan will be disadvantaged. It's important [Canberra] see this as a joint government and industry program.' Should Japan win the final selection, expected to occur by the middle of next year, 'it would catapult Japan into an AUKUS Pillar Two-like partnership on advanced military technology with Australia and open doors to broader cooperation in this Pillar Two area, where Japan has obvious strengths,' Shoebridge said. 'The fact that the Japanese Government and MHI are offering to build Mogami class frigates for and with Australia is a remarkable statement about the strategic and technological partnership they see as possible between our two countries, particularly after the setback from the submarine decision a decade ago. Australia should understand Japan's serious and positive purpose in making this offer at this time.' One interesting tidbit in the announcement is that Japan will, as America does, retain veto power over the transfer of the weapon to a third party — another sign it is serious about becoming more of a defense export player on the global market.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/japan-oks-potential-sale-of-mogami-frigate-to-australia-in-first-of-its-kind-move/	2024-12-02T12:13:04-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
EXCLUSIVE: 2 key senators urge Navy to change course on large USV program	The USV Mariner, a US Navy research and development vessel, is docked at the United States Naval Academy where it will be christened on Aug. 23, 2022. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The top two senators overseeing the Pentagon are urging the Navy’s leadership to rethink its plans for the Large Unmanned Surface Vessel (LUSV) over concerns the vessel’s size and complexity will rival that of a manned frigate, according to a letter obtained by Breaking Defense. The senators also say the Navy should work with lawmakers to 'repurpose LUSV funds' to support certain activities for the Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel program. The LUSV is one of the Navy’s exquisite, unmanned surface vehicle programs focused on anti-surface warfare and strike warfare missions. Its requirements include being able to employ up to 32 Mk-41 Vertical Launch Cells, which is evidently driving up anxiety on Capitol Hill. 'This requirement drives the LUSV size and complexity, potentially rivaling a frigate’s displacement at 4,000 tons,' according to a Nov. 14 letter signed by Sens. Jack Reed, D-R.I. and Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who also lead the Senate Armed Services Committee. 'Under current plans, the LUSV will be late to need and incur excessive concurrency, but the Navy will also have a shortfall in Mk-41 compatible missiles even to outfit all LUSVs.' By contrast, the MUSV, which is envisioned to carry a variety of unique payloads, is envisioned to be under 500 tons displacement and no longer than 200 feet in length. The LUSV has been a high-profile research and development program for the Navy since 2019 when it unveiled a bevy of new efforts around unmanned maritime technologies. But between congressional skepticism and other budget priorities, the vessel's original schedule to become a program of record was delayed from 2025 to 2027 — and the senators' letter says even the 2027 timeline may be in danger given the other challenges facing the program. The letter is addressed to Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti and Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro. 'We still believe in the need for the high-low mix of vessels in the Navy’s fleet design and commend Admiral Franchetti’s focus on robotic vessels in NAVPLAN 2024,' the letter states. 'Part of the low-end of the mix is the set of autonomous and attritable capabilities being accelerated to meet INDOPACOM needs. These massed effects, however, do not solve the range of needs desired by the combatant commanders.' Reed and Wicker urge the Navy to 'repurpose' LUSV’s funding to support 'MUSV, procuring additional vessels in FY 2025 and FY 2026 to host already procured payloads, and creating a path to achieve a program of record in FY 2027 for the MUSV.' The letter is the latest bump in the road for the US Navy’s efforts to develop what it calls a future hybrid fleet, featuring both manned and unmanned warships. Programmatically, lawmakers have been skeptical of LUSV since its inception and have pressed Navy officials to explain with clarity how unmanned vessels fit into the service’s broader concepts of operation. MUSV, as evidenced in Reed and Wicker’s letter, has received a slightly better audience on Capitol Hill following successful operations in the Indo-Pacific using vessels often referred to as the 'Ghost Fleet.' 'The Medium Unmanned Surface Vessel should fill important gaps with mature technologies, validated mission needs, and producibility to deliver on expedited timelines' the senators wrote. 'In all, more than 267,000 total miles have been steamed with 70 percent in autonomous mode, proving out reliability of the hull, mechanical and electrical equipment as well as demonstrating the ability to carry several mission payloads.' Long-term changes the Navy makes to either program will likely not be seen by the public until next year when it is expected to unveil its FY26 budget request.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/exclusive-top-2-senators-urge-navy-to-change-course-on-large-usv-program/	2024-12-02T11:28:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/Mariner-Side-View-scaled-e1661283313758.jpg
Why adding the Osprey to the Atlantic Naval Air Force matters	A CMV-22B Osprey, assigned to the 'Mighty Bison' of Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron (VRM) 40, approaches the flight deck of the world's largest aircraft carrier, USS Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78), Sept. 19, 2024. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Maxwell Orlosky) This is the latest in a series of regular columns by Robbin Laird, where he will tackle current defense issues through the lens of more than 45 years of defense expertise in both the US and abroad. The goal of these columns: to look back at how questions and perspectives of the past should inform decisions being made today. Last month, I had the chance to visit Norfolk Naval Station to meet with Rear Adm. Doug 'V8' Verissimo and discuss with him how the first squadron of CMV-22Bs stationed at Norfolk plays into the evolution of Atlantic fleet, which now includes the Ford carrier. Both the CMV-22B and the USS Gerald R. Ford bring new capabilities to naval operations in the Atlantic region, which means a new challenge for Verissimo’s Naval Air Force Atlantic, the aviation Type Commander for the United States Naval aviation units operating primarily in the Atlantic under United States Fleet Forces Command. AIRLANT is responsible for the material readiness, administration, training, and inspection of units/squadrons under their command, and for providing operationally ready air squadrons and aircraft carriers to the fleet. At the time of our discussion, six CMV-22Bs had arrived; the expectation, dependent on final funding, is for 12-15 Ospreys for the squadron to be stationed as part of AIRLANT. One top-level takeaway is how the CMV-22B provides significant help with the challenge of contested logistics — a challenge that is only going to get worse with the Navy focused on distributed operations. Being able to hop from carrier to carrier will be key for the Navy under this concept. Take weapons transport, for example. The admiral underscored that 'the future will likely bring smaller, more agile weapons to complement the heavier more difficult weapons to transport like TLAMs.' He then argued that this shift to a different weapons stockpile would augment the utility of the CMV-22B supporting weapons re-supply in a contested combat environment. But Verissimo also noted that the CMV-22B is also going to be a vital capability for his command in an area that is logistics-related: a medical emergency. He put it this way: 'If I have a medical emergency, I'm not trapping and catapulting the human body that's already injured. I can softly land and softly take off so I can take care of my people in a medical emergency.' There are specific benefits when the CMV-22B is combined with the Ford. The island on the Ford has been moved towards the end of the deck, freeing up space to which an Osprey can move when it lands for offloading of weapons or supplies, so it doesn’t block the EMALS catapults — meaning a resupply can happen even as combat aircraft are being deployed. And there is a fuel capability in that area which can refuel the Osprey for its departure from the deck as well. Throughout much of our discussion, the admiral emphasized the evolution of the carrier for the new strategic situation and the flexibility it brings to the fight. The assets assigned to the Ford carrier will change as future payloads and platforms emerge. Verissimo also underscored the unique features of the Ford design, notably the significant enhanced power generation capabilities which enable the ability to use future payloads, weapons and platforms which leverage that enhanced electrical power generation capacity. He argued: 'The carrier and the carrier strike group are one of the only integrated forces which brings the core seven joint warfighting functions to the fight wherever it is operating. And with the Ford class, and its ability to generate electric power, it enhances those capabilities as well.' Prior to my meeting with the admiral, I met with Commander Mason Fox and his team. Fox is the Commander of Fleet Logistics Multi-Mission Squadron (VRM) 40, the 'Mighty Bison,' and I learned a quite interesting aspect of the challenge of standing up the first operational CMV-22B squadron on the East Coast. As they were getting ready to go from North Island (San Diego) to Norfolk on Dec. 6, 2023 with their first Ospreys, the DoD grounded the Osprey fleet DoD wide. Obviously, this was a shock but one which the squadron and its support community found a way to respond. According to Fox, the squadron had received their flight simulators so the pilots could train in the absence of flying real airplanes while waiting for the grounding to be lifted. And he indicated that the maintainers worked with prime manufacturer Bell in Fort Worth on training the maintainers. This meant that when the grounding was lifted in March 2024, the squadron was ready to re-commence their stand-up effort and the first squadron planes arrived the next month. 'We want to integrate as tightly as we can with the carriers and the air wings on the East Coast so that they fully understand our capabilities,' Fox added. They work with the Commander Air Group or CAG when onboard the carrier. What they have been focused on since the squadron has been activated is working with the carrier community on the logistics operations for East Coast based carriers, the Truman and the Ford. They worked with the Truman in June 2024 and the Ford in September 2024. They are planning to next continue their training with the Bush in the future. Fox concluded: 'Our version of the Osprey has a little bit more gas that we can carry, and we have a primary mission that is different than the Marine Corps and Air Force Ospreys. But I think that if we’re looking at a joint fight, we’re looking at the 450 plus Ospreys that are part of the program record. They will all be contributing to distributed maritime ops, because that’s the fight we are in.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/why-adding-the-osprey-to-the-atlantic-naval-air-force-matters/	2024-12-02T08:32:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8655887-scaled-e1732543950283.jpg
Rheinmetall closes Loc Performance acquisition, as it eyes US-market expansion	A conceptual design of Rheinmetall's Lynx XM30 for the US Army competition. (Rheinmetall artwork) WASHINGTON — Rheinmetall has officially acquired Michigan-based Loc Performance for just under $1 billion, a move company leaders say is central to plans for US footprint expansion. 'The purpose of the acquisition is to strengthen Rheinmetall's position in the US market, and we do that in many ways,' Matthew Warnick, American Rheinmetall Vehicles managing director, told Breaking Defense ahead of the closing. 'First and foremost, we pick up almost two million square feet of manufacturing space, but more importantly than that, is the… approximately 1,000 employees that we get to add to our bench that are used to manufacturing components and parts, all the way up to combat vehicles,' he added. With the $950 million purchase of Loc now closed, Rheinmetall plans to keep those 1,000 employees on staff and add additional jobs. Loc’s Chief Executive Officer Jason Atkinson noted that prior to the close, Loc already had about $3.6 billion worth of backlog work, including vehicle drivelines, suspensions, track systems, rubber products, armor products and fabricated structures. At the same time, the German-based Rheinmetall has sought to carve out a larger share of the US market is vying to win Army competitions like the coveted Bradley replacement program dubbed the XM30, the Common Tactical Truck, the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET) Increment II and a revamped self-propelled howitzer initiative. For 2025, Warnick projects the new pairing will bring in close to $850 million in revenue and, depending on where things stand with new wins, that figure could hit 'north of' $1 billion by 2027. '[That target] is a mix of the existing backlog that we now create the opportunity for export coming out of Loc facilities, given the robust international footprint of Rheinmetall… and being able to provide material content into those programs, be it in the United Kingdom, be it in Australia, be it in Germany, but also winning new contracts as we go forward,' he added. Depending on just how much growth there is within the US market, Warnick said, will determine if the company can move ahead with plans to enlarge its production footprint and, potentially, build out a military vehicle center of excellence inside the United States.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/rheinmetall-closes-loc-performance-acquisition-as-it-eyes-us-market-expansion/	2024-12-02T04:54:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/SHOT21a_v17Mud-scaled-e1684523151385.jpg
How BAE plans to keep its Eurofighter Typhoon UK final assembly line alive for GCAP	A UK Royal Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon conducts a NATO air policing mission (UK MoD) BELFAST — When the emir of Qatar visits the UK this week, his trip will be watched closely in the city of Preston, located some 250 miles northwest of London. That’s because Preston is home to the Warton facility of BAE Systems, where final assembly of the Eurofighter Typhoon occurs. And the hope is that Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani might use his trip to announce a new order of the fourth-generation jets, a Gulf lifeline that could help save the line from cooling for good. The Wharton facility is scheduled to produce two final Typhoon airframes by the end of 2025, the last from a previous order from Qatar for 24 jets. But after that, the future of the UK-made Typhoon is unclear. A spokesperson for BAE Systems was adamant that the British defense giant has no plans to shutter the Wharton facility, saying ''There is absolutely no suggestion of this' and pointing to potential international orders. Analysts and BAE executives say Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey are all viable options for future orders. But those 'what ifs' appear to be little comfort to Steve McGuinness, a key union figure who kicked off something of a firestorm in England with a letter to lawmakers imploring the British government to invest in the Warton line — not just for the Typhoon program's own future, but for the future of British advanced fighter production. 'We have serious concerns that without a domestic order for Typhoon there will be no GCAP [Global Combat Air Programme] due to the loss of the skills necessary to build and fly aircraft,' wrote McGuinness, an aerospace and defense executive council member at the Unite trade union. BAE can keep at least some work at the line going with research and development efforts for future projects, and may redeploy staff currently working at the Warton plant across other parts of the Typhoon business and separate air combat projects run by the company. But in the end, the best way to keep the Typhoon line up and running, and its workforce employed in the lead up to GCAP, is to sell more Typhoons. And the jet is flying against significant headwinds. 'The world is moving to new generations,' said JJ Gertler, senior analyst at the Teal Group. 'The market for Typhoon in recent years has been for countries acquiring them more for diplomatic purposes than performance criteria.' Following the letter from McGuiness, the Spectator publication, a British conservative leaning publication, ran a piece entitled 'The sad death of the Eurofighter Typhoon.' It turned the letter into headline news. 'I think if you were the leadership of BAE Systems you probably wouldn't have looked favorably on that report coming out from the Unions,' Gary Waterfall, a former UK Royal Air Force air vice-marshal, told Breaking Defense. 'It's a bit prejudging,' on production prospects. 'There remains great interest in Typhoon and we are currently pursuing a number of orders in the Middle East and Europe, in addition to further orders from our European Eurofighter partners – as well publicised in recent press reporting,' the BAE response adds. 'Further orders will extend production beyond the latter part of this decade.' Options for further sales are limited, according to analysts, as the world is largely turning towards more advanced systems than the '4.5 generation' Typhoon. 'A higher degree of stealth has become the cost of entry into almost any fighter market, and you see systems like F-35 supplanting high-end fighters in many cases,' said Gertler. 'For some of the missions remaining to Typhoon, like air policing, less complicated and expensive systems can do the same job at a lower acquisition and operating cost.' The Typhoon is produced by four partner European nations: the UK (BAE), Germany (Airbus), Italy (Leonardo) and Spain (Airbus). Each has its own final assembly line, which puts the last touches on planes destined for their own militaries or for international customers. Whichever manufacturer is the lead campaigner for an export sale is generally awarded final assembly rights; The UK is the lead Eurofighter export nation for campaigns related to Qatar, Turkey, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The failure of the UK to commit to a new order of 24 Eurofighter Typhoons is chief among issues raised by McGuiness, alongside reports that London will replace older Eurofighter Typhoon Tranche 1 jets (due to be phased out in 2025) with additional orders of the Lockheed Martin F-35. London last procured the Typhoon in 2009, as part of a joint contract for 112 aircraft, alongside the Eurofighter partner nations. Under the Defence Command Paper of 2021, London cited a need to dispose of of aircraft with 'limited utility in the digital and future operating environment' [PDF] as motivation for axing the Tranche 1 jets. The letter from McGuiness warned against such the F-35 acquisition decision, defining it as 'a hammer blow to the British aircraft industry and potentially could end the design, manufacture and assembly of fast jets in this country, seriously damaging our sovereign capability.' A Royal Saudi Air Force Eurofighter Typhoon arrives at RAF Coningsby, Lincolnshire, England, ahead of Exercise Cobra Warrior (UK Royal Air Force) Despite a lack of domestic interest in more Typhoons and the F-35’s clean sweep of global competitions against Eurofighter in recent years, analysts said that BAE is not wrong in having reason for optimism, thanks to potential sales to the Middle East. Turkey has said it wants to acquire 40 Eurofighters. Recently Germany, which had been against the deal, offered a 'positive response,' to reaching an agreement, according to Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler. In January, Germany also lifted a block on selling to the Saudis, opening the way for a long-delayed second tranche aircraft order (adding to 72 in operation) to take shape. A firm agreement has still to be reached, but could be on the agenda when UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer visits the country next month as part of a Middle East trip that will also include travel to the United Arab Emirates (UAE). 'The Turkey campaign is quite active, and the highest priority,' said Richard Aboulafia, managing director at AeroDynamic Advisory, a consultancy firm. 'There’s a good chance it comes through. The same is true for the second Saudi tranche. But Britain is lucky in that its [Typhoon] production line is the most likely to survive the end of the decade,' of all four partner nation final assemblies. Similarly, it is 'not inconceivable' that across the partner nations, Typhoon production could stretch 'out to the early to mid' 2030s 'given some of the export campaigns that are ongoing,' added Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for military aerospace at the UK-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. Additionally, the UK has also invested £2.4 billion ($3 billion) in a capability development package for Typhoon, under which BAE has been contracted to deliver an advanced Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radar &#8211; European Common Radar System (ECRS) Mk 2. 'These upgrades are also designed to support technology and skills development in readiness for Tempest/GCAP, the next generation combat aircraft,' added the BAE Systems spokesperson. 'Under current plans, Typhoon will remain in service with the RAF until at least 2040 and we are committed to ensuring that this vital capability remains at the cutting-edge of UK and NATO combat air power until its retirement,' said a UK MoD spokesperson. 'Multi decade programmes like the one made at Warton exemplify the UK’s enduring commitment to supporting global defence and security and underpin development of deeper strategic international alliances for the UK,' Kevin Craven, CEO of ADS Group, a UK aerospace and defense trade body, wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. 'Our supply chains are resilient, but they are also suffering at the hands of a mixed signal from UK government.' A Global Combat Air Programme(GCAP) core vehicle concept on display at DSEI, London (Breaking Defense) The other reason for optimism at Warton is the importance of GCAP, not just for BAE but for the United Kingdom as a geopolitical calling card. The next-gen program is tied up with Italy and Japan, and, should its Franco-German-Spanish FCAS/SCAF rival fall behind, it could emerge as the non-F-35 jet of choice for the Western world. Because of GCAP’s importance, there will likely be some production that goes on at Warton even if the Eurofighter falls off. 'When it comes to a bridge between generations, design work is generally more important than production work. This is why the issue of Eurofighter upgrades is [of] equal or greater importance than the survival of the production line,' Aboulafia said. 'Will there have to be some kind of bridge to GCAP? That looks likely. But particularly with the current defense austerity posture in the UK, that bridge does not look very much like a Eurofighter,' Gertler added. Barrie suggested that Typhoon experimentation with Autonomous Collaborative Platforms (ACP’s), UK terminology for Collaborative Combat Aircraft, could be developed near term. 'There's obviously ambition to bring ACPs in, in advance of GCAP by quite some time, arguably, by about a decade, really. So you can say there's going to have to be some tech and R&amp;D around integrating … ACP capabilities with Typhoon,' he said. The RAF is on course to receive a first 'operationally useful' ACP 'before the end of the financial year,' said Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, RAF Chief of the Air Staff, earlier this month. The UK has not said which ACP it has selected specifically, but it will be a Tier 1 or disposable type. London also expects to operate a 'suite' of ACPs by 2030, according to its ACP strategy. 'The sooner you can develop that capability and produce it, the better,' in terms of generating combat mass, Barrie said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/how-bae-plans-to-keep-its-eurofighter-typhoon-uk-final-assembly-line-alive-for-gcap/	2024-12-02T01:29:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Eurofighter-Typhoon-e1732642769504.jpg
Swedish Gripen jets don’t ‘make sense’ for Ukraine yet, Dutch defense chief says	Three Swedish Armed Forces Gripens participated in a long range, long duration Bomber Task Force mission over Sweden, May 20, 2020. (Courtesy photo by the Swedish Armed Forces) ATLANTA — While Sweden stands ready to send its Gripen fighters to Ukraine, the head of a key ally's military said that move 'doesn't make sense for me,' at least not yet. 'In the long term, yes, [but] I think we have to avoid [giving] too many systems to Ukraine, because they have a shortage of pilots,' Chief of Defence of the Netherlands Gen. Onno Eichelsheim told Breaking Defense. 'So you have to avoid that you have more systems than pilots. Somewhere in the balance, you have to look at what capabilities are needed at this moment.' In July the Netherlands, Denmark and the US announced they were in the process of donating F-16s from Dutch and Danish stocks to Ukraine. The US has flatly rejected calls to give current American systems, but agreed to allow other nations to provide their US-made jets. Eichelsheim said it's better to 'focus' on the capabilities the Ukrainians currently have. 'So get them ready on these aircrafts, and provide them with the weapons, the money, the logistics, the parts that are available around the world to get these aircraft up and running continuously.' The Dutch official's comments clarify remarks from Swedish Defense Minister Pål Jonson, who said last week that Stockholm was ready and willing to donate Gripens to Ukraine but had been advised not to. 'The donation of the Gripens is not in the hands of ourselves,' Jonson said, suggesting at the time that other actors in the international coalition dedicated to Ukraine's air force, predominantly Denmark, the Netherlands and the United States, wanted to make sure Ukraine is settled with the F-16 before introducing other complex technologies into the ecosystem. 'They have advised us to wait to donate the Gripen until it goes further with the F-16 as well,' Jonson said. Deliveries of the fourth-generation aircraft, dating back to July, represent a major potential uplift in capability for Ukraine, which has been largely relying on Soviet-era MiG-29 and Su-27 combat jets to counter Russia’s invasion, though officials and experts have said it won’t be a silver bullet. Eichelsheim said Kyiv's armed forces have been 'successful in using the aircraft, and they are actually quite successful in maintaining them at this moment.' 'But we also see that they use a lot of spare parts, so we have to work on the spare parts element together with the nations to provide them with the right amount to keep the aircrafts up and running,' he said. Earlier this month Reuters reported the White House had lifted a de facto ban on American contractors working in Ukraine in a move that could give a boost to the complex maintenance of the F-16. In the meantime, Eichelsheim said Ukrainian pilots 'do quite well' with the F-16, 'perhaps even better than we anticipated. 'They learn very fast how to operate the aircraft and how to operate the new weapon systems that they are getting on the aircraft,' he added. 'So, and that's all I can say, actually, about it.'

US drone maker Shield AI moves into Indian defense market, joint venture with JSW Group	A civilian contractor embarked with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, lands a V-BAT drone aboard the USS Green Bay in the Philippine Sea, Feb. 2, 2023. (U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Andrew King) SYDNEY — The Indian defense market, not known for its historic openness to foreign investment, has gotten an injection of very fresh US defense technology from the AI and drone company, Shield AI. The pan-industrial Indian company, JSW Group, has formed a joint venture with the US firm and JSW plans to invest roughly $90 million in the next two years to build a plant, secure the intellectual property and train workers. The goal is to build V-BAT, Shield's vertical takeoff and landing drone, in India, as well as provide its support and maintenance. A press release from Shield AI notes that JSW's 'investment will enable JSW to establish a local supply chain and create an advanced facility in India for manufacturing, assembling and testing V-BAT aircraft.' The US Marines own and operate V-BAT. This deal appears to be in keeping with a larger Indian effort known as Atmanirbharta designed to encourage foreign companies to work in India, instead of the foreign companies designing, building and assembling weapons to be exported to India. That effort includes an investment fund to attract disrupters and smaller companies, the webpage of which has a link to the drone deal. 'Once reliant on foreign suppliers, India now places a high priority on self-reliant manufacturing to meet its security needs, reinforcing its vision to strengthen national resilience and reduce dependency on external sources,' an Oct. 24 press release by the Indian Ministry of Defense about Atmanirbharta notes. It says that India used to rely on foreign countries for much of its weapons, with '65-70% of defense equipment being imported. However, this landscape has dramatically shifted, with around 65% of defense equipment now manufactured within India.' It points out that '21% of this production comes from the private sector, bolstering India's journey toward self-reliance.' Shield's release claims that this deal will 'allow India to function as a global production hub for the San Diego-based firm 'to handle both domestic and international sales and maintenance. It also will, the companies say, 'reduce reliance on external sources and ensure consistent delivery to India’s Armed Forces.' This 'marks a significant step in boosting India’s defense capabilities by bringing in world-class UAS technology to the country,' the release claims. 'JSW recognizes the same thing Shield AI does: that Group 3 UAS drones like the V-BAT can accomplish the same missions as many helicopters and larger Group 5 UAS drones for a fraction of the price,' Brandon Tseng, Shield AI’s co-founder and a former Navy SEAL, said in the release. 'As the market shifts from expensive, exquisite aircraft to swarms of lower-cost, AI-piloted UAS drones, this collaboration builds upon Shield AI’s significant U.S. investments, enhances global distribution, and supports continued expansion of U.S. operations.' Shield AI's managing director for India, Sarjan Shah, said the deal with JSW Group 'has been crafted over a multi-year period to transform the depth, scale and scope of India’s indigenous capabilities in the field of military unmanned systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-drone-maker-shield-ai-moves-into-indian-defense-market-joint-venture-with-jsw-group/	2024-11-27T10:31:47-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/V-bat-scaled-e1697122824715.jpg
New tech, including drones carrying blood, help injured Israeli soldiers survive	A Thor drone used to drop a small box that contains blood packets that can be used in the field by the IDF. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) JERUSALEM — The Israel Defense Forces estimate they have saved 380 lives of soldiers in the last 14 months of war due to new technology and procedures used to evacuate casualties to hospitals and to treat them on the field, including using drones to ferry blood for infusion into combat zones. At a tour of the IDF's Medical Corps and Technological and Logistics Directorate on Monday, an IDF official showed data that reveals the military has managed to reduce by half the number of soldiers who die from their injuries. In the 2006 Lebanon war, the IDF found that this rate was 14.1 percent. That number dropped to 9.2 percent during the 2014 war, and now is 6.9 percent for the Gaza front and 7.1 percent for the Lebanon fronts. 'The average time for a soldier to receive medical treatment in the field is between zero to four minutes, over 90 percent of soldiers injured from close-quarters combat received treatment in the field, approximately 1,600 injured soldiers were evacuated via helicopters,' the IDF said in a written statement. The short time to receive treatment is due to the presence of what the IDF calls Advanced Life Support providers, meaning medics deployed at the company level, and having more combat soldiers trained as medics. If the wounds are serious enough, the injured are placed in armored personnel carriers or Humvees and evacuated, either to a helicopter landing zone where Israel’s unit 669 takes them to civilian hospitals, or they continue in vehicles. The evacuation process can take slightly more than an hour when moving wounded from Gaza, to up to 111 minutes from Lebanon, due to the topography. The IDF also has increased the number of patients who receive whole blood and plasma that is constituted from freeze-dried plasma. Both of these have replaced the use of crystalloids, which had been used to treat blood loss in the field. Freeze-dried plasma does not require cooling, whereas whole blood does; the IDF has found a way to bring both to the front via small coolers for blood packets. The IDF has also recently used Thor drones, large quadcopters, to drop blood encased in a cooled box. The payload can be dropped from around 450 feet to troops in the field. The payload, around the size of a shoe box, lands via a small parachute rather than a cushion because blood should not be disturbed too much when being transported, an IDF official explained. A Humvee outfitted by the IDF as an example of how wounded can be transported from the field in specially-outfitted vehicles with stretchers and medics on board, for faster evacuation. (Seth J. Frantzman / Breaking Defense) The use of coolers deployed to the front with combat soldiers to carry blood has not only helped treat patients but also solved the problem of supplying the soldiers with these necessities during long periods in the field. During some of the fighting, IDF units have been in combat for days or weeks, and the coolers can provide several days of cooling for the blood. The blood is warmed via a small device, and the freeze-dried plasma can be reconstituted using water, a process that takes several minutes. The deployment of new tourniquets and homostatic bandages, used to control bleeding in an area like the groin where one can’t tie off an arm or leg, have been found to be effective. All of this helps treat soldiers in what is usually called the 'golden hour' in trauma care as patients are moved toward a hospital. However, the deployment of more medics at the front and movement of paramedics and physicians into the field has also resulted in more harm to these trained personnel. The IDF said 58 of their medical personnel have been killed. That's about 7 percent of the 804 IDF service members killed in the fighting since Hamas launched its devastating Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. Meanwhile, the death toll in Gaza is reported to exceed 44,000 and more than 3,000 in Lebanon.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/new-tech-including-drones-carrying-blood-help-injured-israeli-soldiers-survive/	2024-11-27T07:39:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_IDF_medical_drone_handout-e1732644659771.png

(Photo by Adam J. Dewey/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump announced late Tuesday night that he has selected John Phelan, a prominent financier and campaign donor, to become Secretary of the Navy. 'John will be a tremendous force for our Naval Servicemembers, and a steadfast leader in advancing my America First vision. He will put the business of the U.S. Navy above all else,' Trump wrote in a post on TruthSocial, the social media platform he started. Phelan is the co-founder and chairman of Rugger Management, a private investment firm based in Palm Beach, Fla. The Hill reported he is also a donor to the Trump campaign and GOP-aligned efforts. It was not immediately clear if Phelan has any background or experience in national security. Phelan is Trump's second major pick for a spot as top brass at the Pentagon. Earlier this month, he selected Pete Hegseth, a co-host of Fox News's 'Fox &amp; Friend Weekend' and a former infantry captain in the Army National Guard to serve as secretary of the defense.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/john-phelan-financier-and-gop-donor-tapped-to-be-next-navy-secretary/	2024-11-27T04:17:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/trump-ngaus-e1724704355499.jpg
Aussie navigation firm, MBDA team and test AUKUS’ new tech-sharing muscles	Demonstration of MBDA's NILEQ sensors and how they read terrain like a fingerprint scanner. (MBDA) SYDNEY — A collaborative effort between a small Australian navigation firm and European defense giant MBDA is among the first to test the new tripartite arms export control system from the start of a program, and initial reports are positive, according to the CEO of the Australian firm. Before the changes to the US International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) policies and the arms export regimes of Britain and Australia, 'it would take six months to get a license approved to just share information,' Sydney-based Advanced Navigation CEO Chris Shaw said in an interview today with Breaking Defense. But since a revamping of the rules in August, at least the timeline for information sharing has been trimmed down to days or weeks, he said. 'Yeah, there's still controls that have to be taken to account, which is fine, but it's a lot more simple now for something like this,' Shaw said. The memorandum of understanding between the two companies limits the work to between the United Kingdom and Australia, the release says, so has yet to test US rules. The Australian defense minister, Richard Marles, has hailed the arms export reforms as a 'generational' change, and Australian officials have generally been eager to comply with American requirements as they amend Australia’s arms export system. The ITAR system, of course, is infamous for its often slow and complex processes, overseen by the US State Department’s Political-Military Bureau. Pillar II of the US-UK-Australia venture known as AUKUS — whose primary focus in Pillar I is helping Australia buy and build nuclear-powered attack submarines — is a more diffuse effort which covers the rapid development, testing and deployment of new technologies in the realms of autonomy, hypersonics, cyber, artificial intelligence, electronic warfare and underwater systems. Shaw said his company and MBDA have been in talks with Pillar II contact points in each government since the beginning of this effort, and the press release mentions Pillar II without offering specifics. The collaboration, announced Nov. 20, is meant to produce and test a system that can work on a medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) drone that uses a newly developed sensor set to provide jam-proof navigation, as well as autonomy. MBDA developed the NILEQ sensors, which function in ways similar to fingerprint scanners, reading the terrain over which they fly. The system includes a detailed database of the Earth's surface. The sensors note changes between the database and what it senses, allowing rapid change detection and providing information that could be used for targeting. 'MBDA are convinced it has lots of different applications, so then they've decided to partner with us to explore taking that core tech and us integrating it with our navigation technology, and then trying to build an end solution for use on drones,' Shaw said in the interview. 'That's not something they do, because typically they build end products, right?' RELATED: When facing electronic warfare in Ukraine, small drones' quantity is quality The Australian general manager for MBDA, Tom Tizard, said in the press release that their new technology 'seeks to address the enormous demand for resilient absolute positioning information that will complement the existing navigation systems of airborne platforms.' Russia has made the risks of GPS all too clear, causing advanced weapons that depend entirely on GPS to lose much of their potency when jammed. Tizard praised Advanced Navigation as 'an ideal Australian partner to help accelerate the technology towards market entry. Navigation technologies that are not simply accurate and precise, but also provide the ‘resilience’ against interference, is what propels this partnership.' If it all works as designed, Advanced Navigation said in a press release that it believes the system 'will enable airborne systems to navigate unlimited distances over land without relying on GPS, and is passive and resistant to interference.' The venture is moving along at a clip, with the new systems' first test flight possibly happening before the end of the year, Advanced Navigation's CEO said. The MBDA agreement comes after the company signed in early September what could be a landmark agreement with South Korea's Hanwha to supply an already-developed precision guidance systems to Hanwha worldwide. It could, Shaw said the day of the signing, lead to as much as a 400 percent increase in business for the Australian firm.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aussie-navigation-firm-mbda-team-and-test-aukus-new-tech-sharing-muscles/	2024-11-27T02:07:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-2-e1732632837127.jpeg
