US should fortify, expand airbases to ward off ‘menace’ of Chinese threat: Report	U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Colorado Air National Guard's 120th Fighter Squadron taxi for takeoff during a training sortie June 7, 2017, at Kadena Air Base, Japan. (U.S. Air Force photo by Naoto Anazawa) WASHINGTON — A relative shortfall of air base fortifications on the part of the US has created an 'imbalance' in the Indo-Pacific that favors China, requiring renewed American efforts to shore up base defenses as a potential war with Beijing looms, according to a new think tank report. Since 2010, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has undertaken a vast campaign to expand and reinforce its own airfields resulting in significantly more runways and over 3,000 aircraft shelters — the latter enough to cover the 'vast majority' of Beijing’s combat aircraft, Hudson Institute authors Thomas Shugart and Tim Walton write in their report 'Concrete Sky: Air Base Hardening in the Western Pacific.' American efforts, by contrast, have remained 'modest' in recent years with much smaller growth of aircraft shelters and ramp space, the report says. In the event of a war over Taiwan, where observers fear China may invade and invite a US response, the report notes that greater Chinese airfield capacity within range of the island nation 'creates an imbalance in which PLA forces would need to fire far fewer &#8216;shots' to suppress or destroy US, allied, and partner airfields than the converse.' Some American efforts, like the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment method to disperse operations, have been rolled out in response to the rising threat of China, but the report argues that more is needed to protect vulnerable aircraft parked on the ground amid the advent of precision weapons. The report offers three specific initiatives for policymakers to pursue, with the first aimed at inducing China to spend more on defenses and less on offensive capabilities as a result. According to the authors, the US should field cheaper and more easily-produced standoff and stand-in munitions that could hold relevant airfield targets at risk, and which could be paired with other measures like new concepts of operation. Secondly, the report calls for improving the 'resilience' of air base infrastructure, particularly by building more aircraft shelters and expanding airfields — including for bases in the US. The authors warn planners not to have the 'distorted perception' of hardened shelters as 'an anachronism' just because American forces made such quick work on them in the Gulf War. They still have value for defense, especially when complemented with effective, active air defenses. Policymakers should focus on other ways to make bases themselves more resilient as well, including by ensuring damage can be rapidly repaired and that the proper 'low-cost and high-capacity' kinetic and non-kinetic defenses are in place, the report says. RELATED: &#8216;Sanctuary' no longer: New Air Force plan seeks to rejuvenate installations The report’s third initiative calls for evolving the US’s force design toward long-endurance aircraft that can operate from distant locations and spend considerable time in the air, as well as systems that can fly from damaged or non-existent runways. Regardless of the fate of projects like a next-gen fighter or futuristic tanker for the Air Force, which would likely satisfy requirements for operating at relevant ranges and in contested airspaces, the report notes that military planners 'cannot hope future aircraft procurement will obviate its current need to enhance the resilience of its airfield operations.' 'Worldwide, US airfields face the threat of attack,' the report says. 'The US Department of Defense can continue to largely ignore this menace, inviting PRC [People’s Republic of China] aggression and potentially losing a war, or it can face the reality and organize and resource its forces and infrastructure to prevail.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/us-should-fortify-expand-airbases-to-ward-off-menace-of-chinese-threat-report/	2025-01-08T05:02:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/F-16-kadena-scaled-e1736283319432.jpg
US completes $9B B61-12 nuclear warhead upgrade	Workers at Sandia National Labs prep a B61-12 for a safety test. (NNSA) WASHINGTON — Seventeen years after it began design and development, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has completed work on the B61-12 nuclear warhead, the agency announced today. The Last Production Unit of the upgraded warhead was completed on Dec. 18, roughly three years after production formally started on America’s updated nuclear gravity bomb. An October 2024 report from the agency [PDF] put the total program cost at around $9 billion. 'Completing the B61-12 on schedule is the latest example of what we’ve been saying for several years now: NNSA is delivering capabilities at the pace and scale needed by our Department of Defense partners and our deterrence requirements,' NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby said in the announcement. While the Defense Department has oversight on the delivery systems for nuclear weapons, nuclear warhead modernization is run through the NNSA, a semi-independent branch of the Department of Energy. The B61-12 life-extension program consolidated the older B61-3, -4, -7 and -10 variants while updating with newer technologies. Technically, B61-12 is not a 'new' nuclear weapon that increases the stockpile, as the US is taking the warheads from the older bombs and placing them in new housings. In 2020, the F-15E became the first jet to be certified to carry the B61-12, and in March Breaking Defense first reported that the weapon has been certified on the F-35A. According to the October 2024 report from the NNSA, it has also been certified to fly on the B-2, F-16, and German Air Force PA-200 Tornado jets, and is working towards certification on the Italian Air Force’s Tornados and the US Air Force’s B-21 bomber. Notably, the agency announcement says that with 'production of the B61-12 LEP now complete, NNSA will transition to producing the B61-13 bomb.' The B61-13, announced in October 2023, is designed to have a higher-yield in the range of a 360 kiloton blast, which would represent a major step up from the 50 kiloton B61-12. A first production unit on the B61-13 is scheduled for fiscal 2026, according to the announcement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/us-completes-9b-b61-12-nuclear-warhead-upgrade/	2025-01-07T12:50:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/b61-test-e1710272177859.jpg
Joint European force launches AI-enabled tool to track Russia’s shadow fleet, monitor undersea cables	The Russian oil tanker Eagle S is suspected of causing undersea cable damage in the Baltic Sea (Finnish Border Guard) BELFAST — The multinational Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has activated a new operation centered around a UK-led and artificial intelligence (AI) based reaction system capable of assessing threats to undersea cables and monitoring movements of Russia’s shadow fleet. Dubbed Nordic Warden, the operation began last week, said the UK Ministry of Defence in a Monday statement and follows reports of a Russian oil tanker suspected of causing damage to the Estlink undersea cable in the Baltic Sea. Key to the operation is an AI-developed computer program that can examine data from a 'range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest,' according to the MoD. 'Specific vessels identified as being part of Russia’s shadow fleet have been registered into the system so they can be closely monitored when approaching key areas of interest.' Should a suspicious vessel be identified, the system can use real time tracking and instantly send a warning to JEF members and other NATO allies. London also explained that Nordic Warden demonstrates how JEF is employing 'innovative technologies to boost European security, while supporting and complementing NATO’s own operations.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer added, 'Growth and national security are vital to our Plan for Change, which is why this government is working closely with our allies to protect critical national infrastructure, such as undersea cables.' In a statement coinciding with the UK announcement, JEF said that it is 'concerned about the recent damage to the Estlink-2 power cable and several data undersea cables in the Baltic Sea on 25 December 2024.' It condemned the incident as one which had caused 'direct economic and security implications for Finland and Estonia.' Finland has taken firm action in response to the alleged Russian sabotage, launching an investigation and seizing the Eagle S tanker. Last week, Finland's National Bureau of Investigation said that it was 'about to' wrap up seabed related activities related to the probe, according to a statement. Prior to the latest incident, Ben Key, First Sea Lord of the UK Royal Navy, had admitted NATO nations were struggling to deal with attacks on undersea cables and connectors because of rights associated with territorial ownership and international maritime conventions. In 2023, he singled out JEF as a potential aid to counter the problem, because it could provide 'some agility in the sub threshold space.' The 10 nation expeditionary body is made up of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/joint-expeditionary-force-launches-russian-shadow-fleet-undersea-cable-ai-tracking-system/	2025-01-07T12:12:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/9b0be5c6-88c5-5421-44ed-36f42a0d7a7b-e1736271996333.jpg
Navy would need billions more than estimated to build future fleet: CBO	Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and Cavour Carrier Strike Group sail in formation. The United States Navy and the Italian Navy held the first-ever bilateral Multi-Large Deck Event (MLDE) in the Indo-Pacific. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Daniel Kimmelman) WASHINGTON — Independent government auditors estimate the US Navy’s latest long-term shipbuilding plans will cost 46 percent more than historical congressional appropriations have provided and 17 percent more than the service projects. That analysis comes from a new report published Monday by the Congressional Budget Office, which is statutorily tasked with analyzing the Navy’s annual 30-year, long-range shipbuilding plans. The 2025 version of that document focuses on achieving a fleet of 381 manned ships, a target established a 2023 Navy assessment formally called the Battle Force Ship Assessment and Requirement report. The latest shipbuilding plan offers two shipbuilding profiles: one supported by the Biden administration and an alternative that assumes lower funding levels from future lawmakers. CBO’s analysis focuses on the profile supported by the administration. 'The Navy’s 2025 plan would cost 46 percent more annually in real terms … than the average amount appropriated over the past 5 years,' according to the new report. 'CBO estimates that total shipbuilding costs would average $40 billion (in 2024 dollars) over the next 30 years, which is about 17 percent more than the Navy estimates.' Auditors also project that to operate and maintain those ships, purchase aircraft and weapons, and fund the Marine Corps, the total Navy budget would have to jump from $255 billion today to $340 billion in 2054. (CBO routinely adjusts its estimates to remove the effect of future inflation.) Historically, the Navy’s price estimates are always more optimistic than CBO because predicting future shipbuilding costs requires analysts to make a series of assumptions about the costs of labor and materials, as well as the capabilities and characteristics of new vessels. The further out into the future an estimate reaches, the less certain analysts can be about the bottom-line price. The chaos inflicted on the defense industrial base by the COVID-19 pandemic is one example of a factor that had significant impact on shipbuilding costs but was impossible for CBO or the Navy to predict prior to 2020. Both CBO and the Navy acknowledge the costs of the 2025 plan have risen over the three options laid out in the 2024 shipbuilding plan. Auditors’ projections show an increase of between 7 and 16 percent while the Navy's estimates are between 5 and 14 percent. 'The growth in costs reflected in the Navy’s and CBO’s estimates for the 2025 plan is attributable to both an increase in the estimated costs of many shipbuilding programs and to the larger number of ships that the Navy would purchase under that plan compared with what it would have purchased under the alternatives in the 2024 plan,' according to CBO’s report. One key price tag neither CBO nor the Navy can predict yet is the costs of the future unmanned fleet. The service’s 2023 assessment concluded that the fleet should contain 134 unmanned ships, but due to the technology’s early stages — as well as levels of uncertainty about that fleet’s final composition from the Navy — the new report does not make any estimates about its price tag.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/us-navys-future-fleet-could-cost-46-percent-more-than-recent-budgets-cbo/	2025-01-07T11:02:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/8580602-scaled-e1733847381422.jpg
4 ways Trump should work with the China Commission to secure supply chains	Central Computer Processor digital concept (Getty images) When Donald Trump takes office at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, he will face a very different threat environment from when he left office four years ago. In particular, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) that he will confront will not only be the pacing threat that he identified during his first term, but will pose an even greater challenge than the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. The PRC is wealthier, in both absolute terms and relative to the United States, than was the Soviet Union. While COVID damaged both the American and Chinese economies, Beijing has nonetheless seen its GDP grow from $14.8 trillion in 2020 to about $18 trillion today. And China has more levers of power than its Soviet predecessor, able to mobilize its academics, media, businesses, diplomats and military to compete with Washington. Perhaps the greatest difference between China and the USSR: America is fully intertwined economically, including on supply chains with the PRC. And while that’s an issue lawmakers have been working to figure out, the focus all too often is only on what matters for cutting edge technologies, ignoring that China holds key positions in less noticed, less sexy supply chains that can nonetheless have devastating consequences. In 2019, for example, 'China accounted for 95 percent of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, 91 percent of U.S. imports of hydrocortisone, 70 percent of U.S. imports of acetaminophen, 40 to 45 percent of U.S. imports of penicillin and 40 percent of U.S. imports of heparin, according to Commerce Department data.' As Rosemary Gibson, author of China Rx, has noted, 'Medicines can be used as a weapon of war against the United States.' Similarly, although the PRC has not established a globally competitive position in terms of the most advanced logic chips, it holds a strong position in terms of 'legacy chips.' As defined in the CHIPS Act, legacy chips are semiconductors built on process nodes that are 28nm or larger. A far cry from the logic chips that are currently at 7nm and pushing 2nm nodes, but legacy chips are essential parts of virtually every piece of equipment that uses electronics, from microwaves to automobiles to combine harvesters to fighter jets. To address these threats, the Trump administration can leverage the bipartisan efforts of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (aka, the House China Committee). This committee has emerged as a vital platform for examining and recommending policies to counter China’s strategic maneuvers. By working alongside this body, the administration can engage in a truly broad-based, bipartisan effort to counter China’s supply chain position, and prioritize the development of strategies that directly target vulnerabilities. To reduce reliance on China, the administration must adopt an innovative and multi-pronged strategy that incorporates both domestic reforms and international collaboration: These measures will inevitably have trade-offs, including higher consumer costs and potential retaliation from China. However, prioritizing national security while mitigating economic impact requires a clear, forward-looking strategy. Just weeks after the US election, China banned exports of gallium, germanium and antimony. These minerals are critical for US defense manufacturers because they are essential in advanced technologies, including semiconductors, defense systems, and renewable energy. Gallium and germanium are key in producing high-performance chips used in radar, communication systems, and military electronics. The restriction highlights vulnerabilities in the global supply chain for strategic materials, underscoring the importance of securing alternative sources to sustain US defense capabilities and technological development. Efforts to reduce dependency on China align with growing bipartisan consensus that economic resilience is inseparable from national security. A secure and resilient supply chain of both cutting edge technologies and the broader range of critical strategic resources not only underpins military readiness but also protects critical infrastructure and ensures America’s ability to maintain its global leadership. As the House China Committee underscores, confronting these challenges head-on is crucial to countering China's ambitions and ensuring US sovereignty. Long-term investments in infrastructure, innovation, and allied collaboration will strengthen the US supply chain against future disruptions. Programs that incentivize advanced manufacturing and encourage partnerships with allied nations will position the United States as a leader in critical sectors such as clean energy, semiconductors, and rare earth processing. The Trump administration has an opportunity to act decisively, leveraging the House China Committee’s insights and bipartisan support for supply chain reforms. By addressing these vulnerabilities with urgency, foresight, and innovation, the United States can secure its economic future, protect its citizens, and counter China’s strategic threats in a complex global landscape. The actions taken today will shape America’s ability to navigate the challenges of tomorrow and reaffirm its position as a global leader.

Air Force clears BAE’s F-15 electronic warfare kit for full rate production	An F-15EX fighter jet taxis to its parking spot at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (US Air Force) WASHINGTON — A new electronic warfare kit for the Air Force’s F-15 fleet has been cleared to enter full-rate production, the Pentagon announced. 'BAE Systems is currently on schedule in support of Boeing’s F-15 EPAWSS LRIP [low-rate initial production] activities and is looking forward to supporting Boeing in the FRP [full rate production] phase of the program,' Kevin Fournier, EPAWSS Program Director at BAE Systems, said in a statement to Breaking Defense. Boeing confirmed receipt of the award but declined to comment more broadly. EPAWSS completed operational testing last year, and a June 2024 Government Accountability Office report [PDF] found that officials aimed to proceed to full-rate production before October 2024. A full-rate decision typically signifies satisfying criteria like design maturity and confidence in an underlying manufacturing process, paving the way to produce a system at a greater rate. Electronic warfare systems like EPAWSS help pilots survive in contested battlespaces by alerting them to dangers like enemy radars and offering tools to jam them in response, among other features. Underscored by conflicts like the war in Ukraine, officials frequently emphasize the need to quickly retool EW systems to combat emerging threats in the electromagnetic spectrum. Pointing to a demand for effective EW capabilities in the modern battlefield, Boeing officials have said they are exploring ways to turn the F-15EX into a platform similar to the Navy’s EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/air-force-clears-baes-f-15-electronic-warfare-kit-for-full-rate-production/	2025-01-07T08:54:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240216_f15ex_taxi_6959449-e1708094519988.jpg
Leonardo unveils British Navy Proteus rotary wing UAS final design	Leonardo's Proteus Rotary Wing UAS demonstrator is aligned with the Royal Navy’s Maritime Aviation Transformation (MATx) strategy – a long term Fleet Air Arm evolution plan that stretches to 2040. (Leonardo) BELFAST — Leonardo has released the final design of the Proteus Rotary Wing Uncrewed Air System (RWUAS) demonstrator, under development for the UK Royal Navy, ahead of its first flight expected later this year. Bearing resemblance to the manufacturer’s AW09 light single-engine helicopter, the three-ton aircraft is distinguished by a five blade main rotor system and modular payload bay. In a company statement today, Leonardo said that Proteus 'will be used to demonstrate advances in autonomy and payload modularity and interchangeability, whilst developing cutting-edge new rotorcraft technologies including design and manufacturing techniques.' Proteus sits under a four-year RWUAS Technology Demonstration Programme (TDP) contract, valued at £60 million ($75 million) and issued to Leonardo by the UK Ministry of Defence in July 2022. The demonstrator is aligned with the Royal Navy’s Maritime Aviation Transformation (MATx) strategy — a long term Fleet Air Arm evolution plan that stretches to 2040. Leonardo noted that the strategy includes 'building mass at sea and supporting future anti-submarine warfare missions.' To reduce design costs and quicken the pace of Proteus aircraft development, the manufacturer has also drawn heavily on 'components' from within the company’s helicopter and UAS portfolio. The Proteus technology demonstrator aircraft’s design has been unveiled by Leonardo @RoyalNavy and @DefenceHQ’s @DefenceES Future Capability Innovation (FCI) team. The circa three-tonne uncrewed rotorcraft will be used to demonstrate advances in autonomy and payload modularity… pic.twitter.com/hk5WQmAUE3 &mdash; Leonardo Helicopters (@LDO_Helicopters) January 7, 2025 'This design will demonstrate the viability of large UAS in the maritime environment and will function as a test bed for the development and demonstration of autonomous capability,' it added. 'This includes flight control laws and algorithms for large autonomous Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft.' Leonardo labels its production facility in Yeovil, southwest England, as the 'Home of British Helicopters,' and said that the site 'maintains an aggressive autonomy development roadmap, which covers the capabilities required to conduct autonomous flight and deliver mission capability.' The manufacturer has leaned on autonomy and cutting edge technology to support development of Proteus, which includes a digital twin and 'more than 40 components manufactured with advanced composite materials and the use of AI in its control software.' As Breaking Defense previously reported, Leonardo had settled on an assessment of 'potential systems' for integration before moving to a final aircraft design, with a model displayed at DSEI in 2023 largely based around intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, as well as maritime and logistics supply missions. Leonardo did not share details of key subsystems that will be integrated on Proteus, including an engine type, though France's Safran Arriel 2K engine, the AW09 powerplant, stands out as an obvious candidate. Phil Bartlett, head of future programs at Leonardo Helicopters UK told Breaking Defense in a statement that Proteus first flight preparations — a milestone set for mid-2025 — are 'progressing at pace.' 'We're pulling together a range of exciting new technologies for the Proteus demonstrator, so there's a lot to do and a lot of moving parts to get in place before that happens, but the team are highly motivated to deliver this key milestone and we're really seeing the benefits of our use of digital engineering techniques such as digital twinning,' he added. Echoing such sentiment, James Morris, UK Defence Equipment and Support, Future Capability Innovation maritime head, said in comments to media, 'This is an exciting and novel project that demonstrates collaboration, new ways of working with industry, the application of Agile principles and highlights how DE&amp;S can work at speed to deliver ground-breaking capabilities into the Royal Navy.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/leonardo-unveils-british-navy-proteus-rotary-wing-uas-final-design/	2025-01-07T07:12:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/image001-1-e1736259614244.png
How China’s new next-gen fighters could impact America’s plans for NGAD	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) SYDNEY — On Dec. 26, the People's Republic of China celebrated the birthday of its founder Mao Zedong by unofficially unveiling two new advanced aircraft designs. And while details on those jets are thin, experts tell Breaking Defense that there are hints about how the new systems could impact American interests in the region. The planes appear in videos that leaked out on social media. It's unclear the provenance of the videos, but the fact they penetrated China's formidable firewalls and have remained online indicates that the 'leaks' have official sanction. The videos show two planes of previously unknown design. The larger plane, which appears as an advanced flying wing design somewhat reminiscent of the American B-2 and B-21 bombers, has been dubbed in public discussions as the Chengdu J-36, called such because it is believed to have flown from Chengdu Aircraft Corporation’s (CAC) headquarters. The second plane, which is less clear, appears to be fighter sized and likely came from Shenyang Aerospace Corporation (SAC). Several experts on advanced Chinese and US aircraft say the larger J-36 is probably designed for long-range operations and to carry a large weapons load. (CAC also builds China's premier fighter, the stealthy J-20.) 'The tailless design is intended to be stealthy and the delta-wing design is intended to give it long-range. It is about the same size as a strike-fighter, so I don’t think it is intended to be a B-21 [bomber] analog,' Bryan Clark, an expert at the Hudson Institute in Washington, said in an email to Breaking Defense. What is the J-36 being built to do? pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc &mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 'With respect to the actual CCP advanced aircraft, these don’t look like aircraft with traditional air to air characteristics,' Dave Deptula, the head of the Air and Space Force's Association's Mitchell Institute, said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'More like very stealthy with large payload bays (to carry long-range weapons) so they can get close enough to get off first shots against U.S. high value aircraft…and/or deliver ordnance (missiles or bombs) against U.S./allied high value surface targets, to include surface ships.' Malcom Davis, a China expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense in an email that the 'large weapons bay on the J-36 gives it the ability to be an excellent long-range air interceptor that would be optimized against US and allied combat support platforms such as AWACS/AEW, tankers, and other reconnaissance MPA-type platforms.' That 'would make it more difficult for US Navy carrier aviation to project power inside the first island chain, if their key combat support platforms cannot survive in the face of a high-speed, long range, stealthy interceptor like the J-36,' David said. The Chinese have long made much of their long-range and high-speed missiles like the DF-21, with its presumed ability to strike US carriers and targets such as Guam. Because the smaller, second aircraft is harder to see, experts had less to weigh in on. But Davis posited that 'its fully maneuverable tail fins are highly innovative, allowing superior stealth when flat and superior maneuverability when active.' He thinks the SAC is a shorter-range platform, with less payload than the J-36, 'so maybe its optimized for operations within the first island chain, whilst the CAC J-36 has much greater speed and range and payload,' Davis said. 'Simply put, we need more information on the SAC platform to make sensible analysis, and this is why most analysis is on the CAC platform.' While the Peoples Liberation Army may have flown two new aircraft, the question is how they can impact American strategic thinking. As a whole, Chinese aircraft 'appear to be well behind their US counterparts in stealth, sensor fusion, and speed/maneuverability,' Clark said. 'This is because, while the PRC can steal or emulate the exterior elements of a US design, the mission systems, stealth coatings, and propulsion/control technologies inside are either highly-classified and therefore hard to access or difficult to replicate with indigenous Chinese technology.' He and Davis both pointed to the Chinese struggles to build jet engines with high-quality and durable turbines. 'China’s jet engine and avionics industries are immature, which is why COMAC has not been able to field a viable commercial aircraft until recently and even that aircraft is only being purchased by Chinese carriers who don’t have a choice. Many of China’s military and commercial aircraft depend on western propulsion and avionics parts,' Clark said. The reality, Clark said, is oftentimes the Chinese build weapon systems that physically mimic what the US has in order to 'demonstrate China’s technical prowess and suggest the PLA is not behind the US in weapons development.' Still, he and other experts painted the J-36 as a potential counterpart to the American Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program — which is currently in a reassessment phase with no guarantee of coming to full fruition. The images of the J-36 should give American planners incentive to keep NGAD moving forward, argued Deptula. The market appears to agree. At the start of the new year, stock analyst Scott Deuschle of Deutsche Bank downgraded Lockheed Martin stock from a Buy to Hold in part because of the appearance of the Chinese jets. He said they made the case for the F-35 less compelling and increased the need for NGAD. The developments in China are likely to accelerate the need for NGAD, and the ultimate success in fielding NGAD by the early-mid 2030s could…partially cut into the F-35 procurement program,' Deuschle said. Davis believes the J-36's appearance 'will inject new urgency into the US NGAD/FA-XX programs, as well as GCAP. There will be concern, especially in the new Trump Administration, that China could steal a lead in next generation (or sixth generation) aircraft.' He points out that 'NGAD is on hold pending review in the Trump Admin — and I'm willing to bet Trump will say &#8216;damn the torpedoes' and fund the full project simply to avoid being left in the wake of the CAC-J-36 and whatever may follow. GCAP too will become much more urgent in terms of delivery, and the large size of the J-36 — and the configuration of GCAP — may drive US designers to think about a larger platform, where speed, stealth, payload and range are more important.' Davis predicted the Chinese will push hard and fast to deploy these new aircraft. 'You will recall how quickly the Chinese moved to deploy the J-20 operationally after its first flight in 2011, and the Chinese will be incentivized to repeat or improve on that, most notably because the CAC J-36 and the SAC platforms will light a fire under the USAF/USN and DoD re NGAD and F/A-XX,' Davis wrote. 'Beijing won't want to waste an opportunity to humiliate the US by operationally deploying a sixth-gen platform before the US. So I'm tipping we won't be waiting ten years for this to enter service — look for the J-36 in particular to enter service before the end of this decade.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/how-chinas-new-next-gen-fighters-could-impact-americas-plans-for-ngad/	2025-01-06T23:55:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-R1-scaled-e1718985449640.jpg
Ligado files Chapter 11, commences restructuring to slash debt burden	As part of its post-bankruptcy restructuring plan, Ligado has signed an agreement with AST SpaceMobile to lease some of its spectrum for satellite-to-phone communications. (Image: Getty) WASHINGTON — Ligado Networks today announced it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is putting in place a restructuring plan that the company says will reduce its current debt load of $8.6 billion to approximately $1.2 billion — in large part financed by a deal with satellite-to-phone company AST SpaceMobile. In addition, creditors holding some 88 percent of the firm's debt have agreed under the restructuring plan 'to provide $115 million of additional incremental financing to fund Ligado during the restructuring process,' the Ligado press release explained. The bankruptcy, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, is itself not a surprise. The company has been signaling that might be an option since last year when it sued the Defense and Commerce Departments for allegedly 'seizing' its L-band spectrum license. That license was granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2020, but the DoD, Commerce and a number of other government agencies have been protesting the decision ever since, arguing that Ligado's plan to use that spectrum for cellular communications rather than traditional satellite communications would dangerously interfere with GPS signals widely used by the military, commercial aviation and myriad other industries for positioning, timing and navigation. Ligado has contested that claim. The deal with AST calls for the firm to lease 45 MHz of Ligado's mid-band spectrum — the same spectrum at the center of the DoD controversy — for use by its satellites in low Earth orbit providing connectivity with cellular telephones. That was something of a surprise move for AST, according to veteran telecommunications consultant Tim Farrar. 'The transaction associated with [Ligado's bankruptcy] is fairly unexpected, in terms of AST agreeing to lease their spectrum, because AST has been all about partnerships with cellular operators and using terrestrial spectrum &#8230; and building satellites to operate in lower frequencies,' he said. 'It's really a sort of 180 degree turn for AST to basically go and move to MSS [mobile satellite service] spectrum and move to these higher frequencies, where as they had said they were much better off with the low frequencies which were going to penetrate buildings.' According to Ligado's press release, AST 'has agreed to provide Ligado, subject to certain conditions precedent, with approximately $113 million of AST SpaceMobile warrants, and usage rights payments to fund Ligado’s payments under certain spectrum agreements. Additionally, Ligado will receive economic participation in AST SpaceMobile’s direct-to-device business in the U.S. and Canada.' For its part, AST in a press release today said the deal would help the company expand its services. 'Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering,' said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. Farrar said the likelihood is that Ligado will 'hive off' this part of its business as a sub-unit while keeping its one satellite in geosynchronous orbit active in order to maintain its spectrum license in order 'to continue to make their lease payments to Viasat,' which According to the Ligado release, the company had been for the past year making an effort 'to secure a comprehensive resolution with satellite communications company Viasat to restructure Ligado’s significant payment obligations to Inmarsat, which Viasat acquired in 2023.' Viasat had been planning to partner with Ligado on satellite-to-cell services. Meanwhile, the company said it has no intentions of dropping its lawsuit against the federal government — which, if won, could also be a source of income to pay off debtors. 'Ligado will continue to vigorously prosecute its litigation against the U.S. government to enforce its constitutional right to just compensation for the government’s unlawful taking of Ligado’s licensed L Band spectrum,' Doug Smith, president and CEO, said in the firm's press release. But that effort is likely to come with a twist, said Farrar, who predicted that Ligado will also pursue an effort to come to an out-of-court settlement with the incoming Trump administration. During Trump's first term, federal officials leaned strongly into efforts by the mobile telecom industry to take over spectrum traditionally used by government agencies and satellite firms for use by developing 5G networks. Indeed, Trump's FCC Chair nominee, Brendon Carr, along with the rest of the FCC, in 2020 voted to support Ligado’s application, and he was a vocal supporter of opening up spectrum for economic benefits. However, Farrar said that there are myriad complicating factors at play both with regard to the fate of the lawsuit and the conclusion of Ligado's restructuring plan. 'The question is, is this new administration going to be willing to settle that lawsuit?' he asked. And that may depend, he added, on whether new Trump advisor Elon Musk 'is going to weigh in as a example of this not being government efficiency at its finest? &#8230; The problem is if Elon Musk weighs in, because AST is obviously a competitor with Starlink, then all bets are off.' At the moment Musk's SpaceX, which operates the Starlink satellites, has been focusing on making alliances with terrestrial wireless providers for satellite-to-phone services, with an agreement already in play with T-Mobile. But as AST and others companies move to instead use spectrum allocated to satellite rather than wireless communications, SpaceX will need to decide whether it also wants to pivot, Farrar said. Further, he explained that government agencies including the FCC have to approve the Ligado/AST deal. And that may be impacted by the fact that Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on Dec. 17 opened a new study on potential interference from direct-to-device networks with GPS signals that has implications for the Ligado case. It is unclear when that study will be completed; industry representatives have until the end of this month to make initial comments on a series of NTIA questions. For NTIA, which coordinates spectrum usage by federal agencies including by DoD, there is a conundrum at play with regard to the impending 'direct to device' boom. On one hand, the Pentagon and other agencies are worried about GPS interference, but on the other hand, DoD in particular is itching to gain the benefits of secure satellite connections to phones and other handheld devices for use behind enemy lines. 'This is not something that is going to be solved in a few days or a few weeks. This is going to take months, if not even a year or more,' Farrar summed up.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/ligado-files-chapter-11-commences-restructuring-to-slash-debt-burden/	2025-01-06T13:50:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250106_phone_data_GettyImages-1443156022-scaled.jpg
Trump slams Navy’s frigate program over cost increases	Graphic rendering of the future USS Lafayette (FFG 65), named in honor of Marquis de Lafayette and his service during the American Revolutionary War. The Constellation-class guided-missile frigate represents the Navy’s next generation small surface combatant. (Photo by Chief Petty Officer Shannon Renfroe) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump criticized the management of the US Navy's Constellation-class frigate program today following cost increases due to what he called people 'playing around and tinkering and changing the design.' In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump appeared to refer to a deal originally struck in 2020 during his first administration between the Pentagon and the American arm of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri for the new class of ships. 'And they were going and really doing a good job, and the generals, you know, the Biden admirals and generals and all of the people that are involved, they started playing around and tinkering and changing the design, and this, you know, that costs. That costs a lot of money,' Trump said, according to a transcript of the interview posted on Hewitt's website. 'But the generals or the admirals went in and they said oh, why don’t we make it a little bit wider? Why don’t we do this? Why don’t we do that? And it was designed specifically for speed and other things. When you start making it wider, you start making it slower,' Trump continued, insisting the Pentagon should have purchased and built the ship without any changes made to the original design. 'We had it down, and they made changes. They always have to make changes. You know, these guys get in there, and they think they’re smart, and in many cases, unfortunately, they’re not smart, and they take something and they make it worse for a lot more money. That’s what they do. I mean, they spend more money to make it worse,' he said. Elsewhere in the interview, Trump praised his nominee for Navy Secretary, John Phelan, as a 'successful business person.' During his first administration, Trump took a personal interest in specific Pentagon programs at times, such as the presidential aircraft better known as Air Force 1. Robert O'Brien, Trump's national security advisor from 2019 to 2021, was known to be a Navy hawk and proponent for increasing shipbuilding cadences. A number of Trump's GOP allies on Capitol Hill, such as Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who now leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, used Trump's first term in office to codify into federal a law a mandate for the US Navy to maintain a fleet of 355 warships — a requirement the service still far from meeting. Without disclosing specific details, Trump also foreshadowed a desire to rapidly grow the Navy's fleet size. 'We’re going to be announcing some things that are going to be very good having to do with the Navy. We need ships. We have to get ships. And you know, everybody said oh, we’ll build them. We may have to go to others, bid them out, and it’s okay to do that. We’ll bid them out until we get ourselves ready,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trump-slams-navys-frigate-program-over-cost-increases/	2025-01-06T12:36:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/7888456.jpg
Kratos wins firm’s largest-ever $1.5 billion award for DoD hypersonic testbed	An artist's rendering of Kratos's Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle. (Kratos image) WASHINGTON — Defense technology firm Kratos has inked a deal worth up to $1.45 billion with the Pentagon to help develop a low-cost testbed for hypersonic technologies, the company announced today. The award, issued as an other transaction authority agreement under the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) 2.0 program, has a performance period of five years if all options are exercised. The team led by Kratos includes several players such as Leidos, Rocket Lab and others. 'Kratos is honored to receive the largest contract award in our company’s history, a testament of the value Kratos’ employees and team bring both to our Company and United States National Security,' Kratos CEO Eric DeMarco said in the release. 'This programmatic milestone underscores our unwavering commitment to making upfront investments for rapidly developing, and being first to market with affordable, mission-critical solutions that meet the evolving needs of the warfighter,' he added. The MACH-TB program, which began as a US Navy effort, includes multiple 'Task Areas,' with Kratos’s award falling under Task Area 1. For its part, Kratos will be tasked with 'systems engineering, integration, and testing (SEIT), to include integrated subscale, full-scale, and air launch services to address the need to affordably increase hypersonic flight test cadence,' according to the company’s release. Awards and missions for the other task areas were not immediately clear. Kratos last year revealed that its Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle successfully flew for a Missile Defense Agency experiment. A company spokesperson told Breaking Defense today that the Erinyes 'is one of the hypersonic frontends' planned to fly under the MACH-TB effort. However, the spokesperson added that '[t]here will be others as well.' Officials have long raised concerns that hypersonic efforts are stymied by limited testing infrastructure. As the MACH-TB program’s name suggests, the effort aims to provide a wide array of DoD users increased hypersonic testing capacity. Flying testbeds like one envisioned for the MACH-TB effort typically allow users to evaluate the performance of key subsystems under relevant conditions — meaning speeds greater than Mach 5 in the case of hypersonics. The Pentagon is racing to catch up with adversaries Russia and China that have already fielded hypersonic weapons. A recent successful test for a joint Army-Navy missile may mean that goal is closer at hand, as the Air Force moves forward with its own fast-flying projects.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/kratos-wins-firms-largest-ever-1-5-billion-award-for-dod-hypersonic-testbed/	2025-01-06T12:15:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Erinyes-e1736190052857.jpg
Raytheon secures near $1B Patriot order from Romania	Romania has placed an additional order for Raytheon made Patriot air and missile defense systems (Raytheon) BELFAST — RTX’s Raytheon has received a $946 million contract from Romania for the supply of additional Patriot air and missile defense systems, marking a third such order by the European nation. The acquisition is designed to replace Patriot equipment supplied to Ukraine and falls under a wider Western coalition military aid effort led by Germany, the Immediate Action on Air Defense (IAAD) project, to urgently co-fund and transfer a variety of modern air defense systems to Kyiv. In an announcement last week RTX noted that the new contract 'includes fire units consisting of radars, control stations and missiles.' Similarly, Romania's Minister of National Defence Angel Tilvar welcomed the order on X, sharing that 'The radars, control stations and missiles that will equip the next 3 Patriot systems for Romania, contracted in 2023, will strengthen Romania’s strategic air defense capabilities.' Pete Bata, senior vice president of Global Patriot at Raytheon, said in the announcement that 'Romania’s continued investment in Patriot is a testament to the nation's dedication to ensuring collective security, deterrence, and stability across Europe.' Norway and Sweden are partly funding the new procurement for Bucharest with Oslo contributing approximately $127 million and Stockholm offering around $27 million, according to figures from the Romanian and Swedish governments. Romania said last year that it was acquiring 200 Patriot Advanced Capability-2 (PAC-2) Guidance Enhanced Missiles-Tactical (GEM-T) surface-to-air missiles, valued at €1.09 billion ($1.13 billion), as part of a wider NATO joint procurement. Breaking Defense reported at the time that the $5.5 billion alliance procurement, which also includes Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, could lead to a combined total of 1,000 GEM-T units being procured. The missile interceptor has been designed to destroy tactical ballistic missiles and is a 'primary effector' for Patriot, according to RTX. Patriot has been credited with shooting down Russian Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missiles during the war in Ukraine, but delivery delays have been a point of tension in recent months. 'Sometimes these gaps are excessively long. You cannot do military planning. You cannot calculate what you [should be able to] count on, on the battlefield,' said Dmytro Kuleba, former Ukrainian minister for foreign affairs, last year. Alongside Patriot, Ukraine also operates Soviet-era S-300 surface to air missile systems against Russia, while the US and Norway have provided Kyiv with National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Additionally, Germany has also supplied IRIS-T SLM (Surface Launched Medium Range) missiles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/raytheon-secures-near-1b-patriot-order-from-romania/	2025-01-06T11:29:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Raytheon-In-Focus-lead.jpg
Tehran’s proxies are on the back foot. An Iran-Russia defense pact could revive them.	Russian and Iranian flags on a desk. (Getty Images) The sudden collapse of Bashar al-Assad's government in December 2024 has led many to focus on Russia, and its inability or unwillingness to prioritize Syria due to the conflict in Ukraine. But focusing too much on Russia understates the role that Iran, and more specifically Tehran’s proxies, played in propping up Assad. After all, Russia has been at war for almost three years, but it was only when Hezbollah was preoccupied with its war against Israel and Iran was no longer willing to spare resources to prop up the failing dictator that Assad's regime finally crumbled. Under the proposed 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between Moscow and Tehran, we are likely to see the Iran-Russia relationship strengthen over time, not just on a conventional level but in terms of Moscow’s support for Iran’s proxy forces. A renegotiated defense treaty is likely to result in Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iranian-backed Iraqi militias playing a more outsized role in the Iran-Russia relationship. With a renewed 'all-encompassing' Iran-Russia defense agreement, Iran is likely to budget more funds for its overseas proxies and increase weapons shipments, creating new opportunities for Russia to tap sources of black-market weapons and skirt sanctions. Russia has started doing this already on a small scale; in March and April 2022, Iran-backed Hashd al-Sha’bi militants shipped Iranian rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), anti-tank missiles, and Brazilian Astros II rocket launchers to Russia by sea, which were later used in Ukraine. The reverse flow of weapons also exists. Less than a month after Hamas’s horrific Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel, CNN and The Wall Street Journal reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad agreed to send Hezbollah the SA-22 missile system — an advanced Russian anti-aircraft weapon — via Russia’s state-sponsored mercenary Wagner Group. While officials never confirmed whether Wagner completed the delivery, the IDF later released photo evidence of other 'state-of-the-art' Russian missiles stored in Hezbollah weapons caches, smuggled over-land into Lebanon via Syria. According to an unnamed Israeli major cited by The Wall Street Journal, Russian weapons alone constituted an estimated 60 percent to 70 percent of the Hezbollah weapons confiscated by the IDF in the first few days of the 2024 Israeli ground operation in southern Lebanon, prompting major concerns about Russian-Iranian weapons proliferation to proxy militias. As the benefits of a stronger military and diplomatic relationship between Iran and Russia trickle down to Tehran’s proxies across the Middle East, more frequent exchanges of technical military-industrial knowledge and personnel could equip all parties involved with an arsenal of lethal technical expertise, allowing them to use one another’s weapons more effectively on the battlefield. As with the flow of arms, this type of communication is already taking place. On Feb. 12, 2024, Ukrainian intelligence reported that Lebanese Hezbollah and the IRGC were training Russian troops to operate Iranian Shahed-136s, Ababil-3 UAVs, and the Raad remote-controlled air defense system prior to their deployment to the Ukrainian front line. The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia provided Iran-backed Houthi rebels with targeting data earlier this year for their attacks on global shipping in the Red Sea, in addition to prior shipments of small arms. Just one month after its illegal invasion of Ukraine, Moscow began recruiting Syrian mercenaries for its own military, and later reports confirmed that Iranian proxies were training the new recruits alongside Russian soldiers at an IRGC base in Syria. As Russian troops continue to suffer heavy losses on the Ukrainian front lines, Moscow has recently turned to other Iranian proxies for fresh draftees; according to The Financial Times, Houthi militants are promised 'high salaries' and Russian citizenship in exchange for military service in Ukraine. FT also reported that ordinary Yemeni men were tricked into travelling to Moscow and then forced to sign enlistment contracts. This mutually beneficial exchange of technical know-how and personnel not only encourages continued aggression against the West but allows Russia, Iran, and Tehran’s web of proxies to develop independent production, maintenance, and operational capabilities. Beyond the direct military cooperation already taking place, a 'comprehensive' defense treaty could accelerate Russia and Iran’s abilities to manufacture each other's weapons systems. Russia has already built a drone factory in Tatarstan’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone capable of churning out 6,000 Iranian-spec Shahed UAVs per year for its war in Ukraine. One tangible deliverable of a Russian-Iranian agreement could be a Tatarstan-style production plant on Iranian soil, with the capacity to transform the logistics and smuggling networks that funnel Russian weapons from Tehran to Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza. With the capacity to domestically produce more of the Russian weapons it sends to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and various Iraqi militias, Tehran could significantly reduce the risk involved and time required to carry out successful smuggling operations. A domestic Russian arms industry would also afford Iran with the resources needed to resupply its own air defenses and rearm its proxies as Tehran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis continue to engage in direct conflict with Israel. Trading amongst themselves allows both Russia and Iran — two of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world — to self-sustain their own shadow economy, fueled by fleets of ghost ships and complex gold and oil smuggling schemes. Russia and Iran’s proposed agreement would see them cooperate on 'all the spheres of bilateral cooperation,' including trade, indicating that a renewed treaty could result in a greater reliance on backchannel networks to raise funds and transport illicit goods — which already sees millions of dollars flowing through the network. Although the United States continues to take decisive action against the Iranian-Russian illicit trade networks, a defense treaty could inspire more creative sanctions evasion schemes and prompt an uptick in weapons and oil sales between Moscow, Tehran, and Iran’s proxy network. The Russian-Iranian relationship has transformed over time from a marriage of convenience to a structured alliance between rogue states with shared economic and security interests. With this formalized agreement, Iran could secure both a steady supply of sophisticated weapons and also a P5 ally to safeguard its malign activities in the Middle East, potentially resulting in a more aggressive military strategy when carrying out direct attacks on Israel. This blanket protection afforded by Russian backing may in turn embolden Iranian proxies, prompting them to select riskier targets when attacking international shipping or American military assets. Russia also benefits from closer defense ties with Iran; it gains millions of dollars in weapons sales, Iran-backed forces to replenish its battered military still fighting in Ukraine, expert training on Iranian weapons technology from Hezbollah and the IRGC, and logistical support from a regional ally after losing its military positions in Syria. A renewed defense treaty between these two powers will render Iran’s web of proxies all the more dangerous by arming already destabilizing agents with more advanced weapons technology and the capacity to manufacture and ship arms to new battlefields.

Wrapping up 2024 and starting 2025, in the eyes of Breaking Defense’s reporters	Fireworks and light shows are held at the Champs-Elysees during the New Year celebrations in Paris, France on January 1, 2025. (Photo by Luc Auffret/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Big changes are on the horizon, but no one really knows what they will be. Talking with members of the national security community in the two months since Donald Trump won the November presidential election, that’s the clearest consensus: Trump and his team will be making major moves to the world of defense, but exactly what that’s going to look like is, for now, guess work. That uncertainty is reflected in the collection of pieces by the Breaking Defense staff, looking forward to 2025. But it also permeates the team’s reflections on 2024, which was a year in which the presidential election kept everything in limbo. That doesn’t mean there wasn’t news — we published almost 2,000 stories, op-eds and features on the site, and the editors have dark circles under our eyes to prove it. But 2024 felt like a transition year, and 2025 is going to be the payoff, in whatever form it takes. Each December I ask the staff to use the end of the year to reflect on their favorite stories from the year. In case you missed any of the year in review pieces, here’s your handy roundup: 2025 is going to be another busy one, both from a news perspective and for Breaking Defense, as we launch a new weekly video series and continue to deliver the best coverage of the defense sector out there. It's going to be a bump ride in spots, but we'll be there to guide you through.

Why Israel’s IAI is investing heavily in Indian startups	IAI has launched a new India Innovation Program called NeuSPHERE. (Israel Aerospace Industries) JERUSALEM — Israel Aerospace Industries is seeking to support start-up companies in India via a new program, as the company seeks to expand its relationships with a major market for Israeli goods, IAI CEO Boaz Levy told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. The NeuSPHERE Innovation Acceleration Program, announced in November, will see IAI giving Indian startups funding, as well as technical and marketing expertise, in order to help push capabilities into the market. It builds off 'over 40 years of mutual work' with India, Levy said, but better reflects the current goals of the Modi government’s Make in India effort, which emphasizes the need to produce locally. 'We need to tune ourselves and find the right ways to work together according to the new regulations in India,' Levy said in an interview conducted last month. 'This is why we decided our new strategy will be holding of several companies in India that will support our programs in India. Per a company statement, NeuSPHERE is 'aimed at focusing on the Indian technology startup community, in particular inventive deep-tech startups focusing on big data, signal and image processing, advanced navigation systems, AI and autonomy, XR-maintenance and training, green energy, advanced production, quantum, edge computing, Human Machine Interfaces and wearable technology.' Those technologies align efforts IAI has also made in Israel to invest in start-ups and take advantage of Israel’s nimble market that pushed new technology to the battlefield based on operational successes. IAI also opened a similar program to support innovation in the US. Levy stated that the company has already opened its first NeuSPHERE office New Delhi, but did not specify how many startups were involved or when the first partnership with local startups would begin. He sees the program as a gateway for better engineering processes and capabilities 'that we will demonstrate for our Indian users.' He added that 'the program is to build up technology. If the technology is there as a startup, then we will invest, but if this tech can bring benefits to our products then it could be a [joint venture], and that is a case by case situation and we are exploring. 'It is a long journey and time will tell,' he said, noting IAI plans to work to figure out what works best for each startup individually. India is a major market for Israel and a strategic partner of Israel, but Israeli defense companies also have relations with many other countries in the region, such as Singapore, Australia, South Korea and Vietnam. Asked whether he sees the work they are now doing in India as forming a hub for the wider region, Levy answered positively, but stressed that the focus is on the Indian market. 'It is a hub for IAI, a lot of our production has been done in India, some is part of the offset and some continues deliveries to other customers as well,' he says. 'We believe that the innovation program is a great starting point and we will continue to support it and see if we can make it as a platform for future collaborations with India.' Outside of the startup interest, IAI recently launched a new facility in Hyderabad. This site is involved in the maintenance of radars and is run by HELA systems. In addition IAI continues to be part of a multi-billion dollar deal that dates back almost a decade with India to develop missile systems. These systems, known as MR-SAM in India, are part of IAI’s Barak family. 'Barak is continuing in the three services in India and we are proud with the DRDO collaboration and the three armed services and I think that it symbolizes the good work we are doing together for the benefit of our two nations and more,' Levy said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/why-israels-iai-is-investing-heavily-in-indian-startups/	2025-01-06T05:55:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/India-Innovation-Program-Photo-credit-Israel-Aerospace-Industries-e1735935818356.png
Boeing taps Dana Deasy, former top Pentagon official, as CIO	U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick M. Shanahan formally, swears-in Dana Deasy as the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer, June 15, 2018 at the Pentagon, Wash. D.C. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Angelita M. Lawrence) WASHINGTON — Boeing today announced it is appointing Dana Deasy, a top Pentagon official during the first Trump administration, as the company's new chief information digital officer and senior vice president of information technology and data analytics. 'Dana is a well-respected, global technology leader who has a track record of delivering on innovative technologies across large and complex organizations,' said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg in a company statement. 'With the need to stay vigilant to protect against cyber threats, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence playing a larger role across all industries, our IT team will have a key role as we focus on meeting our safety and quality goals, delivering reliably for our customers and positioning ourselves for the future.' Deasy worked as the DoD's top IT official from June 2018 until the end of the Trump administration, notably leading the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing effort, as well as driving towards a 'zero trust' cybersecurity model. He was also the point person on making sure the department could function during the COVID-19 pandemic, when significant portions of the building shifted to remote work. Before his time at the Pentagon, Deasy spent four years as CIO at JP Morgan Chase, and previously worked for General Motors. According to his LinkedIn, since leaving office he has done consulting as well as 'some retirement.' His appointment comes as a rocky moment for Boeing, which is laying off 10 percent of its overall workforce as it tries to recover from financial turmoil on both its defense and commercial sides.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/boeing-taps-dana-deasy-former-top-pentagon-official-as-cio/	2025-01-03T14:48:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/4489494-scaled-e1735944289231.jpg

John Raven) WASHINGTON — The State Department on Thursday approved a possible $3.64 billion foreign military sale of RTX-made Advanced Medium-Range Air-To-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) to Japan, including up to 1,200 missiles and associated additional guidance sections. 'This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific region,' according to a notice from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. 'The proposed sale will improve Japan’s capability to meet current and future threats by defending its homeland and U.S. personnel stationed there. Japan will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces,' the notice continues. Details in DSCA announcements are not final; quantities and dollar totals often shift during negotiations, and today’s announcements technically tee up an opportunity for lawmakers to block the deal within a 30-day period, though such a step would be unlikely given the close military relationship between the US and Japan. The approval comes at an otherwise tense moment for US-Japan relations as President Joe Biden today followed through on his threats to block Japan's Nippon Steel from purchasing a Pittsburgh-based facility. The Washington Post reported earlier this week the Japanese company had sent a new offer to the administration, pledging to maintain American jobs, in an effort to salvage the deal that had become embroiled in election year politics, but those efforts apparently failed to sway the outgoing administration.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/state-approves-3-64b-sale-to-japan-of-air-to-air-missiles/	2025-01-03T12:38:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/6144937-scaled-e1735935891699.jpg
Europe braces for Trump’s second term: 2025 preview	President Elect Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly (Bloomberg via Getty Images) BELFAST — President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House looks set to spark tension and trouble in Europe with fears that he will end the war in Ukraine on terms of greater advantage to Russia. Peace plan proposals reportedly floated by the incoming president’s team include Ukraine ceding territory to its neighbor and removing future NATO membership for Ukraine. Trump’s NATO position would be in direct opposition to the alliance’s stated approach — that Ukraine is on an 'irreversible path' to securing membership — and runs the risk of opening up a high profile dispute with allies and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Rutte already appears to be pre-empting Trump’s tactics and has openly talked of making Ukraine’s hand 'stronger' at the negotiating table with Russia by urging allies to increase military aid commitments and ramping up defense production across Europe. Despite not singling out Trump’s purported peace plan ideas specifically, Rutte has increasingly talked of not allowing a 'bad deal' for Ukraine to go ahead by messaging that, 'what you can never have is high fiving' between North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and China's President Xi Jinping. He has also been clear that the peace deal must be fit for purpose because it is pivotal to the long term defense and security not just of Europe and the US, but the Indo-Pacific region too. More generally, Trump’s dislike of NATO will likely lead to uncertainty over the future of the alliance, though it remains to be seen if this time around, he will again threaten to pull the US from the institution. On several occasions during 2018, Trump privately said he wished to withdraw from NATO, according to the New York Times. Congress has since approved legislation that stops any president from making that move without approval from the Senate or via an act of Congress. Trump’s hands would not be tied entirely on the matter though, because he could call on presidential authority over foreign policy as a workaround, per Politico. However those permutations potentially play out, Trump’s undermining of NATO will ultimately continue to play into the hands of Russia, weaken deterrence, cast doubt on allied unity, and force European nations to look inward and take on more burden sharing. Enacted or expected rises in defense spending across Europe, notably from Poland and the Baltic nations, alongside moves like France and the UK discussing sending troops to Ukraine, appear to demonstrate that the continent will attempt to be more self-reliant on military matters. But there is little question that Europe will be considerably weakened if Trump's worst impulses are acted on.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/europe-braces-for-trumps-second-term-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T11:55:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_trump_laptop_GettyImages-1228653864-scaled-e1732226397800.jpg
CMMC 2.0 and the possibility of a cyber service: 2025 preview	Staff Sgt. Wendell Myler, a cyber warfare operations journeyman assigned to the 175th Cyberspace Operations Group of the Maryland Air National Guard monitors live cyber attacks on the operations floor of the 27th Cyberspace Squadron. (U.S. Air Force photo by J.M. Eddins Jr.) WASHINGTON — Over the past year, the Department of Defense has set the stage for how it wants to strengthen cybersecurity and information technology infrastructure against adversarial threats, namely the People’s Republic of China. But with another Donald Trump presidency on the horizon, all eyes are on him to see if he keeps the existing programs afloat or scales them back. Simultaneously, some cybersecurity experts and lawmakers have predicted that the president-elect will stand up a new cyber service. These are some of the programs and shifts to look out for in the next year. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] This year the Pentagon released its final rule for the long-awaited Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, which sets new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information (CUI). The 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) final rule, which lays the framework for CMMC 2.0, went into effect on Dec. 16, but the DoD won’t actually begin implementing the CMMC 2.0 requirement for contractors until the 48 CFR final rule is released — likely in the spring of 2025. However, in order to avoid a scramble to meet the new regulations with little notice, those requirements won't become mandatory until after a three-year phase-in period. The first official CMMC program was built under the first Trump presidency in 2020— one of the reasons why those in the cybersecurity realm believe the program won’t change under Trump. Stacy Bostjanick, the chief of defense industrial base cybersecurity in the DoD's office of the chief information officer, told a panel in November that CMMC 2.0 is not 'going anywhere.' 'CMMC was initially started under the first Trump administration,' she said. 'We have made such progress, and so many people recognize the need for it. It endured, and we went through and did the proper rule making steps to make it, to memorialize it. I don't see it going anywhere.' Not everyone is so sure that CMMC 2.0 is sticking around. Quentin Hodgson, formerly the Pentagon’s director of Cyber Plans, told Breaking Defense that given the fact that Republican administrations tend to scale back on regulations, CMMC 2.0 requirements could be reduced. 'It's possible that the new administration could decide to relook at that and say this is too high a burden or not the right way to approach improving cybersecurity standards in the defense industrial base,' Hodgson said of CMMC 2.0. 'I could see where there would be a relook at some of those things that were seen as maybe from a Republican or conservative point of view ... more heavy handed than it needed to be with respect to the private sector,' he added. Though experts and Pentagon personnel may have an opinion on the fate of CMMC 2.0, its future is in the hands of the next administration, and since we don't have a crystal ball, we will just have to wait and see what 2025 brings. The Potential For A 7th Branch In another effort to shore up cybersecurity protections and capabilities, some experts and lawmakers believe that with another Donald Trump presidency, an independent cyber service could be a real possibility. Though the idea of an individual cyber service has long been a point of contention within the Department of Defense, Hodgson told Breaking Defense that since Trump stood up the Space Force it’s possible that he could stand up a cyber force. 'This change in administration potentially could give more impetus to the creation of a separate cyber service,' he said. '[Trump] did that with the Space Force. It was something that the Department of Defense didn’t want, but he decided he wanted it, and it’s possible that that could also happen with cyberspace.' Separately, two Texas Republicans, Rep. Pat Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell authored an amendment in a draft version of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that called for an independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. (The study is being conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.) However such plans seem to have been scaled back in the final version of the NDAA. The new language was vaguer, calling only for the assessment of 'cyber organizations' instead of a separate cyber service — an important change, as advocates of a future cyber force had been hoping to hang their argument off of a report from the academies. Although the final NDAA language could be seen as a setback, Rep. Fallon told DefenseScoop that he’s still optimistic that the DoD could create a cyber force based on the study’s results. 'I am sure that the incoming administration will take a hard look at everything within the cyber realm to ensure maximum protection, efficiency, and lethality. We in Congress will do the same and I am confident we’ll see changes based on the level of threats we are faced with,' he told the outlet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/cmmc-2-0-and-the-possibility-of-a-cyber-service-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T09:37:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/230210_DVIDS_cyber_dark_4259914-scaled-e1676042385196.jpg
Army chooses BAE Systems for prototype base defense artillery cannon	Army Gen. Randy George, the 41st Chief of Staff of the Army, addresses attendees at the 146th National Guard Association of the United States General Conference, Detroit, Michigan, Aug. 24, 2024. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class Zach Sheely) WASHINGTON — The US Army has chosen BAE Systems to prototype a new artillery cannon, envisioned to defend bases against a variety of threats including unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and other advanced air threats. The system has been dubbed the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon (MDAC) and Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) prototype. The service announced the selection in a public Dec. 20 notice, which was sole-sourced to BAE, meaning the Pentagon did not hold a competition amongst private industry to determine its vendor. The Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office 'has a requirement to develop and deliver a full Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon System (MDACS) Battery no later than Q4FY27 followed by an operational demonstration in FY28,' according to the notice. 'A full MDACS battery consists of eight Multi-Domain Artillery Cannons, four Multi-Function Precision Radars, two Multi-Domain Battle Managers, and separately, no less than 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles.' The announcement did not include details about the amount of funding the contract would include, but Breaking Defense previously reported the Army was planning to spend $67 million in fiscal 2025 to kick off its efforts before investing more heavily in future years. (The government is currently operating under a continuing resolution, with funding stuck at FY24 levels through at least March.) 'Throughout the developmental effort, soldier touchpoints will gather feedback for Army requirements generation and prototype maturation,' the service wrote in its budget justification documents. 'MDACS will use the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) and conduct a series of flight tests culminating in a battery-level operational assessment in FY 2028.' An assessment is expected in 2028 to determine the technology can be fielded, according to the service, which is increasingly prioritizing base defense as it preps for a potential conflict in the Pacific.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-chooses-bae-systems-for-prototype-base-defense-artillery-cannon/	2025-01-03T07:56:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/randy-george-scaled-e1735919540725.jpg
The future of Syria, Lebanon and geopolitical moves in the Middle East to come: 2025 preview	Fighters walk in the Syrian presidential palace in Damascus' Mount Qasyoun on December 8, 2024, after Islamist-led rebels declared that they have taken the Syrian capital in a lightning offensive, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria. (Photo by OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Hopes are high that year 2025 will be one of peace in the region after an especially violent 2024. The fastest developing story, sure to dominate at least the start of the new year, is found in Syria, where leader Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, ending a 50-year family rule. Now, a coalition of rebels are in control of the capital, and the world is watching for how they will shape the nation's future — and whether democracy or extremism will blossom. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Additionally, this year is expected to reveal to future of Russian and Iranian influence in Syria, specifically the Russian military bases in the country. Will Moscow strike a deal with the rebels to keep Hmeimim air base and Tartus naval base as its power projection focal points in the Mediterranean or is 2024 the end of Russian presence in Syria? This remains to be answered and maybe sooner in 2025 than expected. After Syria itself, the region can be expected to keep a close eye on neighbor Iraq, which was already planning to end the US-led coalition mission there by September 2025. 'To be clear, the United States is not withdrawing from Iraq,' a senior administration official told reporters in September 2024. 'We are moving towards the type of productive long-term security relationship that the United States has with partners around the world.' Nevertheless, this upcoming year might put Baghdad under strain if ISIS and al Qaeda see a resurgence in Syria. Assad's fall in Damascus also may strain Iran's influence in Iraq, and could push Iranian-allied militias there to resort to asymmetric threats to compensate their retreat in other countries. Also in flux as the new year looms is the fate of Southern Lebanon, after Hezbollah and Israel agreed to a ceasefire there. On the Lebanese side, observers can expect the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to be the jewel of 2025, as it will take on a key role in maintaining the ceasefire to the south, but also contend with instability from Syria's collapse that could mean more stress on Lebanon's other borders. On the technical side, I expect international conferences to support the LAF to take place to boost its armament parallel to the increased role entrusted to the military. The military aid is expected mainly from the US, the traditional donor to LAF, France and Arab countries like Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, for their own defense Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates can be expected to boost cooperation with Western defense firms through joint ventures, while at the same time they're likely to keep investing at home to boost domestic industry. Twenty-twenty-five could bring on fighter jet news, as Saudi Arabia may find its way into the British-Italian-Japanese Global Combat Air Programme, and the UAE may redouble its efforts to join the American F-35 program. Last but not least, 2025 could see another big push towards normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, something the Biden administration had flirted with accomplishing before Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 attacks derailed that delicate process. Additionally Saudi Arabia might be able to seal the defense pact with US where Washington would be committed to defending Saudi territory in case of attack. Whether this pact, which was 'very close' back in May, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, will be a prerequisite to normalization with Israel remains to be seen.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/the-future-of-syria-lebanon-and-geopolitical-moves-in-the-middle-east-to-come-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T07:43:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241219_rebels_assad_palace_inside_GettyImages-2188884856-scaled-e1734640650830.jpg
Pacific political turmoil, AUKUS, and the looming Taiwan deadline: 2025 preview	Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on Dec. 4, after South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. (Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — Readers can expect the beginning of 2025 to be dominated by political turmoil in the Indo-Pacifc, with South Korea unexpectedly groping for an answer to the impeachment of its president, Australia possibly facing a closely divided parliament, Japan trying to build government that will last more than a year and China offering the prospect of more uncertainty in the highest reaches of its military. Once South Korea selects a replacement for impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose unexpected declaration of martial law sparked a fundamental threat to the country's hard-won democracy, the outlines of the new foreign and national security policies will begin to emerge from the political fog. The most likely outcome, at this point, seems to be a more amendable approach to China, more skepticism of the tight intelligence ties with Japan and a less hardline approach to North Korea. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Japan, whose government led by Prime Minister Ishiba Chigger, suffered a sharp rebuke from the public in late October elections, may struggle to maintain the intelligence-sharing arrangement with South Korea. The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) was originally signed for the two countries to share information on North Korea. Under the original terms of the deal, Japan would send satellite imagery and electronic information to South Korean analysts, who would reciprocate with human intelligence going to Japan. The agreement is also designed to allow the two sides to share real-time targeting information to counter North Korean missiles. The weakness of the Japanese government could also affect what have been rapidly tightening ties between Japan and Australia. For example, the two countries now speak each of other as partners second only to the United States, which is their primary ally. And the two countries defense ministers — flanked by outgoing US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — announced in mid-November that Japanese marines would make regular rotations to Australia for training and exercises. Further south, Australia may also face its own electoral turmoil with national elections likely to be held in March (they must be held by May). The Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is widely expected to prevail, but there is a reasonable chance that the election may result in Labor losing much of its authority as the group of MPs known as Teals could swell their ranks and the coalition of Liberal and National Party MPs might surge. That could be good for defense spending. The Labor Party, which has spoken bracingly of the grim regional strategic situation and the need for the three-nation AUKUS effort and for Australia to bolster its conventional major weapons systems, has actually let defense spending plans dip in real terms from 2023-2026. The election results will determine whether that changes. AUKUS, at least in theory, could benefit from increased support from the Liberal Party leadership. Japan and South Korea's efforts to tie themselves more closely to the so-called Pillar II or AUKUS — research and development of advanced capabilities such as hypersonic, cyber, autonomy, artificial intelligence and underwater tech — will depend on their and Australia's political results, as well as the assessment of the incoming Trump administration. On the other side of the geostrategic coin, in 2025 military planners, diplomats and strategists will be closely watching China as it continues to purge top military leaders, for reasons uncertain. Finally, all of this will be taking place in the shadow of 2027 — the year by which the US says Chinese President Xi Jinping has said he wants the Peoples Liberation Army to have the capabilities to execute an armed takeover of Taiwan. Australia and Japan are keenly aware of the date. Japan has significantly boosted its defense spending to record levels and published a strategy that makes Taiwan the keystone of much of its planning. While few experts believe Xi has set 2027 as the year he will actually try to take Taiwan, with only two years to go, military strategists usually plan for the worst.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/pacific-political-turmoil-aukus-and-the-looming-taiwan-deadline-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T05:33:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/south-korea-coup-scaled-e1733326013659.jpg
For the Space Force, terrestrial turf wars and rising budgets await: 2025 preview	The moon as a crystal ball. (Images via Getty / graphic by Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld elicited some snickers back in 2002 with his famous quote about 'known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns' bedevilling US intelligence about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. But those words seem pretty appropriate when trying to prognosticate what 2025 will look like for the US Space Force. From bureaucratic turf wars to extra-terrestrial combat, the old crystal ball is just pretty darn cloudy right now. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] There are a few things that pundits by and large agree are clearly on the agenda next year, with outcomes that are fairly likely. First is the likely growth in both the Space Force's budget and force size. As this humble scribe predicted at the end of last year, service leaders over the past 12 months sought to make its case for growth in personnel numbers, in mission areas and in budget. Indeed, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall — who, according to sources, has on more than one occasion and only half-jokingly called the newest military service his 'biggest unfunded priority' — called for the Space Force's budget to be doubled or even tripled. Given that President-elect Donald Trump takes personal credit for the Space Force's creation, service advocates appear pretty confident on social media that the service's budget and status within the Defense Department will rise. But given the administration's much-touted effort to cut costs by finding efficiency in government departments including DoD, few analysts are putting their bets on a funding increase anywhere close to Kendall's call. Second, Congress is already making noise about looking to 2025, the Space Force's fifth year, as a kind of deadline for the service to show first results from efforts to pivot to new ways of doing business — that is, to demonstrate tangible progress toward new, more resilient capabilities based on 'proliferated' constellations and the use of commercial satellites and technologies. Service leaders are likely to have to answer the question: Five years on, what new capabilities to meet the growing threat actually are in the field? And Space Force officials swear that they will have something to show for the investment so far. In particular, the Space Development Agency (SDA) is expected to begin launching its first set of satellites with limited operational capabilities, called Tranche 1, in March or April. Tranche 1 includes 126 Transport Layer data relay satellites, and 35 Tracking Layer birds for missile tracking, and the agency plans to have all of them on orbit by early 2026. Tranche 1 will be the first opportunity for SDA and the Space Force to prove that constellations made up of large numbers of smaller satellites in low Earth orbit can speed needed data to warfighters while complicating adversary targeting efforts. In addition, Col. Rich Kniseley, the head of the Space Force's Commercial Space Office, told Breaking Defense on Dec. 17 that he is confident his shop will award the first contracts under the service's fledgling Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR) program early next year. CASR is being developed as the Space Force's answer to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, and those first awards will be focused on commercial providers of space tracking data and analysis. Commercial industry officials are hoping CASR also will serve as a market stabilizer by providing predictable funding lines. Despite the intervention of White House budgetmeisters and the National Space Council, the long-running turf battle between the Space Force and the two key Intelligence Community agencies with space mandates, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), will continue to fester into next year. The most pressing source of strife is the question of who is in charge of buying commercial remote sensing imagery and products when and under what circumstances — an issue that a industry officials say threatens to undercut the nascent market. Government sources have told Breaking Defense that draft memos have been inked to clarify the lanes, in particular one between NGA and the Space Force, but that squabbling has broken out again in light of the pending administration change. It is anyone's guess whether, or how, the issue will be resolved over the next year. Savvy betters will be putting money on a marked shift in budget priorities next year towards the development of new kit and capabilities for targeting Russian and Chinese space systems, whether those be suspected killer satellites or more traditional military support systems such as intelligence-gathering satellites. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has spent much of this year advocating for such a shift — one that from all past evidence the incoming Trump administration likely will support. The unknown here is how far that tilt will go, given that the Space Force is still struggling to make a number traditional satellite systems foundational for warfighting fit for purpose. And as noted above the budget will not be unlimited. All things considered — the churn in domestic politics, the famous unpredictability of the incoming POTUS, the increasingly volatile international security scene and the runaway pace of technology innovation in the commercial space market — 2025 seems even more ripe than this year for supernova-sized surprises. Honestly, who had the fall of Syria or North Korean garbage balloons on their 2024 bingo card? What's next, extra-terrestrial craft among the ever-increasing drone swarms? Chemical weapons production in space? A materials breakthrough enabling a (squee!) space elevator? Obviously, all of those are pretty far out — but you never know. Proceed at your own risk, and hardhats are highly recommended.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/for-the-space-force-terrestrial-turf-wars-and-rising-budgets-await-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T12:01:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241218_space_crystal_ball_GFX.png
Trump administration inherits Air Force funding hurdle: 2025 preview	Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin makes remarks before presenting Maj. Brady Augustin the 2022 Koren Kolligian Jr. Trophy during a ceremony at the Pentagon, Arlington, Va., Feb. 7, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — In a March briefing with reporters outlining the service’s fiscal 2025 budget, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall issued a warning: Although spending limits imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act are set to expire by FY26, leaders would still have to make 'tough choices' about big priorities that year. The FY26 budget is now (almost) here, and decisions within it are in the hands of the incoming Trump administration. In conjunction with incumbent Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, Kendall’s successor — who has not been announced as of this writing — will officially chart the way forward for a service that is struggling with a shrinking fighter force, pressing modernization needs and a wholesale revamp aimed at countering China. An early preview of the problems facing the next administration was recently laid out by Kendall, who mused that the service’s plans for a next-gen tanker may not be affordable. Similar funding constraints apply to a next-gen fighter whose fate will now be settled by the incoming Trump team, a key program for the Air Force that Breaking Defense previously reported is supported by the service's internal analysis. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Other critical efforts additionally need funding in the upcoming FY26 budget, most notably two legs of the nuclear triad. As a seemingly successful flight test campaign continues, officials expect to ramp up production of the service’s B-21 Raider built by Northrop Grumman. And work on the new Sentinel ICBM, where Northrop is also the prime contractor, must proceed after a congressionally mandated review determined that there was no alternative for the increasingly expensive program. Compounding the service’s woes, the FY25 budget has yet to be approved by lawmakers, and likely won’t be until March at the earliest. Trump-appointed officials alongside lawmakers will then simultaneously have to finalize the FY25 budget and craft FY26 spending plans — leading one top outgoing Pentagon official to predict the FY26 budget may not arrive until April or May. How the new leadership in Washington influences the Air Force is an open question. But even two big milestones ahead that will likely be welcomed by the service may be interpreted differently by up-and-coming power players — notably Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-leads of a planned commission that will seek to slash government spending. A leading example is the service’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft program. The drone wingmen are set to make their maiden flights next year, as the likes of Ramaswamy call to pour more investment into uncrewed systems, rather than 'a wide range of other expenditures for new kinds of fighter jets' among other capabilities. A successful CCA program could bolster calls to scale back manned fighters, but for now, officials are pushing back against moving to fully unmanned combat. As Allvin recently told attendees at the Reagan Forum, his vision for the future consists of manned–unmanned teaming. In a similar vein, upgraded versions of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 could finally be cleared for combat in 2025. While likely to be celebrated by officials once it’s achieved, significant delays for the upgrade may only embolden the likes of Musk, who has called officials 'idiots' for continuing to build the stealth fighter. As always, it'll be Congress that makes the final call on Pentagon programs. And though incumbent Biden administration officials have said they’ve been working to a higher topline for a notional 2026 budget than what was the norm under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, it’s not clear if congressional conservatives — who backed the legislation in the first place — would support major boosts to defense spending. However, proponents of a bigger Air Force budget will still have allies on Capitol Hill under the new GOP majority. One key champion for a larger Pentagon topline will likely be Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is set to chair the Senate subcommittee that oversees defense spending. Incoming Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., has also called for a 'full-scale rebuilding of the shrinking US Air Force,' including by pressing forward with the Next Generation Air Dominance program. Speaking Dec. 10 during a virtual discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, outgoing Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter described two principal challenges awaiting the next administration: getting the proper resourcing, and ensuring systems are effectively integrated in a new, highly connected age of warfighting. '[I]f the Fiscal Responsibility Act shapes the resource posture of the nation, we will not be able to fulfill the national defense strategy,' Hunter said of budgetary challenges. Regarding the 'sophisticated integration mission,' Hunter then said that 'I think we’ve got people who can hit it out of the park,' although '[y]ou’re still going to have to swing at the pitch and make contact.' Lauding 'wins' notched under his tenure, Hunter added, 'there is a lot still to be done.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trump-administration-inherits-air-force-funding-hurdle-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T10:30:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/allvin-scaled-e1718387249735.jpg
From a new civilian leader to modernization priorities, Army changes afoot: 2025 preview	Gen. Randy George, Chief of Staff of the Army, discusses next generation command and control (C2) system capabilities with a 1st Infantry Division Soldier during a human machine Integration demonstration at Project Convergence &#8211; Capstone 4. (US Army/Sgt. Brahim Douglas) WASHINGTON — An upcoming civilian leadership shakeup across the entire Department of Defense next year could usher Daniel Driscoll in as the 26th Army secretary if Senators give their blessings. President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick — a former soldier and adviser to Vice President-elect JD Vance — to lead the ground service in early December. The gig brings with it a host of decisions including ways to move weapon development programs into production; revamp ones that have foundered in early development; and carve out efficiencies. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, who still has several years left of his tenure, talked about some of these challenges back in October. 'It should be clear to all of us that the days where we indiscriminately could buy an entire Army’s worth of inventory in a single program of record are gone,' he told an audience during the Association of the US Army annual conference. 'We can’t afford to invest in obsolescence. 'There are also some things that we are going to stop buying, old, stand-alone tech that doesn’t connect to our network, equipment that can’t operate in our [transformation in contact] formations, all of the outdated stuff that isn’t survivable on the modern battlefield,' the four-star general later added. 'Even if it was a requirement in the past, even if it was a program of record, we may have to stop buying it.' While he didn’t name names of possible programs on the cutting room floor, the service has been grappling with a flat budget as it pushed forward with modernization priorities categories — long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift, the network, air and missile defense and soldier lethality — that were inked out during the first Trump administration. By and large, those priorities remained during the Biden administration, with the exception of some systems being killed off, like the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), and others sent back to the drawing board. While service officials haven’t disclosed if 2025 will be the year they need to make sweeping cuts and prioritize funding, they do have some key decision points set for the coming 12 months. This year, for example, the service officially announced it was halting development on its Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) platform after spending several years integrating and testing out the addition of a 30-foot, 58-caliber gun tube to BAE Systems’ Paladin M109A7 self-propelled howitzer. It subsequently announced that five companies had been picked — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems — to demo their existing platforms. In early December, Director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks said those early evaluations indicate that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation,' which means the service may decide not to delve into another lengthy development phase, and a decision is likely coming in 2025. Depending on when a new Army civilian leader is ultimately sworn in, a couple of other big-ticket items may await including the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next and a single vendor selected for the Robotic Combat Vehicle Phase II. The Army is also poised to use next year’s Project Convergence capstone event to test out the service’s future command and control (C2) architecture to see if it’s on the right track. If testing there goes well, senior leaders will likely hand the prototyping project over to the Army Futures Command's (AFC) Network Cross-Functional Team to continue work. That team is 'already getting the requirements developers together. They’re already looking at the budget that it will require, and working [on] the acquisition approach,' explained Col. Michael Kaloostian, the AFC’s networks and security director for Next Generation C2. Part of that tentative plan ahead revolves around delivering a 'minimal viable product' to units later in 2025 for continued testing before the service begins fielding it to soldiers, possibly in 2026. Another hot topic across the government next year is poised to be the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. An initiative rather than a department, there have been threats of major cuts to the DoD, and for his part, George has said is in favor of finding efficiency inside the Army. 'We’ve talking about process innovation in the Army for the last year,' he told an audience in early December out at the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'If it doesn’t make us more lethal or our teams more cohesive, we have to be looking at, you know, should we be doing it? So I think we have to review everything that we’re doing in that light.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/from-a-new-civilian-leader-to-modernization-priorities-army-changes-afoot-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T08:14:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/8298347-scaled-e1734367699797.jpg
Ireland and Airbus agree to $95 million H145M helicopter deal	The Airbus H145M helicopter can be fitted with a range of ballistic and guided weapons BELFAST — The Irish Department of Defence has signed a contract with Airbus UK for the acquisition of four H145M light-utility helicopters, in a deal valued at €91.7 million ($94.6 million). Announced this week in a statement by Micheál Martin, Irish deputy prime minister and minister for defence, the new multirole rotorcraft — set to replace two aging EC-135 aircraft — will be used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), light attack operations, police air support and training. 'These helicopters will not only significantly boost the capacity of the Defence Forces pilot training programmes, but also enhance intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and light combat capabilities of our Air Corps,' said Martin. Dublin also stressed that the new aircraft will 'greatly improve' operational support for Special Forces and the Army Ranger Wing. General Officer Commanding of the Irish Air Corps, Brig. Gen. Rory O’Connor, said the aircraft 'will provide vital light tactical transport support to the Army, Navy, and Army Ranger Wing, reinforcing our interoperability with Special Operations Forces.' He added, 'These helicopters will also play an important role in shaping the next generation of rotary-wing pilots, ensuring the Irish Air Corps remains agile, adaptable, and mission-ready for years to come.' Dublin did not disclose which weapons will be fitted on the H145M fleet, but a first aircraft delivery is scheduled for Q1 2027. The H145M is typically outfitted with the Airbus HForce weapons management system, which covers a range of ballistic and guided missile options, including machine gun (12.7mm), canon (20mm), rocket (70mm), as well as air-to-air, air-to-ground and laser guided rocket munitions, according to company literature [PDF]. The latest aviation acquisition by the small, militarily neutral nation comes weeks after signing a €53 million order with France's Dassault for a Falcon 6X multipurpose strategic reach aircraft, which will be used for 'transport, airlift and medical capabilities,' per the announcement. Set to be operated out of Casement Aerodrome, Dublin, the fixed wing aircraft is set for delivery in December 2025 — and likely will play a VIP transport role when Ireland takes over the presidency of the European Union in 2026. More broadly, Ireland has committed to transforming its defense forces by 2028, based around the implementation of recommendations made by the Commission on the Defence Forces. To reach such an ambition, Dublin is focused on the Commission’s Level of Ambition 2 (LOA2) concept and addressing 'priority gaps' related to 'an assault on Irish sovereignty.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/ireland-and-airbus-agree-to-95-million-h145m-helicopter-deal/	2025-01-02T07:44:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/H145-EXPH-1745-11-scaled-e1702556338132.jpg
For the Navy, all eyes will be on the China-Taiwan question: 2025 preview	The Arleigh-Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG-52) transits in the Taiwan Strait. (US Navy photo by Ensign Samuel Hardgrove) WASHINGTON — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti has ordered the US Navy to be prepared for the possibility of conflict with China over Taiwan in 2027. But for better or worse, the Navy the US has today is largely the one it will have in 2027, and what last-minute preparations Franchetti can make will be my focus in the new year. In the Pentagon, there are three budgets that exist. (Technically, Congress has not yet passed an appropriations bill for 2025, but for the sake of simplicity, let’s assume they will by March.) That means the budgets in play next year will be the one being executed, fiscal 2025; the one being debated on Capitol Hill, FY26; and the one being crafted inside the Pentagon, FY27. In other words, the service has just one more budget cycle to make meaningful pre-2027 changes to its fleet composition that haven’t already been publicly disclosed. As Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., likes to say, 'Shipbuilding is a long game.' One year is not enough time for dramatic change, as long-time Congressional Budget Office analyst Eric Labs pointed out earlier this month. Which leaves the question of: What can the Navy do before then to prepare for a potential conflict with China? The answer the service has presented comes from Franchetti’s recently published Navigation Plan, which includes her 'Project 33,' the spearheading initiative setting the service’s focus on 2027. Franchetti lays out numerous goals but one that stands out to me is her focus on 80 percent surge readiness. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 'Think back to 9/11. We know that all of a sudden we need to get ships underway to do different missions … We want to be able to have a process through each one of our communities: aviation, surface and submarines, that they can certify a ship as combat surge ready, and get it out the door on the timeline that it’s needed,' she told reporters earlier this year. It certainly seems like a worthwhile goal, but the Navy’s struggles with maintenance keeping pace with operational tempo — even in peacetime, never mind wartime — are well documented. The CNO will be trying to rapidly overcome problems that I suspect many, if not all, of her predecessors, and their respective counterparts in the Commandant’s office, grappled with when they were at helm. Franchetti has also taken to using the phrase 'Getting more players on the field,' referring to building traditional warships, but also unmanned vessels, among other efforts. The service has spent considerable time and money in the first half of the 2020s going through the steps to incorporate unmanned surface and subsurface vessels into its fleet. And there are success stories such as Saildrones patrolling the seas in support of 4th Fleet. My focus in 2025 will be watching to see if the service can maintain its momentum in adding unmanned vessels to its fleet and when will we more frequently hear about those vessels’ inclusion in real-world operations alongside the manned fleet. Engaging Houthis alongside a carrier strike group in the Red Sea is a vastly different mission than surveilling the coast of South America. Lastly, there’s the money. Franchetti’s plan states candidly that without a larger budget, the service will face 'deep strategic constraints.' When faced with a difficult financial situation this past year, the service opted to heavily cut into its future modernization budget to make up the difference. Cutting funds for next-generation strike fighter development was one big bill payer. While conventional wisdom suggests a Trump administration will certainly request more funding for defense, whether Congress — with all its varying factions, even within the GOP alone — provides that higher level of funding is still very much a question in my mind. How the Navy copes with whatever money it does receive will be a key point on my watch list in 2025. For those who haven’t heard Franchetti speak publicly recently, she has said she has a countdown timer in her office indicating the number of days until 2027. China and its intentions toward Taiwan are clearly at the front of mind for the CNO; she has it put it at the front of mind for her service and, indeed, it will be front of mind for me in the new year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/for-the-navy-all-eyes-will-be-on-the-china-taiwan-question-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T06:03:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/6185323.jpg
Defense industry could see big shakeup under Trump: 2025 Preview	A model of the proposed paint scheme of the next generation of Air Force One is on display during a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Oval Office of the White House June 20, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON— No one could predict the twists and turns of the first Trump administration, even for an area as obscure and mundane as the defense industrial base, and it would be a fool’s errand to try to do that for a second one. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Instead, let’s break down the current state of play in the political environment, look back at the first Trump term, and think about some of the major questions facing the defense industry during a second Trump administration: Will Trump personally involve himself in defense acquisition, again? For defense acquisition nerds, Trump’s first term was marked by his highly unusual personal involvement in weapons contracting. Whether it was his stated desire to return to 'goddamn steam' catapults on the Ford-class carrier, interrogating Boeing executives on the possibility of buying a 'Super Duper Hornet' F/A-18 variant, or having personal meetings with defense CEOs on Air Force One and F-35 contracts, Trump delved into the minutia of defense acquisition in a way that no US president had done in the modern era. With the Wall Street Journal reporting that Trump has already spoken with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg about the Air Force One replacement program — as well as the return of the F-35 and drone warfare to the mainstream news cycle — it’s highly probable that we could see Trump once again try to make his mark on a program, putting pressure on defense contractors to highlight his deal-making skills to the American taxpayer. If I were a gambler, my money would be on Trump interference on big-name aerospace projects — most likely F-35 or Air Force One, again — but potentially also other fighter jets, including the Navy and Air Force’s sixth-generation fighter programs. What happens with defense spending? The fiscal 24 defense budget was constrained by the spending limits imposed by last year’s Fiscal Responsibility Act, and while final appropriations for FY25 won’t be passed until spring (at earliest), signs point to a budget that conforms to those limits. Those restrictions will be gone in time for FY26 — the first chance the Trump administration has to shape the defense budget, albeit not from the bottom up. While the groundwork for the FY26 was performed by the Biden-era Pentagon, whether the incoming administration doubles down on that stagnant Pentagon spending or bumps it up could be a bellwether for its approach in future years. Analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense immediately after the presidential election were split on whether Trump would be good for defense spending. Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with TD Cowen, pointed to boosts in defense spending under the first Trump administration and cited support for higher toplines among Republican leaders on the defense committees. However, whether defense budgets ultimately see a boost could be down to the interplay of House Republicans, as the razor-thin GOP majority in the House has given hardline fiscal conservatives enormous bargaining power. The Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, could be another fly in the ointment for defense spending hawks. Musk has declared his intent to use DOGE to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget. And although lawmakers, defense executives and military leaders have suggested they’re on board to cut wasteful spending (who doesn’t love government efficiency?), I don’t see defense companies lining up to suggest programs where they should receive less money. RELATED: Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon's DOGE to wow Is Trump a friend or foe to the defense industry, and who benefits? During his last term, Trump got cozy with the defense primes, celebrating the business acumen of defense executives such as then-Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and — before the Boeing 737 MAX crisis — Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. It remains to be seen whether any CEOs from legacy defense primes win Trump’s favor, but so far his regard seems to be centered on business leaders from the defense startup and venture capital world. The incoming president recently tapped Stephen Feinberg, who leads private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, as deputy secretary of defense. Other executives from firms like Anduril and Palantir are also reportedly being considered for major roles inside the Pentagon, and Musk could be helping to cut Pentagon spending despite leading a major defense company in SpaceX. One way this dynamic could play out is greater preference for inexpensive uncrewed systems — an area where defense startups have firm footing — instead of the exquisite, expensive weapons platforms traditionally made by defense primes. Pentagon leaders could potentially opt to sacrifice a discrete quantity of a major weapons system such as a single Virginia-class submarine or several dozen F-35s in order to buy hundreds of autonomous weapons and improved networks, Byron Callan, a defense analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a Dec. 18 note to investors. 'The tension between GOP fiscal hawks and defense hawks will likely push the administration to look for lower-cost options for defense in the form of autonomous air and naval systems. The role of persons with defense tech/venture/start-up backgrounds in senior administration positions adds firepower to this battle,' he wrote. Down further into the weeds are questions about the regulatory environment, changes to defense contracting, and how Trump’s overall trade policy influences defense contractors. The previous Trump administration took a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement, resulting in increased mergers and acquisitions, most controversially seen in Northrop Grumman’s purchase of Orbital ATK. (The Biden administration would later block a similar proposal for Lockheed to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne.) Analysts speculate that the second Trump administration will revert back to a more permissive environment for M&amp;A.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/defense-industry-could-see-big-shakeup-under-trump-2025-preview/	2024-12-31T11:45:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220427_trump_af1_model_GettyImages-1157175271-scaled-e1651086105288.jpg
Austria picks Leonardo M-346 light fighter to replace retired Saab 105s	The M-346, produced by Leonardo, showed off some of its weapons options at the 2023 Paris Air Show. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Austria has taken the next step in shoring up its small and aging fleet of jet fighters, with the formal announcement that Vienna will procure 12 Leonardo M-346FA aircraft. The announcement, made by Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner on Dec. 28, had been been anticipated for months. It comes four years after the neutral nation retired its Swedish-built Saab 105 trainers. The M-346 model selected is light fighter variant of the Italian firm's jet, which is best known as an aircraft trainer. Austria will buy the jets from the Italian government under a government-to-government contract whose details are still under negotiation, the Bundesheer announcement said. While the timeline and pricing for the purchase remain unclear, the Austrian government budgeted 1 billion Euros (currently just over $1 billion US) for the purchase in 2022. Leonardo declined to comment for this article. Until the M-346s begin arriving, the Austrian Air Force’s only combat aircraft are 15 Eurofighters, according to a Flight Global database [PDF] — six of them purchased second-hand from the German Luftwaffe and all of them in the barebones Tranche 1 configuration. (The latest Eurofighter upgrade is Tranche 4). The single-engine M-346 is a significantly lighter aircraft than the twin-engined Typhoon, albeit heftier than the 1960s-vintage Saab 105s it replaces. The M-346 first flew in 2004 as an advanced training aircraft, but like many trainers it can be configured for air defense or ground attack as well. It is currently operated by Italy, Poland, Singapore, Israel, Greece and Qatar, and Leonardo is pitching the aircraft aggressively both to Latin American nations and to the US Navy to replace its aging T-45. The M-346 is also used by the Italian-run International Flight Training School, where Austrian jet pilots have trained since the Saabs were retired. That training will return to Austria once the nation has its own M-346s, Tanner said in her announcement. 'By purchasing the jets, we are closing a significant capability gap in our air force,' Tanner said, according to an online translation of her German statement. 'In this way, we are not only bringing 100 percent of the training of our pilots back to Austria, but we are also significantly strengthening airspace defense. This increases the protection of Austria, the Austrian population and our neutrality against threats from the air.' Replacing the Saabs will also shore up the military value of Vogler Air Base and protect local jobs, Tanner said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/austria-picks-leonardo-m-346-light-fighter-to-replace-retired-saab-105s/	2024-12-31T10:45:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/IMG_4965-scaled-e1713255621953.jpg
China stirred the Pacific pot, Japan powered up and Aussie AUKUS anxiety emerged: 2024 in review	A China Coast Guard ship (L) is seen from the Philippine Coast Guard vessel BRP Cabra during a supply mission to Sabina Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea on August 26, 2024. (Photo by JAM STA ROSA/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — Turmoil, violence and reaction. That was the theme of 2024 across the Indo-Pacific, with China's belligerence and attempts to remake the international order to its liking at its core driving many decisions of the nations in the theater. In several instances this year Chinese forces engaged in hostile behavior, ramming Philippine ships, allegedly attacking Vietnamese fishermen and threatening Taiwan. But the actions were not without repercussions as they drove China's neighbors and NATO countries to sign major new agreements, increase exercises, sail more joint Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) and bang the diplomatic drums more loudly and more often. Japan made among the biggest moves in 2024. Tokyo and Canberra signed a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), clearing the way for regular deployments of Japanese marines to Australia, similar to the rotational force the US Marines have at what Australians call the Top End. Japan and Britain also signed an RAA. Japan also announced its biggest defense spending increase since World War II in September. 'The international community is facing the greatest post-war trial yet, and has entered a new era of crisis,' the first page of the their defense budget declared. In the Pacific Islands, scene of much turmoil over the last two years as China pressed to gain advantage in the region, the situation has seemed to stabilize in favor of Australia and its allies. Nauru, the troubled island that once had the world's highest GDP per capital and now faces possible ruin from climate change, agreed to accept $64 million USD from Australia in return for a veto of future Chinese activities in the tiny island. Nauru President David Adeang came to Canberra and signed the agreement on Dec. 9. This is similar to a treaty with Tuvalu, the Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union, which came into force in late August this year. In addition, the Pacific Island states agreed to join an Australian initiative to improve the region's police forces. Australia committed $400 million AUD ($253 million USD) over five years, which included creation of a regional training center in Brisbane, which opened the day after the Nauru treaty was agreed. The Chinese military itself also wasn't free of internal turmoil, which came into clear view with the suspension from office of a senior member of the powerful Central Military Commission and the previous disappearance of China's third defense minister. All that 'does not give a sense of stability within the PLA [People's Liberation Army],' Meia Nouwens of the International Institute for Strategic Sutfies told Breaking Defense earlier this month when the story broke. One of the few events largely divorced from China of great import in the region was the remarkable declaration of martial law — and its retraction — by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Now that Yoon has avoided immediate impeachment, there may be more regional stability than first expected, but his actions did, analysts said, put the crucial General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Japan at risk because the opposition is likely to suspend or scrap if should they take power. There is also concern among China watchers that should the opposition take power, they are likely to listen more carefully to Chinese policymakers than did Yoon. Meanwhile, threading through all these events has been the uncertain course of AUKUS, the massive effort by Australia, the UK and the US to help Australia buy at least three Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines and build a small fleet of SSN AUKUS boats over the next 20-plus years at an estimated cost of $368 billion AUD ($237 billion USD). Australia's defense budget will not increase in real terms until after the next election — likely to be held by March or April next year — at least. Sir Angus Houston, former chief of the defense force and co-author of the Defense Strategic Review, said in late November that Australia must increase overall defense spending to 3 percent of GDP to avoid cannibalizing the military in order to pay for AUKUS. The current plan would only boost spending to 2.2 percent of GDP by 2028. And there are signs of concern among senior Australian officials about budget and execution. Australia killed a $5.3 billion AUD satellite contract with Lockheed Martin, which would appear to be very sort of cannibalization Houston worried about. The Australian government claims it has protected the money and will invest in a new approach, but the cut occurred roughly 18 months after the award was announced. And in a little noticed declaration at a conference in the Indian Ocean focused on AUKUS, an Australian admiral voiced public worry that Australia’s generational effort to buy and deploy nuclear powered submarines was 'at risk' if the government does not take quick, decisive action on infrastructure. The military and government needed to 'get going' on crucial work to ready Western Australia for AUKUS submarines or risk falling behind, Rear Adm. Wendy Malcolm said. He added that Australia’s generational effort to buy and deploy nuclear powered submarines is 'at risk' if the government does not take quick, decisive action on infrastructure.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/china-stirred-the-pacific-pot-japan-powered-up-and-aussie-aukus-anxiety-emerged-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T09:26:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241213_china_philippine_ships_GettyImages-2167796597-scaled-e1734121917898.jpg
Middle East was designed by regional conflicts and increased indigenous production: 2024 in review	A cloud of smoke erupts during an Israeli air strike on the village of Sujud in southern Lebanon on September 25, 2024. (Photo by RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As the war drums fade in Lebanon and to the east the half-century Syrian regime has toppled, I've leaned toward labeling 2024 as 'the year the Middle East was reshaped.' [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The conflict between Israel and Lebanese group Hezbollah reached a ceasefire after a dramatic course of events including an Israeli attack on Hezbollah that included exploding pagers and walkie talkies, Israel targeting storage warehouses in civilian neighborhoods, and the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. The US-mediated ceasefire launched a 60-day truce between Israel and Lebanon starting on Nov. 27, with a monitoring committee comprised of the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Then, on Dec. 8 Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia while rebel forces swept through the country and captured Damascus. After the regime collapse, eyes moved to the fate of the Russian military bases in Syria and the potential collapse of an Iranian weapons pipeline to Hezbollah. In late 2023, the Red Sea saw attacks from the Yemen-based Houthi rebel group, which led to an international coalition to secure the waters. Notably, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were absent from these coalitions, and Bahrain was the only Gulf state to take part in the US-led operation Prosperity Garden. While parts of the Middle East reeled from those geopolitical earthquakes, the defense industries of other nations in the region doggedly pursued their own goals, including parallel focuses on localization and expansion with international partnerships. For instance, Qatar's Barzan Holdings is cementing the investments it's already made in platforms like unmanned vehicles, counter-UAS solutions, command and control systems and ammunition. 'We have built a good portfolio in the last seven years, and we are planning to strengthen this portfolio in these sectors,' deputy CEO Mohammad Al Marri told Breaking Defense in a March interview at DIMDEX in Qatar. 'We are not planning to diversify since what we have right now is competent enough. Our focus for the next five years is to ensure capability and sustainability for our platforms,' he added. UAE defense conglomerate EDGE Group expanded in 2024 its international reach with cross border cooperation plans, including founding an ammunition production line in Indonesia, signing an agreement with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to codevelop underwater solutions in the UAE, and signing another agreement with the Brazilian navy to codevelop counter-drone systems. 'This year [2024] for us is a year to catch up on our deliveries, our commitments, whether that is a delivery of a solution, or a development,' Hamad Al Marar, EDGE Group CEO told Breaking Defense in February. The firm also made its first stride in the space domain this year, launching a new company dubbed FADA. Saudi Arabia has worked on its ambitious defense plans this year, as it eyes to join the international sixth-generation fighter jets program, GCAP. Saudi Arabian Military Industries showed off its defense plans and platforms developed at second edition of the World Defense Show this year. Turkey made confident strides in its defense production projects. Its national fifth-generation fighter jet, dubbed KAAN, performed its maiden flight in February. Ankara also launched its first mostly indigenous communications satellite to orbit and expanded its deals with other nations, including its first export contract to a NATO nation.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/middle-east-was-designed-by-regional-conflicts-and-increased-indigenous-production-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T07:12:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-2173524754-scaled-e1734622532317.jpg
Russia doubled down on nuclear threats in Europe: 2024 in review	View of the Kremlin in the aftermath of a drone attack by Ukraine (Getty Images) BELFAST — This year Russian President Vladimir Putin ramped up threats to his enemies across the NATO alliance by lowering the threshold for a nuclear strike — a move that directly followed Moscow accusing the US of approving Ukraine to fire Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia for the first time since the war began. Shortly after, Washington went on to publicly acknowledge the policy to loosen weapon restrictions was in place, after months of resisting calls to do so. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Russia's new nuclear doctrine, signed by Putin in November, laid out in clear terms that any non nuclear power aligned with a nuclear state, or receiving support from a nuclear state — effectively all 32 members of NATO — will be considered targets if Russia thinks it is under threat. William Alberque, former Director of NATO’s Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Center, noted in an op-ed published on Breaking Defense, that 'In all, the new doctrine says that Russia will use nuclear weapons whenever the president decides to do so.' He added, 'But by expanding the role of nuclear weapons beyond … deterrence, and by expanding the dangers that could become threats — to include military infrastructure or exercises near its borders — it risks sending ambiguous or non-credible deterrent signals that could, in turn, require Putin to act out further in order to credibly deter the West.' On the ground in Ukraine, another 12 months have passed, over 1,000 days in all since the war started, without either side able to strike a winning blow — though Russia continued with slow advances. Kyiv has shown renewed resilience and ingenuity, most notably making a surprise incursion in the border territory of Kursk that featured an estimated deployment of 10,000 troops. At the time, the tactical gamble was looked upon by Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, as Ukraine's way of cracking 'open' debate in NATO over whether to allow long range weapon strikes in Russia, but it was only when North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk that Washington finally dropped long range weapons restrictions to strike inside Russia. It is estimated that Pyongyang has sent around 11,000 troops to Kursk. Losses on the North Korean side, shared for the first time in December by Ukraine's main defense intelligence agency, are said to amount to at least 30 dead or wounded in action, reported ABC News. Europe's efforts to increase weapons production on Ukraine's behalf and to restock equipment offered to Kyiv remains in the shadow of Russian industrial might. Morten Brandtzaeg, CEO of Norway’s Nammo, suggested that competing with Russian artillery shell production output on a 'one-to-one' basis is futile, and that European industry would be better served by concentrating on quality over quantity. He did share reasons for optimism however, explaining that European production took a 'huge step forward' over the last year, off the back of 'separate nations' supporting 'local industry' through government subsidies. Brandtzaeg added that Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany had all followed such a path. As the year draws to a close, top of mind for European leaders is the potential threat posed by President-elect Donald Trump; not just from the fallout that could occur from the US ending military aid to Ukraine — a move he has threatened — but a peace plan that might take Ukraine membership of NATO off the table. The sudden collapse of French and German governments in quick succession has not helped to allay fears that European unity on defense issues will suffer to boot.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/russia-doubled-down-on-nuclear-threats-in-europe-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T05:45:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/kremlin-scaled-e1683228223123.jpg
Turkey’s Baykar acquires Italian firm Piaggio Aerospace	A full-scale mockup of the Piaggio Aerospace's P.1 HH Hammerhead unmanned aerial system is presented at the International Paris Airshow at Le Bourget on June 17, 2015. (ERIC PIERMONT/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Baykar has been approved by the Italian government to buy Italian aviation giant Piaggio Aerospace in a move that thecompany says will expand its reach in the European Union. 'The relaunch of the company is guaranteed, with a clear and ambitious industrial vision,' Industry Minister Adolfo Urso said, according to a statement from the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy. 'After six years of waiting, we are giving Piaggio Aerospace a future, a strategic asset for our country, with a long-term production perspective, safeguarding corporate complexes and workforce.' Baykar outbid two other offers for the sale, according to the ministry's statement, though the value of the deal was not disclosed. Piaggio Aerospace was launched in 1884, and specializes in designing developing, manufacturing and maintaining aircraft, UAVs and engines. Piaggio Aerospace has developed the P.1HH HammerHead and P.180 Avanti unmanned aerial systems — giving it obvious synergies with Baykar, which rose to prominence on the back of its own UAV designs — and also conducts maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) services. 'It makes sense for Baykar to buy an Italian company. This will provide access to European markets, but also access to EU funded projects,' Caglar Kurc, a defense analyst and assistant professor at Abdullah Gül University, told Breaking Defense. 'I also think that this would protect Baykar's business with European countries if there are any crises between Turkey and European countries (or EU),' he said. Turkey was previously part of the Lockheed Martin-led F-35 fifth-generation aircraft program, with Turkish firms producing parts of the aircraft. In 2019, however, the US suspended Turkey’s participation in the program over Ankara’s purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense systems. Piaggio Aerospace was selected in 2004 by Pratt &amp; Whitney America to produce and supply components of F-135 engine for the F-35. With the purchase of Piaggio, it is possible Turkey could regain access to the F-35 supplier program. Spokespeople for Pratt &amp; Whitney did not respond to a request for comment by press time about what Piaggio’s current role on the F135 engine production line is or whether the company had any concerns about that role. A full return to F-35 program is 'unlikely' as long as Turkey has the S-400, Kurc said. But, 'Baykar, through Piaggio will become a supplier to F-35 [which] is pretty interesting to watch,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/turkeys-baykar-acquires-italian-firm-piaggio-aerospace/	2024-12-30T14:03:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/GettyImages-477405560-scaled-e1735574795992.jpg
Pentagon unveils new $2.5 billion package for Ukraine; USAI funds depleted	The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, firing a missile. The system, jointly produced by the US and Norway, is a critical part of Ukraine's air defense. (Photo: Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department today announced a new package of military assistance for Ukraine collectively worth roughly $2.5 billion, as the Biden administration in its waning days rushes to get aid to Kyiv out the door. Included in the announcement is $1.25 billion worth of equipment delivered via presidential drawdown authority, as well as $1.22 billion stemming from Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds. Drawdown equipment is taken directly from US stocks, whereas USAI funds can support a range of activities from training to the purchase of new equipment. The aid package, the Biden administration’s final of 2024, represents the depletion of USAI dollars Congress appropriated in an April supplemental spending bill, according to a White House press release. According to the Pentagon, drawdown equipment focused on Kyiv’s 'most urgent needs,' such as missile defense articles, artillery munitions and anti-tank weapons. For its part, USAI funds covered capabilities such as air defense and drones. The full list of equipment from a DoD press release is as follows: The package comes during a tough winter for Ukraine amid an onslaught of Russian strikes, including a Christmas Day attack on the country’s power grid. With USAI funds depleted, President Joe Biden is hurrying to spend remaining drawdown authority before President-elect Donald Trump takes office — whom many observers fear could turn off the spigot of military assistance for Kyiv. 'I’ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible — including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons,' Biden said in the release. 'At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagon-unveils-new-2-5-billion-package-for-ukraine-usai-funds-depleted/	2024-12-30T12:23:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/NASAMS-Firing-RMD-e1735589628352.jpg

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In Congress, most major defense issues were stuck in a holding pattern this year as lawmakers worked through a backlog of must-pass legislation under the restrictions of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, with little willingness to make big moves ahead of the election in November. With President Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election and the GOP takeover of Congress, we’ll see if big changes to defense spending and policy hit the accelerator. Breaking Defense will have more on what could be in the ether in a future piece, but a key question there is whether the Senate confirms controversial nominees in the national security realm, including Pete Hegseth as defense secretary and Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence, as well as who gets tapped for key service and acquisition-related jobs. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] For now, let’s rewind: 2024 started with Congress on the backfoot, funding the government through a continuing resolution that kept spending at fiscal 2023 levels and an outstanding request from the Biden administration for supplemental funding for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan. Last year’s debt ceiling agreement, which birthed the Fiscal Responsibility Act, also set the stage for a pretty stagnant spending environment for FY24 and FY25, with limits for nondiscretionary defense spending that did not keep pace with the rate of inflation. Congress narrowly staved off a government shutdown in March, approving FY24 appropriations halfway through the fiscal year. By then, the Biden administration had already released its FY25 budget proposal, creating a unique situation where the Defense Department was defending its latest request while trying to figure out the FY24 budget. Despite the Senate having passed a similar bill in February, it took until the end of April for Congress to approve a $95 billion defense supplement that addressed foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, as well as emerging requirements for the submarine industrial base. Given many House Republicans’ opposition to funds for Kyiv and Trump’s uncertain posture for future weapons donations, the package may have marked the last major collection of aid for Ukraine. The legislation also included a TikTok ban that would go into effect unless its Chinese owners divest from the social media app. Those provisions, which were backed by US tech execs from firms like Palantir, could be reviewed by the Trump administration, making the fate of TikTok in the United States one of the biggest technology questions for 2025. The biggest legislative fight over defense — one still not decided given the ongoing continuing resolution — is whether Congress ultimately agrees to boost funding over the FRA limits, which set a defense topline of $895.2 billion. Senate appropriators have argued for emergency funding that would increase defense spending by $21 billion without technically breaking the FRA caps. However, Senate and House armed services committees opted to keep to the FRA limits in the FY25 NDAA, which passed mid-December. RELATED: What to know about what's in the compromise NDAA In the realm of industry, several stories dominated the year. One was the shifting landscape at Boeing’s defense unit, which saw production challenges that resulted in financial turmoil and leadership changes. Another major thread was the instability in the submarine industrial base. While the sector has faced production issues since the COVID-19 pandemic, executives from General Dynamics Electric Boat and HII —the nation’s two submarine makers — lamented a lack of progress in the supply chain, as subcontractors struggle to make on time deliveries, adding schedule and cost risk. We also saw the continuation of two major plotlines: the ramp up of munitions production and the rise of the defense tech sector, as the Pentagon continues pouring funding into areas like drones, space and counter-drone systems through Replicator and other developmental initiatives.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/defense-spending-stagnates-as-election-dominates-us-politics-2024-in-review/	2024-12-30T11:21:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_rep_mike_johnson_GettyImages-1770847690-scaled-e1709241354686.jpg
DoD keeps pushing for the next-gen of IT and cyber systems: 2024 in review	US Sailors assigned to the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Carney (DDG 64) stand watch in the ship’s Combat Information Center during an operation to defeat a combination of Houthi missiles and unmanned aerial vehicles, Oct. 19. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Aaron Lau) WASHINGTON — With ongoing conflicts in the European and Central theaters, the Pentagon has placed updating its digital strategies at the top of its list of priorities. As a result, the DoD unveiled ambitious plans in 2024 to rev up its information technology and network capabilities, both at the highest level and within the services. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] In June, the Pentagon released a comprehensive information technology strategy, coined the Fulcrum Strategy, that aims to serve as a catalyst for 'transformative change' and a 'tipping point' for bolstering digital modernization within the Pentagon, according to the strategy. 'Fulcrum prioritizes user experience by driving capabilities that are intuitive, resilient and combat-ready from day one, and we think that’s important because it sort of takes the idea of having a strategy that is more functional base, and then flips it around and have it more warfighter driven,' Leslie Beavers, principal deputy CIO at the DoD told reporters during a media roundtable this summer. The strategy has four lines of effort: Embedded in the first line of effort was the initiative to implement zero trust principles — the idea that no user should be assumed to be who they say they are. Basically, networks should always be assumed to be compromised. The Pentagon began putting a heavy emphasis on zero trust after the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the DoD completely implement zero trust in its IT, operational technology and defense critical infrastructure by 2027. First, the Pentagon focused on implementing zero trust for IT, and because the department was able to make strides in this realm combined with past and looming adversarial threats, it has 'pivoted' its focus to OT, Randy Resnick, the director of the Pentagon's Zero Trust Office, told Breaking Defense in November. 'For OT and weapon systems, we are coming out with initial zero trust guidance. Why? Because the adversary is attacking,' he said. 'The adversary wants to get into weapon systems to prevent their launch, or mess with the GPS coordinates, so the DoD is looking to initially secure these things beyond what they are today.' While the DoD as a whole appears to be pushing for network and IT resilience, the Army has its own wide-scale plan aimed at creating an integrated command and control structure focused on data centricity at every echelon. The systems of systems approach, called Next Generation Command and Control (NGC2) was announced by Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George in May. The effort is being led by Army Futures Command, with Gen. James Rainey at the forefront of the effort. While still in the early development stages, NGC2 will create a consolidated network architecture based on a technology stack that AFC officials released in December. This includes an application layer, an operational systems layer, a compute layer and a transport layer. The point of NGC2: to make things as easy as possible for forces in the field. The Army is looking to industry to help develop capabilities and technologies that can bring this program to life. In doing so, the service has said that it’s going to stray away from requirements that are too prescriptive. 'We're continuing to better describe the problem characteristics of the solution space, but still we are not getting prescriptive in a sense of, ‘This is the technology we need, this is the vendor we need to get it from,’ those types of things,' Joe Welch, deputy to the commanding general of AFC said during an interview in December. 'It's still very much in the attributes of the solutions more so than the solutions themselves.' Additionally, the service said they plan to hire a few team leads instead of having one lead systems integrator. 'Having competition and giving our users opportunities to prototype with more than one solution is potentially powerful, and it also stimulates industry investment, because there's more opportunities for industry,' Mark Kitz, program executive officer for the Army’s command, control and communications-network portfolio told Breaking Defense. 'We certainly want to avoid this incumbency, right? We don't want an [integrator] who's going to lead us for the next 10 years, right? We want constant competition. We want constant new teaming.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/dod-keeps-pushing-for-the-next-gen-of-it-and-cyber-systems-2024-in-review/	2024-12-30T09:23:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240808_DVIDS_destoyer_control_8082819-scaled-e1723125369641.jpg
How the Pentagon domesticated the chatbot: 2024 in review	Sailors assigned to Navy Cyber Defense Operations Command monitor, analyze, detect and respond to unauthorized activity within U.S. Navy information systems and computer networks. (DVIDS) WASHINGTON — Large Language Models haven’t achieved human-like consciousness and transformed or shattered society — at least not yet — as prominent figures like Elon Musk suggested early in the hype cycle. But they also haven’t been crippled to the point of inutility by their tendency to 'hallucinate' false answers. Instead, generative AI is emerging as a useful tool for a wide but hardly unlimited range of purposes, from summarizing reams of regulations to drafting procurement memoranda and supply plans. So, two years after the public unveiling of ChatGPT, 16 months after the Department of Defense launched Task Force Lima to figure out the perils and potential of generative AI, the Pentagon’s Chief Digital &amp; AI Office (CDAO) effectively declared the new technology was adequately understood and sufficiently safeguarded to deploy. On Dec. 11 the CDAO officially wrapped up the exploratory task force a few months ahead of schedule, institutionalized its findings, and created a standing AI Rapid Capabilities Cell (AIRCC) with $100 million in seed funding to accelerate GenAI adoption across the DoD. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The AIRCC’s forthcoming pilot projects are hardly the first Pentagon deployments of GenAI. The Air Force gave its personnel access to a chatbot called NIPRGPT in June, for example, while the Army deployed a GenAI system by Ask Sage that could even be used to draft formal acquisition documents. But these two cases also show the kinds of 'guardrails' the Pentagon believes are necessary to safely and responsibly use generative AI. RELATED: In AI we trust: how DoD’s Task Force Lima can safeguard generative AI for warfighters To start with, neither AI is on the open internet: They both run only on closed Defense Department networks — the Army cloud for Ask Sage, the DoD-wide NIPRnet for NIPRPT. That sequestration helps prevent leakage of users’ inputs, such as detailed prompts which might reveal sensitive information. Commercial chatbots, by contrast, often suck up everything their users tell them to feed their insatiable appetite for training data, and it’s possible to prompt them in such a way that they regurgitate, verbatim, the original information they’ve been fed — something the military definitely doesn’t want to happen. Another increasingly common safeguard to run the user’s input through multiple Large Language Models and use them to doublecheck each other. Ask Sage, for instance, has over 150 different models under the hood. That way, while any individual AI may still hallucinate random absurdities, it’s unlikely that two completely different models from different makers will generate the same mistakes. Finally, in 2024 it became a best practice in both DoD and the private sector to put generative AI on a diet, feeding it only carefully selected and trustworthy data, often using a process called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). By contrast, many free public chatbots were trained on vast swathes of the Internet, without any human factchecking beforehand or any algorithmic ability to detect errors, frauds, or outright jokes — like an old Reddit post about putting glue on pizza that Google’s AI began regurgitating as a serious recipe in one notable example this year. Some defense officials said this year they a savvy adversary could go further and deliberately insert errors into training data, 'poisoning' any AI built on it to make errors they could exploit. By contrast, the Pentagon prefers AIs which are trained on official documents and other government datasets, and which cite specific pages and paragraphs as supporting evidence for their answers so the human user can double-check for themselves. None of these safeguards is surefire, and it’s still possible for generative AI to go wrong. But at least the guardrails are now strong enough that the Pentagon feels safe to drive ahead into 2025.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/how-the-pentagon-domesticated-the-chatbot-2024-in-review/	2024-12-30T06:11:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/240815_DVIDS_navy_computers_308045-scaled-e1723757674705.jpg
Army halted weapon development and pushed tech to soldiers faster: 2024 in review	An antenna farm is set up away from soldiers inside the command post. (Breaking Defense/ Ashley Roque) WASHINGTON — In what has turned out as Army Secretary Christine Wormuth's fourth and final year as the service’s top civilian leader and Gen. Randy George’s first full year as chief of staff, the duo shed high-profile modernization programs, revamped others and pushed tech down to soldiers at a faster clip. Wormuth, slated to wave goodbye to her post as the 25th secretary of the Army in January 2025, largely spent her tenure keeping the service’s high-profile modernization portfolio intact. This year, though, the axe fell on several initiatives starting with the early February aviation shakeup that ended development on the next generation Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), kept General Electric’s Improved Turbine Engine Program (ITEP) in the development phase longer, and shelved legacy Shadow and Raven unmanned aerial systems. 'We are learning from the battlefield — especially Ukraine — that aerial reconnaissance has fundamentally changed,' Army Chief Gen. Randy George said in a press release at the time. 'Sensors and weapons mounted on a variety of unmanned systems and in space are more ubiquitous, further reaching and more inexpensive than ever before.' In turn, the service is planning to spend dollars freed up by those decisions to ink a multi-year procurement deal with Lockheed-Sikorsky for the UH-60M Blackhawk line, give Boeing the greenlight to formally begin production on the CH-47F Block II Chinook, buy new drones and more. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The axe officially dropped on another big-ticket development effort just a few weeks later when the Army unfurled its fiscal 2025 budget request: It was halting development on its Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) platform. The goal was to use the modified artillery platform to launch 155-mm rounds out to 70km, an increase from the current max range of up to 30km. But after spending several years integrating and testing out the addition of a 30-foot, 58-caliber gun tube to BAE Systems’ Paladin M109A7 self-propelled howitzer, it was not working out as planned. However, the requirement for such a weapon remains and the service subsequently announced it has selected five companies — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems — to demo their existing platforms on a roadshow of sorts. In early December, the director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team, Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, said those early evaluations should be completed by month's end. And, he added, so far so good, with early findings indicating that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation,' which means the service may decide not to delve into another lengthy development phase. 'We're very pleased with what we're seeing so far, and even some on the autonomy side,' the one-star general told an audience Dec. 3. Eyeing soldiers' kit, the service also spent part of the year preparing industry for a possible shake up to its portfolio of night vision devices including the mixed-reality goggles dubbed the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS). Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment, for example, were tasked with running Microsoft’s most advanced mixed-reality system, IVAS version 1.2, through the ringer alongside dedicated night vision systems like the Enhanced Night Vision Goggle-Binocular (ENGV-B) and another system dubbed PVS-14. 'They’re going to provide the best feedback in terms of, here’s what the ENGV-B can provide versus a PVS-14 versus the capability inside of IVAS,' an Army official told Breaking Defense. The goal is for those Rangers to provide a 'more mature look' at how they use night vision while also answering questions about the ideal IVAS form factor, battery needs and more. Those answers are expected to help Army leaders decide the best pair up specific night vision devices with units and define IVAS Next requirements for an upcoming competition. George announced plans to expand his keystone inactive beyond infantry under a 2.0 push. The plan, he said, expands the bottom-up approach to two divisions, two Armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and reserve and guard formations. The service started with the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, 2nd Light Brigade Combat Team of the 25th Infantry Division and 3rd Brigade, 10th Mountain Division. Next year, it will be expanded beyond infantry under a 2.0 push and will include two divisions, two Armored brigade combat teams, two Stryker brigade combat teams, and reserve and guard formations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/army-halted-weapon-development-and-pushed-tech-to-soldiers-faster-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T11:34:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/antenna-farm-scaled-e1724767823161.jpg
Space Force gets loud and proud about warfighting role: 2024 in review	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman addressed the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 6, 2024. (Space Force Association) WASHINGTON — Over the past year, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has issued a series of internal 'Commander's Notes' that have sought to create the culture and operational concepts for the newest military service, with a firm focus on the Space Force's warfighting role. It's clear that as 2024 comes to a close and the Space Force celebrates its fifth birthday, what one observer called 'chest-thumping rhetoric' clearly has entered into the public domain — a change that defined how the service went about its public and private posturing over the last year. Saltzman spent most of this year charging up the forces to think of themselves not as support specialists, but as frontline capabilities — or, as he told Guardians assembled at the Space Force Association's Spacepower 2024 conference in Orlando, Fla., on Dec. 10, 'You are warfighters, whether you carry a gun or not.' [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 'In accordance with the law and at the direction of the president, you are trained and expected to carry out offensive and defensive actions against military forces of other countries, or support other military elements that do. When you're in a combat squadron, you're the first line of defense for conflict in space and your actions directly impact lives on the ground, in and out of harm's way.' In conjunction with this culture setting, top brass from Saltzman on down have become ever-more open about the service's plans and classified offensive capabilities to take out Chinese and Russian satellites on orbit in any future conflict — whether the mission be to defend American military and commercial satellites or to attack enemy birds being used to target US terrestrial forces. Saltzman told the Spacepower conference that 'space control' in now the Space Force's top priority because adversaries 'will absolutely try to disrupt, degrade and destroy US capabilities. This is unacceptable. In short, what we have, we will fight to keep.' Further, he stressed that China in particular 'can and will use their space capability to hold the joint and combined force at risk,' thus making it imperative that the Space Force be trained and equipped 'to make sure that doesn't happen.' Space Force Gen. Stephen Whiting, who commands US Space Command, told reporters on Dec. 11 that 'space fires is our number one Integrated Priority List gap.' The Integrated Priorities List is an annual compendium of requirements put together by each combatant command to inform the military services of their operational needs to be included in budget an acquisition plans. Whiting explained 'fires are defined in joint doctrine as the ability to affect or influence targets, and those could be targets in any domain that support the space mission. &#8230; If we are trying to achieve space superiority, there are targets that need to be influenced — in the cyber realm, in the terrestrial realm, [and] in space.' Lt. Gen. Douglas Schiess, who commands the Space Force's component for providing trained operators to SPACECOM called Space Forces-Space, told reporters on Dec. 11 that his first priority is 'to protect the joint warfighter from space-enabled attack, and secondly, to defend our assets and our allies' assets from attack from someone else.' To do this, he added, operators need 'effectors that can negate' adversary space capabilities. The loud new messaging moves away from the Pentagon's traditional silence on space warfighting plans — with the traditional focus on support services to the joint force such as communications and positioning, navigation and timing. Speaking to reporters after his Spacepower presentation, Saltzman said that in the past the Defense Department kept information about 'offensive and defensive' space capabilities 'close to the vest' — asserting that some of the rationale was 'just kind of hand-wringing' rather than a need to 'protect' anything. 'We have to conduct counter space operations to deny an adversary the ability to target our forces,' he said, and that requires 'offensive and defensive capabilities. &#8230; I have no problem saying that we are gonna be ready to contest the space domain,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/space-force-gets-loud-and-proud-about-warfighting-role-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T09:58:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/RS_20241210_0067-151-scaled-e1734122255777.jpg
A year of next-gen fighter doubts for the Air Force: 2024 in review	Lockheed Martin Skunk Works concept art of a sixth-generation fighter. (Lockheed Martin) WASHINGTON — After years of development, the Air Force broke cover on its futuristic stealth fighter in May 2023 to announce that a winner would be picked to build the platform in 2024, teeing up the highly anticipated next generation of airpower. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The trouble started this summer, when whispers about NGAD’s fate first started swirling around Washington. Budget constraints bearing down on the Air Force — thanks to high-profile headaches like cost overruns with the nuclear-tipped Sentinel ballistic missile and pricey new programs like the B-21 Raider — began to exact their toll as the service built out its fiscal 2026 budget. In June, Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin appeared to suggest NGAD was in hot water, equivocating when asked whether the service could commit to the program. Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall subsequently confirmed the stealth fighter program was on pause, and bowing to the obvious, the service announced this month that the 'way ahead' for the program would officially be decided by the Trump administration. The service’s own capabilities have also rapidly evolved, featuring tech like space-based ISR and comms, drone wingmen dubbed Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) and a budding 'kill web' that threads together disparate sensors, weapons and shooters to neutralize a threat. Any NGAD fighter is 'going to need to work with CCAs. It’s going to need to work in an architecture which includes space-based support and other off-board support and an architecture that uses our most advanced weapons,' Kendall said in July. 'So we’ve got an opportunity here to really just be careful and make sure we’re on the right path before we make the final commitment.' The NGAD challenge also lies in unforgiving geography. Should American troops clash with the PLA, particularly over the Taiwan Strait, Chinese forces would enjoy a significant homefield advantage. Beijing’s burgeoning missile arsenal further threatens to lay waste to critical American installations in the region, which includes aircraft that could be caught in the crossfire while parked on the ground — creating a rift between the Air Force and Army on air base defense. 'The infrastructure that’s required to support an F-22 class aircraft, if you will, leads to some vulnerabilities. Runway length, for example,' Kendall previously told Breaking Defense. The same is true for engine-makers GE Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney, who are separately competing to build the NGAD fighter’s powerplant. After the Air Force passed on re-engining the F-35, the Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion effort, the program name for the NGAD engine, appears to be the only avenue left to carry revolutionary, 'adaptive' powerplant technologies forward. Ironically, the Air Force’s NGAD pause could very well prompt the Navy to go first on a different next-gen fighter. While the Air Force wrestles with its sixth-gen design, a Navy official previously told Aviation Week the sea-based service remains confident in its plans, and is still on track to award an engineering and manufacturing development contract by the end of fiscal 2025 for its own future airframe. Though all this, Kendall has maintained he's confident an NGAD fighter, in some form, will be built. And to that end, internal Air Force analysis now supports the development of a manned, next-gen platform, Breaking Defense previously reported. But a new administration will take over in January, where 'Department of Government Efficiency' co-leads Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have both called into question current fighter procurement efforts. What the Trump administration will do is unclear, though if history is any guide, manned fighter jets may be here to stay for at least one more generation. Like the flying car, the death of the manned fighter has been predicted for decades, but neither have come to pass.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/a-year-of-next-gen-fighter-doubts-for-the-air-force-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T07:58:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/11/Screen-Shot-2020-11-17-at-10.28.29-AM.png
Tensions between Navy and industry in the spotlight: 2024 in review	Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro, crosses the walkway of guided-missile destroyer USS Preble (DDG 88) following a tour of the ship, Feb. 16. Preble is an Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer homeported in San Diego. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Olivia Rucker) WASHINGTON — In 2024, the US Navy’s frustrations with its industrial base were on public display. Whether those frustrations were justified depends on who you ask. I've been watching the US Navy and industry interact with one another since 2017. My view is limited to what happens in open forums, granted, but nonetheless, it represents the same view the rest of the public has. What one quickly realizes as one follows admirals and secretaries around from conference to conference is that the visible relationship between industry and military is typically sterilized. There's a lot of talk about partnerships and camaraderie, patriotism and love for America, an ingrained sense of service to country. I bring all that up to juxtapose it with what we saw this year. Acquisition executive Nickolas Guertin published a one-page document outlining the severe delays of each major shipbuilding program and highlighting their associated prime contractors. Uniformed commanders publicly voiced their frustrations about industry's production cadence for munitions. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] And Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro on multiple occasions tore into industry for what he said were excessive stock buy backs and industry's failure to re-invest in their own facilities. He chastised American shipbuilders for, in his view, failing to rise to the occasion in the way South Korean and Japanese industries have done in their own quests to compete with China. In one notable speech, Del Toro mentioned the possibility of personnel misconduct on industry’s part and previewed an office that will go after those individuals. To be clear, I do not think there is anything wrong with the Navy expecting its contractors to act ethically and follow the law. But I do find it odd that Del Toro — the service's civilian leader handpicked by the president — would raise that subject voluntarily to a friendly audience in a Navy-centric city like San Diego. When I asked Del Toro about his posture towards industry during this year's Sea Air Space Exposition, he told me the broader message he was trying to send was one about industry respecting the investment taxpayers have been making into the industrial base. 'It takes a team effort and the American taxpayers are making enormous investments in the industrial base,' he said at the time. 'I need industry to make the proper capital investments themselves. And if you take a look at the major primes in this country, for example, that work in the defense industry, about a third of them are putting enormous buybacks into their own stocks. That prevents basically the utilization of those monies to be able to recapitalize those industries to try to get us to a better place. So that's what I'm saying. Everybody's got to do their part, and we expect industry to do their part as well.' I should note that in the latter half of the year the secretary noticeably toned down his criticisms of industry in public forums. Nevertheless, when I've asked executives about Del Toro's prodding, they usually respond with shrugs. No one wants to get into a public shouting match with their customer and, at the end of the day, it's not Del Toro sitting on the other side of the table when contracts are negotiated, written and signed. The backdrop to all of this has been a US Navy under as much pressure as its ever been in modern history. The October 2023 attack on Israel resulted in American destroyers seeing more action than they have in years. That in turn has led to increased pressure both on munitions production and the maintenance requirements for the fleet. The service has infamously struggled with the ship maintenance required to upkeep a blue water navy even in peacetime — rotating carrier strike groups to the Middle East to aid Israel only added to that pressure. While Del Toro will ultimately leave office by Jan. 20, the munitions shortages, the ship maintenance backlogs and the increasingly higher operational tempo the Navy has had to adjust to will likely all follow the service well into 2025 — and perhaps beyond.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/tensions-between-navy-and-industry-in-the-spotlight-2024-in-review/	2024-12-27T06:02:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/8244067-scaled-e1712070593740.jpg
We fed every 2024 Pentagon briefing into ChatGPT. Here’s what it thought.	WASHINGTON -Tech. Sgt. Bryan Scharman, Non-commissioned Officer In Charge of Cyber Support of the 151st Communications Flight in the Utah National Guard, works on setting up communications between supported agencies during the 58th Presidential Inauguration. (National Guard photo by Tech. Jonathan Young, JTF-DC) MOBILE, Ala. — If 2023 was the year that OpenAI's ChatGPT exploded onto the public scene, 2024 was the year the US military and Intelligence Community began carefully wading into the potential of generative AI. Officials have said that kind of tech could be used for everything from streamlining acquisition to sifting through a mountain of open source data for relatively low-level intelligence analysis. And while the Pentagon has grown to trust generative AI enough to build a new 'cell' around it's use, many officials are still cautious because the cutting edge technology is not without its risks, especially its propensity to 'hallucinate' false information. Echoing many other officials this year, Jimmy Hall, chief information officer in the State Department's intelligence wing, said last week, 'We want to be able to use a gen AI,' but the office is 'just not ready.' 'As we step our way through, we don't want to be so quick to the trigger that we put our situation where civil liberties or privacy or something else is violated,' Hall said in a webinar put on by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. 'So we're really behind the scenes testing a few items, mechanisms, systems, tools, before we're ready to roll that out. But we do want to take advantage of emerging technology.' So while generative AIs may not be fully ready for prime time in many ways, the fact that the US security establishment is eagerly pursuing use cases makes it worthy of some of our own experimentation. As such, below is an end-of-year interview with ChatGPT, which has been armed with a document compiled by Breaking Defense containing every Pentagon transcript posted on Defense.gov since Jan. 1, 2024 up to the middle of last week. This interview was conducted with the less robust, free version of ChatGPT, GPT-4o mini, and the application has been directed to keep its answers shorter than usual. The following transcript has been slightly edited and additional context has been added in Editor's Notes. Breaking Defense: What was the biggest development in the world of defense in 2024? ChatGPT: The biggest development in defense in 2024 was the launch and execution of Operation Prosperity Guardian, a multinational coalition effort involving over 22 nations to secure vital shipping lanes in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden from escalating Houthi attacks, supported by Iran. This operation demonstrated a significant shift towards proactive, collective international defense strategies, leveraging advanced technologies and persistent presence to ensure maritime security and economic stability. [Editor's Note: This is a bit of a curious answer. While Prosperity Guardian and its parallel European counterpart Operation Aspides are certainly potent international security collaborations, 2024 saw several arguably more significant developments in the Middle East region alone, from the killing of Hezbollah leader Hasan Nasrallah to the fall of the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria.] Ensign Hunter Riportella relays information from the bridge aboard the Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Mason (DDG 87) during a vertical replenishment with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN 69) while the ships operate in support of Operation Prosperity Guardian (OPG) in the Red Sea, Jan. 8, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Chris Krucke) How did US policy change toward Ukraine in 2024, if at all? In 2024, U.S. policy toward Ukraine remained consistent in its commitment to supporting Ukraine’s defense against Russian aggression, with continued delivery of advanced weapons systems and training for Ukrainian pilots, including on F-16 fighter jets. However, the policy faced challenges due to depleted replenishment funds for military aid, underscoring the need for congressional approval of supplemental funding to sustain assistance levels. [Editor's Note: Yup, pretty much, even if the US and Europe have apparently run out of Ukrainian pilots to train on the F-16. What Congress will do with regard to Ukraine aid under the incoming Trump administration is another question entirely.] What are the Pentagon's top concerns as it relates to the future of Syria? The Pentagon's top concerns regarding the future of Syria include the persistent threat posed by Iranian-backed proxies, such as Harakat al-Nujaba, which continue to target U.S. forces in the region, and the destabilizing influence of actors like Iran and other extremist groups. Ensuring the safety of U.S. forces and maintaining the fight against ISIS to prevent its resurgence remain critical priorities, while managing broader regional dynamics and avoiding escalation with Iran. [Editor's Note: Here, ChatGPT's answer is consistent with fears officials have publicly expressed, though the particular mention of Harakat al-Nujaba is a bit unusual. The Pentagon announced it had killed a leader of that group back in January 2024, but has made little mention of it since in official transcripts, and media reporting does not appear to have identified the group as a specific concern currently.] Fighters walk in the Syrian presidential palace in Damascus' Mount Qasyoun on December 8, 2024, after Islamist-led rebels declared that they have taken the Syrian capital in a lightning offensive, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria. (Photo by OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP via Getty Images) In 2024, what were the Pentagon's top priorities in the Indo-Pacific region? The Pentagon's top priorities in the Indo-Pacific region in 2024 included ensuring regional security and stability through extended deterrence and collaboration with allies, particularly in the face of threats from China and North Korea. Efforts focused on mitigating risks of conflict over Taiwan and the Korean Peninsula while maintaining strong defense partnerships to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific. [Editor's Note: That does about sum it up, especially the focus on international partnerships in the region, which has been a top priority for Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.] What was the Defense Department's biggest mistake in 2024? The Defense Department's biggest mistake in 2024 was the delayed notification and lack of transparency regarding Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hospitalization and the temporary transfer of certain operational authorities. This lapse highlighted weaknesses in communication protocols, prompting internal reviews to improve procedures and ensure timely dissemination of critical information to senior officials and the public. [Editor's Note: There's a necessary reminder here that ChatGPT is answering based on Pentagon transcripts, and the fervor around Austin's secret January hospitalization required several days of cleanup from the Pentagon public affairs office — hence the emphasis from the generative AI. Arguably the DoD made bigger, or at least more impactful mistakes in 2024, whether it was related to troubled weapons programs or broader defense policy, but officials tend to be more circumspect about those kinds of calls.]	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/we-fed-every-2024-pentagon-briefing-into-chatgpt-heres-what-it-thought/	2024-12-26T12:38:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241220_DVIDS_computer_DC_3148118-scaled-e1734712089434.jpg
Everything comes down to Ukraine: 5 stories from Europe in 2024	South Koreans watch a television broadcast reporting the North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin (Getty Images) BELFAST — The war in Ukraine surpassed the 1,000 day mark earlier this year and continues on with slow Russian advances amid growing uncertainty in Europe that a new US administration under Donald Trump could end desperately needed military aid to Kyiv or result in a peace deal of greater, long-term strategic value to Moscow. Of all that happened during the conflict in the last 12 months, the deployment of North Korean troops to the Russian border territory of Kursk stands out from the pack. The move itself was officially confirmed by Mark Rutte, NATO Secretary General in October, after he held a North Atlantic Council meeting with South Korea’s National Intelligence Service and its Ministry of National Defense. It will be of no surprise to readers then that events from, or linked to, the war dominate our picks for the top European stories from 2024. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. ‘Growing desperation’? NATO chief confirms North Korean troops deployed to help Russia in Kursk Rutte defined the deployment as a 'significant escalation' of DPRK’s continued involvement in Russia’s 'illegal war' against Ukraine, while labelling it as a further 'breach' of UN Security Council resolutions. Soon after, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh, echoed NATO's appraisal, as she shared that an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been sent to 'train in eastern Russia [and] will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks.' 2. Sweden officially joins NATO as 32nd alliance member Forced to wait longer than Nordic counterpart Finland, Sweden finally joined NATO in March. Former NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg took to social media to mark the occasion. 'It’s official – #Sweden is now the 32nd member of #NATO, taking its rightful place at our table,' he shared. 'Sweden’s accession makes NATO stronger, Sweden safer, and the whole Alliance more secure.' The addition of Sweden notably increases alliance capabilities across the High North and Baltic Sea, while serving as a counterweight to Russian threats in the two strategically pivotal regions. Stockholm boasts formidable air, land and sea prowess shaped by multirole Gripen fighter jets and Gotland-class diesel-electric attack submarines. 3. Why Germany’s Scholz won’t follow Biden on long-range strikes for Ukraine After months of resistance, the US ended its opposition to Ukraine firing Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia for the first time in November. The UK soon followed suit, overturning a hold on Storm Shadow long-range cruise missiles. France, which refers to the weapon as SCALP, has also supplied a number of units to Kyiv. Similar to the lift on long range strikes by the US and UK, French President Emmanuel Macron said, 'there’s no red line on this.' Germany, on the other hand, stood out from the crowd, refusing to change course. Analysts that spoke with Breaking Defense about the matter said that German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was potentially holding out on the supply of Taurus long-range precision missiles in a bid to protect his political career and argued that he has limited clout over Russia. 4. French defense minister attacks industry over production rates, threatens requisitioning In March, France’s Minister for the armed forces Sébastien Lecornu aired concerns around national weapons productions rates by threatening industry with the requisitioning of 'personnel, stocks or production tools' if things don't improve. And he didn't stop there. Prime manufacturers were not the only group in Lecornu's line of fire. Subcontractors could also be forced to prioritize defense customers over civilian clients if they didn't rise to the challenge, he explained. In light of demand spiking to boost weapon supplies to Ukraine, KNDS told Breaking Defense that production of 155mm artillery shells had doubled, reaching an annual rate of 60,000 units in 2024, with a target of reaching 120,000 in 2025. 5. KNDS debuts Enhanced Main Battle Tank technology demonstrator On the equipment front, European defense firm KNDS unveiled a new Enhanced Main Battle Tank (EMBT) technology demonstrator at Eurosatory in France. The vehicle offers a glimpse into the manufacturer's thinking for the Franco-German Main Ground Combat System (MGCS) program, which effectively amounts to development of the continent's next generation main battle tank. As freelance writer Andrew White wrote of the EMBT, it includes an upgraded Leopard chassis with shortened engine to increase space inside the vehicle’s compartment; a new uncrewed turret, fitted with a 140mm Ascalon gun, ARX30 30mm x 113mm remote controlled weapon station; and the French Ministry of Defense’s Prometheus active protection system.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/everything-comes-down-to-ukraine-5-stories-from-europe-in-2024/	2024-12-26T10:14:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221222_putin_kim_GettyImages-1139189964-scaled-e1671728927858.jpg
The terror of war, a helo crash mystery and the business of defense: 5 Middle East stories from 2024	Smoke billows above Beirut's southern suburbs following an Israeli airstrike on November 26, 2024, amid the ongoing war between Israel and Hezbollah. (Photo by FADEL ITANI/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — This year it was nearly impossible to choose just five stories from our coverage of the Middle East in 2024, a year of brutal wars, seismic shifts in power and, for now, at least some hope for broader peace. It was a year in which stories about new technology, joint ventures and defense contracts were overshadowed by invasions and missile barrages, but that didn't mean the business of defense was stagnant, as the Saudi World Defense Show and Qatar's DIMDEX proved. So, after much consideration, here are the top five stories for 2024 from my list: [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. What life looks like in Lebanon after 1 year of conflict between Hezbollah and Israel It's the task of a journalist to report impartially, including when a conflict comes to your own country. Still, that doesn't mean it's impossible to tell human stories, including in this report about what life was like on Lebanon's southern border during Israel's invasion. Most residents left the area, but some stayed, and a few told Breaking Defense what it looked and felt like to be in their homes while barrages of missiles and bombs were exchanged between Israel, Hezbollah and even Iran above their heads. The 'bombardment sounds never seem to pause. The nights are the worst,' one southerner told Breaking Defense. But life elsewhere in Lebanon, including here in Beirut, did not feel safe before November's ceasefire. 'Are we going to die tonight?' my children asked me every night while they rush into my room, awakened from their sleep, not by calls to get ready for school but from bombs. It was easy to see the black and white smoke plumes from these attacks rising above the city. 2. What a Turkish drone in the Raisi crash crisis reveals about Iran’s UAV capabilities Who would have believed that the Iranian president's helicopter would crash in fog, and that it would be a Turkish UAV to be deployed to find the crash site? That's apparently what happened in May, even if Iranian officials later denied the drone had succeeded in its mission. Either way, experts said the use of the drone and its onboard sensors revealed perhaps more than Tehran would've liked about Iran's indigenous drone capabilities — as popular as they may be. Can Kasapoglu, a Turkish defense expert and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, said at the time he wasn’t buying Tehran’s claim. 'Iran was dwarfed by the Turkish information superiority [and] overshadowed by NATO standards,' he said. 3. Past the deadline, Western defense firms still navigating Saudi Arabia’s localization mandates Raising its domestic defense ambitions, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia called on all firms to set their regional headquarters in the Kingdom by January 2024. But at the Saudi World Defense show in February this year, Breaking Defense asked executives whether they have abided by this mandate. Already past the deadline, Western firms said they were still navigating their path and ways to accommodate the mandate. They were doubly caught between a rock and a hard place, since many are already established in the United Arab Emirates, which is making a parallel localization push. Some firms got creative, while others tried to work their way around the issue and resorted to more generous interpretations of the rules. 'I don’t know if we read the [regional headquarters] request that specifically but we are working with the government to make sure that we support whatever the request turns out to be in the right way and, again, I think our interpretation may be a little bit different than you described,' Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security President and CEO Ted Colbert (who has since left the company) told Breaking Defense then. 4. Iran shows off naval guns, missiles and UAV named ‘Gaza’ at Qatari defense show As rare as it is for Iran to show it arms in a defense show abroad, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps made a surprise appearance with their armament in Qatar at Dimdex. Breaking Defense was able to speak with Iranian officials and get a close view of the systems exhibited. From a drone dubbed 'Gaza' to naval guns, radars and missile defense systems, the Iranians had an array of systems to show the world. All of the systems at the stand were developed and produced by Iran and, one official said, are open for export to any country 'except Israel and [the] US.' 5. Russian bases and Hezbollah weapons: Key questions follow fall of Syrian regime At the tail end of 2024, more than half a century of the Assad family rule in Syria came to an end. Rebels took over one city after another, reaching Damscus apparently after Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad fled to Russia. But below the surface, key questions festered about the future of Russian military bases in Syria as well as Hezbollah arms transfer routes from Iran.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/the-terror-of-war-a-helo-crash-mystery-and-the-business-of-defense-5-middle-east-stories-from-2024/	2024-12-26T08:23:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241126_israel_strike_beirut_GettyImages-2186324612-scaled-e1732647429461.jpg
Government watchdog greenlights Army’s new spy plane contract, denies L3Harris’s protest	A Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft. (Bombardier via US Army) WASHINGTON — The Army is cleared to proceed building out its new spy plane with the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC), after the government watchdog agency denied L3Harris’s contract protest. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued its decision on December 23, noting that the protest is covered by a 'protective order,' and a report on the rationale behind the denial will be publicly released once it's redacted. L3Harris did not immediately respond to questions today about the new GAO decision, but the forthcoming report should shed additional light on the company's complaint into how the service awarded the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) deal. Neither the Army nor SNC immediately responded to questions from Breaking Defense about the program and if the stop work order has now been lifted. In August, the service selected SNC to convert Bombardier’s Global 6500 business jets into an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform under its HADES program. An industry team up featuring L3Harris, Leidos and MAG Aerospace had also bid on the program to replace the legacy fleet of RC-12 Guardrail turboprop aircraft. By October, L3Harris filed a protest with the GAO. 'We carefully reviewed the information during the Army’s debrief process, which led us to challenge the HADES decision and request further analysis to ensure the proposal received an equitable evaluation,' an L3Harris spokesperson said in a statement at the time. 'Our goal remains to ensure that mission operators receive the lowest risk and most capable solution available for an increasingly complex security environment.' The Army halted HADES integration work while GAO sorted through the protest, but in November it officially accepted the first business jet slated for integration during a ceremony in Wichita, Kansas. 'Once we're in a position to begin integrating the aircraft, that will be the next step … the integration of the equipment in the back,' Andrew Evans, the director of the Army’s ISR Task Force, told reporters at the time. 'The airplane itself is what we describe as the workhorse to HADES, it's what enables HADES to get in position, to collect … to have the endurance necessary to provide meaningful station time,' he added. 'But the magic of a HADES is what will happen in the back of that aircraft.' That magic includes moving target indication, high-end signals intelligence and other capabilities, possibly including launched effects. The service is also gleaning feedback from 'bridging' aerial ISR assets designed, in part, to inform HADES requirements. Those efforts included: Evans and Lt. Gen. Anthony Hale, the Army’s deputy chief of staff for intelligence, said the goal is to create commonality across those aircraft and port back lessons into the HADES design. 'Every day the enemy is working in the electromagnetic spectrum, they're utilizing EW [electronic warfare] capabilities, they're utilizing unmanned aerial system capabilities that we haven't seen before, and then they're increasing the use of new weapon systems,' the three-star general said. 'Whether it's [in] Ukraine or whether it's somewhere in Africa, our adversary is using these places as battlefields and testing areas to develop and continue to emerge technology and so … getting after what we see in one theater is going to come to another theater,' Hale later added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/government-watchdog-gives-army-greenlight-for-new-spy-plane-contract-denies-l3harriss-protest/	2024-12-26T06:51:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240103_bombardier_hades_army-e1704312802342.jpg
From Japan’s build-up to stumbles in the Lucky Country: 5 Pacific stories for 2024	Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launches fourth of Mogami-class frigates, Mikuma. Credit Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force SYDNEY — One of the biggest stories of the year in the Indo-Pacific was Japan casting aside the cloak of pacifism and moving to boost defense spending and actually export a major weapons system. While some of the policy planks had been laid down over the least decade, this was the year Japan really began taking concrete steps to make these a reality. The importance of the development is reflected below in this selection of five stories from Asia in 2024, plus an eyebrow-raising shakeup in the Chinese military, as well as a couple reports that look at some important moves Australia made as well. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 1. Japanese MoD makes first appearance at foreign airshow, seeking arms exports When Breaking Defense saw the Ministry of Defense booth at the Singapore Air Show in February, the first reaction was shock : a Japanese government booth trying to sell weapons. True, it was relatively small and the companies were too, for the most part. But there were Japanese officials, some in uniform, actively courting the international press, companies ands representative of foreign governments. And they spoke with Breaking Defense and encouraged the coma[pnies to speak with media. 2. &#8216;Huge implications' as top Chinese military leader under investigation, joins 3rd defense minister While Japan was trying to do one of the things China most fears — become a serious, power-projecting regional power — China's top leadership appeared to go a bit bonkers. A senior member of the body that rules the Peoples Liberation Army, the Central Millitary Commission, was 'suspended' and the third defense minister vanished from view. In any other large military, such actions would set off global alarm bills. More than a month after the CMC member and the the most recent defense minister vanished, there is still only informed speculation as to why this is happening, but analysts agree on one thing: all does not appear well in the Chinese military. 3. Australia, Japan ink first R&amp;D trial on underwater tech Two of the US allies most closely watched by China got much closer this year. Adding to the US Marines who operate from northern Australia for six months each year, 6,600 of its service members can train each year for nine weeks, Japan will now send its marines each year to Northern Australia. In addition to the new rotational force at the beginning of the year, Australia and Japan agreed to start working together on some of the most advanced and highly classified military equipment for 'strategic capabilities in robotic and autonomous systems for undersea warfare.' 4. &#8216;Alarming' but &#8216;not surprising': Australia reportedly left with 1 operational sub amid repairs, upgrades This year cracks in the Royal Australian Navy submersible fleet started to appear, even as the country pushed to bolster both fleets in the longer term. The Collins-class fleet was virtually crippled as the government admitted it could only deploy one of the country's six ageing subs. The government declared that a second boat could put to sea if necessary and claimed the fleet was meeting its operational requirements. But the news raised basic questions about whether Australia could close the capability gap between Collins and the arrival of the first boats in the AUKUS fleet. 5. Aussie Navy to double surface fleet with $7B plan, but future funding uncertain Knowing its aging fleet of ANZAC-class destroyers and other surface assets was growing increasingly thin as a deterrent, Australia decided on a $11.1 billion AUD ($7.2 billion US) plan to double its surface fleet. A key part of that is the General Purpose Frigate program, which has been whittled down to a competition between ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems' MEKO A-200 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries' Mogami frigate. The MEKO-200 is an upgraded version of the ANZAC class ships. The Mogami would be Japan's first sale of a major weapon system to a foreign country.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/from-japans-build-up-to-stumbles-in-the-lucky-country-5-pacific-stories-for-2024/	2024-12-26T06:03:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Image-3-e1733085030942.jpeg
