HII slashes financial outlook for 2024 due to contract delays, supply chain issues	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (U.S. Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Supply chain problems, COVID-era contract terms and lagging contract negotiations with the Navy hampered shipbuilding giant HII during the third quarter, forcing the company to lower its financial guidance for the year, the company announced today. Free cash flow for the year is now expected to top out at $100 million, a drastic reduction from a previous estimate of between $600 million and $700 million. HII also withdrew its five-year cash flow outlook, which spanned from 2024 to 2028. Shares of the company plummeted 23 percent today as the company failed to meet Wall Street expectations. 'The long-term value equation for HII has not changed. There's unprecedented demand for our products and services,' CEO Chris Kastner told investors during an earnings call. 'We remain confident in our mid- to long-term guidance of nine to 10 percent shipbuilding margins, and we firmly believe the actions we are taking will enable us to stabilize performance as we continue to work through these shifts.' The company’s Newport News Shipbuilding division — which builds aircraft carriers and submarines — took a total $78 million in charges, including $34 million related to design changes for Block IV Virginia-class submarines, with the rest of the impact spread between two Ford-class carriers and the refueling and overhaul of the John C. Stennis (CVN-74), said Chief Financial Officer Tom Stiehle. Executives broke down the company’s challenges into two buckets. First, it is unclear whether HII will wrap up contract negotiations with the Navy for 17 Virginia-class Block V and Block VI and Columbia-class submarines by the end of the year, which could alter the company’s profitability and cash flow for the year and beyond. RELATED: Supply chain issues slowing down General Dynamics sub construction, CEO says Second, HII’s shipyards have underperformed due to late deliveries from its supply chain and a lowered experience level among its own workforce, which has led to greater than expected rework. 'It bears repeating that nearly all of the ships currently under construction were negotiated prior to COVID, and since those contracts were signed, we have seen a significant loss of shipbuilding experience in our yards,' Kastner said in a statement accompanying the results.'Those ship contracts, which we are still operating under at Newport News, did not anticipate in their cost targets and risk limiting clauses the significant disruption of our workforce and supply chain, or extended periods of heightened cost inflation.' On the ongoing negotiations with the Navy, Kastner said the discussions were a chance to 'reset' contract terms to reflect those post-COVID realities. 'We've been working very hard with the customer to try to get those 17 ships right. It's a broad-based sort of contract that we're working on that really unlocks investment in in labor and infrastructure and technology across the portfolio,' he said. 'We thought we were pretty close to getting it done. It's in review still, and alternatives are being reviewed, and we're supporting that conversation, but it's just created some unpredictability.' RELATED: From Kabul to keel laying, Afghan immigrants find new careers at US shipyards In a note to investors, J.P. Morgan analyst Seth Seifman said the company's third quarter results and withdrawal of its cash flow guidance was 'a worse outcome than we expected.' 'Shipbuilding, and especially submarine building, is a top national priority that is attracting significant funding,' he wrote. 'As parts of industry struggle to keep pace with demand, however, the Navy and Congress may need to take more dramatic action to advance their plans if they are not content to muddle along.' Among the challenges at Newport News is an investigation into reports that workers had improperly welded noncritical structures on carriers and submarines. An initial assessment found that fewer than two dozen welders did not consistently follow procedures in their weld process, Stiele said, adding that the company continues to work with the Navy on a comprehensive investigation. HII took an initial charge connected to the welds, which Stiehle characterized as 'immaterial,' but the total financial impact will not be known until the investigation is over, he said. Cash flow for the next couple of years will be 'choppy' and heavily dependent on whether the company is able to improve performance as it enters its new contracts, Kastner said, adding that the company is also taking a 'hard look' at its expenses. HII’s supply chain issues echo concerns raised by General Dynamics CEO Phebe Novakovic, who said the company would slow submarine construction because its supply chain could not keep pace with General Dynamics Electric Boat. 'We’re going to control what we control,' Novakovic said last week on a GD earnings call. 'We’re going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see is more of a predictable supply chain schedule that is elongated. We’ll take cost out of our business, and we’ll continue to work productivity on the deck plates with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce.' While the money flowing to the submarine industrial base is helping HII’s supply chain, it will take time for the company to reap the benefits that come from those capital investments in new facilities, equipment and tooling, Kastner said. This morning, HII announced that its mission technologies division received a $3 billion contract to provide the Defense Department strategic-level support 'to enhance joint force capabilities and accelerate the application of solutions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hii-slashes-financial-outlook-for-2024-due-to-contract-delays-supply-chain-issues/	2024-10-31T09:30:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231108_DVIDS_submarine_construction_820194-e1699443296744.jpg
UK vows to ‘closely monitor all our supply chains’ after collapse of hypersonic supplier	UK firm Reaction Engines specialises in high speed propulsion and cooling technologies, but collapsed today after failing to secure a rescue deal (Reaction Engines) BELFAST — The UK Ministry of Defence said it will continue to 'closely monitor all our supply chains' as it reels from the collapse of Reaction Engines, the high speed propulsion manufacturer and industry lead on London's quest to develop a reusable Mach 5 and beyond aircraft under the Hypersonic Air Vehicle Experimental (HVX) program. The aerospace company, best known for its cutting-edge cooling technology and Synergetic Air Breathing Rocket Engine (SABRE), is also part of the £1 billion ($1.3 billion) Hypersonic Technologies &amp; Capability Development Framework (HTCDF) effort to build and deliver a first UK hypersonic missile, but was plunged into administration today after failing to secure a financial rescue deal, according to Sky News. The company reportedly conducted weeks of talks with potential buyers, including an unsuccessful attempt to win over £20 million from the United Arab Emirate's Strategic Development Fund (SDF), the investment agency of the UAE's Tawazun Council. Sky News noted that accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) had officially taken on Reaction administration duties today. PwC did not immedately respond to a requst for comment from Breaking Defense, nor did the UAE's SDF. A spokesperson for Reaction declined to comment. Analysts told Breaking Defense it remains to be seen what impact Reaction's troubles will have on hypersonic programs, but there are few who could replace the company's share of the hypersonic work. The UK MoD only told Breaking Defense in a statement on Wednesday, prior to the official news, that the MoD has a 'long running relationship with Reaction Engines Ltd and closely monitor[s] all our supply chains to ensure the continued delivery of key capabilities, including research and development.' Reaction, Rolls-Royce, the Royal Air Force’s Rapid Capabilities Office (RCO), the UK Government’s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and the UK’s National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) are jointly involved in HVX, which has been designed to 'rapidly develop critical high-Mach/hypersonic technologies, including novel air-breathing propulsion architectures, innovative thermal management systems and advanced vehicle concepts,' according to Rolls-Royce. SABRE and patented cooling technologies are critical parts of HVX. Progress on the effort includes launch of a full-scale experimental engine test campaign, partners carrying out design work on hypersonic vehicle concepts and the unveiling of Concept V — a single engine hypersonic concept vehicle. Regarding the separate hypersonic framework effort HTCDF, Reaction was picked by the UK in May, as one of 90 small and large organizations from industry and academia, eligible to bid for contracts in support of developing indigenous hypersonic missile capabilities. A total of eight hypersonic technology lots for the project cover: design and integration, modelling and testing, airframe and power generation, low Technical Readiness Level (TRL) concepts, a lethality package (including warhead and fuse), propulsion, on board computing, and seekers. London has settled on a three-step strategy of buy, collaborate and develop to build out hypersonic missile capabilities, which also focus on potentially acquiring a Hypersonic Glide Vehicle (HGV) as part of AUKUS Pillar II. Like all other major projects, the long term future of HVX and HTCDF remain on hold until the UK's Strategic Defence Review (SDR) reports in mid-2025, but Reaction's collapse could have a troubling impact on both high profile projects, analysts said. William Freer, research fellow at the Council on Geostrategy, a British think tank, told Breaking Defense on Wednesday following early reports of Reaction's then-potential downfall that 'going into Administration would certainly cause headaches for the HVX programme, but it is difficult to say exactly what the direct impact would be.' He noted the 'outcome is highly dependent on exactly who is brought in for administration and how they decide to carry out the process.' Christie Maddock, an associate professor at the Aerospace Centre of Excellence at the University of Strathclyde in Scotland, questioned how UK industry could replace Reaction. 'The biggest impact will be that the UK loses its its leadership in this field [cooling technology], and I don't know that anybody at the moment has enough momentum or enough investment to be able to pick it up again,' she noted. The financial difficulties that led to Reaction's demise were not altogether new. Asked about company challenges on the Aviation Extended podcast last year, Mark Thomas, Reaction Engines CEO said, 'Historically, it's been money raising &#8230; having to continually, on an almost annual basis, raise money for the business to fund the projects and the demonstrations and the trials. That's becoming less of a concern, but now it's shifted more into the need to penetrate the markets, generate revenue, to pour that back into the business to be self sufficient.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/uk-vows-to-closely-monitor-all-our-supply-chains-after-collapse-of-hypersonic-supplier/	2024-10-31T08:40:04-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/F-_S4BBXcAAwEVu-e1730370198366.jpg
More soldiers, control vehicles may be required to maneuver Army’s early Robotic Combat Vehicles	A Robotic Combat Vehicle Light prototype during Soldier Experimentation at the National Training Center, NTC, Fort Irwin, Calif. from July to September 2023. (US Army/ Savannah Baldwin) WASHINGTON — Testing has found that additional US Army soldiers are likely needed to operate early Robotic Combat Vehicles than anticipated even just months ago, the service disclosed this week. Under the Army's envisioned 'human machine integrated formations,' the service wants a future where RCVs are out ahead of soldiers on the front lines, taking on dangerous missions without potential loss of life. However, the service is not expecting early versions of those robots to have high levels of autonomy, which means soldiers will need to stay close by teleoperating them for the foreseeable future. Based on testing earlier this year at Fort Irwin, Calif., service leaders believed that for every two RCVs, it would need one control vehicle containing five soldiers — one driver and two teams with two each remotely manning an RCV. But in late July, as part of the Army Futures Command’s RCV Pilot-24 exercise, soldiers with the 1st Squadron, 7th Cavalry Division, again used the four RCV surrogates. The idea, the service explained in a Tuesday press release, was to have soldiers inside two trailing control vehicles operating a total of four RCVs on reconnaissance and security missions. The verdict? That wasn’t an adequate pairing that time around, and the platoon needed a third control vehicle to effectively operate the four robots, according to Brig. Gen. Chad Chalfont, the commandant of the Army Armor School at Fort Moore. As a result, the unit was 'restructured' and a third control vehicle was folded into the mix, the service explained. The service did not detail how many soldiers were now in each control vehicle, but if the math holds, that would be an additional five soldiers needed towards the front lines. While that July test event is moving the manned vehicle to robot ratio in the wrong direction, service officials previously told Breaking Defense that it is going to take time to develop and field RCVs. And part of that process may mean soldiers closer to the robots they control, as well as using them for limited missions while work continues evolving on a number of fronts. The service is testing out those RCV surrogates and control vehicle to examine how they may operate them in battle and tech limitations but still hasn’t selected which company will build the initial RCVs. That decision is expected to come in early 2025 when one company is picked to proceed with platform development. (McQ, Textron Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Oshkosh Defense are all under prototyping contracts today.) And it has broadly laid out plans to use an Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) as the future control vehicle. In recent months industry sources from all sectors have raised questions about how DEVCOM’s work and the GVAP project will ultimately converge, and the service is now hosting a Nov. 20 industry day to try and clear up confusion. There, it said, it will unveil a 'technology roadmap' to help each company 'make its best effort to align their technology against timing of future opportunities nested with the forecasted needs of the RCV program.' 'The industry day will clarify key points and provide updates regarding the RCV platform as it relates to tele-operation and growth to autonomous movement,' the Army wrote in an announcement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/more-soldiers-control-vehicles-may-be-required-to-maneuver-armys-early-remote-combat-vehicles/	2024-10-31T08:01:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/231213_army_robot_combat_8069610-scaled-e1702489865317.jpg
US Navy to extend service lives of 12 destroyers	The guided missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG-52) enters Naval Station Mayport, Fla. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Shane Cameron Ross/Released) WASHINGTON — The Navy announced today it will extend the service lives of 12 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, resulting in an anticipated 48 years of combined additional operational service from those vessels between 2028 to 2035, according to a statement from Secretary Carlos Del Toro. 'Extending these highly-capable, well-maintained destroyers will further bolster our numbers as new construction warships join the fleet,' Del Toro said in a statement. 'It also speaks to their enduring role in projecting power globally, and most recently in the Red Sea, their proven ability to defend themselves, as well as our allies, partners and friends from missile and drone attacks.' The ships included in the announcement are the oldest destroyers in the fleet ranging from the Barry (DDG-52), which will be extended for three years, to The Sullivans (DDG-68), also slated for a three-year extension. The Navy in March 2023 opted to extend the life of the class’s lead ship, the Arleigh Burke (DDG-51). The ships and their associated life extensions included in the announcement are: The statement did not include any information about the costs associated with the service life extensions, but did say the Navy had already proposed funding in its budget plans for fiscal 2026 and will update the long-range shipbuilding plan accordingly. 'Today’s budget constrained environment requires the Navy to make prioritized investments to keep more ready players on the field,' Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti said in the same statement. 'The Navy is actively pulling the right levers to maintain and grow its battle force inventory to support the United States’s global interests in peace and to win decisively in conflict.' The choice to extend the service lives of a dozen destroyers is multifaceted one for the sea service. During the Trump administration, lawmakers repeatedly hounded top Navy brass to lay out a plan to reach an overall fleet of 355-manned warships. (The Navy’s current fleet size fluctuates between 285 and 290 ships depending on the time of the year and how it lines up with commissioning and retirement ceremonies.) The service responded with a plan that eventually reached the 355-ship figure in the 2040s and 2050s through a combination of building more destroyers than originally planned as well as extending the service lives of those currently in service. The thought process, Navy leadership said at the time, was that while the fleet’s composition would not be optimal, destroyers were the best choice of ship to have in excess. Since the Trump administration ended in 2021, Navy leadership have overall tamped down on their zealousness to achieve a fleet size of any particular number, but Franchetti has repeatedly called for 'more players on the field,' invoking the service’s bottom-line need for a larger fleet. On the flip side, service life extensions necessarily mean operating a vessel for longer than intended which can lead to costlier maintenance periods and longer delays depending on a ship’s materiel condition.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-navy-to-extend-service-lives-of-12-destroyers/	2024-10-31T06:52:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/909174-e1730380760174.jpg
Hypori CEO: Air Force, Space Force to soon get access to non-classified mil networks on mobile	Spc. Acxel Budet Gonzales, Papa Company, 244th Quartermaster Battalion, takes a phone call while awaiting bus transport to his unit during Holiday Block Leave return processing Jan. 3 at the MacLaughlin Fitness Center. On Tuesday Hypori CEO Jared Shepard told Breaking Defense the Department of the Air Force will start gaining access to Hypori Halo on Nov. 15. A spokesperson from the DAF confirmed in an email that the transition to the mobile tech began in mid-October 'with the process being initiated in phases over several weeks.' 'With the Air Force deploying Hypori as part of the Workspace Anywhere program, we empower airmen and air guardsmen to interact securely with government CUI [controlled unclassified information] data from their own devices — whether at home, on the go, or even during their kids’ activities,' Shepard said. 'As global threats rise, it's crucial that our personnel have confidence in their mobile solutions to maintain mission readiness without compromising security,' he added. In August, Hypori was awarded a $4.1 million contract to provide 10,000 licenses of Hypori Halo to the DAF. Since then, more DAF service members have shown interest in registering for the program, Shepard said. The DAF’s adoption of the Halo software comes after it underwent a trial of Hypori’s Workspace Anywhere program, which ended in March. Before that, some Army service members adopted Halo in line with a new policy requiring secure virtual desktop access for soldiers, Guardsmen and Reservists, which included the option to use Halo on their mobile devices. The Army currently has 50,000 Hypori licenses, Shepard said. The Air Force will be looking for a smoother rollout than the Army's, in which some Reserve and Guardsmen said they felt left behind, as Breaking Defense previously reported. At the time, the Army expressed confidence that the virtual platforms, including Hypori, worked for the majority of users. Additionally, Shepherd said that the software is designed around zero-trust access, meaning the software assumes that no user trying to access the platform should have free rein of the network, and users have to go through particular verification processes. This is all done on a Level 5 cloud environment — the most secure environment for controlled unclassified information. As DAF users start to migrate onto the Halo platform, Halo is transitioning from a platform-as-a-service model with Microsoft’s Azure cloud to a software-as-a-service model with Amazon Web Service’s cloud. 'From a performance standpoint, that means that each individual is actually getting dedicated processing power and compute power in their virtual device. So it's going to significantly improve performance. It reduces late latency and lag and touch latency,' Shepard said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hypori-ceo-air-force-space-force-to-soon-get-access-to-non-classified-mil-networks-on-mobile/	2024-10-31T05:33:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/231019_soldier_iphone_crowd_7580394-scaled-e1697732209145.jpg
Air Force’s new cloud-based cyber defense system to protect ‘soft unbelly’ of cyber ops networks	U.S. Air Force Maj. Gen. Thomas Hensley, 16th Air Force deputy commander, is greeted by Col. Craig Bailey, 9th Maintenance Group commander, on Beale Air Force Base, California, Aug. 24, 2023.(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Alexis Pentzer) DoDIIS 2024 — When it comes online, the Air Force expects a new, more robust cloud-based system for cyber operations to allow airmen to better understand their network ecosystem and spot weak spots before adversaries do, Gen. Thomas Hensley, commander of the 16th Air Force said Tuesday. The new system, dubbed the Integrated Defensive Cyberspace System (IDCS) is intended to replace the Cyberspace Vulnerability Assessment/Hunter (CVA/H) and the Operations Platform Fly Away Kits (IOP-FAK), and offer data sharing through the cloud so airmen from different bases can share sensitive information regarding cyber threats. Hensley’s goal: have two IDCS kits installed at each Air Force base. 'So what we are trying to do as an Air Force is make sure that our networks are not the soft underbelly to our war fighting capability,' Hensley said at the Defense Intelligence Information Systems conference Tuesday. He later told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the conference that the new IDCS are 'bigger and more expensive' compared to their predecessors, and they will help with information gathering and defensive cyber operations. The CVA/H and IOP-FAK are technically referred to as 'weapons systems,' but practically they’re defensive structures that identify, track and abate potential cyber threats with software- and hardware-based sensor platforms. With these older systems, airmen were still able to share data, but not on a cloud environment. Now with the IDCS, the data collected from within the system will be transported from the kits and through a cloud platform into the service’s wide-ranged data platform for additional analysis. Hensley explained that when implementing the IDCS, airmen will first have to perform a 'terrain analysis,' which is a cybersecurity evaluation of the network, so they can decide where to embed the system’s sensors that will gather information on potential cyber threats. 'Buying sensors to cover everything in our ecosystem is cost prohibitive. So where is the key terrain that we need to put the sensors to protect the data to go where it needs to go?' Hensley asked. 'So that's precision sensor deployment, but you got to understand the terrain to begin with.' The timeline on replacing the older systems with IDCS is not clear, as it is dependent on when the Air Force gets the 'sustained funding' to make the transition, Hensley said. However, the initiative appears to be behind schedule. When solicitation for this program first came out, the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center said it expected IDCS to be fully underway by mid-to-late fiscal year 2024.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/air-forces-new-cloud-based-cyber-defense-system-to-protect-soft-unbelly-of-cyber-ops-networks/	2024-10-30T12:49:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/7995666-scaled-e1726608345988.jpg
NRO taps 3 startups for innovative launch experiments	An artist's rendering of Starfish Space's Otter satellite servicing vehicle. (Courtesy Starfish Space) WASHINGTON — Ther National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) today announced it has awarded study contracts on innovative launch capabilities to three US-based startups: Cognitive Space, Impulse Space and Starfish Space. The contracts come under the spy satellite agency's Broad Agency Announcements (BAA) for Agile Launch Innovation and Strategic Technology Advancement (BALISTA) program, which is exploring 'in space mobility and maneuver, on-orbit logistics and sustainability, mission acceleration, artificial intelligence for ground operations, and spacecraft propellant particle count,' according to the NRO's press release. The NRO said the contracts, managed by NRO's Office of Space Launch (OSL), are 'smaller in scope' — though NRO has provided no specific value, as usual for the agency as its budget is classified — and intended to assess the potential for emerging space launch providers to provide new types of capabilities. 'This BAA helps NRO advance emerging technologies across launch, on-orbit support, and command &amp; control,' said OSL Director Col. Eric J. Zarybnisky. In it's initial solicitation back in March, NRO explained that it was looking for companies that could provide a number of novel space launch services, including docking, moving between orbits, and AI to manage satellite constellations. Houston-based Cognitive Space specializes in AI for autonomous management of space systems and satellite constellations. Impulse Space, headquartered in Redondo Beach, Calif., provides in-space transportation services from low Earth orbit to other orbits. The company on Oct. 3 announced that it had won a $34.5 million Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase III contract from the Space Force's Space Safari in partnership with the Pentagon's Defense Innovation Unit office to support the next two experiments in the services next two Tactically Responsive Space program, called VICTUS SURGO and VICTUS SALO. Both missions will use the firm's Mira vehicle, and are aimed at demonstrating 'how prepositioned capabilities can improve responsiveness to on-orbit situations, enabling the dynamic operations aspect of space domain awareness,' the company said. Based in Tukwila, Wash., Starfish Space also has previously won a Space Force contract. On May 20, the service announced it had awarded the company a $37 million Strategic Funding Increase (STRATFI) contract to build, launch, and operate one of its Otter vehicles for a 'first-of-its-kind docking mission' designed to provide two years of 'augmented maneuver for National Security Space assets.' Essentially, the Space Force target satellites would use the Otter as an attached engine.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/nro-taps-3-startups-for-innovative-launch-experiments/	2024-10-30T12:33:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/Starfish_Space_Otter_GEO_Earth-e1730316131187.png
South Korea eyes pathway for AUKUS Pillar II with new defense tech agreement	Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and South Korean Defense Minister Kim Yong Hyun stand for the playing of the US and South Korean national anthems prior to a US-Republic of Korea Security Consultative Meeting at the Pentagon on Oct. 30, 2024. (DoD photo/US Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) WASHINGTON — The defense ministers for the US and South Korea today announced a new joint defense science and technology executive committee, one that expressly will consider options for Seoul's participation in AUKUS Pillar II. 'Based on the defense vision of the alliance, we plan to establish a vice-minister level defense science and technology executive committee within this year to explore the application of cutting-edge science and technology in the defense sector, as well as cooperation on AUKUS Pillar II,' Kim Yong Hyun, the minister from South Korea, said during comments at the Pentagon. Kim’s announcement came on the heels of the US-Republic of Korea security consultative meeting today that included US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Tomorrow, the duo will join Secretary of State Antony Blinken and ROK Minister of Foreign Affairs Cho Tae-yul for a 2+2 meeting. While North Korea’s deployment of upwards of 10,000 troops to Russia is a hot-button topic for the two nations this week, the Pentagon announced beforehand that the S&amp;T expansion will remain a focal area, particularly in the areas of autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and quantum technologies. That fits in nicely with the six technology areas identified as priorities for Pillar II: undersea, quantum, artificial intelligence and autonomy, cyber, hypersonic work, and electronic warfare. While US officials said in September that they are open to other areas of opportunities, the goal is to keep the focus on those areas as much as possible. Ever since the creation of AUKUS, there has been a question of whether other nations would be allowed to join the tripartite agreement. Officials have made a delineation: Pillar I, which is focused on nuclear submarine technology and tighter military alliances between the US, UK and Australia, is closed. But Pillar II would offer opportunities for other countries to get involved. That has led to some confusion about whether outside countries can 'join' Pillar II. Inside the Pentagon, at least, the issue is viewed less as one of other nations 'joining' and more about allowing outside parties to work on technological efforts the three core AUKUS nations are developing. Speaking to Breaking Defense in August, Richard Marles, Australia’s defense minister, said that while he expects Pillar II to 'grow,' the focus has to be on making sure 'we get Pillar II into a place where there is something to, kind of, offer. 'I think what’s really important is that we get this better down amongst the three of us first, so that we really know what the architecture of our collaboration looks like, and what the specific projects are,' he said. The first country to be formally tied to Pillar II was Japan, in an April announcement that the AUKUS nations are 'considering cooperation with Japan on AUKUS Pillar II advanced capability projects.' (As an example of the confusion about how Pillar II works, that statement was followed almost immediately by a statement by Australia’s prime minister that 'What is not proposed is to expand the membership of AUKUS.') Officials in New Zealand have had preliminary talks with Australian counterparts about participation in Pillar II, New Zealand’s defense minister told Breaking Defense earlier this year. And there have been calls for Canada to take part as well. (Given New Zealand and Canada are the two non-AUKUS members of the 5 Eyes intelligence sharing network, they both have close connections to the AUKUS partners.)	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/south-korea-eyes-pathway-for-aukus-pillar-ii-with-new-defense-tech-agreement/	2024-10-30T12:21:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/kim-austin-scaled-e1730315341861.jpg
Lockheed completes acquisition of smallsat maker Terran Orbital	SDA Tranche 0 Transport Layer (Image: Terran Orbital Corporation) WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin has completed its acquisition of small satellite maker Terran Orbital, the company announced today. The smallsat producer — now known as Terran Orbital, a Lockheed Martin Company — will report to Lockheed’s space unit and serve as a merchant supplier to other major space primes, Lockheed said. The $450 million deal, which was announced in August, resolves Terran Orbital’s mounting debt problems by uniting it with its biggest customer, which has previously bought the startup’s products for the Space Development Agency’s (SDA) transport and tracking layer of small satellites. The acquisition also gives Lockheed the opportunity to expand from its legacy position making large satellites for the defense sector into the small satellite business, where it may be able to pick up commercial sales. 'The addition of Terran Orbital's spirit of entrepreneurship to the scale of Lockheed Martin means there is a great deal of opportunity to keep pushing the boundaries of technology and space solutions together,' Robert Lightfoot, president of Lockheed Martin Space, said in a statement. 'We welcome their ingenuity and dedication to ensuring mission success and we've always valued those aspects of our working relationship.' Lockheed has had a longstanding relationship with Terran Orbital, having invested in the company multiple times since 2017 through its venture capital arm. Terran Orbital is the first company that Lockheed has acquired from its ventures portfolio. In August, Terran’s Tyvak Nano-Satellite Systems subsidiary announced a $254 million contract to build 10 satellites for SDA's Tranche 2 Transport Layer (T2TL) Gamma contract. The company also brings its expertise in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for remote sensing, with its PredaSAR subsidiary. In 2023, Terran Orbital received $500 million from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency for the organization’s Digital Radar Image Formation Technology (DRIFT) program. Under that effort, the company is expected to demonstrate at least two SAR satellites, which will fly in formation to better see a target area and allow fusion of imagery via advanced processing.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-completes-acquisition-of-smallsat-maker-terran-orbital/	2024-10-30T11:52:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/09/SDA-Tranche-0-Tansport-Layer-Image-Terran-Orbital-Corporation-e1710347311201.jpeg
UK pledges additional $3.8 billion on defense spending, stops short of 2.5 percent GDP timeline	F-35B fighter jets from the UK Carrier Strike Group launch from the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier to undertake sorties under NATO command in the Atlantic (UK MoD) BELFAST — The United Kingom announced today it intends to increase its defense spending by £2.9 billion ($3.8 billion) next year, according to a newly released budget. Rachel Reeves, the UK Chancellor, shared the uplift with lawmakers in a parliamentary speech, though she said that a Labour Party election manifesto commitment of reaching 2.5 percent GDP on defense spending will be met at a 'future fiscal event.' 'I am announcing a total increase to the Ministry of Defence’s budget of £2.9 billion next year, ensuring that the UK comfortably exceeds our NATO commitments and providing guaranteed military support to Ukraine of £3 billion per year for as long as it takes,' added Reeves. Across the 2023 to 2024 fiscal year, London spent £54 billion on defense, according to government figures, tracking at around 2.33 percent GDP and to date has pledged £12.8 billion to Kyiv for military, economic and humanitarian aid. Earlier this month, the UK also announced a new £2.3 billion loan for Ukraine, funded by frozen Russian assets. A supporting Autumn Budget 2024 document [PDF] says that the new funding, approved by Reeves, will allow UK armed forces to 'modernise' and sustain Britain's 'leading role in NATO, including through the nuclear deterrent, combat and surveillance aircraft, surface and submarine fleets, forward land forces, Special Forces and cyber and space capabilities.' Experts have long questioned the ability of the UK to meet its NATO commitments, especially with respect to the British Army delivering a Strategic Reserve Corps, made up of two divisions and additional corps echelon troops. 'The current British Army actually fields half of one heavy brigade’s worth of equipment, split between two, and one regiment of artillery,' Jack Watling, senior research fellow for land warfare at RUSI, wrote in a July analysis. The decline in size and capability of the force in its current state falls far short of a 2015 effort to deliver a 'warfighting division of two heavy and between one and two medium combat brigades, an artillery brigade, an engineering brigade, an air defence group, a logistic brigade and an ISR brigade,' he noted. Patrick Sanders, former head of the British Army, also admitted that UK aid to Ukraine in the form of warfighting platforms, amounting to 14 Challenger 2 main battle attacks and 30 AS90 155mm self-propelled guns, would 'leave us temporarily weaker as an army.' As for increasing spending further, before losing office, the Conservative government had committed to hitting the 2.5 percent GDP target by the end of the decade, which would have resulted in a 2030 annual defense budget of £87 billion, but Labour has still to put forward an exact timeframe for making good on the same GDP pledge. The new government has launched the Strategic Defence Review (SDR), set to report in mid-2025, 'in recognition of the urgency of the threats' it faces and designed to assess national defense priorities and policy. Chief among the threats sits Russia, conflicts and increasing instability in the Middle East and an assertive China in the Indo-Pacific. Though equipment planning remains in limbo until the SDR is published, financial challenges persist, largely owing to a £43 billion, 10-year spending plan deficit, according to figures [PDF] from the National Audit Office, a government watchdog.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/uk-pledges-additional-3-8-billion-on-defense-spending-stops-short-of-2-5-percent-gdp-timeline/	2024-10-30T10:44:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/FLEET-20231105-XN0184-136.jpg.iCexsZ_kMWATAA.lYYOVfIex0-e1719261083813.jpg
First German Leopard 2 tank gets Israeli Trophy Active Protection System	On Oct. 29, 2024 the Israeli and German governments presented the first Leopard 2 tank outfitted with the Trophy Active Protection System. (Israeli Ministry of Defense) JERUSALEM — The Israeli and German ministries of defense held a ceremony in Germany today to inaugurate the first Leopard 2 tank to be upgraded with the Trophy Active Protection System. The system was developed by Israel's Rafael and has been active on Israeli tanks for more than a decade. The installation is the culmination of a government-to-government agreement signed in 2020. Israel’s Ministry of Defense noted that its Directorate of Defense Research and Development had spearheaded this initiative to 'equip Germany’s Leopard 2 tank fleet with Israel’s premier active protection system.' Carsten Stawitzki, national armaments director in the German Ministry of Defense, was present at the ceremony along with the head of the Israeli Ministry’s Survivability Systems Branch, who was unidentified and whose face blurred in photos due to security reasons. Germany conducted live fire tests with Trophy in 2021. The tests took place with Rafael and Germany’s KMW, which developed and manufactures the Leopard. At the time Israel’s Ministry of Defense underlined how the system was combat proven and integrated on the IDF’s Merkava tanks. 'The advancement achieved by our industries in cooperation with our German friends and partners will further strengthen the capabilities of both our defense establishments. We will continue to work at the forefront of tech capabilities, prepare for every operational scenario, and deepen our relations with partners around the world,' Israel’s then-Defense Minister Benny Gantz said then. Rafael has also established a joint venture in Germany called EuroTrophy, modelled on its success supplying European countries with the Spike family of missiles as part of the EuroSpike enterprise. The Spike family includes a number of precision guided and anti-tank missiles made by Rafael. The EuroTrophy venture includes General Dynamics European Land Systems, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann and Rafael. The Trophy system has also been integrated on the IDF’s Namer armored personnel carriers, as well as on US Abrams tanks and has been integrated on Challenger 3 tanks. Trophy will also be used on Leopard 2 tanks in Norway. Rafael also announced updates to Trophy at AUSA in early October, in part inspired by Israel's experience fighting in Gaza and Lebanon. The system can now defend against top attack threats. The Leopard 2 deal is part of a number of high profile deals for Israeli defense industries in Europe. In 2023 Finland signed a deal to acquire David’s Sling, the medium-range air defense system made by Rafael. Israel also finalized a deal to sell Israel Aerospace Industries Arrow 3 to Germany in 2023. 'This [Leopard/Trophy] milestone adds to a series of recent high-value defense agreements, including Germany’s purchase of Israel’s Arrow missile defense system, reflecting a shared commitment to advancing defense capabilities,' Israel’s Ministry of Defense noted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/first-german-leopard-2-tank-gets-israeli-trophy-active-protection-system/	2024-10-30T10:22:07-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_trophy_leopard_israeli_MOD-e1730234696944.png
GPS resiliency is falling short, but there is a solution	The GPS constellation that provides positioning, navigation and timing signals to the US military and civilians around the world, is made up of 31 active satellites. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images) The third generation of GPS satellites continues to deploy, and US Space Force has selected companies to introduce new Low Earth Orbit augmentation (LEAP) under the Resilient GPS program – yet these upgrades, while necessary, are not sufficient to adequately address growing risk from attacks to GPS. Ground-Based Position, Navigation and Timing (PNT) must be a part of efforts to upgrade and back up GPS if we are to meet rapidly evolving threats. Among the obstacles keeping us from addressing growing adversary counter-space capabilities is the failure to imagine what a day without space might look like. The seams between space, air, ground, electronic warfare and cyber are preventing full appreciation of cross-boundary threats to PNT. We should be organizing more holistically around a diverse set of PNT solutions, including adding a ground-based element to provide PNT signals receivable by our smartphones and other critical receivers. For decades, the civil-military success of the GPS program has supported unprecedented automation stemming from the widespread availability of accurate PNT. The nation’s critical infrastructure: telecommunications networks, the energy grid, and the financial sector all rely on GPS signals to operate. Legacy routines that used to operate independently from space-based signals have long since been retired. Recently, jamming, spoofing, cyber, and physical attacks have brought into question whether we have become overly dependent on space-based PNT signals. An attack (kinetic or electronic warfare) or mishap in the crowded low earth orbit could have cascading impacts and degrade or even eliminate the weak signals from Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites in medium earth orbits. Without access to space, the day to day technologies we take for granted — navigation, logistics, travel, alarms, AI sensors, robotic actuators, ATM machines, agriculture — stop working. 911 calls spike in volume, quickly overwhelming systems designed around automated location, and over time, telecommunications networks fail as they lose synchronization. The public, having built much of their lives around ever-available communications and location information, would further place a surge of demands on critical infrastructure that has lost control of essential functions. In short, if GPS goes down, critical infrastructure fails and our nation plunges into chaos. This scenario is not science fiction. Heightened tensions around the world include adversaries that have demonstrated attacks on space systems. These threat actors know that Space provides an asymmetric advantage to the United States and our allies. In their perverse calculus, an attack on space assets, intended to reset a losing hand, would be an escalation preferred over a nuclear exchange. What was a high bar for an attack on space systems is being lowered daily as Ukraine and the Middle East showcase adversary exploitation of GPS and other space-based PNT signals. RELATED: GPS shows some Lebanese citizens in Jordan, likely result of combat-related ‘spoofing’: Experts We need to add resiliency to our current space-based PNT, creating services to complement and back up GPS. Admiral Thad Allen, USCG (ret.), the current Chair of the Space-based PNT Advisory Board, said that 'America’s continued over-reliance on GPS for PNT makes critical infrastructure and applications vulnerable to a variety of well documented accidental, natural, and malicious threats.' The Board reported this summer that China and other nations are already ahead of the United States in building out resiliency to GPS and PNT. They concluded that the United States has 'fallen behind,' presenting a 'troubling shortfall in GPS’s greater vulnerability to jamming and spoofing.' China continues to build more capable and resilient PNT systems with an integrated architecture. The Chinese approach to PNT enhances their efforts to gain global technology market share for critical infrastructure industries. We need a whole-of-government approach, working together with the private sector to counter Chinese PNT gains. PNT services underpin the smooth functioning of our economy, and we need a ground-based component to compete. The United States should heed the board’s warning. A ground complement to GPS would address both today’s PNT availability issues and provide needed backup. This would be a deterrent to any adversary considering an attack on GPS. When space-based GPS is threatened, a ground-based system, receivable by smartphones and other widely available devices, would greatly reduce adversary motivation for counter-space escalation. There is widespread agreement on the need for ground based PNT as space-based alternatives share common GPS vulnerabilities but there is also much debate on the approach. Some PNT professionals advocate bringing back an enhanced Long Range Navigation (eLORAN) capability that would upgrade ground-based transmitters using Low Frequency signals from the decommissioned LORAN system, creating excellent propagation characteristics but needing either larger receiver antennas or new antenna technology breakthroughs to be receivable by smartphones. Others point to FM Radio and TV broadcast signals that can support distribution of accurate timing reference after disasters with new protocols. Ultimately, however, we will need to provide signals that are receivable in the devices we rely upon every day. Shifting our National policy from Resilient GPS to Resilient PNT, would ensure that we build an architecture and systems that degrade gracefully under the full spectrum of conflict using multiple ground-based approaches. The FCC is currently reviewing the record on a proposal that would enable a ground-based complement and backup to GPS. The act of establishing a ground-based PNT service category, as the proposed FCC order would do, would let the market introduce and sustain competitive solutions without the tail of a new federal program. The proposal is a strong step towards addressing our national security PNT risk. In the meantime, DoD and other agencies with GPS oversight, should replace governance of GPS with resilient PNT, motivating a mix of diverse PNT solutions capable of supporting society’s needs anticipating a day without space. Now is the time to act. Establish a complement and backup so that if GPS is denied, we have ground based PNT signals at the ready. Rear Admiral USN (ret.)

Lockheed Martin successfully demos Navy combat system on hardware destined for ICS	Aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) transits the Atlantic Ocean. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class K. H. Anderson/Released) WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin, in conjunction with roughly a dozen industry partners and the US Navy, successfully demonstrated it could run a virtualized version of a key combat system on hardware anticipated for use in the service’s forthcoming Integrated Combat System, according to a company executive. The demo, which took place in late September at the Navy’s Maryland-based software factory known as The Forge, focused on running the Ship Self-Defense System (SSDS), the multi-functional combat system used by aircraft carriers and certain Navy amphibious ships that lack the Aegis Combat System, Shireen Melvin, integrated combat management systems director at Lockheed Martin, told Breaking Defense. RELATED: App Store For Warships: Inside The Navy’s Project To Revamp How The Fleet Gets Software It was a necessary show of agility since the stated purpose of the Navy’s Integrated Combat System is to outfit its ships with hardware and software capable of running independently from one another. Among other benefits, the service hopes this will lead to the sorts of rapid, over-the-air software updates for its warships similar to those routinely done by America's technology behemoths. Operating a key piece of software for aircraft carriers and amphibs, the SSDS, on the latest developmental hardware being designed for ICS is another major step towards that goal of software and hardware independence. 'The team was able to do that successfully and virtualize a recent software build of SSDS, and then have it run on the new hardware that’s been selected for the ICS,' Melvin said. 'We’re going to keep adding to these demonstrations that we’re doing &#8230; as we continue to develop the ICS and as we move along and showing the progression of it.' Breaking Defense exclusively reported this February an in-depth view of the other key Navy facility developing the ICS, which the service has dubbed 'The Foundry.' Whereas 'The Forge' is focused specifically on software development, the otherwise incognito Navy building in Dahlgren, Va., has been tasked with producing the hardware destined for the ICS. Notably, most of that hardware is coming directly from products already being mass produced by industry, Navy officials told Breaking Defense at the time. RELATED: Inside The Foundry, The Navy’s Program To Modernize Hardware Across The Surface Fleet 'The technology that we’re taking is really technology that’s coming from the industry side, that has been out there and we’re now applying it to warfighting,' said Capt. Brian Phillips, an officer overseeing the Foundry. 'The world has become much more dynamic,' he continued. 'It changes much more quickly. We’ve really had to put a lot of thought into how do we incentivize industry … and empower them to sort of unleash their power to give us the technology we need, rather than dictating everything to them?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-martin-successfully-demos-navy-combat-system-on-hardware-destined-for-ics/	2024-10-30T08:32:42-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/2065424-scaled-e1706551345299.jpg
‘New Indo-Pacific missile age’ drives Australia to domestic GMLRS, munition production deals	Part of the forging process at the Maryborough munitions plant, a joint venture between Germany's Rheinmetall and a privately owned Australian company, NIOA. (Colin Clark/Breaking Defense) 'Why do we need more missiles? Strategic competition between the United States and China is a primary feature of Australia's security environment,' Pat Conroy told the National Press Club here. The most immediate commitment to increasing missile capabilities here came when Conroy said Australia would spend $316 million AUD ($207 million USD) to create a local factory to build Lockheed's Martin's Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), starting in 2029. It will be able to produce 4,000 missiles a year, roughly one quarter of current global production, he added. 'Producing GMLRS missiles in Australia is the stepping stone towards local production of more advanced, longer-range strike weapons in the future — local production that is essential to our sovereignty and our security,' Conroy said. Breaking Defense contacted Lockheed Martin and the ministry for more details about the plant. Lockheed declined to comment. At press time, defense had not responded. Australia recently committed to jointly manufacture Naval and Joint Strike Missiles with Norway's Kongsberg Defense in the city of Newcastle on Australia's eastern coast, the only site outside of Norway. The JSM can be carried internally by the F-35, preserving its stealth profile. Reinforcing that made-in-Australia penchant, Conroy announced that BAE Systems Australia received a $160 million contract to triple production of the Passive Radio Frequency Sensor (PRS) used in the JSM. However, those sensors, at least in the short term, will primarily be put into missiles procured by the US Air Force, Japan and other countries, BAE Systems said in a statement. 'This is a significant achievement for our manufacturing teams at Edinburgh Parks and an innovation success story that has required more than a decade of commitment from our employees and our partner Kongsberg,' Andrew Gresham, managing director of defense delivery at BAE Systems Australia, said in a statement. 'The Passive Radio Frequency Sensor is highly innovative technology designed, developed, and built in Australia.' Speaking to Breaking Defense last week, Conroy pledged that a new contract for manufacturing 155mm shells would be announced 'shortly.' That turned out to be true, with Thales Australia winning a hotly contested contract to manufacture the shells, part of the Lucky Country's effort to better able to handle supply chain disruptions and build stockpiles of crucial weapons. That contract includes building a new forge to make the shells, notable because Australian-owned NIOA, which had been competing with Thales for the contract, already has a custom-built forge in operation to produce 155mm shells. However, those shells are under contract to be exported to Germany, whose company Rhenimetall has a majority interest in the shell-making joint venture. Australia currently imports its finished 155s from a South African subsidiary of Rhenmetall. The artillery shells are the most in-demand military product in the world and mark an important commitment by the Labor government to ensure the Lucky Country's supply chains are more organic and less subject to the vagaries of global manufacturing and shipping. As usual, the opposition's defense expert, Andrew Hastie, cast scorn on today's announcements, saying the government had provided very few details about either GMLRS or 155s. 'Part-time Defence Industry Minister, Pat Conroy, used his National Press Club speech to announce Labor’s preferred tenderer to build a new forging capability for 155mm artillery ammunition – excluding any details around the costs associated. We are left scratching our heads once again,' Hastie said in a statement. 'Meanwhile, Labor’s announcement to establish a new $316 million Australian Weapons Manufacturing Complex comes with no plan or details for implementation. We must now wait for the Albanese Government to identify a site sometime next year for the facility which won’t be operational until 2029. But the clock is ticking and we have no time to waste.' Outside of the munitions announcement, Conroy was asked about a Chinese ICBM test from September, which flew more than 11,000km and landed in the Pacific Ocean off of Australia's north-east. It was the first such test by China in more than 40 years. Australia 'expressed significant concern about that ballistic missile test, especially its entry into the South Pacific given the Treaty of Rarotonga that says the Pacific should be a nuclear weapons free zone,' Conroy told reporters during Q and A.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-indo-pacific-missile-age-drives-australia-to-domestic-gmlrs-munition-production-deals/	2024-10-30T07:15:23-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/IMG_3175-scaled-e1727963129906.jpeg
Secretary Wormuth’s advice to next administration: ‘Stay on the path’ on Army programs	Secretary of the Army, Hon. Christine Wormuth, visits Japan, August 1, 2024. Secretary Wormuth had bilateral meetings with Japanese defense leaders and visited soldiers at the 5th Composite Watercraft Company at Yokohama North Dock. (U.S. Army photo by Sgt. David Resnick) Wormuth, whose name has been floated in news reports as the potential next Secretary of Defense should Democratic candidate Kamala Harris win in November, said she wouldn't speculate on what the future has in store for her. 'I am going to run through the tape as Secretary of the Army, wherever that tape ends,' she said. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. BREAKING DEFENSE: Looking at the broader picture, what are your key takeaways after nearly four years on the job? Concerns? The road ahead? WORMUTH: There's a benefit to having the duration of leadership for multiple years, because it provides consistent direction for where we're trying to take the Army. We have had clear objectives, and we've been able to follow them through. We've really moved the needle on a lot of our acquisition programs … [with] a lot of that progress because we're using new authorities. We have consistent resourcing, as much as we can, given [continuing resolutions] and things like that. But we haven't changed direction. We haven't zigged and zagged. So, I think, there's a lot of benefit to that consistency over time. Looking ahead, the Army still has a lot of work to do. … We need to have a mindset that reflects a greater sense of urgency and a somewhat higher willingness to take prudent risks, because the security environment is really challenging and technology is changing rapidly. As you have worked through the upcoming five-year budget, will you talk about some of the priorities you're looking at? Frankly, we are going to need to remain consistent across a lot of our big portfolios — long-range fires, future vertical lift, ground combat vehicle — [and] all the things we've been working on. It would be my hope and advice to the next administration, whatever party that may be, that they kind of stay on the path that the Army is on because I think we're on the right path. I've talked publicly about the fact that the next budget that [Chief of Staff Gen. Randy] George and I have been working to build a greater investment still in UAS [unmanned aerial systems], counter-UAS and electronic warfare (EW). The Army has been the service that's most invested in counter UAS to date, but we're going to increase that some more. But frankly, I think, a lot of what we need to do is just keep on, keeping on and see things through. Get the [Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft] to first flight, have a successful hypersonic weapon test, things like that. Part of that push has been this flexible spending pots of money for groups of systems. What are you hearing from Congress? And do you think that this will actually, you'll be able to get this over the line? I’m cautiously optimistic. &#8230; I was a little skeptical, just because of my experience with appropriators and with the appropriation staffers, they don't like what they see as slush funds. We're really trying to work with them to talk about what approach would work for them. I think the fact that we're targeting it narrowly to UAS, counter-UAS and EW, rather than kind of trying to have it encompass all of our different kinds of programs may be helpful. We're in an active conversation with on the appropriation side, in particular about what kind of mechanisms do they need to feel comfortable? What kind of transparency mechanisms would they need to feel comfortable enough to give us the ability to bin things into larger pots. …The proof will be in the pudding and we'll see what comes out in the ‘25 appropriations bill when it passes but I'm a little more optimistic than I was nine months ago. You have mentioned concerns about the negative impact a flat budget will have on Army programs and the hard choices the service might need to make. When will the service need to start making those tough decisions? We have to see what's going to happen in a couple areas. The quality-of-life panel [from] the House Armed Services Committee was proposing a 15 percent pay increase. If that passed in that form, that will be a very, very big bill that will absolutely crowd out other things that are important for our soldiers, to their readiness, to be combat effective, to give them the equipment they need. So, that's a variable…. But certainly, a 15 percent pay increase for junior enlisted soldiers is a big bill that would put further pressure on our modernization programs. What should I be asking you about or topics the media isn’t covering? The United States Army needs to look hard in the next couple of years at kind of what I call the Army lifestyle, the burden of our frequent PCS [permanent change of station] moves. A lot of our younger officers are choosing to get out of the Army because they feel like they don't have enough stability and predictability. Their spouses want to work and have a lot of challenges doing that when they're having to move every two years. And so, I think, that's something we really need to take a very hard look at &#8230; are we going to be able to attract the best people? Are we going to be able to retain the best people? 'Embrace the suck' is sort of part of the Army philosophy, but there are limits to that, there are limits to individuals' selfless service. We've had a model that's static for a very, very long time. It's not going to be easy to change that, but it's really important.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/secretary-wormuths-advice-to-next-administration-stay-on-the-path-on-army-programs/	2024-10-30T06:20:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_wormuth_helicopter_8683810-scaled-e1730223933875.jpg
E-2D Hawkeye: Flexible airborne command and control for sea, land and joint operations	The E-2D supports a wide variety of missions: defensive and offensive counter-air, integrated air and missile defense, electronic warfare, air traffic control, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, border security, and counter-drug operations. (Northrop Grumman photo). Initially designed for airborne early warning (AEW) and defense of carrier battle groups, the E-2D Advanced Hawkeye has evolved into a versatile platform that provides airborne command and control (C2) for multiple nations. The U.S. Navy has invested more than $1 billion in a technology roadmap to modernize and sustain this aircraft, positioning it as a critical node for joint command and control. Breaking Defense discussed the platform’s capabilities with Janice Zilch, Northrop Grumman vice president and Integrated Product Team (IPT) lead for Multi-Domain Command and Control (MDC2). Breaking Defense: How has the E-2D evolved to include airborne command and control alongside its traditional AEW role? Janice Zilch: The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye represents the latest in a legacy of AEW aircraft that stretch back over 60 years. While its original focus was defending carrier battle groups and monitoring long-range threats over water, it has now evolved into a cutting-edge platform capable of identifying and neutralizing a diverse range of threats in various environments. It’s similar to the evolution of mobile phones. When those were originally designed, it was to make a voice call. Think about how much has expanded in terms of functionality available. The same applies to the E-2D. Our advancements in bandwidth, processing power, and organic sensors – a radar, ESM (electronic support measures), IFF (identification, friend or foe), AIS (automatic identification system) – as well as our comms suites, allow the E-2D to offer unmatched detection and connectivity. This ensures seamless data sharing across U.S. and allied forces, enhancing joint operations across air, land and sea domains. Today, the E-2D supports a wide variety of missions: defensive and offensive counter-air, integrated air and missile defense, electronic warfare, air traffic control, combat search and rescue, humanitarian relief, border security, and counter-drug operations. This platform has become an indispensable element of JADC2, and the Navy’s continuous investment in its modernization ensures it remains a critical operational asset. For nations needing to protect their borders, the E-2D’s capabilities and performance are attained through its ability to detect smaller targets early and often before other AEW platforms, coupled with mission processing power that give it unsurpassed surveillance volume. (Northrop Grumman photo). For nations needing to protect their borders, the E-2D’s capabilities and performance are attained through its ability to detect smaller targets early and often before other AEW platforms, coupled with mission processing power that give it unsurpassed surveillance volume. The robust communications suite helps create an integrated common operating picture across allied forces and provides real-time data contributing to greater situational awareness. One of the E-2D's key advantages is its operational flexibility. Thanks to its carrier design, it requires shorter runways and has a smaller infrastructure footprint when compared to larger AEW aircraft, making it ideal for rapid deployment. Additionally, the platform offers day one readiness with interoperability capabilities that provide enhanced performance to numerous allied assets including ground-based air and missile defense systems, such as the U.S. Army’s and Poland’s Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS). The combination of these two assets alone provides an increase in decision space and clearer situational awareness to optimize threat deterrence. E-2D also enhances and integrates seamlessly with fighters such as F-16s, F-35s, and unmanned systems such as NATO AGS, in addition to other allied systems. Moreover, Northrop Grumman’s 40 years of experience in supporting international partners operating E-2 platforms ensures we are well-equipped to train, sustain and modernize these systems globally. Our work with France, for instance, highlights the potential for operational synergies across Europe. As France transitions from E-2C to E-2D, we expect to see efficiencies in training, material procurement, and sustainment that could reduce maintenance lead times for European operators. Describe the E-2D's multi-functional role in providing AEW and C2? There is a wide spectrum of operations and use cases for a platform as versatile as the E-2D and its crew members. The E-2D can support civilian missions, such as emergency and disaster relief. We can clear the path for time-sensitive emergency operations, direct military aircraft for humanitarian aid, and we can sequence aircraft for safe takeoff and landing in the absence of air traffic control. In addition, as an airborne air traffic controller, E-2D increases national border security and helps mitigate occurrences of escalating incidents. For example, in the on-going NATO air policing efforts in the Baltic region, E-2D could play a critical role in enhancing the allied posture and effectiveness of these efforts. We can also provide data reports on drug interdiction, surveillance and pattern of life tracking, as well as search and rescue, in addition to enhancing air policing by providing maritime security through the collection of intelligence on ships that aren't emitting AIS. The bottom line is that E-2D offers mission versatility and operational mobility while it plays a pivotal role as a central node across mission areas. That’s enabled by its ability to communicate with numerous assets, providing real-time data for onboard and offboard commanders leveraging its massive surveillance volume on continuous refresh cycles. What does continuous modernization look like for the E-2D, particularly regarding radar and weapon system upgrades? We’ve entered a new era of upgrades with the Delta System Software Configuration (DSSC) 6, or Block II. Awarded last year, Block II represents the most significant upgrade since the E-2D's inception in 2003. This upgrade involves a complete technology refresh for the cockpit, mission computer, and operations station. Most importantly, the new open mission systems architecture will enable rapid integration of new capabilities, including non-proprietary applications from industry partners. Beginning in 2027 and continuing into the 2030s, the entire U.S. Navy fleet will be retrofitted with this cutting-edge technology at the forefront of airborne command and control. How does artificial intelligence and machine learning fit into the future of E-2D operations? With E-2D Block II, we're setting the stage for incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tactical decision-making aids. These technologies will enhance the speed and accuracy of our decision-making processes, ensuring that critical information is disseminated faster. Thanks to the E-2D's open mission systems architecture, we’ll be able to rapidly import and integrate AI/ML capabilities as they develop, ensuring we stay ahead of the curve in partnership with the U.S. Navy and allied nations over the next two decades, and beyond. Final thoughts? The E-2D Advanced Hawkeye is the world's premier airborne command and control surveillance platform operating in theater today. For European nations, especially those protecting land-locked borders, the E-2D offers critical capabilities for homeland protection. We will continue modernizing this platform to ensure it outpaces evolving threats, making it a combat-proven and trusted solution for decades to come.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/e-2d-hawkeye-flexible-airborne-command-and-control-for-sea-land-and-joint-operations/	2024-10-30T05:25:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/E-2D_AR_11.png
Swedish defense minister: ELSA long-range strike development lesson from Ukraine	Swedish Defence Minister Pål Jonson speaks to the media ahead of a joint training exercise with the Norwegian, Finnish and Swedish armies, on the Finland/Norway border during the Nordic Response military exercise on March 09, 2024 in Kivilompolo, Finland. (Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images) STOCKHOLM — Sweden is 'eager to participate' in the new European Long Range Strike Approach (ELSA) program, with Defense Minister Pål Jonson telling Breaking Defense he sees an industrial role for companies like Saab and MBDA in the new effort. 'The companies have to speak for themselves. But of course, Saab has capabilities. So that could certainly be an option. Of course, I'd see strong participation from MBDA also.' Jonson said on a call from Qatar, where he was visiting this week. The ELSA project was initiated in July 2024 by France, Germany, Italy, and Poland, with the goal of developing a ground-launched cruise missile with a range of 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers. This range for ground launched missiles was previously banned by the US and Russia by the Cold War INF Treaty, which imploded in 2019, when both countries left the agreement. A few months later, the UK announced it would also have a role in the project, and at the Oct. 18 NATO defense ministers meeting, Jonson signed a letter of intent for Sweden to join the ELSA coalition. Sweden is not currently prioritizing ground-based strike options, but Jonson said that the ELSA effort could have applicability in the aerial and naval domains, which are more a focus for Stockholm. 'The missile will probably be compatible with all the alliance's aircraft, all the surface vessels that have cruise missile launch capability, and simple launch trucks on land,' said William Alberque, former director of arms control at NATO and former director of strategy and technology at IISS. Saab is developing the next generation of corvettes (the Luleå class), fighter jets (Jas Gripen E), and the next generation of submarines (A26). Jonson said that the new subs will not have a long-range strike capability, but that Stockholm wants it for their other modernizing assets. 'We are developing long-range strike capabilities, predominantly for the air force,' Jonson said of Sweden’s focus. 'We are also adopting more long-range strike capabilities for our navy, predominantly for our corvettes.' Strategically, the ELSA effort is 'is very clearly coming out of the lessons learned from Russia's war on Ukraine, and the realization that there are huge gaps in the long-range strike capability of the NATO alliance,' Alberque said. Jonson did not shy away from that idea, telling Breaking Defense that 'The lesson learned from the war in Ukraine is that long-range strike capabilities are becoming increasingly important on the battlefield, and of course, also with stronger air defense capabilities.' Sweden plans to spend 2,4 percent of its GDP next year and 2.6 percent in 2028, which is above NATO’s minimum defense spending target. Jonson said it's too early to give a timeline when ELSA can be operative. 'We joined this project a few weeks ago. Now our ambition is deepened interaction between our government agencies, but also the industry as well, as it depends on our partners and the other countries.' Could it be ready within five years? 'I don't exclude that possibility,' he said. Jonson was in the Middle East to meet with counterpart Khalid bin Mohamed Al Attiyah. Qatar is a NATO partner, and the visit serves as a follow-up to the September visit to Stockholm by Amir Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani. Jonson told Breaking Defense that the two men had top-level discussions about enhanced situational awareness in air and at sea. 'They're interested in enhanced situational awareness, both in the aerial domain and on the seas,' the Swedish official said, noting that Saab produces an 'agile platform in GlobalEye' that would meet the requirement. However, Jonson said 'it was a more general discussion. discussions about Qatar needs in this regard.' In September Saab delivered a Global Eye to the United Arab Emirates. The recent delivery is the fifth in the series of five Global Eye Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&amp;C) aircraft delivered to the UAE since 2020.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/swedish-defense-minister-elsa-long-range-strike-development-lesson-from-ukraine/	2024-10-30T03:15:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/GettyImages-2070957235-scaled-e1715612311169.jpg
Hundreds of drone incursions reported at military installations over past few years: NORTHCOM	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019. (Staff Sgt. Timothy Gray / 5th Armored Brigade) PETERSON SPACE FORCE BASE — The US military has collectively reported hundreds of drone flights over Pentagon installations on American soil in the past few years, and that's just the ones US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) knows about. 'I have no doubt that there's significantly more incursions that we don't see, either with a system or with our eyeballs,' Gen. Gregory Guillot, the commander of NORTHCOM and North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), said during a roundtable today with a small group of reporters at Peterson Space Force Base, the dual headquarters for both commands. Unmanned aircraft system (UAS) sightings over US military bases have raised alarm at the Defense Department, as incursions at sensitive installations like Langley Air Force Base — where the Air Force keeps F-22s — have mystified officials, as the Wall Street Journal previously reported. According to data shared by NORAD, drone sightings in 2022 numbered 250, but that figure has dipped somewhat in recent years, numbering 202 in 2023, and 163 so far this year. Guillot said the events are likely gaining more attention due to the spread of systems that are able to detect and track UAS with greater 'fidelity.' The UAS sightings at places that contain highly classified programs have also raised questions about the drones’ provenance, including whether they reflect operations of an adversary nation, though Guillot said today that he has not yet seen evidence of any 'organized or unorganized foreign nexus.' Instead, he said 'the overwhelming majority of them are probably local hobbyists that are just flying too close to the base.' RELATED: The Army's &#8216;most challenging' unmanned threat? Group 3 drones And while he said there are certainly more events that have gone undetected, Guillot cautioned that many observed phenomena could be duplicate sightings, such as multiple servicemembers calling in the same event. Others could be a case of mistaken identity, like if a servicemember mistakenly identifies blinking lights on a civilian airliner miles away as a closer UAS. Several reports could even concern the same drone flying back and forth over a base repeatedly, he said. Tackling the UAS problem on US soil has flummoxed officials, in part, because of regulations that protect civilian air travel — preventing commanders from taking steps like simply shooting down potential threats or taking other steps to disable them. 'The threat, and the need to counter these threats is growing faster than the policies and procedures that [are] in place can keep up with,' Guillot said. One solution the general pointed to is disrupting position, navigation and timing capabilities for a UAS, otherwise known as GPS jamming or spoofing. But as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have shown, GPS interference can pose hazards for civilian travel if painted with too broad a brush. Tight coordination with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is needed, Guillot stressed, to ensure counter-UAS capabilities are responsibly used. With established ties to the FAA, Guillot said NORTHCOM can step up to play a greater role in defeating drone incursions. One example would be developing preset approvals to engage UAS under specific parameters, obviating the need for a potentially days-long process to get an FAA greenlight. NORTHCOM could also help distribute key systems needed to fend off drone flights by bringing in new capabilities and 'fast-tracking' approval to use them, 'hopefully' within hours. Ultimately, Guillot said NORTHCOM could be a 'clearing house' of counter-UAS capabilities that serves as the 'lead synchronizer' for numerous government agencies. Other UAS challenges stem from properly detecting and tracking certain systems. While Guillot said he was 'pretty confident' that the Pentagon can sufficiently track larger objects, smaller Group 1 and Group 2 systems can pose more of a challenge since they can blend in with the clutter of airspace. (The Pentagon classifies drones in five 'groups,' with the first group being the smallest and the fifth being the largest.) Besides the UAS conundrum, Guillot has plenty of other issues keeping him busy. Toward the end of the discussion, an aide beckoned him away, bringing an abrupt end to the roundtable. 'I’m sorry, I’m going to have to run for a second,' Guillot said before sprinting out of the room.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/hundreds-of-drone-incursions-reported-at-military-installations-over-past-few-years-northcom/	2024-10-29T14:53:29-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_drone_quadcopter_5816882-scaled-e1730238738198.jpg
Show me the data: DISA leaders outline do’s and don’ts on industry AI pitches	Nathan Helmly, NSWCDD Computer Scientist, builds an algorithm with his team at the NSWCDD Innovation Lab’s wargaming hackathon on Aug. 11, 2021. (Caleb Gardner / Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division) BALTIMORE — The Pentagon’s IT arm, the Defense Information Systems Agency, has seen quite enough AI hype, thank you very much. So at the agency’s annual Forecast to Industry here on Monday, new DISA director Lt. Gen. Paul Stanton said he needs clarity from vendors on how their offerings’ AI features actually work and what data they were trained on. 'If vendors are incorporating artificial intelligence &#8230; they need to be able to explain the details of how and why they’re using it,' Stanton told reporters at a roundtable during the industry day. 'AI requires context. You don’t just sprinkle AI on a problem.' 'Don’t do it for the joy of doing AI &#8230; just to say that you have it,' added the agency’s chief technology officer, Steve Wallace. 'We’ve seen a lot of vendors who claim to have it, and when you peel back the onion, there’s not a whole lot of depth there.' In particular, DISA is not interested in ChatGPT clones. The Air Force has already developed a chatbot for Defense Department use, NIPRGPT, Wallace said, so there’s no need to duplicate that capability: 'We don’t need 60 GPTs running around the Department.' Instead, Stanton, Wallace, and other agency leaders emphasized, DISA needs AI built to serve specific Defense Department missions. They also need to understand — and have contractual rights to — the underlying data on which that AI is trained. 'Being very, very careful and thoughtful about how we acquire, leverage and analytically resolve the right data is important,' Stanton said. 'That’s at the heart of our business as an agency.' One way that focus on the underlying data manifests, said Douglas Packard, DISA’s director of contracting and procurement, is that the agency’s rights to data are absolutely going to come up in contract negotiations. 'Don’t create AI without thinking I’m going to need the data rights to it,' he said. In many negotiations, 'people spend weeks on data rights,' Packard went on. 'Our biggest negotiation item [is] always the data rights, because we [may] need to give it to someone else' to enable competition between contractors and avoid 'vendor lock.' DISA also wants to understand the data used by AI tools so it can assure itself that foundation is sound. Stanton and his team want AI trained on relevant, authoritative, and carefully curated data — not random Reddit posts or other dubious datasets built from indiscriminate trawls of the public internet. 'We don’t want our data derived from the entire corpus of the internet; there’s a lot of bad data,' Stanton said. AI trained on inaccurate data — or even on accurate data mixed in with irrelevant information which the algorithm doesn't know to ignore — can produce wildly erroneous answers. For example, Wallace said he asked a large language model how many directors DISA has had. 'The answer I got was something like 1,700.' Since the agency was founded in 1991, just 33 years ago, that AI result would imply DISA got a new director almost every week. RELATED: How new White House AI memo impacts, and restricts, the Pentagon LLMs can also make subtler errors that are harder to detect, Wallace went on, as DISA discovered in recent internal testing of an 'AI concierge' intended to help its staff sort through what policies and procedures they need to follow. 'We learned a lot,' Wallace said. For instance, when the agency issues a new policy that supersedes an older one, a human can simply look at the dates each document was issued to figure out which one is the latest guidance. But, it turned out, the LLM could not. As a result, the prototype AI concierge would give contradictory answers, sometimes applying the current policy and sometimes the obsolete one, with which it used often depending on exactly how a user phrased the question. To protect against such AI errors and hallucinations, Wallace said, one essential safeguard is well-trained workforce that knows better than accept the algorithm’s output without question. With today’s widespread naiveté about AI, he said, 'it’s not terribly different than when GPS came on the scene' and, out of blind trust, users would navigate to nowhere — or drive into a lake, he added, citing an episode of The Office. (Such navigation errors have happened in real life.) But industry also needs to build better, more reliable algorithms that don’t hallucinate as often in the first place, Wallace and the other officials said. Large Language Models, in particular, need to generate their answers based on verified official sources, rather than the internet at large (using a technique known as Retrieval Augmented Generation, aka RAG). LLMs also need to provide links to specific sources that users can double-check, the officials said, rather than just output plausible but unsourced paragraphs, the way publicly available chatbots do. 'There’s some ongoing research that is really intriguing' on such 'traceable' answers, Stanton said. Forcing the AI to footnote its work this way may require more processing power and data storage, he said. But properly curating datasets could also reduce costs, he said, by allowing AI to ignore vast amounts of junk data and just work with the data that actually matters. 'Help us understand what data is relevant &#8230; so we leverage the right data,' Stanton said. 'Or else we’re going to be stuck in data centers we can’t afford, cranking away on datasets that have no relevancy to the problem we’re trying to solve.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/show-me-the-data-disa-leaders-outline-dos-and-donts-on-industry-ai-pitches/	2024-10-29T13:24:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/231121_navy_hackathon_6821369-scaled-e1700595190716.jpg
Space Force chief wants catchy ‘themes’ for naming service kit, including black programs	Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman (right). (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) WASHINGTON — In his latest missive to Guardians, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman says he wants service members to help brainstorm catchy thematic names for a series of Space Force programs. But a follow-up memo by another senior service official includes some already pretty catchy names, for what appear to be previously unpublicized classified efforts — whose nomenclature may give a clue as to their purpose. Saltzman's 'C-NOTE #32', dated Oct. 25 and obtained by Breaking Defense, explains that the naming of equipment and weapon systems is one way a military service substantiates its internal culture. 'Afterall, words are simply thoughts given form, so the way we refer to something says much about the way we conceptualize it. Taken in the aggregate, our collective language provides insight into our shared values, our common desires, our group norms—in other words, our culture,' Saltzman writes in the note, which was sent to all Guardians in the service. 'How do we talk about our equipment in the Space Force? How do we name the systems we operate? Do those names accurately reflect the Guardian spirit—the space warfighting culture that we are working to build? I am not convinced that they do, but we are making strides to rectify that,' he adds. Providing examples from other services, such as the Air Force's F-16 'Fighting Falcon' fighter jet, Saltzman asks: 'For example, should we name the systems within our Missile Warning and Tracking activities after birds of prey? Or systems within SATCOM activities after canines? Should we leverage mythology? Natural phenomenon?' The memo provides a list of 10 areas of Space Force activity for which Guardians are asked to recommend themes that would guide system nicknames by Nov. 30 — ranging from satellite communications to missile warning/tracking to 'orbital warfare.' CSO NOTICE TO GUARDIANS (C-NOTE #32) Attachment 1. Subset of USSF Activities for Weapon System Naming Themes In a follow-up memo Monday, also obtained by Breaking Defense, Lt. Gen. Shawn Bratton, deputy chief of space operations, strategy, plans, programs and requirements provides instructions for the naming process, noting that winning themes will be announced in December. The memo also provides Guardians with background memoranda for guidance purposes, including the official Space Force naming convention process that was created last October, and an 'abridged list' of current 'weapon systems designations' with explanatory notations. The designations list, dated October 2024, for the most part is structured as might be expected. For example, the category 'Navigation Warfare (NAVWAR)' includes all the current versions of the Global Position System (GPS) satellites, which all carry the designation 'NM,' standing for 'NAVWAR' and 'medium Earth orbit.' Likewise, the ground-based Cobra Dane radar falls under the 'Surveillance' category and is designated as ST-108, with the 'ST' standing for 'Surveillance' and 'Terrestrial.' But the list also includes some surprises, including the names of a couple of 'Cyberspace Warfare' and 'Theater Electro-Magnetic Warfare' systems, called 'Red Dragon' and 'Red Cloud' respectively, that do not make an appearance in the fiscal 2025 Space Force budget documentation — suggesting classified programs. Perhaps most interesting is the 'Reconnaissance' mission area, listed separately from that of 'Surveillance.' In military parlance, reconnaissance usually refers to collecting data to answer a specific military question, or more short-term tactical info-gathering missions, whereas surveillance denotes long-term observation of a target area. While the surveillance mission area includes current and developing Space Force radars, the reconnaissance' mission area lists only four systems — all with intriguing code names that once again are nowhere referenced in the service FY25 budget documents. The first three seem likely to be related: Stargate, Snowgate, and Lightgate. The fourth is called Shiloh. And for some reason, all four carry the ST designation just like the radars ground under the Surveillance mission area, rather than using a primary R designator for reconnaissance. The Space Force did not respond by press time to a request for comment about the listed reconnaissance systems. But as Saltzman said, the military likes to group items by name where possible, so while information about these systems is nonexistent in the public sphere, some logical inferences can be made. One not unreasonable guess might be that the '-gate' named systems are fixed, ground-based lasers to track adversary satellites. For one thing, since all the known Space Force radars are under the Surveillance basket, it seemingly would be odd for classified radar to be put into a completely different basket. Thus it stands to reason that the systems under the Reconnaissance basket are not radars. A second hint is that a 'light gate' is a kind of sensor that uses an infrared transmitter and receiver to detects objects passing through the beam, for the purposes of monitoring time, speed, velocity, and acceleration. Air Force Research Laboratory's Starfire Optical Range at Kirtland AFB in New Mexico long has housed telescopes that can track satellites in low Earth orbit, and specialized in experiments that in the past have been linked [PDF] to the use of optical technologies for anti-satellite weapons. Saltzman visited Kirtland in June, where one of several meetings was with officials at the Directed Energy Directorates. Kirtland also is the home of the Space Rapid Capabilities Office, created by Congress in 2018 to take urgent, and largely classified, requirements directly from operators at US Space Command and find ways to quickly get capabilities into the field. Further, the previous head of the Space Force, Gen. Jay Raymond, told the Houses Armed Services Committee back in 2021 that the service was developing directed-energy weapons for space dominance, but would not elaborate in the unclassified session.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-chief-wants-catchy-themes-for-naming-service-kit-including-black-programs/	2024-10-29T12:15:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/saltzman-salute-scaled-e1681836461283.jpg
The Biden-era Pentagon makes its case for continued industrial base funding in new plan	Contractor employees at Iowa Army Ammunition Plant prepare 155 mm artillery rounds to be filled as a part of the load, assemble and pack operation. (Photo by Joint Munitions Command) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon needs to continue key investments to strengthen the nation’s defense industrial base, including in areas like the submarine industry, munitions production and prototyping projects, according to a new National Defense Industrial Strategy Implementation Plan. The implementation plan released today follows the publication of the Pentagon’s first National Defense Industrial Strategy in January. The strategy called for improvements in resilient supply chains, workforce readiness, flexible acquisition, and economic deterrence as four strategic priorities meant to enable the defense industry to ramp up weapons production at speed and scale. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine exposed vulnerabilities in the global defense industry’s supply chain and highlighted the need for the US industrial base to become more agile and resilient, capable of quickly churning out weapons to respond to a crisis if called upon by the Defense Department. RELATED: Pentagon homes in on counter-drone tech in Replicator 2 initiative With nearly three months to go before a new president moves into the White House, the implementation plan can be read as the current Pentagon’s entreaty to the next administration to keep the ball rolling on key industrial initiatives — a list that includes the Defense Production Act, the Office of Strategic Capital, the Replicator initiative and multi-year procurement of missiles and munitions. It also warns what could be at risk if new leaders abandon them. 'Our aim is not merely to maintain America's edge, but to sharpen it and lay the foundation for continued U.S. leadership in critical technologies and capabilities that will define the battlespace of the future,' Pentagon acquisition executive Bill LaPlante wrote in a foreword to the report. 'Most importantly, this implementation plan will serve as a guiding framework for resourcing decisions and investments in the coming years. It will inform our budget priorities, shape our research and development focus areas, and drive our engagement with industry.' During a roundtable this morning, Laura Taylor-Kale, assistant secretary of defense for industrial base policy, stressed that defense industrial policy had been an area of bipartisan support, with the department working with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress to shape the strategy and implementation plan. 'We are confident in the feedback that we're getting, that this will be a priority regardless of who wins next week in the elections,' she said. The implementation plan lays out six key initiatives the Pentagon sees as critical for advancing the stability of the defense industrial base, as well as current funding lines and the risks associated with vulnerabilities in those areas: All told, the Pentagon’s FY25 funding request of $849.8 billion includes $37.73 billion connected to implementation initiatives, slightly down from $39.42 billion in FY24, according to the plan. In both years, more than three quarters of that funding is earmarked for missiles and munitions, with the submarine industrial base in second place with $4 billion requested in FY25. The plan notes that it does not contain initiatives under consideration during FY26 budget deliberations, noting that those efforts are 'predecisional.' Both Taylor-Kale and Carla Zeppieri, deputy assistant secretary of defense for industrial base resilience, declined to comment on whether current plans call for defense industrial base funding efforts to rise in FY26. However, Taylor-Kale noted that the FY26 budget was the first to be built with the National Defense Industrial Strategy in mind. 'I think there was a definite understanding across the board of the importance of building capacity in the defense industrial base and also bringing in nontraditional companies into working with the Department of Defense,' she said. 'There's a real concern around supply chain vulnerabilities and … adversarial sources in our supply chains, as well as sole source and single source [components].' Zeppieri added that 'some of the topics that continue to get emphasized [in the FY26 budget] build on some of the things that we've seen in FY24 and 25 with respect to munitions and the organic industrial base.' Much of the implementation plan functions as a comprehensive list of tools and projects the Pentagon has started to help strengthen the industrial base. For instance, it outlines how $393.4 million in Defense Production Act funding would be spent to address shortfalls in critical chemicals, casting and forgings, the hypersonics industrial base and micro electronics. The plan highlights the U.S. Army’s multibillion-dollar plan to boost domestic 155mm artillery munition production as well as the service’s ongoing efforts to modernize its ammunition plants and depots. It also lays out current efforts to improve the cybersecurity of defense contractors. While there was no big news about high-profile Pentagon projects like Replicator or RDER, the plan did include some interesting tidbits about how the department hopes to enable those programs to come to fruition. For example, the plans states that the department 'intends to commission various projects, studies, and white paper reviews to identify vendors who can accelerate solid rocket motor production,' an effort that Zeppieri described as separate but complimentary to Replicator. The Pentagon is working on a classified annex to the implementation plan, which will include more detail on vulnerabilities and lay out its mitigation strategy in more detail. The department hopes to finalize that document by the end of the year, Taylor-Kale said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-biden-era-pentagon-makes-its-case-for-continued-industrial-base-funding-in-new-plan/	2024-10-29T11:19:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/03/6471690-e1653593193301.jpg
Emirati firms make presence felt at Turkish expo, aiming to boost defense cooperation	Turkish Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler makes a speech during the opening ceremony of SAHA EXPO, Turkiye's leading international defence &amp; aerospace exhibition in Istanbul, Turkiye on October 22, 2024. (Photo by Serhat Cagdas/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Defense companies from the United Arab Emirates made high-profile appearances at the Turkish Saha Expo last week, inking a number of memoranda of understanding and contracts in the latest tightening of security relations between Abu Dhabi and Ankara. 'The agreements signed by Emirati companies at Saha Istanbul are part of an ongoing trend of strengthening defense industrial ties between Türkiye and the UAE, a development that has gained momentum since early 2023,' Albert Vidal, a research analyst for the London-based thinktank IISS, told Breaking Defense. The expo is put on by Saha Istanbul, an association of hundreds of companies and more than two dozen universities — meaning it's a key opportunity for foreign firms to make connections in the Turkish defense world. As such, the UAE's largest defense conglomerate, EDGE Group, said earlier this month that it established a new office, dubbed MALATH, specifically to 'act as a catalyst for new business engagement between EDGE and SAHA companies, marking a new chapter in UAE-Türkiye cooperation in the advanced technology and defence sectors, and creating greater growth opportunities across the wider region and beyond.' At the show MALATH signed an MoU with Turkish ERA RF Technologies in which the two firms are expected to cooperate on advanced satellite communication terminals and ground modems. LAHAB, another EDGE Group entity, signed three agreements with Turkey's ASSAN Group to supply the latter with LAHAB’s MK munitions, with focus on African continent. The Emirati firm will also 'expand its product portfolio through incorporating Warsaw-configured MK munitions, with the support of ASSAN, to meet the operational requirements of its existing customers,' EDGE Group announced last week. The third agreement states that ASSAN will be a 'key supplier' to LAHAB, to deliver 'NATO-standard MK munitions components,' reinforcing LAHAB’s supply chain. 'These agreements with ASSAN Group represent a pivotal move in strengthening our international partnerships and expanding our global footprint, which is a key component of EDGE’s export strategy,' said EDGE Group CEO Hamad Al Marar. From his point of view, Emin Öner, chairman of ASSAN Group, said that his company 'aims to focus on enhancing serial production capacity. Regarding this, we are one of the biggest and one of the most successful in Türkiye. Today, we are taking a very important step toward getting into the global defense market.' In the cybersecurity field, EDGE’s ORYXLABS joined forces with Pavo Group in a strategic partnership 'to develop and execute a joint go-to-market strategy across Türkiye, the Middle East and Africa,' according to a company statement. Elsewhere, building on the earlier agreement with Baykar, EDGE Group signed an agreement to 'strengthen ties,' 'enhance capabilities, and expand market presence for both companies.' RELATED: New EDGE Group CEO says 2024 is the &#8216;year to catch up' on deliveries, talks missile integration Outside of EDGE Group, at the show Emirati aircraft producer Calidus signed an agreement with two Turkish firms, Aselsan and Havelsan, in which Aselsan is expected to provide advanced cockpit display solutions for Calidus’ aircraft, and both firms will collaborate 'on joint production, technological innovation, and upgrading rotary and fixed-wing aircraft' 'This partnership will focus on comprehensive cockpit modernization projects, ensuring the delivery of innovative solutions to meet both current and future operational requirements,' according to Calidus's statement. Havelsan will equip UAE’s Calidus with ground-based training solutions. The UAE air force contracted 40 B-250 trainer aircraft from Abu Dhabi-based Calidus, the first deal ever for the trainer aircraft, the company’s CEO Khalifa Alblooshi, told Breaking Defense in November.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/emirati-firms-make-presence-felt-at-turkish-expo-aiming-to-boost-defense-cooperation/	2024-10-29T09:51:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241029_saha_expo_turkey_defmin_GettyImages-2179397631-scaled-e1730219636858.jpg
Political leaders need to stop standing in the way of defense innovation	The US Capitol. (Photo by Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images) Earlier this month, the global leaders of the defense industrial base converged in Washington DC for the annual Association of the United States Army conference. The entire convention hall overflowed with weapons, munitions, and any type of military gear that one could imagine. Touring the show floor, it became clear that while defense giants like Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon still rule the roost, the startups and tech firms moving into the defense sphere are no longer happy to just get a small piece of the pie, but instead are looking to tip over the applecart of how weapons are provided to the military. Wall Street appears to be bullish on these new startups, and Palantir, arguably the first of this new wave, recently entered the S&amp;P 500 with a larger market cap (as of Oct. 15) than Northrop, which is a phenomenal accomplishment. And the desire of the warfighters to access the products and services offered by these startups appears to be bottomless; having uniformed leaders actively encouraging innovation is a rare sight in the military, but Army officials made it clear at AUSA that they want to engage Which is to say, everything should be lined up for new entrants to succeed — except that standing in the way are three roadblocks, none of which are technological, and all of which the next President and Congress should consider challenging. First are the incessant battles within the legislative branch, in particular from those who sit in the Appropriation Committees supporting national defense. The entire Congress approved a PPBE commission to address the appropriation process challenges, and while the report came back with many recommendations, the Appropriation Committees essentially responded in writing that the problem is not them, it is everyone else. Appropriators manage defense spending down to the thousands of dollars, enjoying the power given to them by being able to decide, line item by line item, what programs get quantity changes or are allowed to be bought. Unfortunately, this creates a constipated system. To try to survive, many of these tech startups then pay lobbying firms stocked with former appropriators to help them navigate the process for the crumbs of funding that they need. This can change fairly quickly if those elected to Congress want it to change. One small step forward would be to approve the Army’s request in the FY26 budget to provide flexible funding for unmanned aircraft systems, capabilities to counter them and electronic warfare tools. The second roadblock resides at the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), where the rules are written for how the Pentagon procures weapons. The rules, set up in the 1960s, often force companies to set up special pentagon-approved accounting systems. These rules have antiquated ideas of how labor should be tracked and compensated, sometimes forcing software engineers to account for their time in fifteen-minute blocks as if they were lawyers and allowing them to be compensated based upon educational attainment rather than productivity. As Bill Greenwalt testified before Congress in March 2024, 'progress in creating alternative acquisition pathways around the acquisition system have been marginal at best.' One fix would be for OSD to deem all software purchases as commercial, giving the services the ability to just buy the majority of software directly while still requiring the services to get approval for any software that is procured on a cost-plus basis. Doing this will further drive the military services to using the multitude of software vendors that do not have compliant DoD-specific back office systems. The third roadblock resides in the service secretary offices and staff. The political leadership of the services control the acquisition powers and comptroller budget powers within the bureaucracy. They could, if they wanted to, devolve those powers down to warfighting leaders, with political leaders providing oversight but not day-to-day decision making. To do this, both money and acquisition authority would be sent to the major warfighting commands where they could procure items directly from defense firms. This bottoms up approach is similar to how the American economy works, rather than the top-down centralized execution model created by the political leadership. Having different warfighting commanders procure different items will create a true marketplace of capabilities, allow winning and losing products to sort naturally. In effect, the era of contracting-to-monopoly would be over. It is hard to tell if the optimism in the air at AUSA will sustain itself once the war in Ukraine and the Isreal come to an end. Should budgets contract, tolerance for risk will be reduced and it is entirely possible that these startups will evaporate. This should not be tolerated, as it is these startups that are going to help secure our nation both militarily and economically. As we approach the upcoming election, it is crucial for new political leaders to prioritize defense innovation by devolving power and reforming the system. We should ask all candidates for federal office where they stand on this issue. No matter which side wins, the new administration should step up, devolve power, and change the system.

Five Eyes officials say they want a shared Top Secret cloud, someday	Close up of a mature man looking at a large computer monitor which is displaying a map of the world along with numerical data &amp; lines linking locations on the Earth. (Getty images) DODIIS 2024 — Members of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance want a Top Secret cloud environment that all five countries can operate on, though it's just an 'ambitious,' aspirational goal for now. Officials from each member nation said here Monday that with such a cloud environment, the allies would be able to seamlessly share data with each other, which would turn information technology interoperability into a reality. Furthermore, in their vision data would be properly 'tagged,' meaning it has metadata that helps identify who and where the data came from, Brig. Gen. Eric Vandenberg, director of the general intelligence enterprise for the Canadian Department of National Defence, told an audience at the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System conference. 'Not only would this cloud be a Top Secret cloud, but it would be classification agnostic as well, because the data is all tagged, because all of my users all have the correct digital identities, I can store all the data in the cloud. Everyone can access what they're allowed to access when they're allowed to access it. It would enable interoperability,' Vandenberg said. RELATED: $2 billion AUD deal for top secret Aussie cloud with AWS Jack Maxton, chief information officer for defence intelligence at the United Kingdom Ministry of Defence, said his top wish is the same as Vandenberg’s, along with cutting down 'unnecessary bureaucracy.' The Five Eyes group already shares intelligence far more readily than most nations do with their foreign counterparts, but Maxton said bureaucratic restrictions in place still 'are adding very little value, either to our security or to our intelligence mission, but because they've been there for so long, we've just got really, really comfortable.' Austin Martin, the assistant Director for Five Eyes IT integration within the American Defense Intelligence Agency’s Chief Information Office, reiterated Vandenberg and Maxton’s wish for such a network, also speaking on the role of data tagging in creating an interoperable environment. He said if he could solve any problem within the Five Eyes today it would be fixing the siloed data so it can exist on one cloud, which includes 'fine-grained tagging data' throughout the 'entirety of the Five Eyes alliance and intelligence enterprise community.' He added that he thinks the US had made 'great strides in recent times' in this area, but 'there's a lot more work to do.' Brig. Andrew McBaron, director general of intelligence data and targeting for the Austrialian Department of Defence, said a five-nation Top Secret may seem 'ambitious' right now, but other Australian officials revealed months ago that Canberra is already working on a three-nation set up. As Breaking Defense reported in December, Australia’s top intelligence official revealed then the development of a 'Top Secret' intelligence cloud that is planned to be interoperable with US and UK spy networks. Though officials did not say when that cloud will be first launched, they said that it will 'transform' how Australian intelligences work together, and with the US and UK.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/five-eyes-officials-say-they-want-a-shared-top-secret-cloud-someday/	2024-10-29T06:43:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_cybersecurity_hack_map_GettyImages-1305131670-scaled.jpg
Japan to get US Navy’s Lockheed-made EW system in first international sale	Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Murasame-class destroyer JS Yudachi (DD 103) and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Sterett (DDG 104) sail together in formation with Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) and Arleigh Burke-class guided-missile destroyer USS Kidd (DDG 100) on Nov. 19, 2023. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Benjamin Ringers) WASHINGTON — For the first time the Japanese military will be installing a Lockheed Martin electronic warfare anti-ship missile capability on its vessels, courtesy of a new $113 million contract, the company announced today. 'The purchase for Japan marks the first international sale of the premier shipboard electronic warfare system in the world,' according to a Lockheed statement. 'Japan is a critical ally in the Western Pacific. Having [Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program] provides the same state-of-the-art system for detecting and identifying threats that the U.S. Navy uses, enhancing shipboard capabilities, and increasing interoperability with the U.S. Navy.' The Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program, or SEWIP, refers to the AN/SLQ-32 system, which the Navy often calls 'slick 32,' and is being installed on almost every surface ship in the American fleet. Generally EW uses electromagnetic or directed energy to accomplish one of three objectives: electromagnetic attack or jamming an adversary’s systems, defensive measures to protect personnel or protect equipment from getting jammed and electronic support which focuses on surveillance and identifying sources of electromagnetic energy. As Lockheed Martin puts it, 'SEWIP allows sailors to protect the ship from the threats you can see (incoming missiles) to those you can’t (radar jamming).' RELATED: Disrupting The ‘Critical Linkage’: What Is The Navy’s SEWIP? The SEWIP program has four blocks, with varying levels of capability: General Dynamics makes Block I, Lockheed Martin produces Block II, Northrop Grumman is responsible for Block III and the fourth block is a yet-to-determined future upgrade. In general, Lockheed Martin's block specifically focuses on enhancing the system's electronic sensing capabilities. Lockheed’s block is installed on the Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and both classes of the Littoral Combat Ship as well as planned for installation on the US Coast Guard’s Offshore Patrol Cutter. The sale to Japan comes as the White House has made multiple efforts to strengthen the US-Japan relationship through defense technology cooperation and investments among other things. In April, Washington and Tokyo announced plans to 'bilaterally upgrade our respective command and control frameworks to enable seamless integration of operations and capabilities and allow for greater interoperability and planning between U.S. and Japanese forces in peacetime and during contingencies. 'More effective U.S.-Japan Alliance command and control will strengthen deterrence and promote a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of pressing regional security challenges,' the White House said. The Navy announced last week that an American F-35B landed onboard a Japanese destroyer for the first time while exercising off the coast of California.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/japan-to-get-us-navys-lockheed-made-ew-system-in-first-international-sale/	2024-10-29T05:00:49-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241028_DVIDS_japanese_ship_8131025-scaled-e1730141075949.jpg
Aussies grappling with AI’s role in cyber threat decision making	The Australian Signals Directorate cyber and foreign intelligence facility in Canberra. (Australian Defense Force) CANBERRA — As Australia's national security establishment seeks to implement the US-led Responsible Military Use of AI and Autonomy Agreement, which requires a human being make the final decision to fire a weapon, a top government official on cyber policy is being up front that his government is trying to figure out how to make it all work. At the core of the challenge, said Peter Anstee, first assistant secretary of the Department of Home Affairs' cyber and technology security policy division, is whether man-in-the-loop decision making can ever be fast enough to keep up with a cyber attack guided by artificial intelligence, or if that requirement will effectively hamstring Canberra's ability to counter and respond to such a threat. 'It's a good question, and one we're currently grappling with,' Anstee said, 'and I don't think there's a straightforward answer.' 'And then there's the question around, where do we draw these guardrails in terms of military applications or use, Anstee said. 'At the moment, the principled approach its that you always have to have a given decision maker sitting within the kill chain. American autonomy and artificial intelligence experts have long pointed to the unique character of cyber warfare, where response times can be measured in nanoseconds, which raises the question whether humans could respond quickly to a significant threat to be effective. But the Australian official said he didn't 'think we've arrived to the point yet in the cyber domain where you'd have real time offense/defense activity happening in cyberspace, where it would be impossible to have a human decision maker insert themselves — short of a threat-to-life scenario, where we haven't defined risk situations yet in a satisfactory way.' When Breaking Defense asked if that was because Australia has not engaged in that type of warfare yet, he said it was a question of 'those special thresholds haven't been significantly defined.' Anstee appeared on a panel here today at the Australia and Pacific Security conference sponsored by the German Konrad Adenauer Foundation. Breaking Defense accepted travel accommodations from the foundation to attend. Shiri Kreb, an expert on cyber warfare and the laws of war from Australia's Deakin University, said during the panel that the nature of cyber means that 'it's not like a yes or no, if we have human control or not, if we have a scale or a spectrum of human guidance to these machines.' Krebs, who is also a legal fellow advising Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, said that, in the end, 'the question is, what can this human do?' And that question extends to AI and autonomous systems such as large drone swarms. 'We have a human in the loop, but how can a human respond to targets generated through 300 drones at the very same time, right? And so I think this is all not about whether we have the human on the loop that needs to verify a target, but rather, what can that human do with his or her cognitive abilities and to add effects, which I think is one of the examples we celebrate,' Krebs said. As opposed to humans, algorithms — especially those that are AI based —evolve 'on its own path' and 'we simply cannot trace it back. So we can have an algorithm making life and death decisions, and ultimately, it's completely unaccountable because we can't trace the reasoning behind that,' she noted. A secondary effect of relying on AI, Krebs said she had learned in interviews with intelligence analysts, is a decline in their skills. 'It became apparent that one of their concerns is this killing off our intelligence forces, mainly because when we allow AI-based technologies to do a lot of the collection and analysis of data. When we don't allow ourselves the type of intelligence work that that we used to devote to each and every target or threat, that means some of our skill and capabilities in this area are being eroded.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aussies-grappling-with-ais-role-in-cyber-threat-decision-making/	2024-10-28T14:38:14-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20220322asd8638673_0001-e1730131581892.jpeg
US SAR satellite imagery firms say draft ITAR changes still too restrictive	SAR image of forces lined up along the Ukraine-Belarus border in February 2022. (Capella Space) WASHINGTON — As the State Department awaits industry comment on proposed space export rules, they're likely going to get a bit of an earful from at least two major American synthetic aperture radar (SAR) firms — who each told Breaking Defense the new regulations would not go nearly far enough to even the playing field with foreign competitors. '[W]e won't be able to sell the premium technology, which means we'll be out-competed by [Finnish firm] ICEYE and other competitors in the global market,' said Jason Mallare, vice president and general manager at Umbra Space's Mission Solutions group. Likewise Frank Backes, CEO of Capella Space, said the proposed regulations, while an improvement, would still mean that some very high-quality American imaging systems designed to be lofted into space on satellites would fall under restrictions in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, even if competing systems from foreign firms are readily available on the commercial market abroad. Besides ICEYE, he said, these include companies 'from Italy, from France, from Germany, [and] from China.' Both California-based companies, along with ICEYE's US arm, are among a handful of commercial firms that have been providing SAR-satellite data to the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) under study contracts since 2022. Senior Intelligence Community officials publicly have credited that commercial SAR imagery as critical in helping the US government support Ukraine in its long-running war with Russia. Further, ICEYE said it is now is providing Kyiv directly with SAR imagery. SAR satellites are particularly of interest to Ukraine because of their ability to 'see' through clouds, rain and fog — weather conditions prevalent in the region. The proposed State Department changes are part of a broad package of space-related export reforms — which also includes changes to the Commerce Department's Export Administration Regulations (EAR) — put together under the auspices of the National Space Council chaired by Vice President Kamala Harris. Specifically, the Oct. 23 State Department proposal would change the threshold on export of SAR-satellite systems based on the radio frequency bandwidth used, which directly affects the resolution quality of the allowable images. At the moment, ITAR prohibits the sale of SAR payloads using a spectrum width of greater than 300 megahertz (MHz); the new proposal would increase that to 500 MHz. It's a change that Umbra and Capella officials were quick to say is going in the right direction toward allowing US firms to stay competitive on the global marketplace, but nonetheless sets a threshold that is still far below what nearly all current SAR systems use. 'The reality is that the industry international standard right now for what's currently being deployed is 1,200 MHz,' Backes said. 'Our systems are currently 1,200 MHz systems. For SAR systems bandwidth is resolution. Resolution is quality. Quality is, in many regards, the value of the data,' Mallare said. At 1,200 MHz, a SAR satellite sensor provides an imagery resolution roughly equivalent to a picture taken by a space-based electro-optical camera with a resolution between 0.25 and 0.30 meters, the officials said. Umbra can provide SAR images down to 16 centimeter resolution, using digital enhancement capabilities. (Umbra Space) Somewhat confusingly, they added, the Commerce Department licensing regulations prohibit the export of SAR data and products that result from the use of a SAR system with a 1,200 MHz bandwidth. The Commerce Department's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is US government entity that provides licenses for operators of all remote sensing satellites, and sets the rules on imagery resolution. 'So the irony of that scenario is, under NOAA, I am licensed to do higher-resolution SAR, I just can't sell it as a system. So, I could sell the data, but I can't sell the system,' Backes said. 'It's frustrating that you have one part of the US government — in our licensing entity at NOAA — who is basically assessed this [1,200 MHz/0.25 meters] is the state of foreign technology and foreign availability. &#8230; And then you have a separate entity of the United States government that's saying this [500 MHz/0.50 meters] is the standard &#8230; of relevant military equipment that's available,' said Todd Master, Umbra's chief operating officer. Backes said that Capella experts are now putting together a comparative analysis that will map more precisely the equivalency between 'the electro-optical recommendation and the SAR recommendation' in the State Department proposed rules. Interestingly, the State Department proposal would also shift the current ITAR threshold for export of electro-optical imagery from 0.30 meters to 0.20 meters, another relaxation of the rules. Officials from both companies said they are working on formal responses to the State Department proposal, which sets a date of Nov. 22 for comments. They also acknowledge that the proposal clearly states that the department is seeking feedback on the current state of the art and market availability of SAR systems — noting US government officials have made clear that the 500 MHz limit is essentially a placeholder, and encouraged them to provide technical data to underpin their arguments for a change. Further, Backes said that Capella intends to try to 'coordinate' some 'industry-broad response as well.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-sar-satellite-imagery-firms-say-draft-itar-changes-still-too-restrictive/	2024-10-28T13:36:18-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/capella_space_russia_collects_20220224_Belarus-Ukraine-Border-Zoomed.png
Israel signs $500 million deal to expand Iron Beam laser air defenses	The Israeli-developed Iron Beam laser system. (Israeli Ministry of Defense) JERUSALEM — Israel’s Ministry of Defense announced today that it had signed a $500 million deal with Rafael and Elbit to expand production of the Iron Beam laser air defense system, set to come online next year. 'The system is expected to integrate into Israel's multi-layered defense array as a complementary capability to the Iron Dome system. This integration will significantly enhance Israel's defense capabilities against current and future threats while offering substantially lower operational costs,' the ministry said in a statement. Iron Dome is the lowest layer of Israel's three-layered system, responsible for taking out rockets, drones and other shorter range threats. The ministry, which has led the development of the system, called the deal a 'major milestone' in a statement. Rafael makes the Iron Dome, and Elbit, which said it is receiving $200 million in the new deal, is expected to supply the high-energy laser system. The laser will be able to counter various types of threats from rockets to mortars, UAVs and also cruise missiles, the ministry said. The IMoD signed a landmark deal worth approximately NIS 2 billion (over $500 million) to expand serial production of Israel&#39;s first domestically developed laser interception system, the Iron Beam, with lead developers Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Elbit Systems. pic.twitter.com/dtAvPluIqm &mdash; Ministry of Defense (@Israel_MOD) October 28, 2024 All eyes have been on Israel's air defenses as it battles Iranian proxies on multiple fronts, from Hamas in Gaza to Hezbollah in Lebanon to the Houthis in Yemen — each of whom is capable of lobbing rockets, missiles, mortars or drones towards Israeli targets — in addition to Iran itself, which has twice launched missile and drone barrages. Today alone, the Israel Defense Forces said 'approximately 115 projectiles fired from the Hezbollah terrorist organization crossed from Lebanon' into Israel. Israel's push for laser defenses predates the current conflict, and in 2022 then-Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said tests had been completed on the Iron Beam system, calling it a 'game changer.' Eyal Zamir, Director General of the Israel Ministry of Defense, said today that the new contract is 'among our most significant agreements.' 'The Iron Beam deal will ensure continued and accelerated procurement of many additional laser systems.' This is part of a much larger procurement drive worth 'billions of dollars' the Ministry noted. Israel calls the focus on local domestic production of new systems 'blue and white' procurement, emphasizing the large funds spent on local defense industries. 'The capabilities developed at Elbit that will be integrated into Iron Beam represent a quantum leap in future defense technology against various threats,' Bezhalel (Butzi) Machlis, President and CEO of Elbit Systems, said. He pointed out that the development of laser technology 'is another significant step in maturing Elbit Systems' diverse capabilities in transforming and advancing defense and warfare technologies.' The Iron Beam development comes amid other Israeli initiatives relating to lasers, countering drones and financing air defenses. Rafael announced that it had developed a smaller laser air defense system called Lite Beam at AUSA in early October. The smaller system can be mounted on vehicles. On Oct. 15, the Israeli Ministry of Defense hosted an event in the Negev desert at which eight Israeli companies showcased their innovations to counter different types of UAV threats. In addition on Oct. 21 the Ministry announced that it had completed an exchange of letters with the US 'initiating the implementation of a special emergency aid package totaling $5.2 billion to strengthen Israel's air defense system[s]. This strategic support will enhance and expand Israel’s Iron Dome, David's Sling, and the developing ‘Iron Beam’ laser defense system,' the Ministry said at the time.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/israel-signs-500-million-deal-to-expand-iron-beam-laser-air-defenses/	2024-10-28T13:04:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/221205_iron_beam_daytime_MoD-scaled-e1670266593660.jpg
AI has role to play in protecting American nuclear C2 systems: STRATCOM head	Lt. Gen.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Chase Sullivan) DODIIS 2024 — US Strategic Command must update its nuclear command, control and communications (NC3) systems to become more resilient to adversaries, which includes implementing artificial intelligence and machine learning, STRATCOM's chief said today. NC3 systems 'must be secure, and they must be redundant to function in both conventional conflict conflicts or nuclear ones,' Gen. Anthony Cotton, commander of STRATCOM, said during his keynote address at the Department of Defense Intelligence Information System conference here in Omaha. 'Robust cybersecurity measures are critical to protect NC3 systems from adversary attacks or manipulation. Maintaining technological superiority in IT systems create uncertainty in the calculus of our adversaries. That enhances deterrence.' 'Advanced AI and robust data analytics capabilities provide decision advantage and improve our deterrence posture. IT and AI superiority allows for more effective integration of conventional and nuclear capabilities, strengthening deterrence. IT superiority is crucial in this new paradigm, enabling us to deter aggression across physical and virtual realms,' he added. To be able to mobilize such AI and ML, STRATCOM must first work on centralizing its data, Cotton said. If data can be a 'communal asset,' this will make it more possible to add AI and ML into the NC3 systems and allow warfighters and allies to share their information. Data, he said, are 'foundational for the AI application and research for STRATCOM. We must maintain the advantage over our adversaries by enabling faster and better decisions. Effective data management will help ensure we maintain decision advantage by enabling rapid and informed decision making across the enterprise. STRATCOM will transform to a data-centric organization that leverages high-quality data,' Cotton said. However, STRATCOM still has 'a long way to go' in centralizing its data, Cotton said, adding that his team is 'hindered by disparate data formats and lengthy timelines.' Though Cotton emphasized the strategic advantages that AI and ML will add to its NC3 systems, he said that a human must still be involved in the loop as this will 'maximize the adoption of these capabilities and maintain our edge over our adversaries.' He added later that the US’ adversaries are also making strides in AI and ML, which requires the US to have 'constant vigilance and adaptation.' He assured the audience that the US is 'ahead of' the adversary currently, but 'we simply must maintain and expand that lead.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/america-needs-ai-in-its-nuclear-c2-systems-to-stay-ahead-of-adversaries-stratcom-head/	2024-10-28T11:38:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/6741362-scaled-e1663270224912.jpg
To focus on China, US needs to wean off Europe and Middle East missions	A Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) Block 1B interceptor missile is launched from the guided-missile cruiser USS Lake Erie (CG 70) during a Missile Defense Agency and U.S. Navy test in the mid-Pacific. (U.S. Navy photo/Released) Earlier this month, Gen. Charles Flynn, the head of US Army Pacific, appeared at the Center for a New American Security with a clear warning: China’s build-up in land, air, and naval power has put it on an 'accelerated path' toward military superiority in the region. Concerns about China’s military capabilities are par for the course in national security circles these days, but Flynn’s direct comments serve as a good reminder that the PLA’s growth is not something just happening in hypothetical papers, but something the US military is seeing in real time. The problem is that for all the talk about how China is the 'pacing challenge' and needs to be the main focus for Washington, the US is overstretched at this most critical juncture. The uncomfortable reality: To be able to focus on China, American commitments need to change abroad. A quick survey of America’s missions abroad sums the situation up. In the Middle East, the US Navy has steadily chipped away at its already limited inventory of missiles intended to protect its ships in a war with China. In May 2024, Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro reported that the US launched more than $1 billion in missiles during operations against the Houthis, consisting of nearly 100 SM-2 and SM-6 surface-to-air missiles. In October 2024, US Navy destroyers fired roughly one dozen of the Navy’s advanced SM-3 surface-to-air missiles in one night, intercepting Iranian ballistic missiles targeting Israel — and expending an entire year’s worth of production for the Navy’s top-flight missile defense interceptor. For years, experts have warned that the US Navy was not acquiring the missiles it needed to defend itself in the Indo-Pacific fast enough and now it is using them up at an alarming rate in a secondary theater. In Europe, Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine has captured America’s attention for nearly three years, drawing the focus away from China at a crucial time. American military deployments to Europe continue to grow as Russian actions in Ukraine distract from China’s efforts to displace the United States as the guarantor of the prevailing international order. With the United States focused on the conflict in Ukraine, China has been emboldened to challenge American interests in the Indo-Pacific, raising questions about whether US support for Ukraine detracts from support for Taiwan and, more broadly, American efforts to secure a free and open Indo-Pacific. If the United States remains overstretched, it will only further the ambitions of the so-called 'Axis of Upheaval'— the term my colleagues at CNAS have assigned to the loose coalition of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea intent on disrupting the American-led international order that has ensured economic, political, and security stability since the Second World War. The situation, however, is not hopeless. There are several options available to prevent that outcome, if political leadership in Washington is willing to make hard choices. In Europe, American military power and its extended nuclear deterrent must remain the bedrock of European security, but the US should continue pressing its NATO allies to invest in collective defense. All NATO members should meet — and ideally exceed — the 2 percent spending target set by the alliance. Russia’s invasion prompted long-time NATO partners Sweden and Finland to formally join the alliance and spurred significant investment in military modernization and planning in Poland, and critically, among the Baltic states along NATO’s vulnerable northeastern flank. The US should push NATO to capitalize on these developments by expanding its Enhanced Forward Presence mission, ensuring that it can support frontline NATO battlegroups with the necessary reinforcements during a crisis, and continuing to support defense innovation in key areas among its member states. That would allow the US to draw down its presence in Europe, freeing up assets for use in the Pacific — the kind of movement that was underway before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. In the Middle East, the US should reduce its commitment of high-end capabilities within the region and redeploy them to the Indo-Pacific region. The rapid expenditure of advanced munitions in the region is unsustainable. The US should take the lead in organizing a multinational coalition of allies and partners to protect commercial shipping, allowing American military forces to take on a reduced role in the interception of Houthi missiles. This effort could model the success of the EU-led counterpiracy taskforces that operated off the Horn of Africa for many years. That must go hand in hand with the US pressing Israel to reach a solution to the crisis in the Middle East that allows the Pentagon to reduce its force posture in the region. The diversion of thousands of US servicemembers and critical missile and air defense capabilities to the region detracts from the ability to place those forces in the Indo-Pacific where they may be needed on short notice in a crisis with China. In addition to doubling-down on its own posture in the region, the US must prioritize the capacity of partners and allies in the Indo-Pacific to support US operations during peacetime competition and wartime engagement. To do so, the US must increase the production rate of the critical munitions it expects to rely on in great number during a conflict with China; while US production lines are hitting maximum output, encouraging investment from allies and partners in their own domestic production, as Australia is currently doing, can help make up shortfalls. To ease the logistical burden of surging American forces into the region during a crisis, the US should expand its efforts to preposition and stockpile American military hardware in the region. And the US must continue to encourage its allies and partners in the region to invest in their own defense capabilities in ways that complement American advantages in the region. Interoperability and familiarity are foundational to this approach and a key objective of the US military’s approach to peacetime campaigning in the region. Finally, the United States must ensure that the trilateral AUKUS agreement proceeds on schedule. This landmark agreement serves as a bedrock for future security in the region and a framework for expanded cooperation with other key Indo-Pacific allies and partners. President Xi has chosen to support his partners in the 'Axis of Upheaval' in large part to sow the decline of the American-led international order — with the goal of making sure the US is stretched thinly if China decides to make moves in the Indo-Pacific. If the United States cannot rebalance its military focus toward the Indo-Pacific it risks expediting Chinese aggression in the region and furthering the decline of the US-led economic and political order worldwide. Yes, a relative withdrawal from Europe and the Middle East is difficult to swallow and carries its own risks. But if China is the biggest threat to American interests, then it has to remain the biggest focus of America’s capabilities — even if it comes with accepting risk elsewhere.

‘Growing desperation’? NATO chief confirms North Korean troops deployed to help Russia in Kursk	NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte addresses media after a North Atlantic Council meeting with Republic of Korea intelligence and defense officials (NATO) BELFAST — North Korean troops have been deployed to the Russian border territory of Kursk in support of Moscow’s war against Ukraine, the head of NATO said today, calling the move 'a sign of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's growing desperation.' 'I can confirm that North Korean troops have been sent to Russia and that North Korean military units have been deployed to the Kursk Region,' Secretary General Mark Rutte said in a press briefing after a North Atlantic Council meeting with South Korea’s National Intelligence Service and its Ministry of National Defense. Rutte called the development a 'significant escalation' of DPRK’s continued involvement in Russia’s 'illegal war' against Ukraine and a further 'breach' of UN Security Council resolutions. Hours later Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters an estimated 10,000 North Korean troops had been sent to 'train in eastern Russia [and] will probably augment Russian forces near Ukraine over the next several weeks.' Singh said 'a portion of those solders have already moved closer to Ukraine.' Echoing Rutte, Singh said any move to put North Korean troops in combat 'highlights President Putin's increasing desperation, as Russia has suffered extraordinary casualties on the battlefield, and an indication that Putin may be in more trouble than people realize.' The troop commitment mirrors the estimated number of troops — 10,000 — that Ukraine used to seize portions of the Russian territory of Kursk in August. Rutte said that NATO 'calls on Russia and the DPRK to cease these actions immediately.' 'The deepening military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a threat to both the Indo-Pacific and Euro-Atlantic security. It undermines peace on the Korean Peninsula and fuels the Russian war against Ukraine,' he said. Earlier this month, John Kirby, US National Security Adviser, said that should DPRK troops be deployed in Russia they could expect to be treated as 'fair game' by Ukrainian forces. 'The possibility that there could be dead and wounded North Korean soldiers fighting against Ukraine is — is absolutely real if they get deployed,' he told reporters. On Friday the Council on Foreign Relations published an analysis on the potential introduction of North Korean troops into the fighting, saying in a counterpoint to Rutte and Singh that since Russian forces have been gaining ground recently, it's unlikely Putin was acting out of desperation. 'Rather, Putin is probably making this move based on tactical considerations,' the analysis said. 'In helping Russia retake Kursk, the North Korean contingent can also allow Putin to focus Russian forces on their advance in eastern Ukraine, the main front where Russia has been steadily, if slowly, advancing.' Either way, defense ties have become more pronounced since Moscow and Pyongyang signed a mutual defense agreement in June. The pact commits the two sides to come to the other's defense in the event of being attacked. Beyond troops, it is estimated that the DPRK has supplied Moscow with over 8 million 122mm and 155mm artillery shells, based on Republic of Korea intelligence that the nation says has been verified by satellite imagery of Russian cargo ships transporting weapons in large containers out of North Korean ports. Ukrainian officials have also said North Korean KN-23 short-range ballistic missiles have been used to target Ukrainian cities. 'Pyongyang has already supplied Russia with millions of rounds of ammunition and ballistic missiles that are fuelling a major conflict in the heart of Europe and undermining global peace and security,' Rutte explained. 'In exchange, Putin is providing North Korea with military technology and other support to circumvent international sanctions.' Russian forces have sustained more than 600,000 losses or injured personnel since the war in Ukraine started, leaving Putin 'unable to sustain his assault &#8230; without foreign support,' according to Rutte. Allies, Ukraine and Indo-Pacific partners are in close consultation about the Kursk deployment and the need to bolster military aid for Kyiv, he added. On Sunday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X that additional military aid packages are expected 'next week,' following the creation of a northern Europe cooperation pact made up of Ukraine, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland. 'We expect support from all our partners for the Victory Plan,' he shared. 'They all understand the importance of being resolute and the necessity of creating challenges for the aggressor, so that Russia loses the ability to disrupt global stability.'

How new White House AI memo impacts, and restricts, the Pentagon	149th Intelligence Squadron airmen conduct training in a computer training lab at Mather Field, California Dec. 2, 2023. The December 2023 UTA focus was on the readiness of the airmen by embracing their unit's stated mission to 'Organize, train, and equip Cyber-ISR leaders to provide intelligence in support of federal and state mission priorities​. WASHINGTON — A landmark National Security Memorandum recently signed by President Joe Biden requires human oversight, safety testing and other safeguards for many military and intelligence applications of artificial intelligence. The memo also launches a sweeping review of how the Pentagon and intelligence agencies acquire AI, with recommendations for regulatory changes and other reforms due back next year. However, neither the memo itself nor the accompanying Risk Management Framework [PDF] impose significant new restrictions on AI-controlled drones, munitions and other 'autonomous weapons,' the chief concern of many arms control activists around the world. Instead, the RMF largely defers on that issue to existing Pentagon policy, DoD Directive 3000.09 [PDF], which was extensively revised last year to restrict, but not prohibit, autonomous weapons (some of which already exist in the form of computer-controlled anti-aircraft and missile defenses). The new policy documents, by contrast, focus on AI used to analyze information and make decisions — including about the use of lethal force. That said, the memo does mention 'a classified annex' that 'addresses additional sensitive national security issues, including countering adversary use of AI that poses risks to United States national security.' The published documents do not specify what kind of 'adversary use' the annex covers nor what other 'sensitive' issues it might address. RELATED: Clear guardrails mean faster progress on AI: Biden signs sweeping guidance for DoD &amp; IC The other major question mark, of course, is the election: Many of the mandates in the memo and the RMF won’t even take effect until next year. While a Kamala Harris administration would presumably continue Biden’s policies, the GOP platform already promises to 'repeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order [published last year] that hinders AI Innovation.' And former advisors to President Donald Trump have called for a 'Manhattan Project' approach to accelerate military AI. A Trump Administration might well remove all the restrictions and guardrails in the Biden plan. Current and former Biden administration officials have emphasized that the goal of the new policy is to accelerate adoption of AI by setting clear guardrails, not to hinder what they call 'responsible' employment. As a result, the memo and RMF rarely impose outright prohibitions and more often allow AI development and deployment to proceed — if, and only if, an extensive checklist of best practices is followed. One of the few blanket bans in the RFM is against using AI [to] remove a human ‘in the loop’ for actions critical to informing and executing decisions by the President to initiate or terminate nuclear weapons employment.' This is a reaffirmation of longstanding US policy that computers can't be allowed to launch nuclear weapons without human oversight. The framework restricts use of AI to forecast likely civilian casualties and collateral damage when planning a potential military strike. Any such use of AI requires both technical safeguards, such as continuous 'rigorous testing' of the AI, and human oversight 'by trained personnel.' The framework forbids computer-generated intelligence reports and analysis 'based solely on AI' unless they are clearly labeled with 'sufficient warnings' to the reader. RELATED: Can tech reduce civilian deaths in conflict? Mark Milley isn’t so sure. The framework then goes into a longer list of 'high impact AI use cases,' all of which are allowed if, and only if agencies implement a detailed set of guardrails. Many of these precautions are about protecting human rights. That includes restrictions on AI 'tracking or identifying [or] classifying an individual as a known or suspected terrorist, insider threat, or other national security threat.' The framework also mandates human oversight of any AI assessing eligibility for benefits ranging from political asylum to federal employment. Yet other provisions aim to ensure that human beings remain in control of AI and can be held accountable for whatever the software does, from handling nuclear and other hazardous materials, or deploying malware online. Before a new AI is even deployed for the first time — and retroactively for AI already in use — agencies must conduct a thorough 'risk and impact assessment,' including an up-front, bottom-line cost-benefit analysis of whether AI is even the right solution for the problem at hand, as opposed to more traditional tools. The mandated guardrails include extensive testing 'in a realistic context,' preferably including a 'pilots and limited releases' prior to widespread deployment; analysis of 'possible failure modes' and mitigations; assessment of whether the underlying data to train, test, and update the AI is accurate, adequate, and accessible; and ongoing, continuous monitoring to ensure the AI continues to perform as intended. The mandatory best practices also address the human users of AI. They must be trained not only to operate it, but to watch for errors instead of blindly trusting the machine (what’s called 'automation bias'), with reporting channels and whistleblower protections when problems arise. Unsurprisingly, the policy does make it possible to waive some or all of these safeguards. But such waivers must come, in writing, directly from an agency’s designated Chief AI Officer, and be reviewed and renewed at least annually Overall, the National Security Memorandum and the Risk Management Framework are not about banning sensitive uses of AI, but regulating them — without getting in the way of rapid progress in the tech race with China. 'The NSM does a good job of balancing between making clear what is not allowed and enabling rapid adoption by the national security community, when the technology and the testing environment mean you can validate the ability to do it safely,' said Michael Horowitz, a UPENN professor who, until recently, worked on AI as deputy assistant secretary of defense for emerging capabilities. And, he told Breaking Defense, the Pentagon has spent years figuring out just how to test and safeguard such systems. 'DoD and other agencies have decades of experience in developing and employing AI, and in designing policies to do so safely,' Horowitz said. 'The NSM not only builds on those lessons learned, it breaks new ground in ensuring the national security community can adopt AI with responsible speed.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/how-new-white-house-ai-memo-impacts-and-restricts-the-pentagon/	2024-10-28T07:23:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241028_DVIDS_intel_squadron_8201945-scaled-e1730121863433.jpg
Space Force scrambling to get GPS ground system upgrades done by 2025	Spc. Caleb Green of 2nd Battalion, 13th Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division, prepares for his nightly call-for-fire mission with the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance System (LRAS) mounted on top. (Photo: Gregory Dalglish, Test Officer, Intelligence Electronic Warfare Test Directorate) WASHINGTON — The Space Force is pushing hard to wrap up its long lagging programs to upgrade the ground systems and receivers for Global Position System (GPS) satellites — including ditching the Air Force B-2 bomber as a first test platform for airborne receivers capable of using the jam-resistant M-Code signal in order to speed them to cross-service aircraft operators, according to a senior service acquisition official. 'Current programs that are scheduled to complete in 2025? &#8230; There is a gun to our head to finish in 2025,' Cordell DeLaPena, program executive officer for Military Communications &amp; Positioning, Navigation, and Timing at Space Systems Command (SSC), said on Thursday. Speaking at SSC's annual Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles, he said that progress is being made on the troubled ground system for command and control of the most modern GPS satellites, the Next-Generation Operational Control System (OCX). Being developed by RTX (formerly Raytheon), OCX is needed to allow some 700 weapon systems across the US military to fully access the encrypted M-Code signal. However, the program has been a poster child for broken acquisition, having been originally planned to begin operations more than a decade ago. OCX 'is almost done with the lab development. Operator testing starts next month. There's one final acquisition program baseline, APB, milestone left on that program. It's called &#8216;ready to transition operations.' Think of that as readiness to enter operational test. That's the last milestone, and we're going to hit it before the end of the year,' DeLaPena pledged. The Space Force also has shaken up its multifaceted effort to field the M-Code user kit being developed under the Military GPS User Equipment (MGUE) program, he said. That program also has been one of the banes of the GPS program for more than two decades — as reported ad nauseam by the Government Accountability Office and the Pentagon’s Office of Test &amp; Evaluation. Under that program, the Space Force is in charge of developing the microchips and microelectronics cards that interface with the M-Code signals, although each individual service is responsible for building service-specific receivers/radios that use those components. MGUE has two phases. MGUE Increment 1 is developing the baseline military-unique ASIC chips and cards for initial integration with platforms across the services, including Army Strykers land vehicles, Marine Corps Joint Light Tactical Vehicles (JLTVs), and the Navy’s DDG-class destroyers — as well as, until recently, the Air Force's B-2 bomber. MGUE Increment 2 will deliver a smaller, more powerful ASIC chip for use by handheld radios and precision-guided munitions. 'Military GPS User Equipment Increment 1? &#8230; We've got to finish that program,' DeLaPena said. 'We've completed the certification for the terrestrial domain. The Army is buying it big time for their users, for their for their Strykers. The Marine Corps for their JLTVs. In September, I certified the maritime platform, which is the Navy destroyer, the DDG,' he added. 'The final APB milestone on MGUE Increment 1 is certification for the aviation platform. We did something very interesting over the past two weeks,' DeLaPena explained. After it became clear that the Air Force 'could not make a B-2 available for this program,' SSC made a proposal to the Department of the Air Force's space acquisition czar, Frank Calvelli, that an Army aircraft — a Gray Eagle unmanned aerial vehicle — be used as a test vehicle instead. (A September GAO report found that the Air Force's internal effort to develop the radios for the M-Code chips has fallen significantly behind schedule.) After coordinating on the proposal with the Defense Department Office of the Director of Test &amp; Evaluation, the Army, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, Calvelli signed off on that change in lead test aircraft on Thursday, DeLaPena said. 'We are pressing ahead with MGUE Increment 1, and we're going to meet that final milestone in 2025,' he vowed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-scrambling-to-get-gps-ground-system-upgrades-done-by-2025/	2024-10-28T06:16:59-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GPS-on-Stryker-scaled-e1729893191673.jpg
Better user interface and experience create faster decision-making in multi-domain operations	Teague works with partners like Overland AI, a company on the leading edge of autonomous land systems, on user experience for navigating complex, off-road terrain at operationally relevant speeds. (Photo courtesy of Overland AI). The Defense Department’s focus on joint and multi-domain operations is rapidly increasing the pace of technology development – everything from tactical radios and hand-held controllers for first-person-view quadcopters to command and control consoles for ISR platforms. To be most effective, those systems and many others need to be designed in such a way that they speed decision making for multi-domain operations, for example, not hinder it. In other words, users need well-designed visual elements like buttons and screens, what’s known as User Interface (UI), and well thought out system processes to help them solve problems, commonly called User Experience (UX). We discussed how UX/UI can be an enabler for future operations with: Tim Heiser, director of defense programs, and Matt McElvogue, vice president of design, at Teague, a firm with 98 years of experience pioneering human-centered design within complex systems and emerging technologies. Breaking Defense: How is UX/UI defined through a military lens? Tim Heiser is Director of Defense Programs at Teague. Heiser: When I hear military customers speak, they need two things: capacity and capability, and they need it now. At Teague, we view good UX design as being able to translate technology to the human who needs to use it, allowing prioritized and simplified decision making in an already stressful and demanding situation. That’s the lens that the military is starting to see through as well. The days of training to an asset with a three-inch thick binder are starting to wane. There’s a place for the binder, but supplementing or replacing that approach with intuitive systems and design helps field capability quicker. McElvogue: There are also usability issues when it comes to automation and the amount of data that's generated by new sensing technology. There's more information to sort through than there has been in the past. Software has to evolve to allow the human user to have some agency – to understand what's happening, know when they need to plug in and direct something, and understand the repercussions of their actions. The DoD is working to bring in non-traditional defense companies. What role does UX/UI play in the widening of this aperture? Heiser: If you think about the amount of technology that's coming to the military – from research labs across the multitude of private and government services, to companies on the commercial end – you no longer have just the three to five big primes developing the ‘next thing.’ Innovation is coming from different spaces within the market in the defense arena, and that's new for the military. It's no longer that you procure capability and technology developed over 20 years, mature it, and field it. It's coming much faster and from different angles. All of it has the same intent, which is to put the best technology in the hands of the warfighter faster than we've ever done it before. Matt McElvogue is Vice President of Design at Teague. McElvogue: Prioritizing decision making is probably more critical today than it's ever been. We’re at a moment in time when a new generation is coming into the military and entering command structures. They’ve grown up post-Internet, with smartphones being something they had in their pockets from an early age. They’re used to using products that have had millions of dollars put into their user experience to make them easy to use. Whether they realize it or not, they're bringing that perspective to the tools that they use at work. They’re asking for better UX as they're brought into the process of evaluating new equipment and interfaces. That’s leading traditional defense companies to seek out new partners to better serve the needs of the military and improve their product offering. Teague works with many of these partners, including Overland AI, a company on the leading edge of autonomous land systems. Their tech is used to navigate complex, off-road terrain at operationally relevant speeds. We've been helping them demonstrate their autonomy stack, OverDrive, through a custom UI that allows warfighters to intuitively interact with the platform’s capabilities – planning routes, executing missions, and providing feedback to the user when their input is needed. The UI we designed has allowed them to visualize and demonstrate their unique capabilities for senior stakeholders and end users in the military, which has sped up adoption of their products. What military systems could benefit the most from improved UX/UI? Heiser: Increasingly, traditional military systems are needing to connect to newer systems that were developed to do a singular task. It’s a very challenging job for someone to oversee, engage, and make decisions with those systems that have been connected, not only within a platform but even across domains. The trick is, how do you upgrade a legacy system that's already been certified, that has been trained on for years? One approach that avoids costly, time-consuming rebuilding is to create an interface that ‘sits’ like a layer on the front. This way, the interconnectivity happens behind the scenes and is seamless to the person who needs to engage with the system. This approach has been a hot topic for us, as many companies we work with are looking to ensure their systems are adaptable to emerging technologies. McElvogue: When you're introducing a new technology, that’s the right time to make sure that you have a human-centered design perspective. When you focus on UX early on, rather than first having technical requirements and then trying to build end-user requirements later, the two can inform one another. Imagine a day in the life of a JTAC (Joint Terminal Attack Controller) or someone that's moving between different systems and products from planning and executing a mission, to talking to intelligence and debriefing after the mission. They're moving through many different company experiences. I think the military is now becoming aware that they source products from all over the place and they need to bring those experiences together in a way that doesn't hinder the individual from doing their job efficiently and without needless mistakes. Human-centered design shows a proven advantage for the end-user – in this case, the warfighter – and can also be a competitive advantage for products in the defense sector. A custom UI developed by Teague allows warfighters to intuitively interact with the platform’s capabilities – planning routes, executing missions, and providing feedback to the user. (Overland AI photo). What’s the role of UX/UI in near-peer conflicts and multi-domain operations? Heiser: If you think about mission planning and execution, the mission planning phase often can take days to digest information, create a battle management plan, and then send that out to your battalions to execute. Because of the amount and speed of information that is coming in while you're executing, you need to have a strategy to quickly digest it and make it usable for the next action. Now the question becomes, do you want the human in or out of the loop regarding the decision to engage with that information? By segmenting and segregating that information and creating the ability to synthesize data and present it to the individual that is in the loop to make decisions, that entire information loop starts to become tighter and faster. In systems where multiple pieces of information are coming together for a ‘go button’ to be pushed, we have observed hesitancy because either there’s too much information, the user doesn’t trust it, or it doesn't look like it did yesterday. In their experience, it's not telling them what they think it should be. And that’s when the UX design becomes incredibly important – for simplification, prioritization, and management of that data. Autonomy is driving development of many DoD systems. What’s the role of HMI, the human-machine interface, in autonomy? McElvogue: We work with autonomous tech, both in defense and in the consumer space, and there's trends across both. When autonomy comes into the picture, you are asking a human to go from the frame of mind where they have direct control, like a gas pedal, to a world where they're operating the asset in a more removed way. It's puppet mastering; you're telling it to do something and then waiting to see how it did. It's a new form of control that requires new skills and interfaces to know how things are going. When I'm watching it execute, making alterations, that requires a new rebuilding of trust with a system when the user doesn’t have direct control. It’s about communicating in a manner that meets them on their level. For example, the systems that we have designed for autonomous vehicles feature multiple styles of communication such as visual, verbal, and written so people can receive communications in ways that are better for them and the tasks they’re trying to accomplish. You might have a map view, a view that shows the steps it's moving through, or have auditory verbal communication. You can dial one or the other back. Similarly, when you replace the usual controls with new modes of control, you can give the operator the ability to interrupt or change the behavior of the platform. Building up the user’s trust in the autonomous system is quite important for the system or technology to be effective. Final thoughts? McElvogue: Looking early at user requirements alongside the technical requirements improves your technology. Bringing in human-centered design early in the process is a competitive advantage for a product in the defense sector, just like it is in any sector. That's proven on the consumer side and companies are waking up to that fact on the defense side. Heiser: We must acknowledge that we are asking more out of our warfighters. The speed of technology is outpacing an individual's reasonable ability to digest all that information and be able to make difficult decisions in stressful situations. We have to recognize and design for those situations so that our warfighters can make the decisions they need to make at the time they need to make it.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/better-user-interface-and-experience-create-faster-decision-making-in-multi-domain-operations/	2024-10-28T05:35:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/BehindTeague.jpg
Lebanon receiving $1B in aid amid ongoing conflict	French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot speaks during the International Conference in Support of Lebanon's People and Sovereignty in Paris, France on October 24, 2024. (Photo by Umit Donmez/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — A conference in support of Lebanon held in Paris has raised $1 billion for the country, according to French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot. 'We have collectively raised $800 million in humanitarian aid and $200 million for the security forces, that’s about $1 billion,' he said Thursday at the International Conference in Support of Lebanon's People and Sovereignty. The conference, which hosted 70 governmental delegations, follows previous sentiments from France that it would support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) in security missions at the southern border. France is 'standing by the LAF, and we have been thinking of preparing different initiatives, always to support the political decision,' a French official told Breaking Defense back in May. The LAF haven’t yet taken part in the ongoing conflict in South Lebanon between Hezbollah and Israel, and even repositioned its troops farther north as the conflict intensified. In his speech at the conference, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati assured the cabinet’s commitment to implement the 1701 Security Council Resolution — which put an end to 2006 war between Hezbollah and Israel. 'The Lebanese government's commitment starting with recruiting additional Lebanese soldiers in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1701 shows a clear commitment to implementing this resolution,' Mikati said. 'The decision to recruit more soldiers constitutes an important step towards enhancing the ability of the Lebanese Armed Forces to maintain security and stability in the region.' He added that successful implementation of 1701 'will require the support of the international community. This assistance can come in various forms, including financial support, training, and technical assistance to ensure the recruitment process is carried out effectively and efficiently.' In addition to Resolution 1701, Barrot highlighted that the joint proposal made in September by France and the United States for a 3-week truce remains the basis for any potential ceasefire in Lebanon. Barrot noted that $300 million of the money raised for humanitarian aid came from the US, according to Reuters. The US has traditionally sent military aid to Lebanon, previously donating three Huey II and six MD-530 helicopters to the Lebanese air force, and three protector class boats to the navy.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lebanon-receiving-1b-in-aid-amid-ongoing-conflict/	2024-10-25T12:25:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GettyImages-2179882764-scaled-e1729876112662.jpg
Join the commercial space reserve: Get longer contracts, in-depth threat briefs; play wargames	Col. Rich Kniseley, head of Space Systems Command’s Commercial Space Office. (US Air Force photo by Cherie Cullen) WASHINGTON — When the Space Force contracts commercial companies to provide 'reserve' capabilities that could be 'surged' in times of conflict — and possibly denied to non-US customers for a period of time — those joining can expect a number of peacetime benefits in exchange for their willingness to serve, according to the head of the Space Force's Commercial Space Office (COMSO). Speaking to reporters on Thursday during Space Systems Command's annual Space Industry Days conference, Col. Rich Kniseley said these benefits could include: longer funding periods; in-depth threat briefings based on a firm's security clearance status; and opportunities to participate in Pentagon wargames. Kniseley, who is spearheading the work to develop a space version of the Civil Air Reserve, called the Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR), stressed that while the plan is still nascent, a number of elements are emerging based on industry feedback to sessions the Space Force held in August. '[O]verwhelmingly, I think industry is still very positive on CASR, we still have some runway to fix some of the concerns, and we're definitely on a path with what industry has been asking for,' he said. During a conference panel discussion, Kniseley said that his game plan is still to release the first set of initial CASR contracts to providers of space domain awareness data and analysis — though his timeframe has slipped a bit, moving from late this year to early next year. 'I'm very confident that we will have our first CASR contracts by early of next year, targeting space awareness,' he said. Kinseley told reporters his office already is working with US Space Command's multinational Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell, headed by Barbara Golf, to craft the contracts already in place through the Global Data Marketplace. The JCO gathers and disseminates commercial space monitoring data to augment military space surveillance, primarily through the National Space Defense Center, which in turn brings together military and Intelligence Community (IC) operators to determine how best to prevent adversary attacks on Defense Department space systems. 'The contracts that we will do with space domain awareness will be very much linked with what Ms. Golf is doing in the JCO. In fact, they will be building upon the current contracts that are already being utilized through the Global Data Marketplace,' Kniseley said. But based on feedback from industry, the Space Force 'would like to do longer periods of performance for would-be CASR members,' he said, noting that a lot of the JCO contracts currently are 'month to month.' Kniseley told the conference that his team also is working with the JCO to ensure that CASR services contracted actually will be useful to SPACECOM operators and properly integrated into joint force concepts of operations. 'I think sometimes industry is looking at CASR is like, I go to the grocery store and I slap organic on it, and, people automatically want to buy it. CASR is going to be aligned very well with the [Space Force] commercial strategy, and it's going to be mission areas that are on the commercial strategy that we're going to be going after,' he said. 'We are doing mission area assessments right now for commercial SATCOM [satellite communications] in the Indo-Pacific region. That's ongoing right now. We will do other mission areas for other combatant commands as well, and what that's going to show us is how much I need to have on contract. So I'm not buying commercial for commercial sake. I am filling a need for the war fighter and filling a gap or an area that we can augment with these commercial capabilities,' Kniseley explained. CASR agreements for other mission areas, such as tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking as well as alternate positioning, navigation and timing will follow. 'Every mission area is different. Every company is different,' Kniseley stressed. 'So there's not going to be a one size fits all, and we will tailor that based on the mission area and sometimes also with the vendor itself.' He further noted that CASR participants won't be required to jump from doing nothing to suddenly providing services at a maximum capacity. 'This isn't a zero to 60 model. You will have a level set amount of capability on [tap during peacetime] in order for me to get this out to the warfighter to make sure that they know what they're doing with this capability, that it's stitched together into this overall space enterprise — and not this &#8216;military versus commercial' [situation where] commercial is automatically on the shelf because I don't know what to do with it,' Kniseley said. 'We'll be funding in peace time. The contracts will also have pre-price negotiations or a surge capability,' he added. One thing the initial contracts will not address, however, is the question of how, when and why the Space Force might demand that CASR participants turn over all their capabilities to the US government and deny service to other customers, potentially including foreign governments as commercial/civilian users. That issue long has been controversial; for example, a sticking point for the National Reconnaissance Office in the 2020-2021 timeframe when it negotiated contracts with commercial remote sensing providers. '[D]enial of service was a common concern across industry for CASR, and I think there's different ways to go about it without overtly calling it out in the contract. One idea that we received from industry is, if a country or an actor is on the sanctions list, automatically we would have to not provide service to them. So, that's not something that we've, you know, put our flag in, but these are additional ideas that we're looking at,' Kniseley told reporters. 'So, those initial contracts will be a step in the right direction, but they won't be the full pass or concept, if you will. We're kind of taking a slower-walk approach to it,' he added. Kinseley told the conference that the next step for CASR is another round of industry discussions planned for 'early December,' when COMSO will elaborate on what options the Space Force intends to adopt as part of the contractual agreements. 'The threats are not slowing down, so we need to move at action and speed. We do need to fight tonight,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/join-the-commercial-space-reserve-get-longer-contracts-in-depth-threat-briefs-play-wargames/	2024-10-25T11:11:35-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/230606-F-XH843_COSMIC-105-e1686161814275.jpg
Ottawa should get serious about the Canadian-Korean defense partnership	Bill Blair, Minister of Defense of Canada, speaks to the press after his arrival at NATO headquarters on the first day of the NATO Defense Ministers' Meeting on June 13, 2024 in Brussels, Belgium. (Photo by Omar Havana/Getty Images) When Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair visited South Korea in September, the delegation did the usual diplomatic niceties like visiting the Korean Demilitarized Zone, meeting Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) personnel serving in the United Nations Command, boasting about bilateral defense collaboration on weapon and asset procurement and reaffirming Ottawa’s commitment to maintaining peace on the peninsula. Canada’s desire to deepen its defensive partnerships also extends to the broader region. Following the trip to Seoul, the minister visited Japan to affirm the same diplomatic nuances as communicated in South Korea. Coupled with Ottawa’s pursuit for a membership in AUKUS’s second pillar, Canada appears to be doubling down on its Indo-Pacific Strategy that showcases Ottawa’s commitment to be a reliable and trustworthy partner on defensive matters in the Indo-Pacific. It's classic visiting-a-partner stuff, but the problem is, like so much of the discussion around Canadian defense spending these days, the visit came with little real military commitment. And if Canada wants to get serious about the Indo-Pacific, that needs to change. During the meeting in Seoul, both ministers emphasized the need to strengthen their defensive bond, citing the Action Plan that will implement the newly elevated relationship with Seoul into a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The meeting also inaugurated more avenues for staff-level military discourses and launched the creation of a High-Level Foreign and Defense Policy Dialogue — a 2+2 diplomatic mission that enables reviews of progress on cross-cutting aspects of defense and diplomatic cooperation. These initiatives constitute a reasonable effort by Ottawa in demonstrating a genuine interest to deepen its defensive partnership on the Korean peninsula. However, Canada’s regional deployments are summed up by a single CP-140 Aurora, a long-range patrol aircraft, deployed to the Korean peninsula, as well as three withering Halifax-class frigates balancing maritime commitments in the South China Sea, across the Taiwan Strait and in waters bordering South Korea. Far from a display of military might, the only thing on display is Ottawa’s perishing combat-capacity to fulfill its commitments to regional defense. This is where Canada missed an opportunity to genuinely deepen its defensive engagement with an Indo-Pacific partner. To amplify its engagement on the Korean peninsula, Canada must build upon current and future capabilities of CAF. This is an area where Ottawa is out of step with Seoul and other like-minded allies, all of whom are increasing their joint combat effectiveness and deterrence capabilities through bilateral and multilateral endeavors. Acknowledging CAF’s limited force generation abilities, Ottawa should have pursued a Status of Force Agreement with Seoul to permanently station Canadian land, air, and sea personnel, equipment, and assets in South Korea. If agreed upon, Ottawa and Seoul would be better positioned to hold frank discussions on items like how CAF can deploy military platforms and future assets, like the River-class destroyer and the F-35 fighter jet, to the peninsula for future drills and active deployments — all of which can align Canada’s military capabilities and force posture with regional allies. Following this, Ottawa should have also pursued a Memorandum of Understanding for co-manning lacking military domain areas belonging to South Korea. With shortages caused by downsizing in the Republic of Korea Armed Forces, an agreement of this type would complement both militaries by deepening tactical synergy, enhancing force interoperability, and guaranteeing the operationality of collective sea, air, and land domains. If Canada were to undertake these efforts to the Korean peninsula, Ottawa would be better suited to demonstrate its resolve to further deepen its military presence in the Indo-Pacific while also offering CAF a detailed assessment of military domains needed to be a more reliable and trustworthy defense partner. RELATED: Don’t miss the boat — Canada and AUKUS should be partners Given their vibrant democratic societies, a shared defense interests for a rules-based order and a historical military relationship that dates back to the Korean War, Canada and South Korea are logical partners. More importantly, they both are impacted by the immediate threat that arises from North Korea. Despite a carefully crafted ceasefire in place since 1953, the armistice on the Korean peninsula is not guaranteed to last. Should the ceasefire unravel, Canada will be obliged to supply stationed military personnel with needed equipment, armaments, and additional military forces to help defend South Korea and allied forces. Since coming to power, Kim Jong Un has exacerbated Pyongyang’s longstanding ideology of confronting its enemies — South Korea, the US, and Japan. Given Ottawa’s strong bilateral relations with all three nations, North Korea has described Canada as a 'bat-blind US follower.' With Pyongyang’s growing capabilities in nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles and first-strike policy, this characterization should not be dismissed and should serve as a reminder for Canadians of the military threats abroad. Canada wants to show it has a major role in the Indo-Pacific, and South Korea would clearly welcome such an increased presence. Ottawa should take advantage and move to increase its defense capabilities deployed in the region while that is a choice and not a necessity driven by conflict.

‘Not Enough’: US Coast Guard’s new ops posture statement raises alarm on need for more money	The Coast Guard icebreaker Polar Sea works the ice channel near McMurdo, Antarctica. (USCG photo by Rob Rothway) WASHINGTON — Faced with an increasing number of missions, personnel and materiel readiness shortfalls, and 'finite resources,' the US Coast Guard today published its first 'Operational Posture' document [PDF], which a senior officer said is intended to convey to lawmakers and the public how stretched his service has become. 'What we're finding is, as we are operating our current fleet to accomplish missions [and] &#8230; recapitalizing to make sure that we have readiness in the future to do our missions, we quite simply do not have enough funding to do all of that at the same time,' Vice Adm. Peter Gautier, the service's deputy commandant for operations, told an audience today during an event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The new 11-page document largely serves as a list of the various missions the service is tasked with — ranging from marine safety to cybersecurity — and the regions around the world the service operates in. Although Gautier explicitly said the statement is not 'a pitch for money,' he also made it clear the USCG cannot continue on its current trajectory indefinitely without a budgetary boost — ideally to the tune of $6 billion annually. 'We only have funding to do maintenance on roughly half of what we need to do on the maintenance inventory to keep our cutters functional,' he said. 'We have small boats that are aging out and &#8230; our aircraft fleet is getting old. Spare parts are no longer manufactured for some of these types [of aircraft].' 'We really, really do struggle, and our path is going to be really challenged unless we get the kind of budget support that we need to keep ourselves on a sustainable track,' he continued. Earlier this year, the Coast Guard's ship maintenance woes caught up with the service at an inconvenient and coincidental time. As Breaking Defense reported, while the leaders of the United States, Canada and Finland were preparing to meet in Washington, DC, to sign the new ICE Pact agreement, the USCG's icebreakers were both sidelined from heading north to patrol Arctic waters — one of the service's key missions. RELATED: ICE Pact: Why the US had to recruit help in race with Russia, China for Arctic icebreakers When asked about the message the Coast Guard wants lawmakers to take away from the new operational statement, Gautier emphasized that the maritime environment is 'changing rapidly.' 'That’s just increasing the demand for Coast Guard services exponentially. We have the right people and the right workforce and the right missions and authorities to do wonderful things, but we need the support of our stakeholders in Congress in order to overcome the challenges that we have in sustaining readiness of our current capabilities, while we build the readiness of the future,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/not-enough-us-coast-guards-new-ops-posture-statement-raises-alarm-on-need-for-more-money/	2024-10-25T09:00:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/1071546-e1729870102948.jpg
Embraer facing production ‘gap’ at Florida-based A-29 facility	An A-29 Super Tucano from Moody Air Force Base, Ga., stops for crew rest and refueling July 17, 2015, at Little Rock Air Force Base, Ark. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Stephanie Serrano) WASHINGTON — Brazil’s Embraer is hunting for new A-29 Super Tucano orders to keep its American final assembly line humming, with 2025 seen as a critical year to parry back a production gap, its defense CEO told Breaking Defense. Embraer stood up an A-29 final assembly line in Jacksonville, Fla., in 2013 to produce the turboprop plane for the US military and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers, most prominently for Afghan air force pilots trained by US troops. But with US involvement in Afghanistan at an end, production at the facility has slowed to its 'minimal pace,' said Bosco da Costa Jr. in a recent interview. 'We are running the facility without big orders coming from FMS,' da Costa told Breaking Defense. 'We are facing a gap of production there. We are still fighting for some orders coming from FMS case[s] and even — why not — from the US government.' The Jacksonville factory is tooled to produce about 24 Super Tucanos per year, da Costa said, but the company currently only has four A-29s in various stages of production. (A Embraer spokesperson said those planes are 'allocated to current and near-term customers,' but declined to name what countries had ordered them.) Jacksonville could face an uphill battle for orders due to its unique setup. Most orders for the Embraer plane, also known as the EMB 314 Super Tucano, run through the company’s Brazil-based production plant. But the A-29 variant produced in the United States is assembled by Embraer in Florida, before US prime contractor Sierra Nevada Corp. outfits the baseline aircraft with US-specific mission systems and communications gear in Colorado. That production line caters only to US customers or Foreign Military Sales brokered by the Pentagon, a much slimmer portion of the Super Tucano customer base. That means that while Embraer has garnered new Super Tucano orders this year from countries such as Paraguay and Uruguay, those contracts cannot be used to pad out a lapse of orders for Jacksonville. 'I think we have 2025 as a year to fix it, trying to find another possibility regarding orders,' da Costa said. Otherwise, the company will be forced to reevaluate 'everything around Jacksonville.' 'The option is to find orders,' he added. 'That's the only option.' A spokesperson for Sierra Nevada Corp. deferred questions on the Jacksonville plant to Embraer. 'SNC is a proud partner with Embraer providing A-29s and subsequent logistical support worldwide,' the spokesperson said. 'SNC is pursuing multiple campaigns with Embraer, and our companies are well-positioned for a number of opportunities with international customers to provide mission-focused and agile A-29 solutions.' Currently, Embraer sees the US military as a potential customer, with da Costa pointing specifically to the Air Force. In the late 2010s, the Air Force explored buying light attack aircraft that it could operate in the Middle East as a low-cost alternative to more expensive fighter jets. Although the service bought a handful of A-29s and AT-6 turboprop planes for test purposes, it ultimately scrapped plans to move forward with a full program of record in 2019. Earlier this month, three of the A-29s purchased as part of that evaluation effort were transferred to Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., where they will be used as a test platform for sensors and weapons, the Air Force said in a news release. 'We still believe that this platform could serve … [the] US Air Force, and we are fighting to keep this facility. But again, we are facing problems without orders and without demand,' da Costa said. Embraer did not deliver any Super Tucanos in 2023, but built about a dozen planes that year — including four in Jacksonville — to be delivered to customers once contracts were signed, Aviation Week reported in February. (Embraer clarified that the four Jacksonville planes mentioned in that report are the ones currently on the production line.) The company expects to book another two orders for A-29s this year, but da Costa said that both orders are expected to be produced in Brazil.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/embraer-facing-production-gap-at-florida-based-a-29-facility/	2024-10-25T07:58:57-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/2073037-scaled-e1729792787763.jpg
Aussie, US test wide range of naval drone tech, C2 during AUKUS-centric exercise	The Australian-built Ocius BlueBottle Unscrewed Surface Vehicle (UCL) (D. Burkey of ProUAV for the ADF) SYDNEY — Australia and the United States today wrapped up the 'signature' stage of a three-week naval drone exercise at Australia's Jarvis Bay, part of an effort to show how the AUKUS partners can jointly operate unmanned vessels in the Pacific. The overarching exercise, dubbed Maritime Big Play (MBP), fall under the agreement's Pillar II, which covers the rapid development, testing and deployment of new technologies in the realms of autonomy, hypersonics, cyber, electronic warfare and underwater systems. MBP 'allows AUKUS partners to practice fielding and maintaining thousands of uncrewed systems, gaining valuable experience operating in coalitions to solve realistic operational problems such as improving undersea situational awareness,' Madeline Mortelmans, acting assistant Defense Secretary for strategy, plans and capabilities, said today in a statement released by the US embassy here, after observing the exercises. 'This year,' Mortelmans said, 'we're advancing our undersea warfare capabilities by expanding our ability to launch and recover uncrewed underwater systems from torpedo tubes on current classes of British and US submarines, that will increase the range and capability of our undersea forces.' Exercise Autonomous Warrior, which finished today, was described by Mortelmans as 'the signature MBP event in 2024.' RELATED: Australian defense minister Richard Marles on AUKUS, China and industry concerns The technologies contributed by the US included software-defined acoustic modems, autonomous underwater and surface vessels, and low-cost unmanned surface vehicles. The tests, according to a statement from the US Embassy, also featured a low-cost balloon with a gondola that 'supports operations in the upper stratosphere with minimum manpower or logistics requirements,' and high-altitude T-200 balloons for communications when other sources are jammed. At the higher level of command and control, the allies tested several systems to eventually build what the statement called 'an AUKUS-wide Common Control System, fusing best elements of the three countries’ existing systems.' They included a software-defined network architecture with another excellent acronym, the Multi-Domain Uncrewed Secure Integrated Communications (MUSIC). It is designed 'to enable seamless communication and coordination across diverse unmanned systems and operational environments,' according to the statement. The second system, the Common Control System (CCS), meant to help pave the way to an AUKUS-wide system, using a now almost mandatory open architecture, to provide drones with hardware and software that works across different systems. Working together like this, with many different systems from multiple countries has its benefits. 'This collaborative approach enables us to reduce acquisition, maintenance, and training cost by creating economies of scale,' Heidi Shyu, undersecretary of Defense for research and engineering, said in the statement. Of course, the home country brought its own set of technologies to the test. Among the promising Australian systems used: a long-range loitering strike glider by Innovaero called OWL-B; an uncrewed surface vessel by Ocius Technology known as the Bluebottle; Anduril's extra-large autonomous underwater vehicle the Ghost Shark; and a large underwater drone by C2 Robotics known as Speartooth. 'This is another example of the ingenuity of Australia’s companies and innovators to partner with Defence to and reflects the Albanese Government’s commitment to investing in a defense future made in Australia,' Pat Conroy, minister for defense industry, said in a statement released today. 'The Maritime Big Play stands to advance the development of cutting-edge maritime capabilities that provide strategic advantage and strengthen collaboration between AUKUS partners.' While the United Kingdom, the third partner in AUKUS, has taken part in a previous portion of MBP, it's unclear what technology they brought for Autonomous Warrior. Notably, during that part of MBP, Japanese observers were there to look into 'improving interoperability with Japan’s maritime autonomous systems as an initial area of cooperation under AUKUS Pillar Two,' a British Navy statement from Oct. 4 reads.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/aussie-us-test-wide-range-of-naval-drone-tech-c2-during-aukus-centric-exercise/	2024-10-25T07:07:38-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/DSC09996.JPG-e1729858077916.jpg
Pentagon info officer’s top priority: Upgrading cryptography ahead of quantum-enabled hackers	Department of Defense CIO for Cybersecurity David McKeown records a message for the RSA conference, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., April 28, 2021. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) 'We've got to think ahead as to what the adversary might be working on and develop algorithms that are there in time to meet the adversary's ability to crack those [older] algorithms,' David McKeown, who is dual hatted as the Pentagon’s Deputy CIO and the DoD’s senior information security officer, said during a keynote speech at the AFCEA Tech Summit Thursday. He said a vital part of protecting Pentagon data is building cryptographic systems that are resistant to quantum computing in what's called Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Quantum computing techniques are so advanced that they could, in theory, crack just about any existing encryption. Most encryption for digital communication uses algorithms based on a security framework known as RSA, invented in 1977, that allows two parties to communicate securely without having to exchange secret keys beforehand. Scientists have theorized that quantum computing, when fully developed, could use an exponential jump in calculation speed and complexity to crack the code. Creating specific quantum-hardened algorithms falls under the National Security Agency’s list of responsibilities since they handle cryptographic modernization as a whole, based on standards under development by the National Institute of Standards and Technology. McKeown acknowledged that quantum computers are still probably '10 years away,' but, he said, the time is now for the Pentagon to do a sprawling review to determine where it might be vulnerable. 'There's going to be a year where [quantum computing] is not going to be 10 years away, and it's going to be nine years, and eight years and seven so we gotta work on this together,' McKeown said. 'We need to look through our whole inventory and look at all the encryption that we're using on everything, and then figure out what needs to be replaced there, and then get to work with the vendors and our community to get the upgrades and field the upgrades so that that new quantum-resistant cryptography is employed throughout the department,' he later added. Even after PQC algorithms come online, the Pentagon won't be able to rest, McKeown said, as they'll need to be updated constantly to fend off novel attacks. 'In some cases, we may have to use the old algorithms unencrypted or re-encrypted with the new stuff that we just came out with. So you see it's an extremely long timeline. You can't put your head in the sand thinking that our algorithms are going to be good forever, and so we constantly have to be working at this,' he said. 'This is a gigantic life cycle of encryption algorithms and encryption of hardware that has to be maintained.' After modernizing cryptographic algorithms, McKeown said the next biggest priority for the department is to implement zero trust, a security system in which a user's activity on a network is regularly checked, rather than letting anyone who gets through a login/password screen run free. McKeown said that the Pentagon is still on track to move to a zero trust-based cybersecurity model by 2027. 't doesn't stop all attacks, and hopefully nobody thinks that that is the case, but what it does do is it's limits the success of the attacker, and allows us to detect the attacks quicker and respond quicker and eradicate the bad guys from our network,' he said. 'Lots of times before we had zero trust, the adversary could live on our network for long periods of time. I had one instance of 18 months before we discovered that [the adversaries] were on our network.' The third priority for the CIO is to enhance the cybersecurity of the defense industrial base, McKeown said. This mainly includes enforcing the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, which sets new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information. (The final rule for CMMC 2.0 came out earlier this month.) The number three priority also includes making production pipelines more 'cyber resilient and survivable,' McKeown added, citing the Colonial Pipeline attack that occurred over three years ago. 'You remember the Colonial Pipeline, when it got shut down, no gas on the East Coast for like a week. You know, we didn't want that to happen with some of these key weapon system manufacturing,' McKeown said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/pentagon-info-officers-top-priority-upgrading-cryptography-ahead-of-quantum-enabled-hackers/	2024-10-25T05:12:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/McKeown_CIO-scaled.jpg
Industry partners announce PEGASUS first flight, tout additional buy	A modified Bombardier 6000 affiliated with the Persistent German Airborne Surveillance System (PEGASUS) program, makes its maiden flight (Bombardier) BELFAST — A trio of industry partners involved in the $1 billion Persistent German Airborne Surveillance System (PEGASUS) program have revealed the first of three modified Bombardier Global 6000 business jets made its maiden flight at the manufacturer’s Flight Test Centre (BFTC) in Wichita, Kan., in the second half of September. Bombardier, along with German collaborators Lufthansa Technik Defense and Hensoldt announced the first flight milestone on Wednesday, noting that the aircraft was not outfitted with the signals intelligence (SIGINT) mission system central to the platform’s airborne surveillance role. Hensoldt’s Kalaetron Integral package has been selected for integration, but in line with plans to first concentrate on an aircraft modification phase and first flight, the SIGINT system will only be fitted by Lufthansa at the company’s special-mission center in Hamburg, Germany, next year. 'Since then [the first flight in September] we've been flying the aircraft on a regular basis,' Steve Patrick, vice president of Bombardier Defense told reporters on Wednesday. 'The aircraft is performing very well. &#8230; the test pilots confirmed that the aircraft handles as expected.' He noted that all three of the PEGASUS affiliated aircraft will be transferred to Hamburg 'over the coming months,' ahead of mission systems integration and a military certification process. It will likely take 'one to two years' for the airframes to be outfitted with the Kalaetron system, according to Jürgen Halder, vice president of airborne SIGINT at Hensoldt. He added that additional flight tests with 'entire systems' will follow, before deliveries to the German Air Force take place. 'Lufthansa Technik has completed its design activities for the integration of the mission system, the additional civil and military avionics systems as well as the aircraft cabin,' said Bombardier in a Wednesday statement. 'The production process of interior parts has also already started in order to ensure the components’ readiness for immediate installation when the aircraft arrives in Hamburg.' Berlin awarded Hensoldt a contract for PEGASUS development, production and SIGINT integration, including the three Global 6000 airframes in 2021, but the electronics supplier is confident that the German Air Force will agree to a follow-on buy, based on growing geopolitical instability. 'If you look at the current geopolitical situation … even though any aircraft can persistently monitor a vast area there are unfortunately too many hotspots globally,' to cover, said Halder. 'We expect additional rise [an additional order] will be coming up eventually. Discussions are starting in a very early phase, but it's apparent that three aircraft is not sufficient.' Germany opted for PEGASUS to end an airborne SIGINT capability gap that emerged when a fleet of five Breguet BR1150 Atlantic aircraft were retired in 2010. After initially settling on a plan to acquire Northrop Grumman MQ-4C Triton SIGINT-configured, high altitude long-endurance (HALE) unmanned aerial systems valued at $2.5 billion, Berlin scrapped it, amid concern over spiraling costs and safety standards for flight in European airspace. Instead, the Global 6000 crewed aircraft was decided on.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/industry-partners-announce-pegasus-first-flight-tout-additional-buy/	2024-10-24T13:12:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Bombardier.jpg
Fighting underground: The US military must learn from Israel’s experience	A photograph, taken during an embed with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) and reviewed by the IDF censorship office prior to publication, shows Israeli soldiers guarding the entrance of a tunnel. (Photo by Ilia Yefimovich/picture alliance via Getty Images) As Israel conducts limited ground operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon, it already has encountered tunnels similar to the dangerous unseen combat it has fought for a year beneath Gaza. Not for the first time, Israel is engaged in a new kind of fight that the United States will face in its future conflicts. Just as the United States has learned from Israel’s wars in the past, the risks of tunnel warfare and how Israel is overcoming those challenges through coordinated troop maneuvers and technological adaptations should drive a shift in the US approach to subterranean combat. The United States has a long history of learning from Israel’s wars. The 1973 Yom Kippur War had such a transformational effect that the US Army made the largest change to its doctrine since World War II. The Egyptian and Syrian armies’ use of new Soviet weapons and tactics that were more lethal and rapid, the ability of anti-tank weapons to neutralize more tanks in the first six days of the war than the United States had deployed throughout all of Europe, and tank battles occurring at much greater ranges than ever before shocked American defense planners preparing for a Soviet invasion of Western Europe. After the war, the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) sent a team to Israel, whose findings led to the adoption of the AirLand Battle doctrine that would guide decades of thinking about winning a conventional war in Europe through close coordination between ground forces and aircraft. Similarly, the wars under Gaza and southern Lebanon have shown how the subterranean environment poses challenges that US troops must be better prepared to fight. Tunnels will be a growing problem for Western-style militaries because they provide physical protection and create challenges for differentiating and isolating fighters from civilians. Recognizing those advantages, Hamas spent nearly two decades fortifying Gaza with more than 350 miles of interconnected underground tunnels. They intentionally designed the urban landscape to enable attacks, protect Hamas fighters, and thwart IDF advances. Hezbollah built similar underground fortifications in southern Lebanon but over a much larger expanse of land. Indeed, searching Hamas’s vast, subterranean labyrinth for terrorist fighters and hostages has been among the most difficult aspects of the war and has already proved a time-consuming process in southern Lebanon. Fighters have appeared suddenly from tunnels to quickly target Israeli soldiers before escaping through hidden passageways. Deep and fortified tunnels also held command-and-control centers, weapons production facilities, storage depots, and hostages. Hamas and Hezbollah also constructed tunnels for strategic purposes as well. Building tunnels inside and below residential buildings, hospitals, schools, mosques, and United Nations facilities leveraged civilians as human shields to discourage Israeli operations. Despite Israel’s pledge to use precise military efforts to minimize collateral damage by distinguishing between terrorists and civilians, hiding fighters beneath civilian sites enabled the willful blindness about who Israeli strikes had targeted that fueled Hamas’s disinformation campaign, contributing to international pressure for Israel to stop the war prematurely. Early in the war, Israel adapted after it became evident that its initial plan to collapse the tunnels with airstrikes or destroy the entry points would not be widely effective because of how expansive and deep the tunnels were and because such operations could be dangerous to the hostages. Instead, Israel utilized cameras mounted on drones or dogs and AI technology to detect threats so that Israeli forces could analyze the best means of responding. In Gaza, the IDF quickly transformed its approach to subterranean operations while in contact with enemy fighters. A key adaptation was its implementation of new tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) for its troops to maneuver underground simultaneously with those moving above ground to use explosives that either completely destroy or render tunnels impassable. After isolating the area around a tunnel entrance and establishing a secure perimeter to ensure there were no hidden entrances that terrorists could use to mount a surprise attack or escape, the IDF then sent in ground troops to defeat any threats, including with a liquid emulsion explosive that avoided the risk of inadvertent detonation on the surface. Building on the decades of US experience in subterranean warfare in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and Vietnam, examining Israel’s underground warfare could help the US and partner militaries prepare for operations against adversaries like Iran, Russia, China, and North Korea, who are growing increasingly close and learning from one another. As a senior Pentagon special operations official put it, it would be 'foolish' to assume future fights won’t consist of a similar operational environment. Borrowing from the IDF’s efforts to coordinate ground troops above and below ground as well as air assets, US doctrine and TTPs for subterranean warfare should emphasize the necessity to detect, analyze, differentiate, isolate, and defeat threats. With the US military also seeking to transform while in contact with an enemy, just as the IDF continues to do, the US Defense Department should emphasize subterranean combat during collaborations with Israel about the future of warfare, expand the US-Israel anti-tunnel cooperation program to fund technologies that explore or collapse tunnels, and conduct regular subterranean warfare exercises with Israeli forces. Joint drills that focus on maneuvering troops simultaneously above and below ground and utilizing emergent technologies would have immense value to US missions from counterterrorism to hostage rescue.

Clear guardrails mean faster progress on AI: Biden signs sweeping guidance for DoD & IC	White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan speaks during the annual meeting of the Arms Control Association at the National Press Club on June 2, 2023 in Washington, DC.(Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden has just signed a sweeping National Security Memorandum (NSM) to guide military and intelligence use of artificial intelligence, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said this morning. The new plan’s guiding principle is a big bet that adhering to American values — like accountability, legality and individual rights — won't slow the US down in the AI arms race with China, but help move it faster. The memorandum will also boost cybersecurity defenses against Chinese theft of American AI secrets and strengthen government collaboration with the private sector and foreign allies, Sullivan and other officials said. And it will be accompanied by an extensive 'Risk Management Framework' to help officials distinguish proper from improper use of AI. The essence of the administration's argument is that government bureaucrats will move slowly and cautiously to adopt AI as long as they’re uncertain about what’s permissible and what’s prohibited, what’s safe to try and what’s too dangerous. Only by establishing comprehensive guidelines, rigorous testing and strict prohibitions on unacceptable uses of AI — notably, that humans, not algorithms, must make the decision whether or not to launch nuclear weapons — can the US government empower its agencies to experiment boldly and advance rapidly within those clearly defined guardrails. RELATED: ‘AI gold mine’: NGA aims to exploit archive of satellite images, expert analysis 'It's a little bit counterintuitive, [but] ensuring security and trustworthiness will actually enable us to move faster, not slow us down,' Sullivan told an audience of military officers and civil servants at National Defense University. 'Uncertainty breeds caution. When we lack confidence about safety and reliability, we're slower to experiment, to adopt, to use new capabilities — and we just can't afford to do that in today's strategic landscape.' 'Preventing misuse and ensuring high standards of accountability will not slow us down,' Sullivan emphasized, comparing it to how trains were able to travel faster once government regulation ensured the rails would be safe. 'It will actually do the opposite.' Senior administration officials stressed this apparent paradox in a briefing for reporters Wednesday evening. 'We are directing that the agencies gain access to the most powerful AI systems and put them to use, which often involves substantial efforts on procurement,' one of the briefers said. But in that context, they continued, 'one of the paradoxical outcomes we’ve seen is, with a lack of policy clarity and a lack of legal clarity about what can and cannot be done, we are likely to see less experimentation and less adoption than with a clear path for use — which is what the NSM and the framework tries to provide.' The NSM includes 'very specific requirements' for agencies to conduct 'classified testing' of AI systems, while the accompanying Risk Management Framework lists specific applications of AI that either warrant special caution ('high impact' cases) or are outright prohibited. RELATED: Empowered edge versus the centralization trap: Who will wield AI better, the US or China? The prohibitions are meant to protect against a wide array of abuses, from a War Games or Skynet-style nightmare scenario where a computer orders the launch of nuclear weapons, to Chinese-style employment of AI to repress dissidents and minorities. 'There are clear prohibitions on use of AI with intent or purpose, for instance, to unlawfully suppress or burden the right to free speech or the right to legal counsel,' one official said. 'There’s also prohibited use cases around, for instance, removing a human in the loop for actions critical to informing and executing decisions by the President to initiate or terminate nuclear weapons employment.' 'We actually view these restrictions … as being important in clarifying what the agencies can and cannot do,' one briefer explained. 'That will actually accelerate experimentation and adoption.' All this guidance builds on prior policy, officials emphasized, citing the Pentagon's extensive revisions of DoD Directive 3000.09 on autonomous weapons and the State Department-led Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, now signed by over 50 nations. 'We have built, over the course of the last couple of years, I think, a pretty good set of markers, right and left, rules of the road, that try to get at these questions of fundamental values,' Sullivan said at NDU. 'Then what the National Security Memorandum tries to do is say, ‘here's our guidelines now, here's how they have to be implemented with special care in the national security space.’' Biden took a personal interest in ensuring the memorandum would have real impact, not just lofty aspirations, Sullivan emphasized. 'We had multiple meetings with him about this, because he didn't just take it and say, ‘Okay, fine,'' Sullivan said. 'We went back and forth on this over the course of two or three months, [and] this was one of his questions: &#8216;How do we really make sure on a rigorous basis, not just that we've set forth standards that make sense to us, but how can we have confidence through thick and through thin, through crisis and contingency, they're actually going to be enforced?' 'That is a big part of what this NSM is trying to achieve,' Sullivan said. One key point the officials made was that the guidelines need to be not only clear, but flexible, able to adapt rapidly to new problems discovered in testing, new technologies from the private sector, or new challenges from China. RELATED: New Pentagon AI &amp; data chief plans big initiatives for fall, from back office to battlefield (EXCLUSIVE) The detailed Risk Management Framework in particular will 'have to be continuously updated,' one official emphasized, so it's been explicitly designed to allow rapid changes as experiments and pilot projects discover new technical complications or ethical dilemmas. Adaptability is even more important with artificial intelligence than it was in past technological revolutions like the nuclear weapons or the Internet, Sullivan said, because AI is moving much faster and its future is more uncertain. 'A specific AI application that we're trying to solve for today &#8230; could look fundamentally different six weeks from now, let alone six months,' he argued. 'The speed of change in this area is breathtaking.' 'The good news is that &#8230; America is continuing to build a meaningful AI advantage,' Sullivan said. 'But here's the bad news: Our lead is not guaranteed, it is not preordained, and it is not enough to just guard the progress we've made, as historic as it's been. We have to be faster in deploying AI in our national security enterprise than America's rivals are in theirs.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/clear-guardrails-mean-faster-progress-on-ai-biden-signs-sweeping-guidance-for-dod-ic/	2024-10-24T11:36:01-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/230602_sullivan_arms_control_GettyImages-1258375495-scaled-e1685724331637.jpg
SDA creates new contractor pool to bid for future demos, tags 19 initial vendors	Space Development Agency chief Derek Tournear (R) addresses the audience at the Space Foundation's 2024 Space Symposium. (Space Foundation) WASHINGTON — The Space Development Agency (SDA) has selected 19 companies to join its newly created vendor pool, called Hybrid Acquisition for Proliferated Low Earth Orbit, or HALO, designed to allow rapid contracting for demonstrations and experiments to support its fledgling low Earth orbit (LEO) constellations. 'HALO is an Other Transactions (OT) agreement modeled after an indefinite-delivery-indefinite quantity (IDIQ) approach, where each member receives an initial agreement valued at $20,000 to defray administrative and travel expenses and is then eligible to compete for future HALO demonstration prototype orders,' SDA explained in an announcement on Wednesday. 'Future prototype orders under HALO will focus on rapid end-to-end mission demonstrations with launch of two identical satellites 12-18 months after award,' the agency release added. SDA Director Derek Tourner on Wednesday told the SatNews MILSAT 2024 symposium that HALO is a 'new idea' and will serve as an 'acquisition contracting vehicle we're using for our developmental and experimentation systems.' Tournear explained that each one of SDA's 'tranches' — the moniker the agency has given to each new configuration of its data transport and missile warning/tracking satellites — 'has a developmental and experimentation system that goes alongside of it. On Tranche 1, it was T1DES, Tranche 1 Developmental Experimentation [System].' The first planned prototype orders using HALO will be for the Tranche 2 Demonstration and Experimentation System (T2DES) projects, 'which will reduce risk and demonstrate feasibility of proliferation for future tactical data links and optical communication missions,' the agency's announcement elaborated. Pool members selected include: While these are the initial firms given the green light to compete under HALO, Tournear said that there will be future chances for companies that didn't make the first cut. 'Don't worry, we're going to continue to onramp people in another year and make sure we have a vendor pool that we can choose from,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/sda-creates-new-contractor-pool-to-bid-for-future-demos-tags-19-initial-vendors/	2024-10-24T11:03:16-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240411_space_symposium_tournear_space_foundation-e1712859283861.jpg
Space Force grants Northrop Grumman $1.8B to build missile warning birds for polar orbit	As part of the Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared System (Next-Gen OPIR), two polar satellites will provide coverage over the northern hemisphere. (Graphic: Northrop Grumman) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's multibillion-dollar Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next-Gen OPIR) missile warning constellation has taken another step forward with Northrop Grumman getting the green light, and almost $1.8 billion, to finalize development of its two polar orbiting satellites. Under the modification to the company's original 2020 contract, the company will 'complete the effort through satellite build, launch, and transition to operations,' the Space Systems Command (SSC) said in an announcement Wednesday. The modification brings the total cumulative face value of the contract to nearly $4.2 billion, it added. The two Northrop Grumman satellites, which will take highly elliptical orbits over the Earth's poles, are expected to be launched in 2028. They are one half of the overarching Next-Gen OPIR constellation, which also includes two satellites to be stationed in geosynchronous Earth orbit (GEO) being built by Lockheed Martin. Those satellites are scheduled to be launched in late 2025, although there is some concern that date may slip. Together, the satellites will replace the current missile warning constellation, the Space-Based Infrared System (SBIRS). All six dedicated SBIRS satellites in GEO are operational as of last March. There also are two SBIRS sensors operating as hosted payloads on classified satellites in highly elliptical orbits over the poles. The total cost for the new satellites is estimated at $14 billion, making Next-Gen OPIR the Space Force's most expensive program. The effort also includes developed of a new ground system, called Future Operationally Resilient Ground Evolution (FORGE), to provide day-to-day operations and command and control (C2) for the four Next-Gen OPIR satellites, and eventually of all the service’s missile warning constellations. FORGE, led by RTX (formerly Raytheon), long has been suffering from developmental problems, with the Government Accountability Office last June warning key pieces of the multi-faceted ground system would not be ready in time to provide C2 for the first of the Next-Gen OPIR satellites. In April, SSC announced [PDF] that a first cybersecurity software package for FORGE system was put into operations at the Overhead Persistent Infrared Battlespace Awareness Center at Buckley SFB in Colorado. 'We're going to deliver another instantiation later this this year, and anticipate operational acceptance next year of FORGE,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, SSC commander, told Breaking Defense in an exclusive interview in September.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-grants-northrop-grumman-1-8b-to-build-missile-warning-birds-for-polar-orbit/	2024-10-24T08:53:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/eprocs_NGP_SVs.0011-scaled-e1684950221702.jpg
SSC picks Millennium to replace RTX for missile warning satellites	Millennium Space Systems is now developing all 12 satellites for the initial configuration of the Space Force's missile warning/tracking constellation in medium Earth orbit. (Courtesy Image: Millennium Space Systems) WASHINGTON — Space Force Space Systems Command (SSC) today announced a $386 million award to Millennium Space Systems for six satellites to fill out the baseline configuration of its future missile warning constellation in medium Earth orbit (MEO) — in effect replacing an earlier contract with RTX that was terminated in June. The six satellites will be launched to a different orbital plane than the first six birds in SSC's planned Epoch 1, also being built by Millennium under a contract granted last November. 'This action successfully completes the Epoch 1 program’s intent to deliver two planes of satellites for a total of 12 space vehicles.' SSC said in a press release today. The delivery of the first Epoch 1 birds is planned for the end of fiscal 2026, the release added, 'and the second plane is expected in early FY28.' Each spiral of satellites under the Resilient Missile Warning/Missile Tracking — Medium Earth Orbit program are called Epochs, and will be delivered every two to three years. Epoch 1 in essence transitions the SSC’s 2021 study of MEO-based missile warning capabilities, first reported by Breaking Defense, to a program of record with Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space, now RTX, and Boeing’s Millennium Space Systems contracted in January 2023 to build MEO MW/MT Epoch 1 prototypes. But when RTX's effort fell behind schedule and over budget, SSC terminated the contract. 'When one of our two industry partners struggled with delivering on cost and schedule, we were able to quickly pivot and still maintain program progress by turning to the performing vendor,' Col. Rob Davis, program executive officer for SSC's Space Sensing Directorate, told the Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles today. Speaking to reporters following his presentation, Davis explained that while RTX had been on contract for three satellites, those were larger birds in a higher altitude and a different design than those now being developed by Millennium. The capability being provided, however, 'so everything balances out there,' he said. Epoch 2, the next configuration of MEO birds, is expected to be up and running circa 2029, and will provide 'initial warfighting capability,' the SSC press release explains. The command released a Request for Prototype Proposal for Epoch 2 in August.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/ssc-picks-millennium-to-replace-rtx-for-missile-warning-satellites/	2024-10-24T07:15:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/image002.jpg
US Army takes on most effective counter-drone system yet: Red tape	US Army National Guard soldiers with 1st and 4th Battalion, 118th Infantry Battalion, 218th Maneuver Enhancement Brigade, South Carolina Army National Guard, conduct training on the Black Hornet Nano UAS on Aug. 10, 2024. (US Army/Staff Sgt. Brian Calhoun) WASHINGTON — The US Army is looking to reclassify some of its small drones because of a concerning flaw that hinders their effectiveness in the field: soldiers who don't want to fly them for fear of the red tape that comes with losing one. Currently, every time a US Army soldier loses or breaks a drone — regardless of its size or price tag — they are saddled with reporting paperwork, a mandatory investigation and possibly a loss of pay. 'If you lose [a drone] or crash it or break it, you have to do this full-on investigation, an investigating officer has to be appointed,' Col. Nick Ryan, director of the Army Capability Manager for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. 'They do a full investigation [and] a report, to determine if the soldier is liable, and if the soldier … has to get docked pay.' That's because the service deems every unmanned aerial system (UAS) 'nonexpendable property,' meaning each and every one must be strictly accounted for and tracked. If a soldier does lose a drone, even in combat, it triggers a Financial Liability Investigation of Property Loss, or FLIPL. It's such a hassle that some soldiers are hesitant to fly smaller drones that are meant to give units an edge in contested environments, fearing the paperwork that an errant tree branch or comms breakdown would spawn. 'It's an Army supply policy problem,' he told Breaking Defense during a recent interview. Ryan said one drone was known as 'the flying FLIPL and they never wanted to fly it.' That soldier hesitancy is a challenge, especially at a time when the service replaces the RQ-11 Raven and RQ-7B Shadow with more drones at every echelon to include: To make sure soldiers actually want to use some of those smaller drones or aren’t afraid to fly and train with them, Army Chief of Staff Gen Randy Geroge is asking for a policy change, Ryan explained. Although still in the works and likely two to three years away, the idea is to deem all drones weighing in at less than 55 pounds as expendable. If approved, when soldiers lose or break those Group 1 and 2 UAS, they could simply sign a 'memo' and get another one off the shelf. No investigation, no docked pay. 'Group 3 [drones], like the FTUAS, we're still trying to kind of figure out where that falls because it is a little bit more expensive and more exquisite,' Ryan said. 'Now something as big as a Gray Eagle, that definitely is something we want to come back or want to go find if we crash it.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/us-army-takes-on-most-effective-counter-drone-system-yet-red-tape/	2024-10-24T05:06:32-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Black-Hornet-e1729713907710.jpg
New Space Force effort focused on ‘closing C2 kill chains’	Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, commander, Space Force Space Systems Command (left). (US Space Force photo by Senior Airman Kadielle Shaw) WASHINGTON — The Space Force's primary acquisition command has established a new effort to build integrated command and control (C2) networks — that is, machine-to-machine capabilities to seamlessly feed data from multiple sensors through battle management systems that process data to 'shooters' — focused on four high priority, classified weapon systems, according to senior officials. Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, head of Space Systems Command, said today that his primary focus over the next five years 'is on the C2 and closure of the kill chains to actually use the effectors,' based on priorities set by the head of US Space Command Gen. Stephen Whiting. The new initiative, he told the Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles, is aimed to overcome current stovepipes and ensure that in a crisis or conflict, 'we can actually employ these effectors and have a kill chain that that closes and actually employ the kit that we're building.' In an exclusive interview with Breaking Defense in September, Garrant elaborated: 'We've got things in this space. We've got things on the ground. We have a spectrum of reversible and irreversible [weapon systems]. But we need to be able to command and control those.' The focus, he added, is on 'four specific weapon systems' that are classified, 'four specific capabilities that we want to ensure that our operators can use.' The 'Joint Enterprise Integrated Federated C2 For Space' effort is being managed by SSC's recently revamped and elevated Space System Integration Office, headed by Claire Leon. Garrant noted that Leon's office is working closely with Brig. Gen. Luke Cropsey, the integrating program executive officer for Air Force Command, Control, Communications and Battle Management, to ensure that the space C2 networks can connect with the larger Department of the Air Force Battle Network. The DAF Battle Network, created last year, is the latest overhaul of the Air Force's Advanced Battle Management System (ABMS). It is a framework for connecting sensors and shooters from the air all the way up to space — and represents the department's contribution to the Pentagon’s Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) initiative. Leon told the Space Industry Days conference today that the 'C2 integration activity' is 'a huge pivot' for SSC being led by her deputy Kris Acosta — and involves not just her shop, but also other Space Force and SPACECOM units, plus outside organizations including the Missile Defense Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office. She explained that the effort to 'put a laser focus on four different effects' was kickstarted by Whiting, who 'went to' Space Force Chief Gen. Chance Saltzman, Air Force Space Acquisition Czar Frank Calvelli, and Cropsey 'and said: &#8216;I need you to shift your focus and really look at four specific weapon systems and having them end-to-end, built, tested, ready to operate by 2026.' 'And so it's really all about being ready for contested space by 2026 and having the people, the processes, the tools, the doctrine, everything in place so that we can operate effectively,' she said. A chart presented Oct. 23 at the Space Industry Days conference in Los Angeles by Claire Leon to illustrate the byzantine space C2 universe of sensors, data lakes, battle management systems and organizational players that make creating fully integrated networks linking sensors to shooters difficult. For decades, the Air Force, and now the Space Force, has struggled to modernize and mesh together the myriad space C2 systems that range from individual satellite constellation ground systems to the computers and software that gather data from radars and telescopes keeping tabs on the heavens. According to a June 2023 report by the Government Accountability Office, the Defense Department between 2000 and 2022 spent $1.7 billion on various space C2 efforts — and that sum doesn't count up what was spent on on previous programs that date back to the 1990s. For example, SSC's previous incarnation in 2018 created Space Command and Control (Space C2) program to modernize, via incremental upgrades, outdated hardware and software used to track and control satellites. It was supposed to replace the ill-fated Joint Space Operations Center Mission System (JMS) that ran from 2009 to 2018, which in turn was aimed at replacing the 1980’s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system. Space C2 also was to add in threat assessment capabilities that can tell a commander the function of an adversary spacecraft and whether it is targeting a US satellite. Following a damning report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2019, Space C2 was restructured in fiscal 2022 — but GAO again in 2023 cited problems with the program, including unclear requirements and delays in planned upgrades. And a subsequent report by the Pentagon's Director of Operational Test &amp; Evaluation showed that Space C2's primary software updated needed to replace SPADOC had fallen at least two years behind schedule to late this year. In his interview with Breaking Defense, Garrant said that SSC is now aiming to finally switch off SPADOC late next year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-space-force-effort-focused-on-closing-c2-kill-chains/	2024-10-23T14:26:46-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/8303146-1-scaled-e1716311389831.jpg
Department of the Air Force appoints Susan Davenport as new chief data and AI officer	Low poly brain or Artificial intelligence concept. Symbol of Wisdom point. Abstract vector image of a human Brine. Low Polygonal wireframe blue illustration on dark background. Lines and dots. (Getty images) WASHINGTON — The Department of the Air Force announced Tuesday that Susan Davenport will be the new chief data and artificial intelligence officer taking over for Chandra Donelson, who has been the DAF’s acting CDAO since April. Prior to Donelson, Eileen Vidrine held the position, and before that the post belonged to Gen. John Olson, DAF's first CDAO. 'Her expertise driving innovation and managing complex programs will be instrumental in shaping the future of Data and AI for the Air Force and the Space Force,' a LinkedIn post from the Department of the Air Force Chief Information Officer, said of Davenport's appointment. In her new post, Davenport will be responsible for developing and implementing strategies for analytics, digital transformation, enterprise data management and responsible and ethical artificial intelligence. She will also lead the DAF’s effort in becoming 'AI ready' by 2025 and 'AI-competitive' by 2027, per the DAF’s CDAO webpage. Davenport has over 30 years of experience working in the intelligence realm, including her most recent post as the Senior Advisor for Defense Innovation at the Secretary of the Air Force’s office and a few other roles within the Air Force and the National Reconnaissance Office. The DAF has made strides in implementing AI and was the first service to launch a generative AI tool, called the Non-classified Internet Protocol Generative Pre-training Transformer, or NIPRGPT. The tool was launched in June, and as of last month, over 80,000 airmen and guardians have used the system. The goal of NIPRGPT is to help the DAF learn how AI can advance access to information and determine if generative AI is necessary within the DAF.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/department-of-the-air-force-appoints-susan-davenport-as-new-chief-data-and-ai-officer/	2024-10-23T11:54:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_AI_digital_brain_GettyImages-1331059443-scaled-e1698953895258.jpg
Boeing CEO says defense is ‘core’ to business, doesn’t preclude sell-off of ‘fringe’ assets	A T-7A Red Hawk trainer aircraft from the 416th Flight Test Squadron, takes off from St Louis Lambert International Airport (Boeing) WASHINGTON — Boeing’s defense business is 'core' to the company, its new CEO said today, in a sign that the embattled aerospace giant will not conduct a complete sell-off of its defense segment as executives consider an overhaul of the company. Kelly Ortberg, who took the chief executive position in August, said he is conducting an evaluation of Boeing’s portfolio with the intent of narrowing the company’s focus and improving execution. 'Clearly our core of commercial airplanes and defense systems are going to stay with the Boeing Company for the long run, but there's probably some things on the fringe there that we can be more efficient with, or that just distract us from our main goal here,' he said in an earnings call this morning. 'I think that we're better off being doing less and doing it better, than doing more and not doing it well,' he said, adding that the goal is for Boeing to understand what it sees as nonessential business by the end of the year. Analysts had speculated whether Boeing would sell off some or all of its defense unit, known as Boeing Defense Space and Security (BDS), as it looks to improve its balance sheet, contend with a quality and safety crisis in its commercial airplanes unit and stave off ongoing losses on defense programs. Last month, Boeing announced the departure of Ted Colbert, who had led the defense unit since 2022, with BDS Chief Operating Officer Steve Parker taking over in an interim role. In mid-October, the company disclosed $2 billion in losses for the defense unit during the third quarter on fixed-price programs including the KC-46 tanker and T-7 training jet. At the same time, Ortberg announced layoffs of 17,000 employees, a move meant to 'reset our workforce levels to align with our financial reality and to a more focused set of priorities,' he said in a letter to employees then. Those sweeping changes have occurred as Boeing deals with an ongoing strike of its Seattle-area machinists union, which has impacted production of its bestselling 737 MAX jetliner as well as defense assets like the KC-46 and P-8 maritime surveillance aircraft. (The union will vote on whether to end the strike and accept a new contract with Boeing later this evening.) Asked whether Boeing will replace Colbert with an executive from outside the company, Ortberg demurred. 'We'll take a look at internally, do we have the right candidate? And if so, that's the way we'll head. If we need to supplement from the outside and bring some outside skills, then it will head that direction,' he said. 'I'm certainly not averse to bringing in some additional resources to help the team, and I don't think the teams are averse to that as well.' Since the COVID-19 pandemic, Boeing’s defense unit has been plagued by cost overruns from fixed-price defense contracts, where the company is responsible for covering all costs above an agreed upon level. As the pandemic and inflationary pressures increased the cost of materials and wages, the planemaker has struggled to keep losses in check. Ortberg acknowledged there is no 'magic bullet' for Boeing’s fixed-price programs, which will take time to become profitable. 'Having said that, the discipline about what we can control on those contracts needs to get better,' he said, adding that Boeing’s defense unit hasn’t done enough work with its customers to keep program risks from developing into a potential cost overrun. 'That's what I've got the team focused on doing a lot more: A lot more deep dives, a lot deeper look at the programs, a lot more looking around the corner [and] not just dealing with what today's problem is going to be,' Ortberg said. Boeing must also ensure it enters into future contracts with a clear view of a program’s risk, and its defense unit leadership needs to work more closely with its engineering and factory workforce to better understand problems as they arise, he said. 'I want to be the leader in the aerospace and defense market,' he said. 'I want to be setting the standard for the products that we deliver. I want our customers doing our marketing for us.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/boeing-ceo-says-defense-is-core-to-business-doesnt-preclude-sell-off-of-fringe-assets/	2024-10-23T11:00:28-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/T-7A-scaled-e1699436176928.jpg
Germany, UK strike ‘first-of-its-kind’ defense deal prioritizing deep strike weapons and drones	Under the Treaty House Agreement, German P-8A Poseidon aircraft will 'periodically' operate from RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland (UK MoD) BELFAST — A new bilateral defense agreement between Germany and the UK, inked today, will see the two European nations develop new deep-strike weapons, naval uncrewed aerial systems and other drones that 'could' fly alongside fighter jets. Marked in a statement by the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD) as a 'first-of-its-kind' defense pact between London and Berlin, the Trinity House Agreement was formally signed in London by Boris Pistorius, German defence minister, and John Healey, UK defence secretary. The accord, built off a joint declaration in July to establish closer defense ties, 'marks a fundamental shift in the UK’s relations with Germany and for European security … [and] will strengthen national security and economic growth in the face of growing Russian aggression and increasing threats,' added the MoD. A number of 'ground-breaking defence projects' across all domains have been committed to, led by an effort to develop 'brand-new extended deep strike weapons that can travel further with more precision than current systems,' including MBDA’s Storm Shadow long-range air launched cruise missile. In a supporting joint communique, London suggested that 'common requirements and military doctrine' for the future long-range systems still have to be developed. No funding details were shared but as a general rule and per Trinity House Agreement stipulations, the pact binds both signatories to equally share 'all costs and benefits' across related projects 'unless otherwise provided for in related agreements or arrangements.' The joint UK-German long range weapons project arrives on the heels of the UK committing to the European Long-range Strike Approach (ELSA) programme – a multinational line of effort with Germany but also including France, Italy, and Poland. 'It is particularly important to me that we cooperate even more closely to strengthen NATO’s eastern flank and to close critical capability gaps, for instance in the field of long-range strike weapons,' Pistorius is quoted as saying in the MoD statement. Regarding drones, Berlin and London have agreed to explore and develop new maritime UAS 'capabilities' and collaborate on platforms that 'could operate alongside our fighter jets' — not unlike the US Air Force's high-profile Collaborative Combat Aircraft effort. Germany and the UK both operate Eurofighter Typhoon fourth-generation fighter jets. Additionally, London has a fleet of Lockheed Martin F-35B fifth-generation jets, while Berlin awaits a first F-35A delivery from an order for 35 aircraft, valued at $8.8 billion. Under the new bilateral pact, German P-8A Poseidon MPA's will also 'periodically operate' from RAF Lossiemouth, Scotland, to protect the North Atlantic and amid Russian threats to the region. Boeing expects to deliver a first of eight of the submarine-hunting aircraft to Germany next year, while the UK currently operates a fleet of nine units out of Lossiemouth. Additionally, the agreement provides for the UK to locally manufacture artillery gun barrels for the first time in a decade. Germany's Rheinmetall will open a new production facility for the equipment, based around British steel produced by Sheffield Forgemasters. In a bid to strengthen land industrial cooperation, the pact also underscores a 'long-term commitment to manufacturing' Boxer armoured vehicles. Britain rejoined the Boxer program in 2019, pledging £2.8 billion ($3.6 billion) to it, and has ordered 623 vehicles, which are due to be integrated into new Armoured Brigade Combat Teams, alongside Ajax armored fighting vehicles and Challenger 3 main battle tanks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/germany-uk-strike-first-of-its-kind-defense-deal-prioritizing-deep-strike-weapons-and-drones/	2024-10-23T10:33:37-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/LOS-20241023-0911-P-8A-0003.jpg.iCevoqnpMXvXS9NjYBMA.PpjVMECP-x-1-e1729695291152.jpg
Supply chain issues slowing down General Dynamics sub construction, CEO says	USS Hyman G. Rickover (SSN 795) is moored pierside during a commissioning ceremony at Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, Connecticut on October 14, 2023.(U.S. Navy photo by Chief Petty Officer Joshua Karsten) WASHINGTON — General Dynamics Electric Boat isn’t getting what it needs from its supply chain on time, a fact that could put its remit to deliver two Virginia-class attack submarines per year under 'considerable pressure,' the CEO of parent company General Dynamics said today. 'The supply chain is not getting better at a fast enough rate as we had hoped,' said Phebe Novakovic during an earnings call with investors. 'Through our internal efficiency, we have now outpaced them. This is the reality of the post-COVID environment for many of our most important suppliers.' While the health of some pockets of the submarine industrial base are improving, Electric Boat continues to be 'severely impacted' by late deliveries from suppliers of major components, which is driving up costs and lengthening production schedules, Novakovic said. She added that the Navy’s most recent delivery schedules reflect the supply chain delays. Specifically, Novakovic pointed to out-of-sequence work as one major cause of cost increases and schedule changes. Shipbuilders like Electric Boat plan out a specific order in which they assemble the countless parts and pieces that ultimately make up the hull form of a submarine. It’s not unusual for a shipbuilder to occasionally receive a late delivery and adjust their plans accordingly. But, Novakovic said today the number of out-of-sequence deliveries Electric Boat is receiving is leading to work costing as much as eight times more than it would have under normal circumstances. 'We're going to control what we control,' Novakovic said. 'We're going to adjust our pace to align with what we now see is more of a predictable supply chain schedule that is elongated. We'll take cost out of our business, and we'll continue to work productivity on the deck plates with an increasingly capable and skilled and experienced workforce.' RELATED: GD Chief Says Navy's 1 Sub Buy Won't Impact Company Short Term, But Out Years Less Certain Novakovic acknowledged that the Navy and Congress understand the industrial base challenges and have directed funding — to the tune of $11 billion planned for the immediate upcoming budget cycles — in order to help shore up manufacturing capacity, but said that further investments may be necessary. 'Costs are increasing — fact of life costs or economic realities — and funding is going to have to adjust to these fundamental changes in input, and that will need to happen over time,' she said. Asked what components are driving the supply chain issues, Novakovic declined to lay out specifics but cited two areas of concern: small parts made by small suppliers, who are often the only source, and large complex parts, which are difficult and expensive to make, and have grown more so due to rising labor and material costs. Since the inception of the AUKUS trilateral security pact, the Navy and its submarine prime contractors Electric Boat and HII have come under increasing pressure to ramp up their construction cadences to deliver two Virginia-class boats per year. Recent historical trends show the industrial base producing closer to 1.2 boats annually on average. Adding to that pressure, the service anticipates it will need to reach a 2.33 boats-per-year cadence to support both the US Navy’s needs as well as the obligations associated with AUKUS. (That schedule is in addition to at least one Columbia-class ballistic missile submarine being delivered annually, a cadence the Navy refers to as '1+2.') Asked whether the supply chain issues will harm the company’s ability to achieve that goal, Novakovic said it will remain a topic Electric Boat must work through with the Pentagon. Former Under Secretary of the Navy Erik Raven announced during the service’s budget rollout earlier this year the Navy believes its efforts to bolster the industrial base will put it on track to achieve its desired cadence by 2028. More recently, Raven told Breaking Defense he believes supply chain and workforce inexperience remain the two biggest obstacles standing in the way. Pentagon officials have characterized the jump from historical cadences to their goal in 2028 as being an increased 'workload equivalent factor of five.' As for General Dynamics, its executives have previously been optimistic about eventually reaching the Pentagon’s goal. Jason Aiken, then the company’s chief financial officer, last year told investors the company was on the cusp of achieving that threshold prior to COVID-19. 'So it is eminently doable in terms of the industrial base,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/supply-chain-issues-slowing-down-general-dynamics-sub-construction-ceo-says/	2024-10-23T09:11:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/11/8071283-scaled-e1699556348565.jpg
China tightens ‘counter-stealth’ military radar net around South China Sea, says report	Triton Island in September 2024. Satellite imagery disputes earlier assumptions that Beijing was building a 600-metre runway, revealing instead the development of a sophisticated counter-stealth radar system and a suspected launching point for an anti-ship missile battery. (Photo:Maxar via Chatham House) SYDNEY — As China increasingly engages in what the US calls dangerous behavior against its regional neighbors in the contentious South China Sea, Beijing also aims to raise its situational awareness there with new radar facilities on a tiny island, according to a report by Chatham House researchers. 'New satellite images reveal how the Chinese military is dramatically expanding its capabilities on Triton Island, which looks set to become a one of Beijing’s key signal intelligence bases in the South China Sea,' noted the Oct. 17 report. 'Once completed, the radar system would significantly increase China’s signals intercept and electronic warfare capabilities across the disputed Paracel Islands archipelago and add to a wider surveillance network spanning much of the South China Sea.' Authors, Chatham House's John Pollock and Damien Symon, added, 'The enhanced facility on Triton is likely to offer a challenge to China’s competitors in the region and internationally.' The new facilities are not, as had been previously reported, the likely beginnings of a runway, they say, noting that it sports what they believe to be 'construction of a new radar system, known as SIAR — synthetic impulse and aperture radar — which purportedly detects stealth aircraft.' The radar 'will form what is believed to be a wider network of at least three overlapping counter-stealth radars built across Chinese bases in the South China Sea over the past decade, including on Hainan Island, home to several Chinese naval bases,' the Chatham House analysts write. In addition to the radar and other facilities, the Chatham House authors say some of the facilities appear to be for signal intelligence gathering. 'For Vietnam, which is rapidly expanding its own bases in the South China Sea, the intelligence structures on Triton would significantly diminish its capacity to operate undetected in the area,' the Chatham report says. 'Alongside existing radar on Triton which can detect sea-going vessels, Beijing will likely have the potential to track Vietnamese air movements and gain forewarning of Hanoi’s maneuvers in the area, including efforts to access oil and gas deposits.' The positioning of the radar on Triton, less than 200 miles south of Hainan, is telling, says J. Michael Dahm, an expert at the Mitchell Institute. 'SIAR radars cannot see over the curve of the Earth, which means there is a gap in China’s air surveillance coverage between Subi Reef and Hainan Island. The Triton Island site will help close that gap,' said Dahm in the Chatham House report. The aim, he suggests, is to give China contiguous counter-stealth radar coverage of the South China Sea. Malcolm Davis, a China and defense expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, acknowledged to Breaking Defense the possible risks of the new Chinese facility but suggested the capabilities it provides could be better judged once the facility is completed. Much will depend on the counter-stealth value of the radar in particular and which individual platforms it can track, he explained — specifically drawing on F-35A, B-21 and F-22 aircraft as examples, not to mention coming sixth-generation platforms. 'The station will probably complicate military operations in peace time across the South China Sea but simply prove to be a juicy target in time of war,' he noted. 'Also, it would need to be defended against a full range of land-attack munitions, or even hypersonic weapons that could emerge in western arsenals in coming years. No matter how sophisticated a radar, it is, at the end of the day, a stationary target that can be destroyed, and [air defense systems] can be overwhelmed,' Davis said. 'The application of advanced loitering munitions and swarming drones might make what is probably a very expensive investment a poor one. The radar doesn't look that well defended to me.' He said loyal wingman aircraft, known as Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA), and armed drones would be 'the obvious counter-response here.' Chatham House authors write that the radar on Triton boasts a 'distinctive octagonal structure, which resembles another SIAR system built by China on Subi Reef in the Spratly Islands, south of the Paracels, in 2017. A half-completed tower also sits near the SIAR radar on Triton, which is likely to be the operations center.' That design could make it even easier to find and destroy in war time. There may be defensive works installed soon, the analysts say: 'The satellite images reveal other building projects on Triton. One is a large pad at the end of the road network which will probably be used as a launching point for a mobile anti-ship missile battery. The building at the northeast end of the road is probably a storage building for missile transport vehicles.' '&#8216;The desire to strengthen control over these resources may explain why China is fortifying Triton Island,'' said Bill Hayton, an expert at Chatham House's Asia-Pacific program, in the article. 'The developments might be a warning that China is planning to mount another drilling expedition,' he suggested.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/china-tightens-counter-stealth-military-radar-net-around-south-china-sea-says-report/	2024-10-23T08:51:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/2024-10-15-twt-winter-2024-osint-triton-image-01_0.png
DoD, SBA announce first group of funds for small business investments to shore up tech innovation	The US is investing heavily in microelectronics. (Photo by Rudolfs Klintsons via Pexels) WASHINGTON — The Department of Defense and the Small Business Administration (SBA) on Tuesday announced the first of its kind set of approved licenses and investment funds for small businesses under the Small Business Investment Company Critical Technology (SBICCT) Initiative. Together, the government plans to invest over $2.8 billion in more than1,000 companies in the defense supply chain to help them bolster their private capital so they can more easily transition from prototypes to products. The SBICCT Initiative was created in 2022 and began taking applications in fall of 2023 with the goal of attracting and scaling private investment into 14 DoD Critical Technology Areas that are vital to economic and national security, Jason Rathje, the director of the Office of Strategic Capital, said during a media roundtable Tuesday. Specifically, he said this program aims to expand access to capital for manufacturing and production. He explained that nearly two decades ago, venture capital was investing heavily in hardware, but this drastically changed about ten years later. Because of this, the DoD started this program to help supplement the gap. Investing in hardware is critically important when creating tech like semiconductors, Rathje said. 'Now [these companies] have access to capital that they otherwise wouldn't have access to, because as those dollars went away from investing in capital intensive industries, the availability of capital for companies who are developing these technologies has also decreased. With this program, we're now swinging the pendulum back the other way,' Rathje said. 'Now this provides us an opportunity to bring back capital to invest in to these hardware intensive, critical technology areas and allows us, the department, to really see value in terms of the products and component technologies that are vital for national security,' he added. At the beginning of July, the SBA allocated the first SBICCT Initiative license. (The SBICCT Initiative aims to utilize SBA funding to provide loans and loan guarantees to investors interested in financing companies developing advanced technologies that support national security.) About three months later, there are now four funds that are licensed and nine that are 'green light approved.' The latter means a business is invited to submit a final license application once sufficient capital has been raised and they have been 'vetted' to raise private capital and make a 'first close'(when a fund launches after initial investor commitments are made), explained Bailey DeVries, associate administrator and director of the SBA Office of Innovation and Investment, during the roundtable. 'What the SBA does is, we will perform our due diligence on funds, and in partnership with the DoD, they will conduct their vetting and security analysis of this fund as well. And when we are at the point where we have completed our due diligence and have legal sufficiency, we are able to then approve those funds to go raise private capital,' she said. It is projected that these 13 funds, which the department declined to say who they belonged to, will 'collectively project' to invest over $4 billion in 'nearly' 1,700 portfolio companies, according to a DoD press release. The $4 billion figure fuses $2.8 million, which combines $1.8 billion in private capital raised by 13 licensed and approved funds, with the SBA leverage. These funds combined with the funds nearing the end of the due diligence process, which derive from the SBA's Debenture programs — a way that small businesses access long-term, fixed-rate capital —amounts to a total of over $4 billion, a US official clarified after the roundtable. (Each fund can access up to $175 million in loans through the same system, according to the press release.) SBA, unlike the Pentagon, can legally leverage 'the full faith and credit' of the federal government to guarantee loans to innovative firms. The same would not be true of an OSC effort, but since that Pentagon office is working with SBA, it is able to use the same legal guarantees. Rathje said such partnership between the SBA and the Pentagon allows the US to prioritize its 'enduring advantage' over adversaries by combining innovation with investment. 'Making investments that not only drive the growth of these technologies but also drive more interest in developing these technologies, since there’s capital now available, is an ecosystem opportunity that we see really increasing US long term enduring advantage,' he said. This story has been updated to reflect a clarification sent by the DoD after the roundtable on the total amount of private capital expected to be raised.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/dod-sba-announce-first-group-of-funds-for-small-business-investments-to-shore-up-tech-innovation/	2024-10-23T07:20:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220420_pexels_chip_processor.png
Turkish firm STM unveils indigenous unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle	STM NETA 300, an unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) developed by Defense Technologies Engineering and Trade Co AS, exhibited at the SAHA Expo, Turkiye's flagship defense and aerospace event, organized by the Istanbul Defense and Aerospace Cluster Association (SAHA) in Istanbul, Turkiye on October 22, 2024. (Photo by Serhat Cagdas /Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish shipbuilder STM unveiled today a new unmanned autonomous underwater vehicle (UUV), dubbed STM NETA 300, saying it is the first in what will be a 'family of platforms.' 'The first deployment of STM NETA 300 will be for mine detection and destruction missions,' STM General Manager Özgür Güleryüz said in a statement from the first day of the SAHA expo in Istanbul. 'The system operates autonomously when deployed for Mine Countermeasure (MCM) Operations, making use of side-scan and gap-filling sonar technologies to identify mines in suspected high-risk areas. This enables the user to classify and identify mines or mine-like objects as quickly and effectively as possible,' the statement specified. But the company said the STM NETA is expected to perform a number of missions including intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, anti-submarine warfare, explosive disposal, and pipeline and geophysical surveys. Güleryüz stressed in his statement that the platforms are being developed to fulfil requirements for the Turkish armed forces 'with high export potential among friendly and allied nations.' The company said the UUV has a maximum speed of five knots and can operate at a depth of 300 meters. The system, which can operate for up to 24 hours on a single battery charge, is now in the sea-testing phase. The NETA is a shallow-water vessel, but STM expects to develop medium- and large-sized UUVs to operate deeper in the sea in the future. In addition to the NETA 300, at the exhibition STM is displaying its Turkish national frigate dubbed TCG Istanbul (F-515), the Ada-Class corvette, as well as models of several of its ships and submarines. STM has other ongoing export projects, the latest of which is a contract to equip the Malaysian navy with three Littoral Mission Ships. It also has the lion's share in Turkish national projects. This year it delivered the Istanbul, TCG Derya cargo ship, TCG Lt. Arif Ekmekçi Logistics Support Ship, as well as the armed unmanned surface vessel Marlin.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-firm-stm-unveils-indigenous-unmanned-autonomous-underwater-vehicle/	2024-10-23T06:25:03-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GettyImages-2179460835-scaled-e1729612368806.jpg
Saronic unveils latest, largest unmanned vessel, with eye on mass production	Saronic’s Corsair autonomously navigating open waters in the Gulf of Mexico. (Photo provided by Saronic.) WASHINGTON — Defense tech startup Saronic announced today it is launching its newest autonomous surface vessel, dubbed Corsair, the company’s third and largest unmanned maritime asset aimed at satisfying the Pentagon’s desire for expendable drones produced en masse. The new unmanned vessel is 24 feet long and, according to the company, can travel 1,000 nautical miles at a top speed of 35 knots with a payload capacity of 1,000 pounds. Saronic also produces 6-foot and 14-foot model vessels that, as company officials describe them, fit the US Navy’s future vision for a hybrid manned/unmanned fleet. Dino Mavrookas, co-founder and chief executive officer at Saronic, told reporters ahead of the public announcement the company is already planning to manufacture 'hundreds' of the new vessel to 'meet the demand' the company is predicting, without naming any specific deals. 'We’re building five prototypes, all of which are currently in development,' he said. 'We have done live demonstrations already with end users, and we are moving and ramping into high-rate production and manufacturing as we speak. So, we will be building hundreds and hundreds of Corsairs next year with the ability to scale that into the thousands.' RELATED: With Navy exercise, unmanned surface vessel firm Saronic sees ‘next step’ The startup, which was formed in 2022, has largely focused its efforts on developing and manufacturing unmanned surface vessels implicitly aimed at the Pentagon’s Replicator initiative, which seeks to mass produce affordable, unmanned drones that could be deployed in a fight against China. As Mavrookas described it, Saronic’s advantage in the unmanned vessel market, which has become increasingly saturated in the defense industrial base in recent years, is vertical integration. 'The thing that matters to the Navy … is scale. The first thing that matters is, can you manufacture these at scale in very, very large quantities?' he said. 'In order to scale autonomous platforms, you have to be vertically integrated from start to finish. You have to bring the hardware, the software and the manufacturing and production all together under one roof.' Earlier this year, the Austin, Texas-based firm secured $175 million in series B funding in a round led by venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. Other firms included 8VC, Caffeinated Capital, Elad Gil and NightDragon. When pressed by reporters on if the company’s production was getting too far ahead of the Pentagon’s interest, Mavrookas argued investors would not be cutting checks if the demand signals weren't clear. 'The Navy has to go in this direction. The buying behavior is changing as we speak, and we’re scaling manufacturing and production with [independent research and development] to meet that demand. So, when the contracting catches up, we’re there to meet it,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/saronic-unveils-latest-largest-unmanned-vessel-with-eye-on-mass-production/	2024-10-22T21:01:21-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/CORSAIR_STILL-07_v002-scaled.jpg
Australia to award 155 shell production contract in coming ‘weeks,’ minister says	Pat Conroy, Australian minister for defense industry and capability delivery, and Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg, the Army's head of land capability at the 2024 Land Forces conference in Melbourne. (ADF Cpl. Janet Pan) WASHINGTON — Australia is poised to award a contract to produce 155mm shells domestically in the next few weeks, defense acquisition minister Pat Conroy told Breaking Defense today. 'All I can say is an announcement will be made shortly. So look out in the next little while for that announcement,' Conroy said in an interview during his visit to meet with American defense officials. Pressed for more specificity, Conroy said the timetable is within 'weeks.' Currently, Australia imports its 155mm shells from a South African subsidiary of Rheinmetall. While there is domestic production via a joint venture between a local company, NIOA, and Rheinmetall, those shells are only for export to Germany. Few details have been made public about the pending 155mm contract from the MoD, including dollar amounts and quantity. Conroy confirmed that the NIOA-Rheinmetall team pitched on the deal, with French firm Thales also competing. However, the minister indicated that there is a third, currently unidentified, competitor as well. 'There was a — I won't get into it — but there was a third option that was approached as well,' he told Breaking Defense. Since the start of the Ukraine war, 155mm shells have become a hot commodity, with international demand far exceeding production. Speaking to Breaking Defense last week, Australian Army Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg, the service’s head of Land Capability, said building up domestic 155 production is vital for Australia’s defense. 'I think our government’s been really clear. You just look at the investment they put into guided weapons and explosive ordnance in Australia,' Vagg said on the sidelines of the AUSA conference. 'I know we’re looking at 155; it’ll be crawl, walk, run. I don’t need to say it’s important — I think the government’s actions, the amount of money and effort they’ve invested in that area makes that pretty clear.' Conroy is also hopeful that Australia can play a role in the broader supply chain globally — meaning that as Canberra invests in building up domestic production of munitions for its own use, it is building in 'scalability beyond our domestic need' to be able to help supply international customers. Overall, Australia has committed up to $21 billion AUD ($14.1 billion USD) for what it’s calling the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance Enterprise (GWEO) over the next decade to increase its domestic munitions production. Part of that includes a planned investment in solid rocket motor production. 'I think that's going to be a key focus, is to develop an Australian capability around solid rocket motors, recognizing that that's sort of the pace setter for a lot of the global supply chains around missiles,' Conroy said. Australia has a request for information out to industry for solid rocket motor production, so any competition is in the early stages, though some companies are already signaling their interest. During Conroy’s visit to Washington, Canberra announced a plan to spend $7 billion AUD on SM-2 IIIC and SM-6 missiles for its Navy. While Conroy declined to go into quantities or delivery timelines due to 'operational security reasons,' he said that part of his conversation with US Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro during this trip was to firm up production plans, given concerns about availability of the weapons. 'I'll just say that we're comfortable with our nominated slots in the delivery [queue] and the US Navy have been very cooperative with us in terms of how we access inventory,' Conroy said. 'So I'm satisfied that the delivery schedule meets our strategic needs, and the US Navy has been very supportive of working with them on understanding the capability.' Colin Clark in Sydney contributed to this report.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/australia-to-award-155-shell-production-contract-in-coming-weeks-minister-says/	2024-10-22T16:45:55-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20240913adf8642611_0157-scaled-e1729192099256.jpeg
Space Force lauds ‘in-country’ subcomponents in Indo-Pacific, aiding allies ‘aggressive’ space plans	Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, US Space Forces Indo-Pacific Command commander, delivers opening remarks during an activation ceremony for the U.S. Space Forces Korea at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea, Dec. 14, 2022. (US Air Force photo by Airman 1st Class Aaron Edwards) WASHINGTON — The US Space Force's expanding footprint in the Indo-Pacific region will help allies like South Korea and Japan as they pursue 'aggressive plans to develop military operations where the space domain is concerned,' while ensuring their capabilities will play nice with the US military's, according to a senior US military official there. 'So, as they build their capabilities, having a component right there in country, working with them, having them exercise with us,' helps inform them about 'how they might consider building those capabilities so that they can integrate across the joint force,' Brig. Gen. Anthony Mastalir, commander of US Space Forces — Indo-Pacific, told the Mitchell Institute today. US Space Forces — Indo-Pacific was established as a component command under US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) in November 2022, and the next month it stood up a subcomponent in Osan, Korea, creatively dubbed US Space Forces — Korea. Now Mastalir said it is his 'intent to activate' a second subcomponent in Japan by 'the end of the calendar year.' '[T]here's all kinds of excitement, both on the [Korean Peninsula] and in Japan, about what the Space Force can bring those allies,' he added. When US Space Forces — Indo-Pacific was stood up, Space Force leaders explained that its job would be to serve as a single point of contact advising INDOPACOM about what space forces and capabilities are available not just from the service, but also other organizations such as the National Reconnaissance Office, US Space Command, commercial firms and US allies and partners — and in turn relay INDOPACOM needs back to the Space Force. Mastalir said that one of INDOPACOM chief Adm. Samuel Paparo's key goals, as well as that of his predecessor Adm. John Aquilino, is to move from a focus on 'bilateral engagements and exercises to more multilateral' activities to strengthen deterrence. '[D]emonstrating on a daily basis with your allies and partners that you're prepared to fight and win a war, if you need to, is really the ultimate way to deter a war. So that's really important,' he said. In the space arena, Mastalir said, multilateral exercises are especially useful for helping individual allied nations understand where they can best contribute to a combined fight. '[O]ur partner nations and allies are in different places in their own journey, and we can engage with those partners where they're at, and really kind of bring them along,' he said. Mastalir said that another key advantage of the Space Force having components in the various combatant commands is that embedded Guardians and their commanders can work directly with 'terrestrial warfighters' coordinate defense of US space assets in the face of adversary attacks. He noted that in the INDOPACOM region, Gen. Stephen Whiting, leader US Space Command, is 'certainly is very focused on China's counterspace capabilities that are designed to take out US satellites.' Mastalir elaborated using a scenario of directed energy anti-satellite weapons, noting that exercises have shown the value of having Space Force commanders having 'a voice at the table' in prioritizing a response and figuring out ways across domains to 'neutralize' those targets. 'You really have to take into account all of the capabilities — whether it's space or cyber or air, maritime, land — to understand what that looks like, and then the key is the timing and tempo of how you prosecute those operations,' he said. 'And the adversary gets a vote.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/space-force-lauds-in-country-subcomponents-in-indo-pacific-aiding-allies-aggressive-space-plans/	2024-10-22T12:55:12-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/Gen.-Mastalir-2022-US-Space-Force-stands-up-Korean-component-scaled-e1729625096986.jpeg
Saab braces for ‘couple of years’ of ‘stop-and-go’ production instability on T-7A trainer fuselage	The T-7A Red Hawk, which will become the Air Force's training jet for fighter pilots. (Boeing) BELFAST — It will take as much as two years before production woes on the Air Force T-7A Red Hawk trainer aft fuselage stop dragging down profits for Swedish sub-contractor Saab, according to the company's CEO. Micael Johansson told investors during a third quarter earnings call today that problems with 'start-up costs and under absorption [fixed manufacturing costs]' aligned to low-rate production of the T-7 will only correct themselves 'over time.' 'We are still burdened by that a bit,' he said. 'During the next couple of years, I would say it will take before we get back to sort of really good numbers' in the company's Aeronautics division. Saab's Aeronautics division, which also counts prized aircraft like the Gripen fighter jet and GlobalEye AEW&amp;C platform within its portfolio, recorded quarter three sales of 3.3 billion SEK (297 million USD). Saab is responsible for providing aft fuselages for the T-7 trainer to prime contractor Boeing, and Johansson said his company plans to deliver 'many' fuselages to its American partner from a contract covering '35ish' units. The aircraft is on order by USAF to replace the service's aging T-38 Talon. RELATED: Saab teases future fighter demonstrator concepts, awaits direction from Sweden In January, Saab received a $102 million order for the parts, which are produced out of the company’s West Lafayette, Ind., facility. 'Boeing have estimated there will be a couple of thousand of these aircraft out there training pilots around the world and many in the US, so we just need to get through this' low volume production phase, said Johansson. 'I'm confident in the [T-7A] capability such that we have the facilities. It's not technical problems. It's more &#8230; stop-and-go in production that we need to get the flow going right.' He did not identify any supply chain bottlenecks linked to the 'stop-and-go' production trend, but one bump in the road came when the Air Force decided to slash its T-7 fiscal 2025 procurement from 14 to seven aircraft. If the Air Force continues to slow roll production, both Saab and Boeing will feel the effect, especially the US planemaker as it looks to iron out development phase issues and break the cycle of costly quarterly losses. Boeing declined to comment. Safety risks linked to T-7 flight control software and escape system flaws have previously been shared by the Government Accountability Office, though Boeing has pushed back on such criticism, arguing that company-led flight tests have opened the way for smoother aircraft development. Elsewhere in the call Johansson said it was a 'surprise' when the company's North American arm received a formal request for information related to Brazil's acquisition of 36 Gripen E/F fighter jets. He stressed that the manufacturer will 'collaborate with the authorities and provide information as they request.' He noted that Saab had similarly cooperated with Brazilian and Swedish authorities over the matter and 'no wrongdoing' was found.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/saab-braces-for-couple-of-years-of-stop-and-go-production-instability-on-t-7a-trainer-fuselage/	2024-10-22T12:21:40-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-01-at-10.16.32-AM-e1635361460500.png
Army awards Leidos $331 million to deploy unified network capabilities to different sites	The ultimate goal of the Army's Unified Network is to give soldiers the same network capabilities while deployed as they have at posts, camps, and stations. Photo courtesy of the US Army. WASHINGTON — The Army has awarded Leidos a contract worth up to $331 million to bolster its unified network initiative — the service’s goal of breaking down the dozens of siloed legacy networks, mostly separated by tactical and enterprise portions, to create a more cohesive singular network. The award comes from the Army’s Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications-Network (PEO C3N), which is the program executive office responsible for modernizing the Army’s network capabilities. More specifically, the award comes out of the Global Enterprise Network Modernization – OCONUS (GENM-O) program office within PEO C3N, which provides network modernization in the Southwest Asia, Pacific and Europe theaters. 'We are proud to partner with the Army in deploying the Global Unified Network, which will enhance interoperability and security across all levels of operations. This initiative not only aligns with the Army's Network Modernization Strategy but also aims to position us at the forefront of advancing military communication capabilities in an increasingly complex global landscape,' Steve Hull, president of Leidos' digital modernization sector said in a press release. A spokesperson for PEO C3N told Breaking Defense that Leidos is the main award winner of the contract, but there are a handful of subcontractors involved as well. According to the press release, the contract has a one-year base period of performance with four one-year option periods, and has a total value of $331 million 'if all options are exercised.' Leidos will deploy the unified network to different Army sites to 'deliver a standardized, orchestrated modern network architecture, aiming to make applications, data, and enterprise services are accessible, trusted and interoperable across the globe,' the press release stated. The Army announced its Unified Network Plan nearly three years ago. At the time, the Army had 69 individual networks and announced the goal of getting down to one by 2027, something Program Executive Officer of C3N Mark Kitz, recently told Breaking Defense was 'ambitious,' yet possible. 'This vision of a unified network is very ambitious. For a very long time, the Army has been building tactical and enterprise infrastructure in two very different ways,' he said. 'And so how do we identify those opportunities? How do we identify the challenges, and how do we identify the roadblocks?'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-awards-leidos-331-million-to-deploy-unified-network-capabilities-to-different-sites/	2024-10-22T11:32:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/12/The-ultimate-goal-of-the-Armys-Unified-Network-is-to-give-soldiers-the-same-network-capabilities-while-deployed-as-they-have-at-posts-camps-and-stations.-e1697476883722.jpg
Prolonged F-35 negotiations take a bite out of Lockheed Martin’s third quarter results	U.S. Air Force Capt. Melanie 'MACH' Kluesner, F-35A Lightning II Demonstration Team pilot and commander, flies an aerial demonstration certification flight at Hill Air Force Base, Utah, on Feb. 22, 2024.(Staff Sgt. Kaitlyn Ergish/US Air Force) WASHINGTON — Protracted contract negotiations between Lockheed Martin and the Pentagon on the next two lots of the F-35 have begun to eat away at the company’s bottom line, with Lockheed executives reporting a $700 million lapse in revenue for the program in the third financial quarter. The Defense Department and Lockheed have yet to finalize a deal on F-35 Lots 18-19, which was initially expected by the end of 2023. Funding from an initial contract that allowed Lockheed to begin work on the planes ahead of a final agreement ran out during the third quarter, forcing the company to reach into its own pockets to keep production work going for those jets, company executives said during an earnings call with investors. 'As a result, the company was unable to recognize revenue and profit on approximately $400 million of costs incurred on the program in the third quarter of 2024, with at least an additional $300 million of impacts across the supply chain,' Lockheed said in a news release. 'Additionally, the company was prevented from invoicing and receiving cash of approximately $450 million through the third quarter of 2024.' Lockheed said in the release that it expects that it will reach a deal with the Pentagon in the fourth quarter, allowing it to recover by the end of 2024. However, the company warned that until a final contract is reached or the Pentagon provides additional funding, its financial results could be negatively impacted. 'Should the negotiation timeline be extend beyond year end … we could see about 3 percent or $2 billion of our sales shift into 2025, along with associated impacts to profit and about $1 billion dollars of free cash flow,' said Lockheed Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave during the call. Lockheed CEO Jim Taiclet said it was 'essential for the health of [its] lower tier suppliers' to keep F-35 production going at pace, even if Lockheed and its major subcontractors cannot book revenue on the program until a contract is finalized. Despite the headwinds to the F-35 program, which drove a 3 percent reduction in net sales for Lockheed’s aeronautics unit compared to the same period last year, the company boosted its financial outlook for the year. Earnings per share rose to $26.65 from the previously predicted $26.10 to $26.60 level. Net sales, which had been expected to be between $70.5 billion and $71.5 billion, are now estimated to be $71.25 billion for the year. Rob Stallard, an analyst with Vertical Research Partners, said in a note to investors that the results amounted to 'a decent quarter from Lockheed despite the F-35 hit.' Last month, Malave warned investors that the company could see a $1 billion 'impact' to third quarter results due to dwindling funds on the most recent F-35 contract. At the time, Lockheed was engaged with the F-35 Joint Program Office and Congress on securing additional funding that could bridge the gap until a final Lot 18 and 19 contract could be reached, Malave said then. Aside from the ongoing contract negotiations, the company is still recovering from a year-long F-35 delivery pause stemming from delays in an upcoming upgrade package known as Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3). The Pentagon began accepting F-35s with an interim version of TR-3 in July, but is withholding payment until the upgrade package is complete. Lockheed expects about $600 million in financial impact this year resulting from the pause and resulting withholding, but it could recover up to $400 million next year as it makes progress delivering parked F-35s. The company expects to deliver 90 to 110 F-35s in 2024, with 48 jets delivered through the third quarter. For the next three years, deliveries will increase to about 180 F-35s, including new production jets and F-35s that were held back during the delivery pause, Malave said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/prolonged-f-35-negotiations-take-a-bite-out-of-lockheed-martins-third-quarter-results/	2024-10-22T10:47:56-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240401_f35_clouds_8270083-scaled-e1711999276822.jpg
Lots of ‘buzz’ but no ‘compelling’ military value for cislunar space: CSIS	The International Space Station flew across the face of the moon on April 9, 2010. (Fernando Echeverria / NASA) WASHINGTON — A new, in-depth study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) finds no near-term value for military operations in cislunar space with the possible exception of space surveillance — and a considerable amount of 'hype' about both technological readiness and the commercial business case. 'Though there is certainly a lot of buzz about cislunar growth, the authors of this report found evidence of only a modest increase in cislunar activities over the next decade compared to the past 10 years,' the study states. 'The authors also could not identify any compelling strategic military value from cislunar space and did not foresee one developing in the next decade that could make a decisive difference in any conflict between the United States and China, Russia, or another nation-state.' 'However, national security organizations may want access to cislunar SSA [space situational awareness] data for surveillance purposes,' it adds. The study, 'Salmon Swimming Upstream: Charting a Course in Cislunar Space' and authored by Clayton Swope, deputy director of CSIS's Aerospace Security Project, and Louis Gleason, a former CSIS intern, was released on Monday. Swope formerly was an executive at Amazon's Project Kuiper, and previously did stints in Congress and at the Central Intelligence Agency. The Defense Department has put operations in cislunar space — roughly the area between the Earth and the Moon — on its to-do list for 2040 and beyond, although there is a vocal contingent within the Space Force and its supporters for speeding capabilities in the face of what they say are China's aggressive plans for control of the region and the Moon itself. A number of small, early DoD research projects already ongoing are designed to enable potential cislunar and lunar surface activities, including at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL). AFRL's efforts include the Oracle program to develop a cislunar satellite to keep tabs on potential threats, natural and manmade, in the region. The CSIS study, however, details a number of serious obstacles to cislunar operations that may take decades to resolve, ranging from basic scientific unknowns to technological hurdles to unanswered international governance questions. 'The list of related operational challenges is long,' the study says. For example, there 'is little space situational awareness (SSA) in cislunar space.' While the region is vast and not so heavily populated as Earth orbits, that lack still means that spacecraft in the region at the moment are flying with one eye closed to potential collisions with natural hazards such as micrometeoroids and manmade objects including space junk. Further, the Global Positioning System (GPS) 'was not designed for this region, so without enhancements it cannot reliably provide cislunar navigation and timing services,' the study says. Working out reliable positioning, timing and navigation capabilities in cislunar space and on the Moon is complicated, the study explains. For one, even time itself 'behaves differently on the Moon due to the theory of relativity. The motion of the Moon relative to Earth, as well as its lower gravity, means that time actually moves 56 microseconds faster on the Moon than on Earth each day. While this difference may seem unimportant on the surface, precision time measured to nanoseconds is typically needed for navigation.' Further, the study points out that there is a need for crafting a precise 'lunar reference model' that not only provides topical maps of the lunar surface, but also maps of the magnetic and gravitational fields in the cislunar and lunar region — something that an interagency group including the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, NASA, the US Geological Survey, the US Space Force and US Space Command now are working to develop. There are other problems posed by physics for systems operating in the vast region of space beyond the Earth's orbit and on the lunar surface, CSIS notes. 'In classical orbital mechanics, the motion of a near-Earth satellite can be predicted as part of a two-body problem (i.e., Earth and the spacecraft). In cislunar space, this two-body problem poorly predicts motion,' the study says. Instead, operators have to calculate a three-body problem (i.e. Earth, the Moon and the spacecraft), which is mathematically tricky and requires the refinement of new operational models for how orbits work in the region. 'Other issues, such as the impacts of cosmic radiation and lunar dust on equipment and humans, also pose hazards to cislunar missions,' the study adds. Like the situation for activities in Earth orbit, CSIS finds that international space governance frameworks for cislunar space 'lack needed clarity and definition in three main areas: space rules of the road, property rights and resource use, and permissible activities.' These gaps increase risks in a number of ways, the study elaborates. 'As international space activities increase, particularly by the United States and China, space will become less safe and secure if these deficits are not addressed. A lack of agreed-to and followed space rules of the road will increase spacecraft collision risks. A lack of consensus by spacefaring nations on property rights, space resources, and permissible activities will lead to a greater chance of misunderstandings and miscalculations by space powers, potentially increasing geopolitical tensions and sparking conflict on Earth,' the study says. 'These hazards are particularly acute for cislunar space,' the study warns. One of the reasons supporters have given for a beefed-up military presence in cislunar space is the likely emergence of a booming cislunar space economy. However, the CSIS authors assert that there 'is little sign of a business case for cislunar activities that is not closely tied to government funding and support. Almost all cislunar activities, no matter the mission’s nation of origin, have a civilian focus. 'Most lunar activities are funded and operated by governments, primarily for scientific research and exploration to better understand the Moon and its environs. Most commercial lunar missions are also closely tied to government science and research requirements and funding.' the study says. And that situation is unlikely to change anytime soon, the study says. Despite all these problems, the CSIS study nonetheless makes a case for US government research and development efforts to overcome them to continue apace. For example, many of the science and tech challenges need to be resolved to enable NASA's Artemis program and the lunar exploration missions of other countries — and to prepare for the potentiality that exploration one day leads to human settlement on the Moon and beyond. 'Ultimately, the calculus fundamentally changes if — probably when — large numbers of humans start living on the Moon and in other parts of the solar system. Many of us, these authors included, foresee that future. But that is not on the 10-year plan, probably not even on the 25-year one,' the report concludes.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lots-of-buzz-but-no-compelling-military-value-for-cislunar-space-csis/	2024-10-22T09:44:00-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241022_DVIDS_moon_space_station_849332-scaled-e1729613994494.jpg
Army ISR Task Force to get more permanent home, likely new name, under military intel shop	A Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft. (Bombardier via US Army) WASHINGTON — It’s been more than five years since the US Army stood up a formal Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Task Force. But over the next year, that name is expected to be stripped away, according to its chief Andrew Evans, and its role transitioned to a permanent directorate under the deputy chief of staff for military intelligence, or G-2. 'The definition of a task force is sort of bound by two things: It's bound by a very specific mission, and it's bound by time,' Evans told Breaking Defense at the Association of the US Army conference last week. 'But a task force, by its very nature, is not designed to be something that's enduring in formation.' 'What is enduring is this idea of transformation, you never finish transforming,' he later added. 'Once you finish the thing, you move on to the next thing that you need to transform.' The tentative plan, according to Evans, is to keep a focus on Army intelligence as a warfighting function but 'institutionalize' the task force’s lessons learned. That will mean the task force name will likely be scrapped and the service will create a 'more permanent, institutionalized' directorate inside that G- 2 shop. 'It'll do what Army staff elements do best, which is programming, resourcing, policy, governance, guidance [and] congressional engagements,' he explained. 'And then the shaping of requirements — which is really what the task force was designed to do [for] those intel specific requirements — we will continue to partner with AFC [Army Futures Command] , as the all-domain sensing CFT [cross-functional team] begins to take on more of that mission.' Those four initiatives paved the way for High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System, or HADES, requirements and a recent contract award to the Sierra Nevada Corporation to convert Bombardier’s Global 6500 business jet into an ISR platform to replace a legacy fleet of RC-12 Guardrail turboprop aircraft. L3Harris recently protested that Army decision, and the service issued a stop work order until the Government Accountability Office weighs in. 'Due process is always that a performer has an option to protest if they believe that there's reason to do so. … The government's response is to defer to the Government Accountability Office and let them do their due diligence,' Evans said. Fixed-wing aircraft aside, the ISR Task Force has also been working on a variety of other requirements including for high-altitude balloons and is eyeing plans for a new one for small high-altitude balloons. 'You’ll see it as mHABs, a micro-high-altitude alloon. Those are smaller and they carry less payload, but they’re more transportable, so they’re a little bit more tactical in nature,' Evans said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-isr-task-force-to-get-more-permanent-home-likely-new-name-under-military-intel-shop/	2024-10-22T06:05:41-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240103_bombardier_hades_army-e1704312802342.jpg
Take lessons learned from joint exercises and turn them into capabilities	ADSI is Ultra Intelligence &amp; Space's command-and-control gateway for CJADC2 that's deployed in more than 35 countries, with 12,500 installations at 2,500 sites around the globe. (Ultra Intelligence &amp; Communications graphic) Project Convergence and Valiant Shield are teaching joint and coalition forces how to connect systems, share data, and exchange intelligence. The next step is to take lessons learned and apply them to actual warfighting capabilities. We discussed the challenges, opportunities, and use cases for interoperability with Bradford Powell, president, C2I&amp;E division, Ultra Intelligence &amp; Communications. Breaking Defense: A primary focus of DoD experimentation like Project Convergence has understandably been on foundational interoperability. The next phase will focus more on how they can take advantage of the interoperability that's in place versus worrying about the interoperability. Explain. Bradford Powell is president, C2I&amp;E div., Ultra Intelligence &amp; Communications. Powell: As interoperability strengthens across joint and coalition forces, we must shift our focus from merely ensuring connections to fully harnessing the resulting connectivity and visibility. The services and coalition partners initially had to solve the challenge of linking systems, sharing data, coordinating tasks, and exchanging C2 and intelligence across the joint force — a complex and demanding effort. But as you pointed out, that’s only the beginning. The next step is to actively leverage this interoperability. Ultra I&amp;C is focused on integrating not just the systems we have in place today, but on integrating advanced, specialized, even exquisite and experimental technologies. The real advantage comes when we show how all these systems – legacy, new, next generation and cutting edge – can work together in the battlespace. We can’t stop at just connecting things. We must use the connected systems, platforms, and command and control assets in a more flexible, more innovative way. That’s where interoperability goes from being useful to being game-changing. What are the use cases for interoperability in combined arms operations, air and missile defense, and multi-domain operations, to name just three? Interoperability is essential for all those kinds of operations because it helps us make better decisions faster, especially in tough situations. So, when systems and platforms can’t talk to each other easily, it slows down how quickly we can act and react. But beyond that, when in a contested environment and an adversary disrupts a central gateway, having a distributed network that allows systems to continue to communicate is a differentiator, even if one node goes down. Data is the key to everything. Enabling systems to share data across different forces, countries and across land, air, sea, space and cyber domains is what will make quick decision-making possible. Interoperability at scale is what creates a bigger, more effective response. One key use case is ensuring our legacy systems and coalition partners benefit from the rapid advancements the joint forces are fielding every year. While we often discuss the incredible capabilities our fifth-generation aircraft bring to the fight, we don’t talk about how to get the data they generate to coalition forces or legacy U.S. systems that may be operating on tactical data networks that were first fielded in the 1970s. This is something we enable every day. Achieving interoperability between future and legacy systems will be critical to ensuring effective cooperation in each of the mission areas you mentioned. How has Ultra positioned itself and its products to enable those use cases when the Army is ready to move in that direction? Ultra I&amp;C is incredibly good at unlocking data, even proprietary data sets. We deliver interoperability solutions that work even in environments where data sharing was never envisioned or supported. We firmly believe that data is the key to true interoperability across land, air, sea, and even space. However we recognize our products don’t operate in a vacuum and must be easy to work with. To achieve that, we developed the Unity Adapter. It’s a single, easy-to-use interface that follows open standards, to allow third parties to easily use our products to connect disparate systems for data sharing, which makes it much simpler to deliver new mission capabilities. This is one example of many where Ultra I&amp;C is embracing and leading with open architectures. We’re working across the enterprise from true open system standards and protocols to connect new formats and systems with the ones we already have. For example, we’re already working to integrate TCMP – an emerging protocol data type for space strategic multicast connectivity – to connect with all the others we already support. Our north star is to create a flexible network that gives the U.S. and allied partners the edge in decision-making and keeps us ahead of the threats we collectively face. Final thoughts? Ultra I&amp;C is focused on solving today’s interoperability challenges while also preparing for the future of warfare. By using open architectures that leverage open APIs and tools like the Unity Adapter, we’ve made it easier for legacy and cutting-edge systems to talk to each other and bring innovation to the way we fight. This kind of connectivity is key to making faster, better decisions, especially in tough, high-pressure situations. The second takeaway is that Ultra I&amp;C is already geared up for what’s coming next, like net-enabled weapons, crewed/uncrewed teaming, and AI-driven combat ID. This is the ability to not just have a track on the screen, but also be able to specifically identify what platform the track represents. An example would be a track for a U.S. F-15 flying in an exercise. Without combat ID capabilities, it will just return a radar hit and make a track. By enhancing the track with exquisite capabilities, we now know it’s an F-15 and we can enrich the track so that everyone knows what the platform is. With our track record in joint and coalition operations we’re set up to help the Army handle future missions that need more connected, adaptable solutions. In short, we’re making interoperability the easy button solution for smoother and more effective solutions for the challenges ahead.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/take-lessons-learned-from-joint-exercises-and-turn-them-into-capabilities/	2024-10-22T05:24:45-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/ADSI-is-Ultra-Intelligence-Communications-command-and-control-gateway-for-CJADC2-thats-deployed-in-more-than-35-countries-with-12500-installations-at-2500-sites-around-the.jpg
Estonia carries out bunker prototype tests for envisioned Baltic defense line	An Estonian Armed Forces official inspects a prototype bunker during a live fire test (Estonian Centre for Defence Investments) WASHINGTON — In collaboration with Latvia, Lithuania and Poland, Estonia has completed the test phase of three bunker prototypes, attacking and then assessing the 'weak points' of each design, as the four nations ramp up efforts to slow any future Russian ground invasion and shore up NATO's Eastern flank. Testing of the fortifications, founded on an original plan to construct 600 bunkers across the borders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, took place at the Estonian Defence Forces Central Training Area, Harju County on Oct. 10. A new report will follow in the coming weeks to 'see how to proceed,' Magnus Saar, Estonia’s national armaments director, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the AUSA trade show. 'We didn't fire from a howitzer. We just used the explosives on the bunkers in specific areas, at different ranges, at different points,' he said. 'So let's say &#8216;functional testing' as opposed to imitating battlefield conditions.' The main purpose of the tests was to 'strike at their [various bunkers] weaknesses and see how' each performed in order to inform a frontline design, said Saar. 'I think the main lesson was the heavier stuff works better,' he said. One of the bunker prototypes was 'made from smaller elements that the military can install themselves,' while the other two were both 'one piece' type constructs, added a spokesperson for the Estonian Centre for Defence Investments (RKIK). Of those two, one of the one-piece solutions requires 'special machinery' to install, while the other was proposed by the 'construction company,' according to the RKIK spokesperson. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania are committed to establishing a 600 strong Baltic bunker line stretching across their borders. (Estonian Centre for Defence Investments) 'One of the goals was to create the fortifications in a relatively light way so that they can be erected with minimal additional tools' and not require cranes, noted Saar. Based loosely on France's ill-fated Maginot Line, the new Baltic bunkers are expected to be 35 square metres (377 square feet), hardened to withstand artillery strikes and house up to 10 soldiers. Supporting storage areas are set to be filled with non-explosive ordnance. In July, then-chief of Estonia's defense forces Gen. Martin Herem explained the broader strategy, saying the line is not meant to stop a Russian invasion dead in its tracks, but to 'shape it' into something more manageable to defend against and buy time for NATO reinforcements. 'Politically, it sounds like ‘Let’s make a hole and stop them there, every inch and all this.’ That’s stupid,' said Herem. RELATED: Baltic defensive bunker line not meant to stop Russian attack, but &#8216;shape' it, general says Herem said the idea is also not to build the entire line ahead of time, but to build long-term projects now while identifying which parts could be completed by infantry within, say, a month if NATO had indications Russia was planning to invade. Saar declined to talk about specific timelines for the bunkers currently under assessment, despite Tallinn previously stating that a first production ready bunker could be established in 2025, but hinted that design tweaks could be implemented and additional tests carried out before then. As part of the tests, 'all of our neighbors were present, Poles, Lithuanians, Latvians, and they're all planning the same thing,' explained Saar. 'Maybe we can share some designs, steal ideas from each other, because&#8230; in the end, we are all one big operations area.' He also said that 'most' long lead items are under contract, so that if a 'crisis starts to develop, we will be very fast to implement' the defensive live. Estonia shares an Eastern border with Russia and has long been clear sighted about the prospect of its neighbour mounting an attack on a NATO nation, near term. The country's former Prime Minister Kaja Kallas warned in January that the alliance has between three to five years to prepare for war with Moscow. Looking at the 'Baltic defense line, the idea is, of course, that infantry is very vulnerable, and we've seen that &#8230; in Ukraine's case,' said Saar. 'Fortifying [defenses] when you're already in hostilities is difficult, so that's why we're trying to prepare ahead of time.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/estonia-carries-out-bunker-prototype-tests-for-envisioned-baltic-defense-line/	2024-10-22T04:35:10-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/P041486-scaled-e1729530387340.jpg
American F-35B lands on a Japanese destroyer for first time: US Navy	An F-35B lands aboard Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) for the first time on Oct. 20, 2024. (Photo by Cmdr. Darin Russell.) WASHINGTON — The US Navy for the first time landed an F-35B onboard Japan's largest ship, the destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184), during sea trials off the coast of southern California, the service announced today. 'This test is essential for strengthening Japan's defense capabilities and is of utmost importance. We will do our best to achieve good test results together with the [integrated test force],' said Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force Capt. Shusaku Takeuchi, Kaga's commanding officer, in a US Navy statement. 'This test does not merely enhance the capabilities of [Japan's] Maritime Self-Defense Force. It also improves the interoperability between Japan and the U.S., strengthening the deterrence and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. alliance, thereby contributing to peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.' The Kaga underwent several changes to allow for F-35B, the US Marine Corps' short-take-off-and-vertical-landing variant, to land on the ship, including painting the flight deck with a heat-resistant material, installing lights for nighttime operations and reshaping the flight deck's bow from a trapezoid to a rectangle, according to the US Navy statement. The Japanese ship departed from Kure Naval Base in Hiroshima, Japan, in early September. The F-35 is detached from Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Two Three (VX-23) based at Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland. The sea trials are scheduled to last approximately three weeks. The bilateral testing follows numerous actions by President Joe Biden's administration to strengthen the US-Japan bilateral relationship as a strategic bulwark against Chinese aggression. The White House in April hosted now former Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for an official visit that climaxed with an announcement to upgrade security ties between the two countries. Those upgrades included a new military-industrial council to explore weapons for co-production as well as a new joint headquarters in Tokyo. Biden has also hosted the leaders of both Japan and South Korea for a trilateral summit in an effort to mend what has been a historically fractured relationship between the two Asian countries.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/american-f-35b-lands-on-a-japanese-destroyer-for-first-time-us-navy/	2024-10-21T13:57:08-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8708105-scaled-e1729541848808.jpg
Ground robots challenged, battery issues: Transformation in contact hits the Pacific	A US Army small unmanned aerial system assigned to the 2nd Light Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division prepares to take off from the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center on Dillingham Airfield, Oahu, Hawaii, on Oct. 7 (US Army/ Staff Sgt. Brenden Delgado) WASHINGTON — Attendees at last week's AUSA conference in Washington couldn't escape the phrase 'transformation in contact,' Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George’s push to quickly test new equipment with units both inside the US and abroad to understand how that technology will operate in real world environments. One of the units George has tasked with testing the new kit out is the 2nd Light Brigade Combat Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division, which recently wrapped up putting new gear through its paces in Pacific conditions to see how they did. The results, divisional leaders told reporters today, should give Army leadership plenty to think about. 'When we receive equipment from across the Army that is really tested in pristine environments&#8230;we're seeing what it can do in the heat, in the salt, in the humidity, and at some cases, at altitude as they train on the Big Island of Hawaii,' said 25th Infantry Division’s Command Sgt. Maj. Shaun Curry. 'Maybe it didn't work the way we wanted to, but we have the capability of giving feedback to the Army, to development, to industry to try and make it work a little bit better.' Out at the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center in Hawaii those soldiers used the newer tech in different temperatures and terrain than the recent training rotation this summer with the 2nd Brigade, 101st Airborne Division in the woods and swamp at Ft. Johnson, La. 'Each one of these pieces of equipment requires the opportunity for soldiers to use in different terrains and environments to figure out how they can be employed, what limitations may be involved,' added Maj. Gen. Marcus Evans, the 25th ID commander. 'That's exactly what a training environment like the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center provides.' So what did they find out on the island? While Evans and Curry did not provide reporters with a comprehensive list of every finding, they offered a quick peek at initial takeaways from three key program areas: the Small Multipurpose Equipment Transport (S-MET), unmanned aerial systems and the Infantry Squad Vehicle. The S-MET Increment 1 robotic mules were designed to help soldiers ferry their equipment around on the battlefield. And while officials inside the 2nd Brigade, 101st Division publicly praised the S-MET’s performance out in Louisiana’s relatively flat terrain, those from the 25th found that soldiers in the Pacific or in hillier terrain may need to use them differently. At times, Evans explained, the steep ravines made it a 'bit problematic' for soldiers to maneuver those robotic mules, versus when they were using them on flatter, less dense parcels of land. As a result, Curry said soldiers found different ways to use them, ways that could shape numbers and operations. 'Bottom-up refinement has been a part of the entire transformation in contact, so it may have been one version to say the [S-MET] was going to work in this particular environment, but for us, I think it works best in all logistics patrols in moving large equipment further back…in the rear area,' Curry said. '[That] may be a little bit different from how originally envisioned, but that's how we're using it on the ground.' Across the board, battery power emerged as another challenge for the soldiers looking to recharge everything from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) to the additional communications equipment they had in tow. The hotter temperatures and humidity, Evans added, means less battery duration for systems, which is simply 'acknowledging and understanding the limitations' based on the operating environment. As for UAS on hand, soldiers had about 130 Short Range Reconnaissance (SRR) aerial drones inside the formation, and those provided them with the ability to see further out than an organic rifle platoon. However, soldiers were 'challenged' to get to higher ground and above the tree line in order to launch the smaller drones, Evans added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/ground-robots-challenged-battery-issues-transformation-in-contact-hits-the-pacific/	2024-10-21T13:16:09-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/SRR-e1729532581703.jpg
Army plans follow-up to SATCOM services pilot for FY25	In support of the Army’s Satellite Communications (SATCOM) as a Managed Service (SATaaMS) Pilot, Project Manager Tactical Network (PM TN), Program Executive Office Command, Control, Communications-Tactical (PEO C3T) facilitates new equipment training on commercial equipment for the Virginia Army National Guard, 529th Sustainment Support Battalion, North Chesterfield, Virgina, on Feb. 14, 2024. (US Army photo by Amy Walker, PEO C3T public affairs) WASHINGTON — The US Army is working on a follow-on contract vehicle for purchasing commercial satellite services before the end of fiscal 2025, following the success of a year-long pilot project wrapping up at the end of this month, service officials told Breaking Defense. 'The Army G6 is currently consolidating all commercial SATCOM requirements to find efficiencies in providing network services through various contract options and consolidated funding lines,' said Lt. Col. Mark Scott, product manager for Unified Network Capabilities and Integration (UNCI) in an Oct. 18 email. 'The Army acquisition community is planning to move from a pilot contract to a follow-on contract in fiscal year (FY) 2025 that will establish a Blanket Purchase Agreement with multiple vendors that provide services from all constellations to include Low, Medium and Geosynchronous Earth (LEO, MEO, and GEO) orbits,' he added. Scott is assigned to the project manager Tactical Network, which led the Satellite Communications (SATCOM) as a Managed Service (SaaMS) pilot under the Army Program Executive Office for Command, Control, Communications and Network (PEO C3N). PEO C3N is the new name as of Oct. 9 for the service's Program Executive Office for Command, Control and Communications – Tactical — a change that was designed to reflect the Army's plans to develop a modernized unified network. The Army on Oct. 16 issued a request for information (RFI) to industry designed to assess the 'state of the art' of commercial tech for two types of SATCOM services that would be bought under a new agreement, that in essence buy access to SATCOM in the same way that individuals subscribe to a mobile phone plan. Like the Army's SaaMS pilot, the new contract vehicle would be managed through the US Space Force's Commercial Space Office. 'The US Army is seeking a highly reliable and secure communication network for the Army with worldwide coverage. The communication network will ensure uninterrupted data transfer, voice communication for the warfighter. The offeror must meet at least a 6 Mbps download and a 2 Mbps upload. These are only the very minimum requirements, but the Army seeks higher and cost-effective data plans,' the RFI said. 'In addition, the US Army seeks multiple vendors to supply iDirect SATCOM terminals that will be used for the Sustainment Transport System (STS) Program. The [SaaMS] portion to STS will provide: multiband-capable SATCOM terminals, SATCOM terminal training, and maintenance of SATCOM terminals,' it added. Scott said while the current timeline is subject to potential change, the Army hopes to issue a formal request for proposals in late FY25. Army officials were pleased with the outcome of the SaaMS pilot, which involved two vendors, Intelsat and DRS Global Solutions. DRS Global Solutions now has been folded into into SES Space and Defense, the American arm of Luxembourg-based SES S.A., which purchased the business from Italian defense firm Leonardo. While noting that he was not directly involved in the effort, Col. Pete Atkinson, the Army's principal space advisor, told the annual Association of the US Army conference on Oct. 15 'it was an absolute success.' Scott explained that the pilot used 'one and six-month service plans' that 'included satellite terminals, bandwidth in all regions of the world, training packages, coordination of host nation agreements, cybersecurity, 24/7 helpdesk support, and maintenance services.' Via individual task order under the Blanket Purchase Agreement contract managed by the Space Force, the Army was able to tailor packages to different 'use cases,' including 'short term deployments, support to Army exercises, replace non-mission capable systems, and to supplement bandwidth for units needing extra data transport,' he said. Overall, the partnership between the Army and the selected pilot vendors enabled the successful fielding of over 60 systems within the pilot period of performance,' Scott added. The pilot provided the Army with several 'key takeaways' that will be factored into shaping the SATCOM as a service model, he said. 'One area of improvement included the need for a quicker transition of services if a unit is required to move locations, requiring vendor and Army coordination to execute the technical action,' Scott elaborated. 'Additionally, feedback from pilot participants on vendor terminal solutions commented that they preferred smaller systems that are easily transportable. Short-notice deployments may require commercial air travel and ruggedized terminals with added power supplies in bulky tough boxes proved difficult for transport.' Overall, however, the Army is convinced that there are benefits to be had from moving in that direction. For example, using a service contract allows for 'potential for rapid response to unit SATCOM requirements combined with the ability to scale quickly,' Scott said. 'The biggest benefit discovered is the use of many of the latest technologies available in the commercial market.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-plans-follow-up-to-satcom-services-pilot-for-fy25/	2024-10-21T12:25:50-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/APPROVED-SaaMS-NET-VAARNG-14Feb24-NorthChesterfield-VA-AmyWalker-IMG_1473rev-scaled-e1729532648615.jpg
Army official wants tech contracts in 6 months, and is inverting the requirements process to get there	A student at the US Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School in the Technical Exploitation Course processes a laptop computer during training at Fort Bragg, North Carolina October 22, 2019. (US Army photo by K. Kassens) Danielle Moyer, executive director of Army Contracting Command at Aberdeen Proving Ground, said during a panel at AUSA 2024 last week that the service plans to emphasize the use of 'characteristics of need,' rather than too restrictive traditional requirements. 'When we have a problem, we want to take that problem and give it to industry, and not over prescribe contracts,' Moyer said. She suggested that instead, industry 'propose back a solution, and then we determine the contract type based on your solution, instead of me predetermining everything.' The thinking was echoed by none other than Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, who described the improved process earlier in the conference. 'We put out a two-page characterization of needs for our network, and then we had all the experts, people who really understand this, and we have our own group of nerds that are a part of this as well, but they would actually tell us, ‘Hey, here's what we can do, and here's how we can do it, and this might be a better way to approach this.' And I think we're getting faster with that too,' George said. Industry seems to agree with the Army's initiative to move toward a characteristics of need approach. Tara Murphy Dougherty, CEO of defense software firm Govini, said it allows industry to be more involved in the process. 'So to the point about how restrictive requirements are and how rapidly outdated they are, what is fantastic about a characteristics of need is that it creates a focus on the warfighter from the buyer side of the problem, and it allows industry to suggest the solutions,' she said. 'If you want innovation, and you know that the vast majority of the innovation in the United States today is happening in the commercial sector, then why not describe your problems and seek that input rather than describing the solution you want?' 'We want affordable contracts, but sometimes we want the best thing, and then how do we incentivize you with the best thing once you prove it right?' Moyer said. She added that her office is looking at ways to hand out incentives for vendors who showed their product was 'better and faster' than others. Christian Brose, chief strategy officer of Anduril Industries, agreed with Moyer, saying incentives and the focus on needs, rather than requirements, would help vendors stay focused on the service’s mission and help deliver products at a faster speed. Moyer said the Army also plans to focus on more demos and less paperwork. She said this allows vendors to actually show off their capabilities instead of showing how well they can fill out a lengthy proposal, which can take large quantities of time as they are are usually hundreds of pages. 'We want you to come demo like, what do you really do and show me?' she asked. 'There should be real constant feedback in some tech demonstrations, versus ‘Did you write [the proposal] really well?’ You probably used some AI to write the proposal anyway.' She added that the Army has already gotten away from the 'hundreds of pages' of written proposals, which she reiterated were not the best measurement as to how a vendor will perform. 'You probably get kicked out of a competition because your font was wrong. [We’re] probably gonna change that,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-official-wants-tech-contracts-in-6-months-and-is-inverting-the-requirements-process-to-get-there/	2024-10-21T11:45:52-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/230525_DVIDS_soldier_laptop_5895094-scaled-e1685021963805.jpg
Turkish defense spending to reach record high amid neighboring conflicts	Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz attends the Opening Session of the 3rd Legislative Year of the 28th Term of the Turkish Grand National Assembly at the Turkish Parliament in Ankara, Turkiye on October 1, 2024. (Photo by Harun Ozalp/Anadolu via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkey plans to increase its defense and security spending in 2025 to ₺1.61 trillion ($47 billion), its highest-ever military budget, in what experts said is a response to increased local production and raging conflicts in neighboring countries. Turkish Vice President Cevdet Yilmaz told reporters in a briefing Thursday that the money will be split, with ₺ 913.9 billion ($26.6 billion) going to the defense spending budget and ₺694.5 billion ($20.28 billion) going to internal security. The 2025 budget, which is a 17.5 percent increase from the $40 billion 2024 budget, follows the recent upward trend of defense spending in Turkey. The 2024 budget, for instance, was a 150 percent increase from the prior year's $16 billion budget. Experts told Breaking Defense that the surge in spending was spurred by Ankara’s focus on boosting its air and missile defense capabilities, as well as supporting local defense production. 'Air defense systems and missiles will be at the top of these projects,' Turkish aerospace and defense expert Cem Dogut said. 'Air defense was one of the weakest areas of the Turkish Armed Forces. For many years, this task was left to the air force, and the air force had mainly resorted to combating this with fighter jets.' He also highlighted Turkish local projects in this domain, stating, 'In order to eliminate this deficiency, various projects have been initiated to create a layered air defense, including the Hisar and Siper air defense missile families and various radar projects.' Another budget need, according to Dogut, is maintaining modern aircraft fleet. '[There is a] need to maintain the current fleet while the current aircraft projects (Hürjet, Kaan) continue until they arrive. A serious additional budget is needed for the F-16 modernization project and the Eurofighter purchase,' he said. RELATED: The &#8216;dual purpose' in Turkey's bid for 40 Eurofighter Typhoons In her opinion, defense analyst Sine Özkaraşahin told Breaking Defense that Turkey has multiple ambitious defense projects, namely 'upgrades to Kızılelma, the steel dome layered air defense system, and potential purchase of Eurofighter jets.' She said Turkey is reacting to a high 'threat perception in its neighborhood,' including instability in neighboring Syria, Iraq and Iran, as well as the current Armenia-Azerbaijan dispute. The Israeli wars in Gaza and Lebanon are a short trip across the Mediterranean. Of the many surrounding conflicts, the biggest problem facing Turkey, according to Dogut, is the current situation in Syria. 'Previously, different operations were carried out [by Turkey] to create a safe zone in Syria. However, the entire border could not be secured, and new operations in this region seem inevitable. Although Turkey wants to postpone this as long as it can, it will eventually have to do so,' he added. Turkey has been focused on making strides in localizing defense production in an attempt to become less dependent on Western technology that might be subjected to embargoes — a long-term investment that Dogut nevertheless says comes at a price. 'Producing a weapon system yourself from scratch will usually be more costly than purchasing it from abroad. Turkey is forced to produce everything it cannot buy from abroad, which wastes time and money,' he stressed.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/turkish-defense-spending-to-reach-record-high-amid-neighboring-conflicts/	2024-10-21T10:57:27-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/GettyImages-2175261114-e1729531119722.jpg
In Ukraine, Austin takes aim at Putin ‘apologists,’ decries ‘both sides’ narrative on blame for war	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III answers questions during a press conference at the conclusion of the NATO Defense Ministerial meetings at NATO headquarters in Brussels, Belgium, Oct. 12, 2023. (DoD photo by Chad J. McNeeley) WASHINGTON — In an impassioned speech in Kyiv today, US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin took direct aim at the idea that Ukraine is to blame for Russia's invasion, saying US 'fully understand[s] the moral chasm between aggressor and defender.' Taking a line from President John F. Kennedy's famous 1963 address in Berlin, Austin, who normally avoids political statements, said that 'there are some who don't understand — or say they don't understand — what is at stake between the free world and an aggressive tyrant like [Russian President Vladimir] Putin.' 'There are some who say that both sides are to blame for Putin's war of aggression &#8230; There are some who blur the lines between aggressor and victim,' Austin said according to prepared remarks, adding in each instance that those people should 'come to Kyiv.' Austin did not identify the people he was talking about, except to mention 'Kremlin apologists,' but the speech comes as a critical moment ahead of the US election and just days after Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suggested Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was responsible for Russia's invasion. 'That doesn't mean I don't want to help [Zelenskyy], because I feel very badly for those people. But he should never have let that war start. The war's a loser,' Trump said last week on a podcast. Speaking next to Zelenskyy late last month, Trump said he and the Ukrainian leader have a 'very good relationship, and I also have a very good relationship, as you know, with President Putin.' Just days later, after Zelenskyy criticized Trump in a New Yorker article, Trump suggested the US should reconsider its commitment. 'Those buildings are down. Those cities are gone. They're gone. And we continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal,' Trump said at a campaign rally. (Earlier in September, during a presidential debate Trump declined to say if he thought Ukraine should win the war.) Some lawmakers in the US Congress, especially among Republicans in the House of Representatives, have spoken out against US aid for Ukraine, arguing that the money is better spent inside American borders. Austin spoke the same day the Defense Department unveiled its latest aid package, including $400 million-worth of equipment ranging from rocket ammunition to Javelin anti-armor weapons to satellite communications equipment. In his speech today, Austin attempted to link Ukraine's security with America's. 'Ukraine matters to US security for four blunt reasons: Putin's war threatens European security, Putin's war challenges our NATO allies, Putin's war attacks our shared values, and Putin's war is a frontal assault on the rules-based international order that keeps us all safe.' And though Austin did not mention Trump, he did name-check Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate, saying she and President Joe Biden 'will have a proud place in history for rallying the world to defend Ukraine.' Austin also praised Zelenskyy, saying that from his position 'on down, your leaders chose to fight back.' 'The spirit of Ukraine has inspired the world, and it has reminded us all to never take our freedom for granted,' Austin said. 'So we refuse to blame Ukraine for the Kremlin's aggression. We refuse to offer excuses for Putin's atrocities. And we refuse to pretend that appeasement will stop an invasion.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/in-ukraine-austin-takes-aim-at-putin-apologists-decries-both-sides-narrative-on-blame-for-war/	2024-10-21T08:58:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240416_austin_nato_flags_8069533-scaled-e1713254552575.jpg
Australia announces $7B for SM-2, SM-6 missiles in huge munitions purchase	HMAS Sydney fires Royal Australian Navy's first Standard Missile 6 (SM-6) near Hawaii during Exercise Pacific Dragon 2024. (ADF LSIS Daniel Goodman) SYDNEY — Australia today announced a massive $7 billion AUD ($4.68 billion USD) investment in SM-2 IIIC and SM-6 missiles for its Navy, solidifying a commitment to buying the US-made long-range precision weapons while boosting the sea service's ability to defend against ballistic missile attacks. 'The Standard Missile 6 and Standard Missile 2 Block IIIC will enable our Navy to strike maritime, land and air targets at long-range, and provide a terminal ballistic missile defense capability, boosting the capacity for the ADF to safeguard Australians and their interests,' Defense Minister Richard Marles said in a Monday statement. 'The SM-2 IIIC and SM-6 are the most advanced air and missile defense weapons in the world and will be progressively deployed across Navy’s Hobart class destroyers and in the future, the Hunter class frigates,' Marles continued. 'This follows the recent successful test firing of a SM-6 from HMAS Sydney.' Australia's minister for defense procurement, Pat Conroy, noted in a statement that, 'Australia was the first country, other than the United States, to fire the SM&#8211;6 missile, underscoring the strength of our alliance.' In terms of capability, SM-2 IIIC adds active seeker technology and 'significantly enhanced defensive capabilities against missile threats,' per the statement. The SM-6 will give Australia's missile defense more depth because of its increased range, the government release says. The announcement is a culmination of years of interest in the weapons from the Lucky Country. In August 2021, the US State Department approved a Foreign Military Sale (FMS) case for 'services related to the future purchase of' SM-6 and SM-2 IIIC. That agreement was for just $350 million USD, but likely helped pave a path forward for today's announcement. While today's statement doesn't say so, it's likely this is a also an FMS case, which will include training, spare parts, manuals and other incidentals. FMS cases mean the US government serves as the go-between for the company — in this case, missile-produced Raytheon — and the foreign buyer. While FMS cases need to be approved by Congress, that is unlikely to be an issue here given the widespread support for military relations with Australia. The SM-2 was the subject of a production shutdown in 2013, when international demand sagged. However, production has since resumed, and the first successful test of a missile from the line occurred in 2020. More than 12,000 of these air defense missile have been delivered, and according to Raytheon, other foreign users include Canada, Germany, Japan, Korea, Netherlands, Spain and Taiwan, with Chile and Denmark also planning to purchase the weapon. Australia has operated earlier SM-2 model missiles since at least 2010. The US Navy fired SM-2 missiles to intercept anti-ship missiles and drones in the Red Sea in early 2024 to defend against attacks by Houthi rebels targeting commercial vessels transiting the waterway. In a recent op-ed, noted defense budget expert Mackenzie Eaglen pointed to what she called the 'dire' missile production problems of the US Navy, including across the Standard Missile line. Eaglen notes that SM-6 procurement for the US Navy is 'expected to increase to 300 missiles by 2029' but that these rates 'pale in comparison to those of the past. For example, in 1985 alone, President Reagan requested 1,380 SM-2s—over 10 times this administration’s Standard Missile request.' The Australian orders, for which no production numbers were provided by the government in its release, should help bolster both the SM-2 and SM-6 production lines.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/australia-announces-7b-for-sm-2-sm-6-missiles-in-huge-munitions-purchase/	2024-10-21T08:30:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/20240805ran8620187_0098.jpeg
It’s time for a true industrial strategy for American national security	Robotic arms along assembly line in modern factory. Heavy industry, technology and machine learning. 3D rendering (Getty images) Earlier this year, the bipartisan congressionally-appointed commission on which we serve sounded the alarm that America is at risk of losing its military and technological edge to China. One way to meet that challenge is to redefine how the industrial base fits into national security to create an all-elements of national power approach. Currently, the view of industrial national security tends to focus on efforts to keep the defense industrial base healthy, productive, and resilient. The emphasis has been ensuring China or Russia cannot buy companies that are integral parts of the defense supply chain, improving and expanding production of the weapons in demand around the globe, and ensuring the security of critical infrastructure essential to the defense industrial base. But in 2024, and certainly going forward, this is simply too myopic a view of the role industrial policy plays as the backbone to American security. There is an integral link between the defense industrial base and American industry as a whole. The materials, components, and manufacturing produced by American industry are as essential to the defense industrial base as they are to U.S. economic strength. The next administration should ensure that industrial policy receives significant attention to strengthen national security. Industrial policy requires making strategic public investments designed to strengthen economic and national security — not only what is traditionally thought of as the defense industrial base, but in broader goods and manufacturing category for both America and its allies. This means ensuring effective production of and supply chains for goods and manufacturing that serve interests and needs across the economy – not just the defense industrial base — as an expanded aperture strengthens U.S. security. RELATED: National Defense Commission: Pentagon has ‘insufficient’ forces ‘inadequate’ to face China, Russia An effective industrial strategy rests on three pillars, each with tangible steps the new administration should take: Defense Production: First, a new administration must enable the U.S. industrial base to rapidly surge and scale production to manufacture goods, from silicon wafers to aluminum pipes to attritable drones. This requires repurposing available mechanisms for public-private financing via the Defense Production Act, within Development Finance Corporation or Department of Energy authorities, or creating new ones. It means legislatively reforming existing U.S. permitting processes, including addressing unintended consequences of the 50+ year old National Environmental Protection Act. It also requires industry to embrace more flexible design, test, and manufacturing processes such as additive manufacturing, and leveraging software to automate and speed defense production. This must be enabled by significant reform of overly rigid government test, evaluation, and qualification regulations. Build Our Workforce: Second, the strategy must harness the American workforce to lead the world economically and provide for a more secure American future. America needs more workers skilled in trade: plumbers, welders, electricians, and those ready to mine and process the minerals that power phones, batteries, automobiles, and weapons systems. Equally, America needs scientists, technologists, and innovators at every level in every field to maintain a cutting edge. The next administration must recast the narrative so that industrial and technical jobs, whether they in civil, military service or in private industry, are seen as critical public service without which the nation cannot function – let alone lead. The narrative must be paired with smart investments in community colleges, vocational certifications, STEM recruitment, and the ability for those with needed skills to move seamlessly between public and private sectors. Work With Partners: Third, the strategy should leverage allies as industrial and technological force-multipliers. Industrial collaboration helps create redundant and resilient supply chains, expands manufacturing capacity, and taps into key leading technologies such as quantum computing. International industrial cooperation strengthens American security and economy by increasing production and innovation in the right technologies. It requires re-engineering export controls like the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and developing swifter information sharing with America’s most trusted friends — in other words, more open channels for industrial collaboration abroad. Consider an America that with like-minded international partners can develop software and computer chips, create a sustainable and resilient critical mineral supply chain, build the defense equipment needed to deter China, and offer more job opportunities and skilled workers to fill them. The good news: This is all possible, and there have been steps made in the right direction. Major economic and energy legislation of the last few years – the bipartisan infrastructure law, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act — lay a foundation for onshoring key industries paired with the ability to 'friend-shore' with allies and partners. The next administration must iterate on these Biden administration initiatives, taking a step further to implement a truly innovative industrial strategy that reimagines manufacturing as a core pillar of American strength. Luckily, there is a growing bipartisan agreement that things need to change. Just look at the presidential campaign today — eight years ago, strengthening the U.S. industrial base to ensure American competitiveness would hardly have gotten a mention. Now you can see candidates talking openly about competing with China economically, reducing dependency on China for key supply chains, and deterring destabilizing actions that threaten U.S. and global security. Our commission assessing the National Defense Strategy highlighted the dangers of inaction. The next president must be maximally focused on moving industrial strategy from words to action to demonstrate that defense of the nation is not just the responsibility of the military alone. For an industrial strategy to work, the president must make it a White House priority that pulls together all elements of national power. At an executive level, a joint team from the National Security Council and the National Economic Council should lead implementation, honing flexible and innovative policy options for the president and playing a coordinating role across government to execute the strategy. At the legislative level, the presidential candidates should consider calling upon the next Congress to constitute a bicameral, bipartisan task force on industrial strategy implementation. The House Select Committee on China, HASC and SASC members, and supporters of the CHIPS and Science Act would be strong candidates for participation. America and its allies acting together present a formidable integrated economic and security edge that can counter China’s attempts to corner markets and coerce economically and militarily. The next president must make clear the nature of the threat and opportunity, pair it with a call to action, and offer pathways for every American, anchored in the industrial strategy that will guide America for the rest of the century. America’s future, and with it, global security, stability, and prosperity, depend on it.

Estonia mulls additional HIMARS buy, while talking with Lockheed competitors	A High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) from Alpha 'Able' Battery, 3-321st Field Artillery Regiment (FAR) from the 18th Field Artillery Brigade (FAB) lights up the night sky on Fort Campbell, Ky. (US Army) WASHINGTON — Estonia is weighing a second Lockheed Martin M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) order and has opened talks with other competitors to assess alternative platform options, according to the Baltic nation’s top weapons procurement official. 'We are expecting [HIMARS] deliveries next year, and we plan a follow on order,' Magnus Saar, Estonia’s national armaments director, told Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the AUSA trade show last week. 'Lately, our government decided to invest an additional €1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) to increase strategic sustainability&#8230;.a huge part of it' will be spent on HIMARS, he noted, before stressing that any new deal is dependent on delivery lead times and pricing from the US government. Speaking on background, a US State Department official told Breaking Defense that 'As a matter of policy, we do not publicly confirm or comment on proposed arms transfer cases until they have been formally notified to Congress. We refer you to the Estonians to speak to their defense procurement plans.' Lockheed Martin did not return a request for comment by publication. Estonia signed for six HIMARS in a package worth over $200 million in 2020 and which covers several rocket types that can reach a range between 70km and 300km, communications systems, training and logistics. First deliveries of the weapons system were scheduled to begin this year, but Saar’s reference to 'next year,' highlights a delay — an issue that looks to have drawn concern ahead of placing a new order. 'If the delivery times were long, we may need to substitute HIMARS munitions for something else, that’s available faster,' he added. 'We're having those discussions here [in Washington] to establish a clear picture of if we would make an order and how fast we could get it.' Talks with a number of non-US competitors have already taken place and include South Korea’s Hanwha Aerospace pitching the K239 Chunmoo, Turkey’s Rocketsan offering Khan and Israel’s Elbit putting forward the Precise and Universal Launching System (PULS). And there may be more — Saar said he had 'probably neglected to mention a few' other competitors. Despite those conversations, the foundations for a follow on HIMARS acquisition appear to be relatively strong, even with the question mark over delivery times. In January, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania signed a trilateral agreement, 'which aims to create a framework for joint use' of HIMARS, according to a translated statement from Estonia's Ministry of Defence. Additionally, the US Army HIMARS unit in Estonia, Task Force Võit, frequently trains and collaborates with Estonian Defense Forces’ 1st Brigade and NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence (EFP) Battle Group. In a more general sense, Tallinn has ramped up defense spending in the aftermath of Russia’s invasion, reaching a figure above 3 percent GDP this year — outperforming the 2 percent NATO target. The Baltic state plans on spending €3.5 billion on new 'armaments' over the next five years, according to the Estonian Centre for Defence Investments long term spending plan [PDF]. Over the next two years alone it has committed to layouts of €200 million for 155mm wheeled self propelled howitzers, €200 million for French Mistral Man-Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) and €200 million for new loitering munitions. As it looks to build up multi-layered air defense capabilities, Tallinn is also set to receive deliveries of German made IRIS-T SLM medium range ground-based air defense systems next year. 'NATO has taken steps to enhance air defense and improve situational awareness,' Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's Defence Minister said at the NATO Defence Ministers' Meeting in Brussels on 18 October. 'The imminent reopening of our Ämari base and the presence of Spain's NASAMS unit in Estonia are part of this air defense enhancement, which will soon be reinforced by our own IRIS-T systems.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/estonia-mulls-additional-himars-buy-while-talking-with-lockheed-competitors/	2024-10-21T07:02:26-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/8367481-scaled-e1719929733574.jpg
Army’s new Theater Information Advantage Detachments will be tailored to their theater: Officials	Staff Sgt.

(U.S. Army National Guard photo by Staff Sgt. Renee Seruntine) AUSA 2024 — One size doesn’t fit all in cyberspace. So the Army’s three planned Theater Information Advantage Detachments will deliberately undergo divergent evolution to better serve the specific commanders they’re attached to, officials said last week. 'One’s going to the Pacific, one’s going to Europe, and one’s going to Army Cyber [Command],' explained ARCYBER’s commander, Lt. Gen. Maria Barrett, in a packed briefing at the Association of the US Army’s annual conference dedicated to the information warfare teams. The newly designated units are designed to help commanders counter disinformation and other 'malign influence' interfering with Army operations. The TIAD assigned to US Army Pacific in Hawaii will stand up first, Barrett said. The official activation date is October 2025, although the service intends to get as many personnel in place as far ahead of that date as it can. The next TIAD to go live will be collocated with ARCYBER headquarters at Fort Eisenhower, Ga. (formerly Fort Gordon), and Europe will be last. Each TIAD will have 65 soldiers, but the US-based detachment will have a trans-regional focus and easy access to ARCYBER’s high-end technical capabilities, Barrett and other officials said, while the two forward-deployed TIADs will focus 'down and in' on their respective theaters and may need more soft-power assets such as foreign-language speakers. The European and Pacific detachments will probably end up diverging from each other, as well, for example in how they plug into the existing command structures. 'We've got to give a little bit of permission [for commanders to say] ’I want all of that coming through my G-38 [staff element]’ or ‘I want all this going through my theater fires element,’' Barrett said. 'I think that is going to play out in some of the exercises. &#8230; We saw this really with the MDTFs [Multi-Domain Task Forces] as well, how each one of the theaters really chose how to command and control' in its own way. That kind of customization is a contrast to the past generation of guerrilla warfare, where the Army deliberately created a few standardized types of 'modular' units that could replace each other on deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan with minimal reorganization or disruption. The TIADs, however, don’t even have a single standardized Table of Organization &amp; Equipment (TOE), Barrett told Breaking Defense after her briefing (though they do have a formally approved Initial Capabilities Document). Their core personnel will come from the 1st Information Operations Brigade, which had been providing specialists in 'military information support operations' (formerly known as psyops) to commanders on an as-needed and ad hoc basis. But the TIADs will add other specialties such as cyber/electronic warfare and languages, she explained, and they’ll embed these experts in their assigned HQs on a permanent basis so commanders can better understand their capabilities — and customize them to their campaign plans. 'It's going to be up to the commander how they're organizing their campaign, what kind of effects they want to have, and what the planners come up with,' Barrett told the AUSA audience. A key aspect of this customization is focus. 'We are not trying to boil the ocean and figure out who’s doing what to whom globally,' said Aaron Pearce, a civilian expert on Barrett’s staff. Instead, he said, the TIADs will specifically look at misinformation, propaganda, and other 'malign influences' affecting the specific commander, theater, and forces to which they’re assigned. Then they can counter it at the commander’s discretion, he went on — whether that means simply exposing the lies, aggressively 'naming and shaming' the perpetrators, or bringing in 'technical means' to hack the adversary’s social media accounts, botnets, and troll farms. Information is a vital tool for military targeting, planning, and other functions, Pearce emphasized, but it can also be a weapon in its own right. 'We also need to start fighting with that information,' he said. 'Information has to be a component of the commander's scheme of maneuver and scheme of fires.' 'Last year, the Combined Arms center published ADP-3-13, the doctrine for information advantage,' Barrett said. 'Now we have a framework for how to think about those things, but the doctrine isn't good enough [by itself]. We've got to have some structure to support this as well… a Theater Information Advantage Detachment.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/armys-new-theater-information-advantage-detachments-will-be-tailored-to-their-theater-officials/	2024-10-21T05:58:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/241017_DVIDS_soldier_computers_7758907-scaled-e1729191253630.jpg
The wings of the M437 take flight after being developed in a fully connected digital ecosystem	The wings for Scaled Composites Model 437 Vanguard technology demonstrator were designed and built by Northrop Grumman in a fully connected digital thread. (Northrop Grumman photo) Northrop Grumman revealed the future of aircraft engineering with the first flight of a technology demonstrator sporting a pair of wings designed and built in a fully connected digital thread. The wings were integrated with Scaled Composites Model 437 Vanguard that took flight in late August. This wasn’t just another first flight, though, as it demonstrated the validity of an end-to-end digital ecosystem that Northrop Grumman calls Digital Pathfinder that paves the way for faster and more affordable aircraft engineering and manufacturing. 'As we pivot toward a near-peer competitor that is increasingly enabled by technology, we must deliver high-tech, high-end solutions within tighter timelines. Digital engineering makes that possible,' said Sarah Beaudin, director, Digital Pathfinder at Northrop Grumman. 'Without digital capabilities, developing systems at the cutting edge of technology would be far slower. 'Our digital environment provides near-real-time visibility, creating a single source of truth. This allows us to adopt a shift-left approach — iterating everything from design through sustainment as early as possible in the program. By the time we actually start building things, we’ve already got it right.' The Digital Pathfinder (DPF) team, spanning Northrop Grumman and its subsidiary Scaled Composites, was tasked with developing a clean-sheet aircraft design and production of a multi-mission, low-cost attritable aircraft using a fully connected digital thread from the onset. Northrop Grumman led the design, build, and manufacturing of the aircraft’s removable wing assemblies using advanced digital tools and processes. Scaled Composites handled aerodynamic and structural analysis, fuselage and empennage fabrication, aircraft assembly, systems integration, and the ground and flight tests. Together, the DPF team delivered quantifiable benefits – reducing costs, accelerating timelines and improving quality. For example, engineering rework on the wings was less than 1 percent, compared to a more typical 15-20 percent for a first-time build. Additionally, the design, build, and testing of the DPF wings was accomplished with less than 2 percent of schedule erosion. Digital ecosystem of the future Ultimately, the platforms and systems created in the digital environment must take solid form and take flight – like the M437. Typically, that involves fabricating parts from aluminum and composite materials. Now, digital engineering enhances these processes with additive manufacturing and determinate assembly. 'Digital Pathfinder had three major manufacturing elements,' said Eric Barnes, a Northrop Grumman Fellow and additive manufacturing expert. 'First, we integrated suppliers into the digital transformation collaborative toolset, enabling the ‘shift-left’ approach. This was a game-changer in many ways. 'The other two aspects were determinate assembly and additive manufacturing. To perform determinant assembly effectively, we need to push digital collaboration down to our suppliers, integrating them into our digital toolsets.' Determinate manufacturing designs components from different manufacturers in a shared digital ecosystem. This ensures that when the parts come together on the factory floor, they do so with minimal tooling and adjustment. In traditional manufacturing, for example, aircraft ribs and skins would arrive at the factory floor without fastener holes, requiring tooling to align the pieces before drilling. The process is both time- and cost-intensive and prone to errors, leading to scrap and rework. In determinate manufacturing, however, the exact location for fastener holes are pre-determined in the digital design. When the components arrive on the shop floor, they align perfectly, allowing technicians to quickly install fasteners without rework. Additive manufacturing is also revolutionized by digital engineering. Suppliers, OEMs, and customers can collaborate in real-time to create shared designs, which are then fabricated layer by layer using 3D printing technology. Northrop Grumman has invested more than $100 million in additive manufacturing, inventing new processes along the way. 'We have multiple patents associated with this continuous fiber additive manufacturing cell,' said Barnes, who led several of those innovations. 'One of these patents allows machines to switch between materials, laying down continuous fiber composites in true 3D form. This enables us to align fibers with load directions, producing lighter, stronger structures with less material.' Collaboration is king in a digital world Manufacturing in a digital ecosystem not only enhances collaboration within an enterprise, as we’ve seen between Scaled and Northrop Grumman, but also brings together project offices, primes, subcontractors, customers,and suppliers into the heart of the production process – from research and development to sustainment. Stakeholders can easily collaborate in a digital ecosystem because they have direct access to the same single source of truth. That provides a common view of requirements from top-level system capabilities down to component-level parts. When changes occur through the Change Control Board, which always includes customer representation — whether it’s a product improvement, evolving threats, or a design change for producibility or sustainability — those changes flow across the fully-connected digital ecosystem. 'Being connected in the digital ecosystem throughout our development lifecycle, we all can immediately see the impact of changes on top-level requirements, test requirements, and sustainment of the system,' said Beaudin. 3D digital design models, including virtual and augmented reality representations, are available for internal stakeholders, as well as customers to view. The models allow users to simulate tasks such as refueling an airplane or reloading weapons, and high-fidelity system performance simulations are also included. 'Many of these simulations are validated models of environments and threat scenarios,' said Beaudin. 'The integrated DoD-industry team can assess system performance and collaborate on design trades to optimize for real-world conditions.' When Northrop Grumman tests systems, whether through virtual models or physical hardware, the results are visible in near real-time via dashboards. Thanks to the company’s digital thread, any deviation from the customer’s requirements can be identified and addressed quickly. Scaling across the enterprise The Digital Pathfinder team is small, agile, and empowered to take leaps ahead in methods of testing and stressing the integrity of the digital thread. While its first tangible output was a set of wings and a new technology demonstrator, the important output was the building of a team that can now operate efficiently and effectively in the digital space and, most importantly, be exported and replicated across the enterprise to include current and future programs of all sizes. 'Digital Pathfinder enabled us to integrate and optimize our digital systems, boosting productivity and minimizing wasted time,' said Beaudin, adding that the digital readiness implementation team is now working with both capture and current programs to assess their ability to operate in a fully-connected digital ecosystem and helping them make the necessary changes to transition. 'The digital thread that is connecting our tools and the digital systems engineering process embedded in our models are scalable to large programs, and the lessons learned are going to pay huge dividends,' Beaudin said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-wings-of-the-m437-take-flight-after-being-developed-in-a-fully-connected-digital-ecosystem/	2024-10-21T05:28:22-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/Northrop-Scaled-Composites-M437.jpg
Industry looking for what’s next after Army’s cancelation of next-gen Patriot interceptor	A Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) missile is launched during a successful Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) flight test at White Sands Missile Range in 2021. (Darrell Ames/Army) AUSA 2024 — The US Army this week announced it was cancelling plans to develop a next-generation interceptor for the Patriot air defense system, but executives from key air defense competitors largely shrugged off the news to Breaking Defense. Maj. Gen. Frank Lozano, the Army’s program executive officer for missiles and space, on Monday announced the service's intent to walk away from the effort, called the Lower-Tier Future Interceptor (LTFI). Instead of buying a new interceptor, which Lozano called 'very expensive,' the Army will upgrade the PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement currently made by Lockheed Martin, he told Defense News. Lockheed had been preparing to compete for LTFI, and as of Tuesday afternoon, the Army had not yet informed the company of its specific path forward for future PAC-3 upgrades, said Tim Cahill, executive vice president of the company’s missiles and fire control business. However, the decision didn’t catch Lockheed 'flat footed,' as it typically invests in future capability enhancements on PAC-3 and has technology 'waiting in the wings,' he added. 'There's budget challenges, and so future programs are always going to face some level of uncertainty relative to whether they're going to go forward or exactly how they're going to go forward,' Cahill told Breaking Defense. While the Army has not laid out which technology upgrades it could seek to transfer from LTFI to future PAC-3 production, Cahill said the company typically pursues improvements to solid rocket motors, seeker technology and lightweight materials — all of which can extend the range of the missile or improve its ability to detect targets. Raytheon, the prime contractor for the overall Patriot system, had also been developing concepts for LTFI, but will lose little sleep over its cancellation, said Tom Laliberty, Raytheon’s president of Land &amp; Air Defense Systems. 'To be honest it doesn't really surprise me, only because funding has been — over the last several years — what I would call sort of conservative,' he said. Laliberty said Raytheon and other vendors likely had plans to test upgrades to existing weapon systems that could provide a cheaper way to do the mission LTFI was designed for. For example, in a recent demonstration in partnership with Northrop Grumman, the companies integrated Raytheon's Standard Missile 6 and Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor with Northrop's Integrated Battle Command System. 'We basically showed how effective SM-6 could be for a large portion of that threat set, that mission that potentially LTFI was also going to be addressing. So I don't know if that played into the decision, but my point is that there's other things out there,' he said. The Army’s senior leadership and program office made the decision to cancel LTFI after conducting a business case analysis of the effort, Lozano said in his interview with Defense News. He said the service would 'continue to advance' PAC-3 'so that it can remain relevant against the evolving threats,' but did not provide further information on the Army’s path forward.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/industry-looking-for-whats-next-after-armys-cancelation-of-next-gen-patriot-interceptor/	2024-10-18T11:45:39-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/pac-3-e1728400253523.jpg

New DoD space policy directive clarifies Space Force, Space Command roles	US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks (Photo by Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department today quietly published it's newest update to the document [PDF] that assigns roles and missions to both the Space Force chief and the commander of US Space Command, with language that should plump up each of their influence with respect to joint force activities. In particular, the new version of 'DoD Directive 3100.10' — dated Oct. 15 and signed by DoD Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks — for the first time codifies into Pentagon policy the three primary missions for which Space Force Guardians must be organized, trained and equipped to fulfill: The directive also officially establishes the assistant secretary of defense for space policy as the chair of the Space Warfighting Activities group. That group, stood up last September as a coordinating body, is described by the new directive as 'a forum to synchronize sensitive space activities with DoD strategic messaging, policy, and strategy.' 'DoD issuances generally aggregate and clarify signed guidance. As you know, this is a dynamic time for the space enterprise, and we are postured to continue to update our issuances as DoD policy evolution demands,' a DoD spokesperson told Breaking Defense today. The previous version of the directive was issued in August 2022. It replaced the 2016 version (itself an update of the original 2012 directive) to reflect the creation of SPACECOM and the Space Force, as well as the 2022 accord signed last year by SPACECOM and the National Reconnaissance Office regarding their roles in defense of the spy agency’s own satellites. DoDD 3100.10 is an internal Pentagon document, and as such it does not represent the end-all-be-all for DoD’s guidance in space. Different presidential administrations have promulgated other types of documents to guide DoD space policy over the years, in addition to National Space Strategy framework documents that capture the roles of other departments and agencies such as NASA. DoD policy is subordinate to any presidential policies and guidance. And yet, it serves as an important role, particularly when it comes to sorting out missions inside the department at a time when the demarcation lines between the Space Force and SPACECOM, as well as among the services, remain somewhat gray. The new directive for the first time includes a separate section on responsibilities of the chief of space operations (CSO), a job currently held by Gen. Chance Saltzman. The previous version included it within the responsibilities of the Air Force secretary. Besides establishing the Space Force's missions, it also puts into policy the CSO mandate as the 'integrator for DoD's Joint Space Requirements.' That role was first assigned to the Space Force chief in 2021 by the Joint Requirements Oversight Council, prompted by concerns about service coordination with regard to space under the Pentagon's ambitious Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept. The previous version of the DoD space policy directive laid out five distinct responsibilities for the SPACECOM commander, currently Space Force Gen. Stephen Whiting. The new versionincreases that total up to nine. The four new taskings are: Perhaps the most important change included in the new DoDD 3100.10 language is that SPACECOM is now empowered not just to synchronize the space operations of the other combatant commands, but also ensure the various regional commands are not duplicating or even canceling out each other's battlefield actions. The language is also notable for the specific reference to 'offensive' as well as 'defensive' operations — the word offensive is not included in the 2022 version.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/new-dod-space-policy-directive-clarifies-space-force-space-command-roles/	2024-10-18T09:17:34-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/GettyImages-2160730520-scaled-e1723040734514.jpg
NRO speeding contracting to support commercial partners	Troy Meink, National Reconnaissance Office principle deputy director. (Photo: Theresa Hitchens/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) has been moving to speed its processes for acquiring commercial imagery in order to help support a robust US industrial base, according to the spy satellite agency's deputy. 'We continue to enhance our internal processes to award contracts faster, which industry likes, and to create more opportunity and great engage with new industrial partners. We are willing to go big on investments where it makes sense for success. The electro-optical contract we ordered a couple years ago, which is about $4 billion over 10 years, is an example,' Troy Meink, NRO's principal deputy director, told the Mitchell Institute Thursday. 'That said, we've got to make ourselves even easier to do business with, and we do that by accelerating investment decisions, again, trying to accelerate the timelines to support what the commercial companies are trying to do, and by adopting a wide variety of risk management strategies that allow us to use industry partners that we may not been able to in the past,' he added. Meink explained that tapping commercial innovation — in remote sensing, in launch, in data processing and in artificial intelligence/machine learning — is critical to helping the NRO meet one of its key challenges: keeping up with the pace of technological change. '[G]iven the threats we face, how fast that threat is evolving, how fast the demands for capability that not only the NRO, but the entire space industry, is seeing, requires a rate of change that's really faster than maybe, almost since the beginning, when we were doing Corona and those sorts of things,' he said. The Corona program, initiated in 1958, was one of the very first US spy satellite programs. The remote sensing satellites carried cameras that took pictures over the Soviet Union, then dropped film canisters that were captured mid-air by a specialized US Air Force plane. Meink stressed, however, that keeping ahead of the tech curve, and being able to rapidly deliver new capability to users, is a 'whole of government' effort, involving Congress and the Department of Defense — especially with regard to speeding acquisition processes. 'That's where we spend a lot of our time, is just working across all the people that are involved in how we do acquisition, how we deliver capability, to constantly push on driving delivery of new capability,' he said. When asked by Breaking Defense about progress in resolving the ongoing interagency debate on acquisition authority for space-based commercial remote sensing, Meink skirted the question. Instead, he made it clear that NRO sees its own role as already fairly well defined, versus that of the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) — as well as the Space Force. 'I hate to say absolutes, right, because there are always exceptions to the rule. But in general, the NRO is responsible for procuring pixels. NGA is really looking at procuring analytics,' he said. 'Now, sometimes that does get blurred; there's no question about it, but that's fine. It should be, because in many cases, we're looking to different contractors. Some contractors do pixels, some do analytics. So, we work closely with NGA,' he added. 'But we do the pixels. They do the analytics.' While Meink didn't mention it, the Space Force also begun to buy the products derived from imagery analysis under its pilot Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Tracking (TacSRT) project. Just last month, Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman said the project had proved its value and that a next step is bolstering the budget — although he was very keen to clarify that the service is not treading on NRO's toes because it is not buying raw images. (He did not, however, reference NGA.) Further, US Space Command's Joint Commercial Operations (JCO) cell on Oct. 1 began expanding its remit from buying commercial space domain awareness data to include purchasing TacSRT data. The JCO director, Barbara Golf, has stressed that the cell is working closely with NGA to avoid duplicative data buys.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/nro-speeding-contracting-to-support-commercial-partners/	2024-10-18T08:23:15-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/IMG_2184-scaled-e1710791883564.jpeg
Lockheed anticipating Sentinel A4 full-rate production contract in coming months	Lockheed Martin is expected to go into full rate production of the the Sentinel A4 radar in mid-2025. (Photo provided by Lockheed Martin.) AUSA 2024 — Lockheed Martin is anticipating it will receive a request for proposals to advance the US Army’s Sentinel A4 radar into full rate production within the next six months, a company official told Breaking Defense. Chandra Marshall, vice president of radar and sensors systems at Lockheed, said today the RFP will follow the service’s recently approved justification and approval (J&amp;A) document being signed out. (A J&amp;A is an acquisition tool the Defense Department uses to explain and memorialize why certain contracts are awarded.) The Sentinel A4, which will replace Raytheon’s Sentinel A3, is a medium-range, air defense radar that uses active electronically scanned array (AESA) to track cruise missiles, unmanned aerial systems, helicopters, planes, rockets, and artillery and mortar threats. The Army is planning to purchase 240 radars for its program of record. Lockheed to date has delivered 10 units dedicated to government testing activities, and in July 2023 was awarded a low-rate initial production contract for 19 units, a portion of which are slated to be used for the defense of Guam, according to Marshall. The LRIP deliveries will start in the later half of 2025, she added. A full-rate production contract award signals that the Defense Department is satisfied with the radar’s performance and manufacturing methods, and gives Lockheed a green light to begin serial production. The radar is slated to be integrated with the Integrated Battle Command System, which represents the Army’s contribution to the Pentagon’s Joint All Domain Command and Control construct. Col. Jason Tate, the Army officer overseeing the program, told reporters last year during AUSA 2023 that the A4 is scheduled to reach initial operational capability in the fourth quarter of 2025. Tate and Marshall also said at the time that they had received expressions of interest from international customers in the radar. Marshall today re-iterated those expressions of interest but said no contracts had been signed yet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/lockheed-anticipating-sentinel-a4-full-rate-production-contract-in-coming-months/	2024-10-18T07:48:51-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/F1D8360_SM-e1729092425334.jpg
Army watercraft readiness precipitously declined over past 4 years: GAO	A 7th Transportation Brigade (Expeditionary) landing craft mechanized (LCM) transports a vehicle to the shore at Fort Story, Va., on Aug. 25.

Benjamin Parsons) AUSA 2024 — Readiness rates for the US Army's fleet of watercraft have steadily declined over the past four years, highlighting a significant weakness in the service’s ability to move personnel and equipment as it prepares for a fight in the Indo-Pacific, according to a new independent government audit. Army policies state that its equipment and assets, watercraft included, should aim for 90 percent of assets to be 'fully mission capable' — meaning they are prepared to execute their full range of missions at a moment’s notice. Not only is the Army failing at that target, its readiness rates dipped from from 75 percent in 2020 to less than 40 percent this year, the Government Accountability Office stated in its report, released today. 'Army officials stated that these low mission capable rates, along with the smaller size of the watercraft fleet after divestment, hinder operational readiness and the ability to meet mission requirements,' the GAO writes. The watchdog examined the service’s watercraft readiness at the behest of a congressional direction included the 2023 annual defense policy bill. Although the service told auditors that it is developing a watercraft modernization strategy aimed at projecting a future fleet in the 2030s and 2040s, GAO found it is 'unclear' what mitigation is in place in the meantime to improve the service’s readiness. 'Moreover, the Army has struggled to address a series of longstanding maintenance challenges with its watercraft fleet. Using handwritten systems to manage maintenance has adversely affected the fleet’s readiness,' the GAO report stated. 'For example, as of May 2024, one vessel had been out of service for over [five] years. Army officials reported several factors contributing to significant delays, including maintenance work.' As part of its report, GAO made four recommendations that focus on Army leadership in Washington as well as operational commanders in the Indo-Pacific taking a variety of action to mitigate the ongoing readiness issues. Responding on behalf of the service, Secretary Christine Wormuth concurred with GAO’s recommendations. A table from the GAO's report on Army watercraft shows the annual drop in mission capable rates. (GAO) The GAO’s report comes the same week that Army leadership at the annual AUSA exposition aggressively argued the service's importance to the Pentagon’s broader strategy for fighting in the Indo-Pacific — a place where watercraft and moving troops and equipment around in them will be integral to winning a future conflict. Gen. Charles Flynn, commander of US Army Pacific, told attendees at AUSA on Monday that the service is now making an effort to repair its watercraft forward, similar to how the Navy does ship repairs and maintenance in Japan. 'We’re trying to fix these watercraft forward in Japan, in the Philippines and Australia and Guam,' he said. 'We were bringing our watercraft all the way back to the continental United States, in some cases, on the west coast and through the Panama Canal for the East Coast, just to fix the watercraft.' 'Army watercraft is a system,' he continued. 'It’s tugs, it’s cranes, it’s connectors, it’s bridges. These systems, we have to have them forward, but we have to actually have them out in the Pacific operating.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/army-watercraft-readiness-precipitously-declined-over-past-4-years-gao/	2024-10-18T05:55:02-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/230130_DVIDS_LCM_2184553-scaled-e1675099483811.jpg

As the Defense Department pursues new ways to share data across echelons and security domains, the role of the 'connected warrior' continues to evolve from that of command-driven warfighters to warriors with access to relevant data that enables them to make informed, operational decisions in the absence of direct orders from command posts. Not an easy undertaking as doing so requires creating a base level for data security and management so communications and intelligence can be shared with maneuver forces to create a common operating picture (COP) of their individual battlespaces. 'Persistent issues seen across all levels include translating classified data for sharing among diverse services, organizations, and coalition partners,' said Chadwick Ford, team lead for Army Connected Battlespace Capabilities at Collins Aerospace. 'Managing data security across various levels and enclaves, alongside creating a unified COP and maintaining connectivity in degraded environments while on the move, remains a formidable challenge.' Chadwick Ford is team lead for Army Connected Battlespace capabilities at Collins Aerospace. It’s a challenge, though, that Collins Aerospace is actively addressing. Its execution of the connected warrior concept includes not only basic battlefield communication and movement, but an understanding of the broader operational situation and one's specific role is critical. In contested environments, it’s not about having constant connectivity but having timely access to relevant data for informed decision-making. 'The decentralized command structure of the United States military is a key strength,' said Ford. 'Whether leading a task force, air assault unit, or maneuver force, commanders wield authority within defined constraints, managing units effectively and maintaining connectivity, even without continuous communication with higher headquarters. 'Ultimately, connected warriors possess a deep understanding of their role within the operational context, enabling effective mission execution despite communication challenges. They're best suited for informing the capability testing we conduct in the theaters where they operate. They’re the driving force behind a lot of the work we do.' As an example of that, Collins recently partnered with the Army’s 1st Multi-Domain Task Force at U.S. INDOPACOM's Valiant Shield exercise to demonstrate the best way to enable a unit to take command and control (C2) capabilities from a fixed site and quickly integrate them onto a ground vehicle for more resilient, distributed C2. Access to a variety of intelligence sources was provided by commercial and military communications networks. Battle management software using artificial intelligence and machine learning 'made sense' of the data from various sources. That created fused situational awareness that was shared with bilateral and joint force partners. The mission command on-the-move capability significantly enhanced C2 operations by seamlessly integrating with networks such as the Integrated Tactical Network, Joint Fires Network, and commercial networks,' said Ford, noting that it facilitated quick transitions between fixed and mobile sites during multi-domain operations, enhancing both survivability and situational awareness. 'It is a roadmap for advancing the technology suite in successive large force exercise demonstrations that show how the capability can scale to connect more networks and provide joint and coalition forces with a more decisive edge in the early stages of a conflict.' From identifying issues to deploying solutions Developing a rapid transition between fixed and mobile sites during multi-domain operations extends far beyond the normal complexity of procurement and the standardization of equipment. Given the emerging role of AI, cloud computing, commercial 5G, and Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite communications capabilities, the aperture of today’s battlespace is being greatly widened and with it the need for clearly defined objectives and requirements. Tackling this challenge is not necessarily about building interfaces between systems. That’s part of the solution but it only addresses the hardware challenge. 'To effectively move from identifying problems to implementing solutions in the development of a COP, the DoD and its industrial partners must adopt a strategic approach,' said Ford. 'This begins with clearly defining operational objectives and requirements for the COP across all military echelons and domains. 'Close collaboration through joint working groups, consortia, and research agreements is essential to address specific COP challenges. Incentivizing innovation within the industrial base with grants, funding opportunities, and contracts focused on COP development promotes creative problem-solving and rapid prototyping.' That includes embracing agile development practices to quickly respond to evolving operational needs and technological advancements. Standardization also plays a role in interfaces and data formats that enable interoperability and information exchange for the real-time decision-making capabilities mentioned earlier. In addition, exercises like Valiant Shield and the Army’s Project Convergence play an important role in validating the effectiveness of COP solutions by providing critical feedback for further enhancement. It is through these strategies that the DoD and its industrial partners can progress from identifying issues to actively developing and deploying solutions that optimize COP across domains. The primary challenges in creating a unified and coordinated approach across the DoD lie in the scale of the task, the time required to implement the necessary changes to existing programs, and the prior investments made in stove–piped capabilities that now must become a node in Joint All Domain Command and Control, for example. Transitioning from identifying problems to implementing solutions represents an enormous challenge for the DoD and its industrial partners, calling as it does for a focused approach on standards for data and connectivity. Seamlessly harmonizing programs requires connectivity across various platforms, be they mounted, dismounted, crewed or uncrewed. Resolving these issues will require a phased approach and a commitment of time to implement comprehensive solutions. 'It’s analogous to not having Apple CarPlay in your car,' said Ford. 'Without it, connecting to Apple CarPlay becomes nearly impossible without resorting to expensive aftermarket solutions, which may not guarantee success.' It’s clear that providing soldiers with a common operating picture will help them function independently and execute commander’s intent when communications are contested. 'These are complex problems we are solving, and it takes partnership between DoD and industry to solve them, and incentivizing innovation within the industrial base with grants, funding opportunities, and contracts focused on COP development. That promotes creative problem-solving and rapid prototyping,' said Ford.' In the reach toward a common operating picture, questions such as: how data is transformed into intelligence; how it’s protected and shared; and how decisions are made and by whom and at what speed, become crucial to the transformative journey that the DoD must take to counter great-power adversaries. While pilot programs and demonstrations provide the necessary feedback for operational and technological advancements, connectivity and interoperability ultimately succeed or fail in the theater of operations. In the military context, there are evident issues with connection, data flow, and information exchange across services, complicating effective communication even within the same service echelons. While the technology exists, the scale of the challenge necessitates concerted effort, resources, and funding from multiple individuals and service branches. 'Integration is crucial,' notes Ford. 'A focused approach on standards for data and connectivity is essential to harmonize programs seamlessly. Depending solely on a single program manager is impractical, particularly across diverse military branches. 'Addressing this challenge is undeniably formidable, but it requires incentivizing individuals and organizations to collaborate and innovate towards solutions. Without such collective motivation, this connectivity issue will persist indefinitely.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/the-connected-warrior-will-have-a-common-operating-picture-even-when-contested/	2024-10-18T05:24:33-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/DOD.mil-image-Collins-240913-A-VS161-2582M-scaled.jpg
Commerce Department eases export controls on satellites, including for remote sensing	Northrop Grumman SpaceLogistics MEV-1 On-Orbit Servicing Satellite (Northrop Grumman image) WASHINGTON — The Commerce Department today announced a tripartite set of export reform rules for a variety of commercial space technologies — including the removal of licensing restrictions on sales of remote sensing satellites and on-orbit servicing platforms to Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. A senior Commerce official emphasized that 'this isn't just a regulatory update' in a background briefing with reporters today. 'This is about maintaining our leadership in space technology, protecting our national security and bolstering our partnerships around the world.' The export control changes also will bolster national security, allowing the Defense Department to more easily cooperate with allies and partners to implement its ambitious plans to create a 'hybrid space architecture' that would enable commercial and friendly government satellites to augment US military space capabilities. 'The three new rules &#8230; recalibrate our approach to export controls. They're easing restrictions on some of the less sensitive space related technologies and on spacecraft related items going to our closest allies, like Australia, Canada and the UK. These changes will offer relief to US companies and they'll increase innovation without compromising the critical technologies that keep our nation safe,' the Commerce official said. The first rule removes 'licensing requirements' remote sensing satellites carrying electro-optical cameras and radars, as well as satellite systems 'providing space based logistics, assembly or servicing spacecraft that are destined for Australia, Canada and the UK,' the official said. The second change removes license requirements for exports of 'certain spacecraft components to over 40 allies and partners across the globe' — for example, including members of NATO and the European Union — easing exports of 'the least sensitive components for most destinations, and broadening license exceptions,' the official explained. A key goal of this change is to bolster and broaden NASA cooperative programs. Finally, the official said, third rule change is still in the proposal stage and is being published alongside a corresponding State Department export reform proposal in the Federal Register for public comment through Nov. 22. The changes imposed by the third rule would 'transfer jurisdiction of certain space-related defense articles that no longer provide a critical military or intelligence advantage' from the US Munitions List, embodied in the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) managed by the State Department, to the Commercial Control List, managed by the Commerce Department via the less restrictive Export Administration Regulations (EAR). The proposed list shift is designed 'to account for advances in technology and the changing operational environment and to facilitate international cooperation and commercial space activities while continuing to protect our national security and foreign policy interests,' the official aid. Some examples of things that would be moved from the Munitions List include 'spacecraft that conduct collision avoidance, spacecraft that perform cooperative docking or grappling, and spacecraft for autonomous detection and tracking a ground vehicles and aircraft,' the official said. Commerce and the State Department back in 2019 published advanced notices of proposed rulemaking on plans for licensing reform, seeking industry input. Last December the National Space Council tasked Commerce and State to reform space export controls. Chirag Parikh, executive secretary of the National Space Council, told the annual Space Foundation Space Symposium on April 9 that the changes were needed because the last round of reforms took place more than decade ago and technology, all around the world, has since rapidly evolved. 'With today's updates to our export controls, the United States is taking a bold step forward in fostering a strong space industrial base,' he said in a statement today. 'These changes will strengthen international alliances and reflect America’s commitment to innovation and leadership in space.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/commerce-department-eases-export-controls-on-satellites-including-for-remote-sensing/	2024-10-17T14:35:41-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/10/SpaceLogisticsMEV-1-e1668472106987.jpg

Australian Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg on domestic weapons production and new vehicles	An armed reconnaissance &#8216;Tiger' helicopter from the 1st Aviation Regiment fires a Hellfire missile during Indo-Pacific Endeavour 2022. (Australian Ministry of Defence) WASHINGTON — America's largest defense conference, the annual gathering of the Association of the US Army, brings in a reliable international presence for the conference, including a sizeable contingent from Australia. Among the top officials making the trip to Washington for the conference was Australian Army Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg, the service's head of Land Capability, a role that sees him provide acquisition requirements for the service. Vagg, who was the top military officer on Australia's recent Defense Strategic Review, talked with Breaking Defense on the sidelines of the conference. Among the topics discussed: lessons of Ukrainian artillery, Boxer troop carrier production, the future of the Tiger ARH helicopter, the new Redback Infantry Fighting Vehicle and more. The interview has been edited for length and clarity. Breaking Defense: Let's start with Boxer. How is that program progressing? MAJ. GEN. RICHARD VAGG: As you know, we've got our Block One vehicles in service now. We took delivery of the first Australian-built Boxer in July and we are working with the company (Rheinmetall Defense Australia) to work out what the drum beat of vehicles is going to be. &#8230; We're expecting to receive the Boxer between now and 2028, 2029, over that period. 211 vehicles in total will be our Boxer fleet. Plus the 100 vehicles that we're doing the government-to-government deal back into Germany with. [Australia is also building 100 Boxers to be exported to Germany.] How many are you expecting to have by the end of the year? I'm not sure at this stage. Are you comfortable with everything being on track with Initial Operating Capability and Full Operating Capability? I'm comfortable. We know we've got a really good capability. What about the Redback Infantry Fighting Vehicles, made by Hanwha in Australia. I know it's still early days, but how are you feeling about that? Any hiccups you're seeing early? No, we're really pleased, actually, with the relationship that we've developed with Hanwha &#8230; You know, they've recently opened what's called the Hanwha Armored Center of Excellence down in Geelong. That was opened ahead of time, below budget. So all the indicators are there — like the facilities and building a factory is generally pretty difficult. So, enjoying working with Hanwha and they've really established themselves in Australia. How's that relationship developing? Hanwha has just kind of blown up the last couple of years in Australia, in a good way. It's been a really good relationship. It's early days, yeah, so I don't want to sit here and say it's [always] going to be awesome, but all the indicators are really positive &#8230; What we hope is that actually establishes an ability to build an export base from Australia. If Hanwha can manage that, that would be really powerful. What's the plan for aviation as you bring down the the Tiger ARH helicopters? As you may well know, we're replacing our Tiger fleet with AH-64 Apaches. So we expect to receive our first Apaches by Q4 next year. We'll manage the phase out of the ARH capability Tiger with the introduction in the service of the Apaches. It's important that we maintain that capability, and the way we'll do that is, we currently have our attack aviation capability in Darwin. Apache will be delivered into Townsvile. So one aviation regiment will move from Darwin to Townsville, and as we introduce Apache, work up to an IOC capability, we'll close down Darwin and the capability with Tiger. What happens then to the Tigers? We will provide options for government in terms of what they want us to do with Tiger, when it comes out of service — everything from contributing to the global supply fleet, there may be gifting options there. It's probably too early to tell at this stage, and that'll be a government decision. Is there any military value in mothballing them, or does that just not make any sense for you? Cost of ownership becomes problematic for us. It's a really technical airframe here. It's effectively, I don't think it's the technical term, but it's like software defined radios. It's a software defined air system. It's not something you just lock in the shed and then roll it out at a later date. Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg spoke with Breaking Defense during the 2024 AUSA conference. (Australian Army) You're an artillery guy by training. Are there lessons that are coming out of Ukraine and to a lesser extent Gaza that you feel are being successfully incorporated into your planning, or is there not as much relevance to those takeaways, because it's such a different situation in Australia? There's some really strong lessons that are coming out of out of all those theaters you've mentioned. And I think it underpins that what characterizes war, it's a battle of will and magic bullets don't exist. There is certainly a need for precision and really high-end weapon systems, but there's also a need for mass, relatively inexpensive weapon systems. A few years ago, people were starting to draw down their stocks. Now you can't buy 155 [shells] in the world, and we can't produce enough 155s. You can't produce enough propellant or explosive fill for those types of systems now. So I think some of those hard learned lessons from last conflicts are definitely coming forward in terms of us drawing those lessons into our theater, the Indo-Pacific, of what it means for us. We as an army, need to be prepared to conduct close combat. And we need to have all the capabilities that come with close combat. You mentioned 155s. How important is it for Australia to get a domestic capability for insensitive explosives? I think our government's been really clear. You just look at the investment they put into guided weapons and explosive ordnance in Australia. Air Marshal Leon Phillips is the chief of our Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordinance, very active in terms of establishing domestic capabilities. And look at some of the announcements that have been made recently in terms of the domestic production of NSM in Australia. I know we're looking at 155; it'll be crawl, walk, run. I don't need to say it's important — I think the government's actions, the amount of money and effort they've invested in that area makes that pretty clear. What about solid rocket motor production? Again, that's part of that ecosystem the GWEO group is starting to develop. We know some of the rate limiting factors to some of our long-range strike capabilities is access to motors. So that's something you think is important to have domestic production of? Bloody oath it does. And I think there's an active request for information with industry in terms of that capability being introduced into Australia, and how industry will go about dealing with that. Obviously, AUKUS is the biggest military modernization effort facing Australia. Are you at all concerned or seeing signs at all that some land projects or land modernization efforts might get delayed, pushed back, underfunded because that money is needed to go towards AUKUS instead? No, and I'm cautious in doing that. Our National Defense Strategy and our Integrated Investment Program have looked across our force structure and have prioritized capabilities and investment in capabilities to have an integrated force, and we're quite clear about not having an overly weighted force in one area. It's about an integrated force, and an integrated force is one where the five domains are thought about and integrated before they hit the objective. An integrated force is about combining and integrating those effects well before the objective, and much like a stool, once you remove one of those legs, it becomes uneven and wobbly. So, probably a long explanation, but you know, we've made some very, very considered decisions about our investment plans from a ADF perspective, and are quite comfortable where we're sitting in terms of our land projects.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/10/australian-maj-gen-richard-vagg-on-domestic-weapons-production-and-new-vehicles/	2024-10-17T13:47:53-07:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/arh_tiger-e1729194090907.jpg
