USMC to add upgraded autonomy navigation suite into ROGUE Fires program	US Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Cade Heller, an artillery cannoneer with Fox Battery, 2nd Battalion, 11th Marine Regiment, 1st Marine Division, prepares a Navy/Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System to be fired at Naval Air Station Point Mugu, California, June 27, 2023. (USMC/ Cpl. Earik Barton) WASHINGTON — The US Marine Corps is going forward with a plan to put more robust autonomous navigation on Joint Light Tactical Vehicles that are the basis for an unmanned mobile, anti-ship weapon system, according to the vehicle manufacturer. 'By seamlessly integrating cutting-edge autonomous technologies with Oshkosh systems, we’re equipping the Marine Corps to strengthen sea denial capabilities, enhance operational agility, and maintain a decisive technological edge against evolving threats,' said Pat Williams, chief programs officer at Oshkosh Defense. Oshkosh is under contract to produce Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE Fires) for the service. That weapon integrates the Navy Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) — a mountable, ground-based anti-ship missile launcher with two Naval Strike Missiles — onto the JLTV chassis. The new development involves a $30 million investment by the Marines into putting autonomous navigation in the form of tech firm Fonterra's AutoDrive system into the vehicles, rather than have them navigating via teleoperations or a leader-follower set up. 'Fielding self-driving ground autonomy on ROGUE-Fires is crucial to the Marines’ modernization plans…that will reduce casualties and improve our warfighters’ ability to fight and win,' said Christian Seifert, Head of Robotic Missile Systems at Forterra. The two companies didn’t detail a precise plan for integration and testing the enhanced capability on ROGUE Fires, but Williams said the company anticipates that it will begin delivering the 48 vehicles this June. As the USMC looks to rapidly develop and field a new autonomous launcher suitable for the Indo-Pacific region, the Army too is working on a number of systems including the Autonomous Multi-domain Launcher. It is also developing a fifth Precision Strike Missile (PrSM) for an autonomous launcher to hit targets beyond 1,000 km. The director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team, Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks, explained in December 2024, that initial work on a fifth PrSM increment is underway, and a science and technology development initiative will kick-off in fiscal 2026. The idea, he added, is to design a missile that can be fired from an autonomous vehicle. 'If you’re familiar with an [M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System] MLRS pod, it’s about 13-feet long,' the one-star general told the audience. 'If you have something without a cab, that’s autonomous, you might be able to employ something longer than that.' 'We’re in the science and technology phase of something that we’ll maybe, eventually call Increment 5,' Crooks added. 'You might be able to employ something that’s actually longer … and you might be able to achieve ranges that, right now, don’t seem realistic.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/usmc-to-add-upgraded-autonomy-navigation-suite-into-rogue-fires-program/	2025-01-13T09:46:51-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/ROGUE-1-e1736788307127.jpg
Textron unveils new family of USVs dubbed Tsunami	Textron Systems worked with the Brunswick Corp. to design and produce a new family of vehicles it is calling Tsunami. (Photo provided by Textron Systems.) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — Textron Systems announced today it is unveiling a new family of autonomous maritime surface vessels, dubbed Tsunami, setting its sights on providing the kinds of low cost, multi-mission assets that the Pentagon in recent years has been seeking out. 'We look out across the market and evaluate our customers' emerging needs,' David Phillips, a company executive, told reporters last week. 'We continue discussions with the Navy … and we’ve been hearing an increased expression of interest in a small, rapidly deployable unmanned surface vehicle that can support a variety of missions beyond mine countermeasures.' Phillips declined to name any specific contract opportunity the company was seeking in the near term through the new product line. The family of vehicles include 24-, 25- and 28-foot variants that provide a payload capacity of up to 1,000 pounds and ranges between 600 and 1,000 nautical miles, according to a company statement. The USVs can also operate in up to sea state 4 conditions. (Sea states are a universally recognized measurement of ocean surface conditions, ranging from 0 to 9, with smaller numbers representing calmer weather and higher numbers indicating larger and more violent waves.) Textron designed the new USVs in conjunction with the Illinois-based Brunswick Corp. When the US Navy began more aggressively pushing unmanned systems into its fleet starting in fiscal 2020, Textron’s 'Common Unmanned Surface Vehicle' played an integral role in the testing for a key mine countermeasures program. Although a production contract for the USV the Navy plans to use was ultimately awarded to Bollinger Shipyards. The advent of Textron’s new USVs follows a series of similar product launches that have cropped up from companies such as Saronic. As a whole, the Navy’s operational forces have been eager to use and test commercially available unmanned systems when it makes sense — Saildrone has sailed its USVs in support of US 4th Fleet off the coast of South America and US 5th Fleet in the Middle East for the service's experimental tech office Task Force 59. Meanwhile, the Navy is building its own repertoire of unique unmanned vehicles that suit its needs through programs like the Extra Large Unmanned Undersea Vehicle awarded to Boeing and the small UUV, dubbed Lionfish, a program awarded to HII. The enthusiasm for such vessels isn't limited to the United States, either. Breaking Defense reported in November that France's Naval Group, a key contractor for the French Navy and the country's national shipbuilder, had unveiled its first ever USV, which it calls 'Seaquest.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/textron-unveils-new-family-of-usvs-dubbed-tsunami/	2025-01-13T08:57:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/TSUNAMI_Media-Kit_3-scaled-e1736784227141.jpg
South American nations add ‘upgrading air forces’ to 2025 resolutions	Members of the Argentine delegation including Defense Minister Luis Alfonso Petri (3rd R) hold their national flag as they pose in front of a F-16 fighter during a press event of the sidelines of an agreement signing on the purchase of Danish F-16 aircraft at Skrydstrup Air Base, Denmark, on April 16, 2024. (Photo by BO AMSTRUP/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — In late December, the first F-16 Block 10 aircraft for Argentina’s Air Force arrived in the country in what Minister of Defense Luis Petri hailed as the 'most important' acquisition since the nation’s 'return to democracy' in 1982. The South American nation has operated without a primary combat aircraft for almost a decade, but now, after many negotiations and false starts, Buenos Aires has received the first of 25 F-16s (including one training aircraft) previously operated by the Danish Air Force. The price tag for the contract is around $300 million, aided by some $40 million in Foreign Military Financing by the US. Just weeks before, Saab-made Gripens belonging to the Brazilian Air Force (FAB) made their international exercise debut at Brazil-led CRUZEX 2024, two years after the Swedish fighters officially joined the force. Argentina and Brazil are not alone in their pursuit of more capable combat aircraft, as nations like Peru and Uruguay have either signed or are pondering new deals recently. But this is no aerial arms race in South America, which hasn’t seen an inter-state war since 1995. Rather it's a race mainly against obsolescence, according to experts, and, for any nation not named Brazil, a race constrained by tight defense budgets. Regional air forces 'need to modernize their inventories and also train their personnel to operate newer technologies,' but only 'within the economic possibilities of each country,' Argentinian retired Brig. Gen. Jorge Antelo explained to Breaking Defense. Though the threat of war is low, the aircraft still function as deterrents, and for aiding counter-drug operations. Andre Carvalho, a PhD researcher at the Brazilian Army Command and General Staff College, said that combat aircraft 'are a great symbol of a State’s hard power and underscores a government’s commitment to defending the country’s sovereignty.' The first F-16 received by Argentina, the trainer aircraft, has already been well received by the air force there, according to Andrei Serbin Pont, an analyst and director of the Argentine research center CRIES. The plane 'gives the service an idea of the status of the rest of the fleet,' he said. Also in December, Argentina signed a Letter of Agreement with the US for advanced American equipment to go on the new fighter jets. Antelo, who recently served as Argentina's secretary of national strategy, told Breaking Defense the deals signaled a technological milestone for the military. But Serbin Pont noted the F-16s won’t be able to solve all of Argentina’s air force woes. The force still operates the Douglas A-4 Skyhawk which Serbin Pont says aren’t flying and have 'no role' in current operations. Argentina also flies its domestically made IA-63 Pampa light attack aircraft and combat aircraft. The local manufacturer of the Pampa, FADEA, is developing a new version of the light attack aircraft Pucará, called Pucará Fénix, Serbin Pont explained. However, the new version remains at the prototype level. Meanwhile, Brazil is contending with a similar situation: It’s in the process of acquiring a large fleet of Gripens but still needs to upgrade older companion aircraft. 'The fleet of Gripens is not enough to replace the aging number of F-5s and A-1s,' Serbin Pont said, referring to the light attack American F-5EM and the Brazilian-Italian AMX A1. Brasilia is reportedly upgrading its indigenous A-29 Super Tucano light attack aircraft to operate with the Gripen, but Carlos Eduardo Valle Rosa, a colonel in the Brazilian air force reserve, said studies are underway to determine the best way to replace the F-5 and A-1. Beyond Argentina and Brazil, some smaller South American nations are also eyeing what could be pricey upgrades, if they can afford it. Peru currently flies Dassault Mirage 2000 warplanes, but those were originally purchased in the 1980s, as well as Russian-made Sukhoi Su-25s controversially bought secondhand via Belarus in the 1990s. In October this year, the head of the Peruvian Air Force, Gen. Carlos Enrique Chávez Cateriano, said he wants his nation to buy a fleet of 24 multi-role aircraft 'to protect the sovereignty and integrity of our country for the next 30-40 years.' (Lima also purchased from Belarus a fleet of Mig-29s, however they appear to not be operational) Media reports suggest some major players have lined up in hopes of supplying Lima with new aircraft, including Lockheed Martin with its F-16, Saab with the Gripen, Dassault with the Rafale and South Korean company Korea Aerospace Industries with its FA-50 and KF-21. Peru’s neighbor to the north, Colombia, has also signaled its interest in updating its airframes, which currently consist of four-decade-old Israeli Kfirs. Geopolitics has intruded on that particular prospect, as Bogota has broken off relations with Israel over its conduct in Gaza. Both Peru and Colombia, Valle Rosa said, are keen to maintain an effective air force in part 'to address historical border issues,' likely a reference to historical tensions between Peru and Chile, and Colombia and Venezuela. Two other South American nations signed deals for new combat aircraft in 2024: Paraguay and Uruguay, though with much smaller price tags. In those cases, each country agreed to buy six Super Tucanos from Brazil’s Embraer. As it is, Uruguay operates a small fleet of aging A-37B Dragonfly aircraft as its only combat platform. Valle Rosa said the choice to go with the Super Tucano 'was Montevideo’s decision to maintain the service’s operational capabilities, particularly for aerial patrol missions.' The Uruguayan media has put the contract at $100 million. Paraguay has no current combat aircraft, making its acquisition particularly momentous. The cost will be similar to the Uruguayan deal, around $96 million, the Paraguayan Minister of Defense Óscar González said in an interview. Valle Rosa noted that despite interest in new aircraft from several nations, and the lack of inter-state conflict in recent history, South American nations have been hampered in the realm of defense acquisition by the lack of defense cooperation like that seen in Europe’s joint production of the Eurofighter Typhoon — as ponderous as those kinds of joint programs can be. In his view, the different acquisition priorities, budget limitations, geopolitical ambitions, and outstanding border tensions likely mean that South American air forces will continue to fly solo and, outside of Embraer, rely on extra-regional suppliers.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/south-american-nations-add-upgrading-air-forces-to-2025-resolutions/	2025-01-13T05:59:43-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/240424_argentina_f16s_denmark_GettyImages-2147852092-scaled-e1713972993821.jpg
New ways to communicate from ground to space and across domains	Today's threat scenarios require battle-proven, highly reliable systems such as multi-band, secure anti-jam voice, data imagery transmission, and network-capable communications. (Illustration courtesy of BAE Systems) Key communications requirements from the Defense Department include resilience in contested radio frequency environments, distributed connectivity across platforms and domains, enhanced security, and rapid upgradability. BAE Systems has demonstrated novel capabilities in these areas to include a software-based waveform for land-to-space communications and sharing of electronic warfare data across tactical datalinks. Breaking Defense talked with Amber Dolan, product line director for Adaptive Communications and Sensing at BAE Systems, about the challenges and complexities of fielding new capabilities on existing platforms and across multiple domains. Breaking Defense: What are the threat scenarios that necessitate next-generation communications for terrestrial and space applications? Amber Dolan is product line director for Adaptive Communications and Sensing at BAE Systems. Amber Dolan: The threats continue to become more capable, and they're spread out over broader geographies and reach longer distances. They have expanded from physical threats into aspects that attempt to disrupt our ability to communicate. Warfighters need to stay connected and share a significant amount of critical information in real time across different types of networks and multiple domains. When I say domains, I mean two things. The physical domains: sea, land, air, space, and cyber. And security domains: sharing data in such a way that they can securely pass and receive information even in contested and congested environments. These scenarios require battle-proven, highly reliable systems such as multi-band, secure anti-jam voice, data imagery transmission, and network-capable communications. What is the demand signal from the DoD in this respect? What are they asking for? Summing it up into themes: resilience, distributed, secure, and rapidly upgradable. Resilience is the ability to adapt and stay connected to provide persistent communications in harsh conditions. One example of adding resilience is integrating anti-jam capabilities into the systems. Regarding distributed, the DoD is looking for solutions for multi-domain operations and the ability to connect across heterogeneous platforms and different physical domains. There is a continued emphasis on crypto modernization and enhancing our secure communications – protecting our data from adversaries. Our customers depend on our products to be their eyes and ears. This goes along with the theme of upgradable. Our systems need to be able to adapt to the evolving threats and rapidly incorporate software and firmware updates, preferably in the field. With your iPhone, for example, you want to update your operating system in real time as soon as an upgrade is available. You don't want to send it back to the store every time there is a change or a new feature. The DoD is also looking for multi-functionality within a software-defined radio that can be reconfigured within a mission or over its lifecycle. Any time we can upgrade a capability or integrate a new one in the field versus having to send a system back – if it's a software-firmware only update rather than requiring a change of hardware – it’s much more efficient and lower cost. That’s what customers are looking for in our software-defined radio and comms solutions – flexibility, cost, speed, and interoperability. Describe the work you’re doing on new solutions with small form factor and multi-function capabilities. How are you demonstrating some of these? Small form factor has a key role in the DoD’s kill chain strategy and their affordable mass goals, and we leverage our software-defined radio designs to be a key enabler here, getting mission-critical information to the warfighter faster. One example of this is our small-form-factor FireNet radio which supports full Link 16 connectivity. It’s a scaled down version of our legacy Link 16 radios and leverages common hardware from our prior radios. This allows us to integrate some of our proven, advanced features from those systems onto FireNet. An open architecture allows for future upgrades, as well, and FireNet also addresses critical SWaP-C demands that we're seeing on current and future platforms. We recently completed a demonstration in our System Integration Lab sharing EW information over Link 16. This customized mission technology can be used on a smaller UAS-type platform. This highlighted our multi-function capability – integrating it in a scalable multi-function processor and distributing that information over one of our legacy datalinks. BAE Systems is also demonstrating the latest state-of-the-art software-based waveforms capable of communicating from land to space and back. The significance of this is increased resiliency for the warfighter. Many of our waveforms are developed with a combination of software, firmware, and hardware. Since this is a software-only based waveform, configured and developed quite rapidly, we’ve been able to integrate and test it quickly to meet mission needs. What are the challenges associated with accomplishing what you’ve described? If you think about developing and integrating new capabilities on a platform, it's not about just providing products that can meet a mission. You've also got to think about the requirements of that platform. What kind of apertures are available on the platform? What does the lifecycle sustainment look like? Can I easily provide upgrades and sustain it and adapt it for future missions, environments, or needs? Regarding the warfighter mission, we want to be able to distribute our solutions on as many platforms as possible. The affordability piece of that is key. For the smaller, unmanned platforms, we can put many more of those into operation and get that capability dispersed that much more efficiently. We've got to have systems that are scalable and can fit on smaller, distributed platforms. Another area is the need to get upgraded performance out there and installed on platforms at the pace requested by our warfighters. There's a long effort after development to get it qualified, fielded, and integrated on a platform. We have a significant install base and have delivered over 100,000 radio systems globally for the U.S. and coalition forces. Our focus is to leverage that existing footprint to make updates to provide additional capabilities versus introducing new systems. An example of that is the Link 16 waveform I’ve mentioned that’s already widely fielded and used broadly on many different platforms. We’re making enhancements to that particular waveform, providing new features with software and firmware versus introducing brand new hardware, or a new waveform that needs new apertures and takes decades to get developed and fielded. Describe the BAE Systems technology that is part of these modernization efforts. The work we're doing involves upgrades to tactical datalinks, and multifunction capabilities that are fusing comms, electronic warfare, and signals intelligence, and allowing for rapid fielding, lifecycle extension, and accelerating the kill chain. Comms is a critical element of that, and some of the systems that we are modernizing include our MIDS JTRS (Multifunctional Information Distribution System &#8211; Joint Tactical Radio System) radios. They provide common communication across multiple platforms and can provide secure gateways through contested scenarios. We're also developing software-defined radios for the AHFRM (Airborne High Frequency Radio Modernization) program, which provides a secure alternative for satellite communications. Our Network Tactical Common Data Links support situational awareness and multiple simultaneous networked operations. We also have our ARC family of radios. The AN/ARC-231A radios mainly for rotary platforms enable sharing of mission-critical information with the latest secure waveform, which can be tailored per mission. The ARC-232A radio provides the SATURN waveform for the Republic of Korea. SATURN is the Second-generation Anti-jam Tactical UHF Radio for NATO. Tell us about your radiation-hardened solutions and how those techniques can help bring new capabilities to space communications. BAE Systems has been providing radiation-hardened electronics for more than 50 years for civil, commercial, and national-security space missions. More recently, customers have been seeking rad-tolerant solutions for low-Earth orbit. To meet the customer need, we have adapted technologies and processes with size, weight, power, and cost at the forefront. This allows the technology developed for rad-hard applications to be used and applied to lower-cost, rad-tolerant capabilities. Compared to rad-hardened, this eases requirements on the type of hardware that you need and the environment that it needs to be able to work in. Our objective is to provide solutions that can provide multi-band global communications access, and persistent encrypted connectivity for our warfighters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/new-ways-to-communicate-from-ground-to-space-and-across-domains/	2025-01-13T05:41:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Featured.jpg
Amphib suppliers say multi-ship buy will yield ‘immediate benefits’ in coming year	The amphibious ship Bougainville (LHA-8) under construction at Ingalls Shipbuilding. (Photo courtesy of HII.) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — An industry group representing 650 companies supplying parts for the US Navy’s amphibious warships says more than half of its members expect the recent multi-ship buy will lead to 'immediate benefits' starting in 2025 or 2026. The service in September announced it was awarding contracts to HII valued at $9.4 billion for three San Antonio-class (LPD) ships and one America-class (LHA) vessel, a deal that had been years in the making and particularly popular among Navy hawks on Capitol Hill. 'The amphibious warship bundle buy of three LPDs and one LHA will drive a considerable increase in efficiency across the amphibious warship industrial base and includes $1 billion in potential savings for American taxpayers,' the group said in a statement. 'Additionally, savings incurred by the industrial base help combat the top challenges suppliers consistently face.' According to a summary of the survey results, which AWIBC provided to Breaking Defense, 46 percent of respondents indicated the deal will improve their companies’ hiring, retention and training efforts and 42 percent said the deal would help to 'invest in equipment to ensure quality and on-time delivery.' The summary’s sample group included 219 respondents. Breaking Defense reported in September the multi-ship buy will include LPD-33, LPD-34 and LPD-35 as well as LHA-10. Collectively, the ships 'support amphibious assault, special operations and expeditionary warfare of US Marines, moving Marines into theater and supporting humanitarian and contingency missions on short notice,' according to a description included in a letter Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro sent to lawmakers. Under multi-ship buys, like the one the Navy awarded to HII in September, the service and industry agree on the prices of multiple ships years in advance and within the same contractual agreement. For the Navy, this usually nets significant price savings by effectively purchasing materials in bulk. For industry, the deals provide the project stability that shipbuilding executives frequently ask both Congress and the Defense Department to provide.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/amphib-suppliers-say-multi-ship-buy-will-yield-immediate-benefits-in-coming-year/	2025-01-10T13:10:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/LHA-8-underconstruction-at-Ingalls-e1724335565226.jpg
After delays, Digital Bloodhound contract goes to MTSI for $640 million	Global data communication network around planet Earth viewed from space with connected grid technology for Internet of Things (IoT), cryptocurrency blockchain, mobile web or cyberspace, map from NASA (Getty images) WASHINGTON — After multiple delays, the long-awaited award for the Digital Bloodhound program, a suite of capabilities aimed at improving detection of cyber threats to space ground systems, was awarded to Modern Technology Solutions, Inc (MTSI). Under the contract, valued at $640 million, MTSI will provide Space Systems Command (SSC) with Digital Bloodhound as part of the service's Defense Cyber Operations for Space mission, which works to protect against various types of unauthorized intrusion, corruption and destruction of the Space Force's networks, according to a company announcement released on Thursday. 'The Digital Bloodhound award selection is a significant step forward for MTSI in providing engineering, test, and sustainment leadership and best-value solutions in the space domain in support of the warfighter,' MTSI President and CEO Kevin Robinson said in the release. Under the contract, which is one-year base term and four option years award, MTSI is required to provide 'integrated program management, software development and deployment, mission/field deployment and sustainment, and cloud services support to enhance defensive cyber capabilities and mitigate cybersecurity risk across the USSF.' 'Defensive Cyber Operations is an incredibly dynamic, challenging, and important mission, and as a company that owns and solves our customers’ toughest problems, we look forward to a partnership with SSC and Delta 6 cyber operators to rapidly provide and upgrade capabilities to outpace threats,' MTSI’s Digital Bloodhound Program Manager James MacFarlane said in the release. The single contract award was initially set to be announced in June 2023 but was delayed twice, Breaking Defense previously reported. The Space Force did not respond to a request for comment regarding the reason for the delay. The contract is seemingly worth less than originally planned. Col. Bryon McClain, head of SSC’s Space Domain Awareness and Combat Power Program Executive Office, announced at the end of 2023 that a contract for Digital Bloodhound was worth up to approximately $750 million. MTSI has previously won contracts with the Space Force and the Missile Defense Agency, with the Space Force contract being part of a joint contract with a dozen other companies worth up to $2.5 billion for the Hemisphere program supporting SSC's Space Domain Awareness and Combat Power and Battle Management, Command, Control, and Communications programs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/after-delays-digital-bloodhound-contract-goes-to-mtsi-for-640-million/	2025-01-10T12:32:10-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_satellite_network_earth_GettyImages-1202911413-scaled-e1682623891888.jpg
Words matter, and other advice for Trump’s incoming team from Pentagon’s No. 2	Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen H. Hicks enters the naming ceremony for the future submarine USS Baltimore while aboard the USS Constellation in Baltimore, Md. Sept. 20, 2024. (DoD photo by EJ Hersom) 'The PRC [People’s Republic of China] is the only nation with the will and increasingly the wherewithal to remake the international order by combining its economic, diplomatic, technological, and military capabilities to challenge the stable, open international system that’s done so much for so many for so long,' Hick’s told an audience at a Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies event. 'We must be forthright about how advanced the PRC’s military has become, then do our utmost to out-think, out-maneuver, and out-strategize them: to prevent war if we can, by being able to prevail in a war if we must,' she said later. Hicks has spent her tenure as the Pentagon’s number two civilian, in part, focused on shoring up the defense industrial base and expanding the US foothold inside the Indo-Pacific region. That has included her signature Replicator initiative designed to counter China’s military mass by cranking out multiple thousands of 'attritable autonomous systems' within two years — think unmanned surface vessels and loitering drones. Under the Biden administration, the US joined forces with Australia and the United Kingdom for a new trilateral security partnership dubbed AUKUS, while also inking co-production deals with several nations including India and Australia. When it comes to specific weapon systems aimed at deterring China, Hicks touted the US Marine Corps’s new Remotely Operated Ground Unit for Expeditionary Fires (ROGUE-Fires), the Army’s Typhon mid-range weapon, and Air Force plans for a collaborative combat aircraft. Much more needs to be done, though, and Hicks provided her successor — billionaire financier Stephen Feinberg, should his confirmation go through — with four key broad focus areas: For many years now whenever the Pentagon or White House has said it will make the 'Pacific pivot' to focus more of its effort on competing with China, unfailingly a crisis arose somewhere else in the world that demanded more attention and the pivot was put on the backburner. In her remarks today, Hicks urged incoming officials to keep Beijing front and center — 'stick to your strategy and use that as your guide,' especially given finite resources. 'Unlimited budgets don’t help the taxpayer and don’t automatically translate into military strength,' she added. 'So senior decision-makers must rigorously align ends, ways, and means, to ensure the strategy itself remains right and DoD can deliver on it. And if it isn’t delivering, those same leaders must drive change from the top.' Continue building on progress under the first Trump and Biden administrations, Hicks said, and it is advantageous to do so with a with a 'sober-minded approach' that doesn't overinflates or underestimates the nature of the competition. The US DoD is a massive bureaucracy and reorienting towards 'strategic competition isn’t for the faint of heart,' Hicks said. Touting weapon modernization developments over the past few years, Hicks urged the Trump administration to continue onward investing in everything from weapons to platforms to shoring up the kill chains. While the Biden administration has spent time trying to expand its military partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region, Hicks warned that strategic competition rarely stops with armed forces. 'When competitors like China act coercively using gray zone tactics, the most effective counters may be intelligence sharing, economic measures, diplomatic actions, or other activities. Sometimes DoD should contribute, but not always,' she said. 'We must use all levers of national power, and more.' The United States’s private sector is an 'asymmetric advantage' that must continually be tended to, she added, noting that the incoming administration should keep an eye on everything from critical minerals and microelectronics to supply chains. A military conflict between China and the US is not inevitable, but incoming officials must 'attend to your actions and your words, they matter more than you think,' Hicks warned. Both sides, she added, need to be cautious of misunderstandings, miscalculations, or inadvertent escalation. 'Some think this may already be a factor in today’s strategic competition between America and the PRC,' Hicks told the audience. 'Whether or not you agree, the possibility of a security dilemma should inform PRC and US policy.' 'After all, we want our operations, activities, investments, and messages to maintain deterrence, not needlessly provoke Beijing into starting a war,' she added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/words-matter-and-other-advice-for-trumps-incoming-team-from-pentagons-no-2/	2025-01-10T11:46:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250110_hicks_sailors_8654638-e1736538361926.jpg
America’s Middle East force posture requires fluidity of options	A U.S. Air Force security forces raven, assigned to the 816th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, maintain a security cordon around a U.S. Air Force C-17 Globemaster III aircraft in support of the Afghanistan evacuation at Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIA), Afghanistan, Aug. 24, 2021. (U.S. Air Force photo by Master Sgt. Donald R. Allen) The U.S. military’s relationship with the Middle East, has, and always will be, complicated. This comes as a familiar paradox: deploying forces to counter immediate threats while preparing to draw down other areas. Prior to the election US defense officials announced both increased deployments to the region and steps toward troop withdrawals. This seeming contradiction may raise questions for some, yet most know it stems from a complex web of historical, geopolitical, and security considerations. This paradox now intersects with the anticipated policy shifts of the incoming Trump administration, which has promised a more assertive approach to countering threats in the region. Statements from campaign advisors suggest a pivot toward increased pressure on Iran and greater support for Israel, which could mean prolonged troop commitments to quelch fires in significant hotspots. And the future of US forces on the ground in Syria is up in the air, with president-elect Donald Trump having stated the US should not be involved in Syria going forward. As with any change in administration, the US will have to consider recalibrating its military posture to provide both deterrence for foes and support to allies. The US should seek to reduce its long-term commitments in areas where its military presence is no longer essential, in alignment with the wishes of leaders in those countries, while also preserving an ability to quickly respond to immediate threats — and a willingness to change plans as world events dictate. The Biden administration over its four years pursued plans to reduce the US military footprint in the Middle East while also surging forces to the Mediterranean and neighboring areas. The White House framed these deployments as essential to prevent the regional spillover of conflict and protect US interests. This decision aligns with historical patterns: the US has long relied on forward-deployed forces as a deterrent against adversaries such as Hezbollah and its backer, Iran. On the other hand, the Trump team's perspective emphasizes a more robust deterrence posture, suggesting that the current deployments may not be temporary. President-elect Trump’s previous policies included a 'maximum pressure' campaign against Iran and there are plans to resurrect said strategy. Many of the cabinet picks for the incoming administration reflect strong desires to side with Israel and present American strength. The new White House team may face an interesting test case for balancing its posture in the region, following the US and Iraq governments releasing their Sept. 27 statement announcing a timeline for the end of the military mission against a major regional threat, ISIS. As media reported, those discussions with Iraqi leadership focused on transitioning US presence from a combat mission to an advisory one, with fewer boots on the ground. These troop reductions align with a broader strategy to pivot the focus from counterterrorism to countering near-peer threats like China and Russia. At first glance, a departure from Iraq may seem out of sync with the heightened military presence elsewhere in the Middle East. However, they are two sides of the same coin. The paradox of both deploying and withdrawing troops is nothing uniquely new: safeguarding American interests, allies, and citizens through targeted, flexible deployments while simultaneously reducing the overall US presence in the Middle East was done after the Gulf War as well. This strategy acknowledges that while the US cannot fully disengage from the region, it must also avoid being permanently tethered to it. The future of US military involvement in the Middle East will continue to be a balancing act. The Biden administration sought to manage this by responding to immediate threats while shifting focus to great-power competition elsewhere. Yet the Trump administration’s foreign policy ethos — marked by an emphasis on 'peace through strength' — could widely differ. While the Pentagon seeks to thread the needle between deployment and disengagement, the incoming administration may favor a more direct posture. In many ways, this paradox is emblematic of the broader challenge facing incoming US policymakers on the Trump team: how to manage regional influence and allyship while safeguarding American interests without becoming ensnared in open-ended conflicts. As the US adapts its role in the region, this dual approach reflects both the reality of short-term threats and the longer-term goal of recalibrating its military posture for future challenges. Fluidity remains a requirement as regional conflicts flare and subside, where America’s role in the Middle East will continue to ebb and flow. What’s clear is that both short-term stability and long-term strategic planning are driving US military decisions, ensuring that what may seem puzzling is actually showing strategic persistence. This balancing act requires a flexible and scalable approach to Middle Eastern security. As the incoming Trump administration reassesses the global posture of the US military, seemingly contradictory moves — such as deploying to manage an immediate crisis while drawing down in areas where long-term military engagement is no longer deemed necessary — will likely remain a key feature of American defense policy.

Iran unveils new loitering munition, announces separate push for 1,000 ‘strategic’ drones	Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian sits next to the commander-in-chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Hossein Salami, and the IRGC's Quds Force commander, Esmail Qaani, during a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of Major General Qassem Soleimani's death at the Imam Khomeini Grand Mosque in downtown Tehran, Iran, on January 2, 2025. (Photo by Morteza Nikoubazl/NurPhoto via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has unveiled a new loitering munition dubbed Rezvan, which it says has a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile) range, according to Iranian media. The new suicide drone reportedly has a flight time of 20 minutes and features a camera on the front that allows it to be controlled from a first-person view. It was revealed by the IRGC during the Payambar-e Azam (The Great Prophet) 19 military exercise, Iran's semi-official PressTV said. Photos in Iranian press appear to show the munition as being launched from a likely man-portable tube, after which its four wings expand for flight. 'This drone enhances the rapid response units of the IRGC's ground forces, providing them with new capabilities to counter terrorist groups, particularly in complex mountainous terrains,' Iran's Tasmin News Agency said. The unveiling of the Rezvan came around the same time as separate reports in Iranian media said the military planned to acquire 1,000 'strategic' drones in 'coming days.' Reportedly the unmanned aerial vehicles to be delivered include Ababil-4 and Ababil 5, which serve multipurpose missions from reconnaissance, patrolling and combat operations. The delivery will also include Arash suicide drones. According to a report from the United States Institute of Peace, the Ababil-5 has a flight distance of 300 miles and can carry four guided anti-tank missiles with a range of five miles or six precision-guided 5.3-pound bombs with a range of 3.7 miles. (The USIP report does not include stats for the Ababil-4.) Interest in unmanned vehicles, especially loitering munitions, has skyrocketed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, where they've proved lethal and difficult to stop on the battlefield. Iran emerged as a loitering munition supplier to Moscow, and analysts have told Breaking Defense their capabilities have drawn attention from countries the world over with tighter military budgets and less cordial relationships with the West — even if Iran was less successful using drones and missiles in two attempts to strike Israel last year. RELATED: Global interest in Iranian drones unlikely to wane despite failed attack on Israel But in early 2025 Tehran may be more concerned about shoring up its own capabilities, after its proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was greatly weakened by Israeli operations and its strongest ally in the region, the Assad regime in Syria, was toppled by rebels there.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/iran-unveils-new-loitering-munition-announces-separate-push-for-1000-strategic-drones/	2025-01-10T07:33:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250110_iranian_pres_irgc_GettyImages-2191601313-e1736522744604.jpg
‘Distrust and verify’: Marines warily embrace generative AI with new guidance, task forces	U.S. Marine Corps Lieutenant Col. Eric R. Olsen, Operations Officer with Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) 24, participates in operations during a simulated Command Operations Center (COC) at Marine Corps Base (MCB) Hawaii, Kaneohe Bay, October 25th, 2013. (U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Aaron S. Patterson, MCBH Combat Camera/Released) WASHINGTON — As the US military moves ever so cautiously to adopt generative AI, the Marine Corps has issued its marching orders on how to safely implement the new technology, including a plan to stand up GenAI task forces at major commands. Formally issued on Dec. 4, instruction NAVMC 5239.1 aims to split the difference between the AI hype squad and the doomsayers. On the cautious side, it reminds Marines that GenAI models may 'hallucinate' — a term of art for 'make stuff up' — and mandates, 'System users should distrust and verify all outputs prior to use.' On the optimistic side, however, the policy urges leaders to let their Marines try out the technology: 'Commands are discouraged from banning the use of GenAI capabilities.' 'Instead,' the policy continues, 'commands should develop comprehensive governance processes that thoughtfully balance the benefits of GenAI tools and capabilities with potential risks, ensuring their use supports broader organizational objectives while maintaining operational security and integrity.' RELATED: AIS@P: Army aims to get AI ASAP for intel, jammers and sensors Specifically, the new policy gives commanders a new to-do list for 2025 on how to safely and responsibly employ GenAI. Some highlights from the memo’s four pages of fine print: The most open-ended item is the mention of task forces, whose full assignment will be detailed in forthcoming policy. What this document does say is that they need to adopt a broad interdisciplinary approach to examining the GenAI tools available and assessing which are actually useful for which specific purposes, or 'use cases.' 'Commands will establish an AI Task Forces/Cells consisting of various data, knowledge management, AI and digital operations subject matter experts to assess existing and in-development GenAI offerings,' the policy says. Those task forces then 'will generate a list of forthcoming preferred GenAI capabilities aligned with common use cases as a reference for USMC organizations seeking to apply GenAI solutions to their mission needs and, as applicable, endorsement.' Further detail 'will be captured in an upcoming memorandum,' the December memo says.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/distrust-and-verify-marines-warily-embrace-generative-ai-with-new-guidance-task-forces/	2025-01-10T05:34:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250109_marine_computer_hawaii_1042582-scaled-e1736454587761.jpg
New admin may be more ‘receptive’ to Navy-industry plan to boost shipyard wages: HII CEO	USS Massachusetts (SSN-798), the 25th Virginia-class fast attack submarine. under construction at Newport News Shipyard in Virginia in 2022. (Photo courtesy of HII.) SURFACE NAVY 2025 — The head of shipbuilder HII said he believes the incoming presidential administration may prove more 'receptive' to a plan developed by the Navy and industry to boost shipyard wages and accelerate submarine production. 'I think there is an opportunity with the new administration. I think there's probably more receptivity to innovation in contracting and that could potentially support getting these 17 boats under contract,' Chris Kastner told a group of reporters on Thursday. He was referring to what has been dubbed the 'Shipyard Accountability and Workforce Support' funding plans, nicknamed SAWS. The proposal, which failed to garner traction with the current administration and with lawmakers, reworks certain contract mechanisms for how the Navy pays for submarine and aircraft carrier shipbuilders, essentially letting prime contractors HII and General Dynamics Electric shift long-term funding to the left in order to invest now in raising wages. That's important for the shipbuilders, which have struggled mightily with hiring and retaining new workers to to meet increasing production demands from the US Navy, particularly in light of the AUKUS trilateral security agreement. '[SAWS] is an innovative approach that increase wages, accelerates submarine production [and] reduces the cost through the [future years],' Kastner said. 'It really checks all the boxes relative to how you'd want to get boats under contract. So I think there is some — there could potentially be some more receptivity, because it's a very innovative approach, and it solves a lot of challenges that that we have right now.' In their most recent defense policy bill, lawmakers admonished the Navy for what they said was a lack of transparency over the plan. The service negotiated SAWS with industry without properly informing lawmakers or the Office of Management and Budget, according to a statement accompanying the bill. But OMB then put forward a $5.7 billion supplemental funding request in November to make up for projected shortfalls in the submarine programs. The Navy's 'lack of communication' leaves 'Congress with few options to address this situation and likely none that will rectify it going forward,' according to lawmakers. Some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, such as Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., have argued that part of the solution for improving the labor force issues for shipbuilders and other industries will come from immigration reform. Asked about Kaine's comments, Kastner said HII's Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Miss., has benefited from workers with green cards. RELATED: From Kabul to keel laying: Afghan immigrants find new careers at US shipyards 'We have some great ship builders in Mississippi that are green card holders [and] that we have some really excellent programs in the community and within the shipyard to have bilingual work constructions, and we have benefited from legal immigration down in Mississippi, and I support increased legal immigration,' he said. His comments come against a backdrop of debates about what American immigration should look like, with the incoming Trump administration pledging a greater focus on border security and immigration reform. Already there has been one semi-public blow up between factions in the Trump administration, with the more business-oriented forces, such as Elon Musk, reportedly clashing with the more anti-immigration forces.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/new-admin-may-be-more-receptive-to-navy-industry-plan-to-boost-shipyard-wages-hii-ceo/	2025-01-09T12:43:30-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Massachusetts-SSN-798-scaled-1-e1732049923370.png
Anduril acquires Numerica’s radar and C2 business	A sign for Anduril at the AFA 2022 Air, Space and Cyber Conference. (Justin Katz/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Anduril has acquired Numerica Corporation’s radar and command and control businesses, a move that will boost the capability of Anduril’s Lattice software platform and expand its radar portfolio, Anduril announced today. The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions by the California-based defense tech firm, which has purchased startups specializing in aerial drones, solid rocket motors and autonomous submarines in recent years. An Anduril spokesperson declined to detail the terms of the agreement. Numerica, which caters to the air and missile defense markets, builds radar and sensor technologies, while also specializing in software that integrates various sensors, platforms and weapons together. The company was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Colorado. Anduril said it will incorporate Numerica’s Spyglass and Spark radars in its existing family of sensing systems, and will manufacture those along with future radar projects at its forthcoming production facility known as Arsenal 1. Numerica’s Mimir software, which fuses data across disparate sensor and weapon platforms, will be incorporated into Anduril software products such as Lattice, which meshes different data feeds and uses artificial intelligence to highlight items of potential interest to the user. 'This transaction expands Anduril’s mission systems solutions to include advanced signal processing and tracking algorithms and software as well as advanced radar systems to bolster Anduril’s suite of air and missile defense capabilities,' Anduril said in a news release. 'The Numerica team brings expertise in advanced mathematical algorithms, scientific computing, and hardware engineering, which will strengthen Anduril’s focus on air defense, missile defense, and vehicle protection.' Anduril CEO Brian Schimpf told Breaking Defense in December that he expects 2025 to be another big year for mergers and acquisitions for Anduril, with the company regularly evaluating 'hundreds' of potential acquisitions per year. 'We're picking off companies at a very different stage than most people look at,' he said in an interview, adding that Anduril has found success in buying smaller companies 'with the right ideas … [and] the right relationships' to the US military. 'We're looking for companies with a lot of growth potential, where we think we can pour gas on them and make it go faster, and that strategy has worked really well for us. We'll keep it up,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/anduril-acquires-numericas-radar-and-c2-business/	2025-01-09T11:10:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/220920_KATZ_Anduril_sign-scaled-e1709168149747.jpg
In his last meeting, Austin challenges Ukraine Defense Contact Group not to fail or falter	Ukraine President Volodymr Zelensky and U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III shake hands at the end of opening remarks during the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, Jan. 9, 2025. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Jordan Lazaro) 'I'm leaving this contact group not with a farewell but a challenge: The coalition to support Ukraine must not flinch, it must not falter, and it must not fail,' Austin told reporters after the meeting. 'Ukraine's survival is on the line, but so is all of our security. [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to avenge a fallen empire and to rebuild it. The Kremlin's assault starts with Ukraine, but it will not end there.' Later this month, President-elect Donald Trump is set to be sworn in for his second term and expected to usher in a host of foreign policy changes, including on Ukraine and NATO, though it remains to be seen exactly what those will be. As a result, the next time the contact group meets it could look very different. 'This is very much Secretary Austin's brainchild, born from his experience and contributions to the D-ISIS coalition and his deep belief that, when you bring allies and partners together, the sum will be much greater than the parts,' a senior US defense official told reporters ahead of the trip. The hope, the official later added, is for the incoming Trump administration to continue meeting allies and partners as part of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. 'Because of the multilateral work, because of the capability coalitions and all that we have done, it will endure in some capacity, in some form going forward, I believe, regardless of exactly how the next team does or doesn't pursue it,' the official said. Part of the plan to help ensure that the group’s work continues revolves around the eight capability coalitions established to focus on a specific equipment requirement like fighter jets, drones, air defense systems, artillery, ammunition, tanks, naval vessels and remote detonation systems for demining. Austin announced today that each coalition endorsed individual roadmaps designed to help support Ukraine's future force. 'Each roadmap lays out an efficient and sustainable approach to helping meet Ukraine's long term and near-term capabilities, and that's how this contact group has produced so much progress by working together for our shared security interests and by standing together,' Austin added. While he took to the stage alone this afternoon local time, earlier in the day Austin appeared alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to kick off the day and announce the $500 million military package. That package is part of the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA) umbrella and includes AIM-7, RIM-7, and AIM-9M missiles for air defense, air-to-ground munitions, armored bridging systems and more. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, used the stage to commit to 'end this war with dignity for Ukraine and all of Europe this year,' and said that it would be 'crazy to drop the ball now and not keep building on the defense coalitions we've created.' 'No matter what's going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased off the map,' Zelenskyy said. 'That used to depend on a handful of big capitals, but now it's on all of us, on how we work together, how ready we are to own our future and how well we can convince our partners to stand with us. The more determination we show in defending our interests, the more interest our partners and especially the US will see is good to stay on our side.' Similarly Pistorius called for the contact group format to be kept 'alive,' a sentiment echoed by Hanno Pevkur, Estonia’s defence minister. Pevkur said in a statement that 'it is crucial for the contact group to continue its meetings even with the inauguration of a new U.S. administration.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/in-his-last-meeting-austin-challenges-ukraine-defense-contact-group-not-to-fail-or-falter/	2025-01-09T11:04:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250109_DVIDS_austin_zelenskyy_8825402-scaled-e1736448195559.jpg
To project power in the Pacific, invest in Guam’s protection	The Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine USS Asheville (SSN 758), departs Polaris Point, Naval Base Guam. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Justin Wolpert) The United States is a Pacific power, yet we are mostly resident in the Eastern Pacific and lack significant presence in the Western Pacific. This geographic conundrum carries heavy implications for everything from supply chains to trade, but from a national security perspective our competitors and adversaries — that axis of China, Russia and North Korea — all are advantaged by their physical proximity to the areas we seek to safeguard. In the event of a contingency, whether in the Taiwan Strait, the Korean Peninsula, or the South and East China Seas, the United States will be playing on the road as the 'away team.' The important exception to this geographic imbalance is found in the great Pacific territories of the United States — and in particular, the US territory of Guam. This is why the Commander of US Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) identified the defense of Guam as number one on his 'unfunded priorities list' in 2024. As the Jan. 20, 2025 inauguration approaches, the incoming administration will confront a risk of conflict in the Indo-Pacific that is likely at a post-Vietnam War high. For the new administration, Guam and its defense should be among our highest national security priorities. To put a finer point on it, absent more urgent moves to bolster Guam’s defense, the risk of military conflict will grow even greater, and our ability to protect our interests will be significantly diminished. The security picture compels us to place a premium on 'forward deployed' military forces in the region, and it further compels us to find the means to sustain them in a contested environment. And while we are highly reliant on allied nations for basing and access for US forces, it is becoming increasingly clear that most valuable piece of land in the event of a fight in the Pacific could in fact be Guam. While there are a number of reasons Guam is so valuable and its defense so important, the two qualities that are fundamental to Guam being almost irreplaceable from a military perspective are its location, and its political status. Guam enjoys a 'Goldilocks' placement in the Pacific — not too far, and not too close. The island is far enough from the potential fight to have some natural protections against many classes of weapon systems potentially employed by our adversaries. And yet Guam is closer to Beijing than it is to Hawaii — close enough to the fight to be a place for combat force generation. The same proximity also allows Guam to serve as a place for maintenance, repair and sustainment. RELATED: Guam missile defenses conduct first-ever ballistic intercept in test Guam’s status as an unincorporated territory of the United States is also key to its importance. Being sovereign territory allows for a large footprint and robust posture on the island — almost 15 percent of the island’s population are US service members and their dependents. It also removes the uncertainty associated with potential political constraints a host nation might impose on our military during a time of crisis. With almost 10,000 military personnel on the island, DoD has chosen to base (either permanently or on a rotating basis) on Guam its most lethal and exquisite systems such as F-35 fighters, B-2 Bombers, and Virginia-class fast attack submarines. Guam is also the location for strategic fuel reserves, munitions storage, and advanced maintenance capabilities for all of these. In brief, Guam being a safe harbor means America has a much freer hand across the full spectrum of military action. It is arguable that the most significant variable determining success or failure during a Pacific contingency is how well America has chosen to defend Guam. Don’t take my word for it: take our adversaries. In 2017, during the 'fire and fury' period, North Korea threatened to strike US military targets on Guam. In 2018, the PLA confirmed that the DF-26 missile was operational and fielded with a range capable of hitting Guam (the missile has been dubbed in Chinese media as 'Guam killer'). Other potential threats exist as well, such as from PLA submarines and potential CCP cyber attacks on island infrastructure. Which is why its puzzling that investment in the island has lagged behind the stated needs. Of course, DoD must weigh competing priorities across its investments. But there are some aspects of Guam’s defense that require urgent action. Priority one: protection against increasingly lethal and accurate missiles. INDOPACOM recently issued a requirement for '360-degree coverage, and layered defense against regional ballistic, maneuvering ballistic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missile threats.' The DoD and Congress should move out quickly to make this a reality. Guam needs passive missile defense as well. Such requirements include hardened aircraft shelters, rapid runway and port repair capabilities, mobile communication capabilities, and mobile fuel storage. Beyond both active and passive missile defenses, Guam has tremendous infrastructure needs. With the surge of force presence and military hardware, there is a pressing need for military housing, medical care facilities, and more expansive maintenance and repair capacity across the services. As Guam’s importance grows, our adversaries will seek all means available to hold it at risk. The US citizens of Guam deserve our protection and the US military and our allies depend on it. Deterrence will be strengthened and the possibility of war will be lessened if we act quickly and truly help with the defense of Guam where it is needed most urgently. The DoD and Congress should move out quickly to support Guam’s needs, enabling it to be that most valuable geography for INDOPACOM forces in the vast region of the Western Pacific.

Sweden bolsters defense with 44 new Leopard 2A8 battle tanks, upgrades to CV90s	Stridsvagn 122 is the Swedish version of the Leopard 2 main battle tank (Swedish Armed Forces) STOCKHOLM — Sweden today announced a $1.97 billion deal for new and upgraded Leopard 2 A8 tanks, as well as upgrades to its fleet of CV90 infantry fighting vehicles. The historic tank deal, which covers 44 new Leopards and upgrades for 66 older Leopard 2 tanks, was brokered by the Defense Materiel Administration (FMV) with the German-French defense contractor KNDS. The investment will significantly strengthen the defense capabilities and contribute to completing the increase from two to four Swedish army brigades that are being built. Combined with 44 other tanks already undergoing modernization, 'We are getting 154 modern tanks and refurbished combat vehicles with these orders, which strengthens our defense capability.' Defense Minister Pål Jonson said in the government's press release Thursday. The new acquisition includes the replacement of the tanks previously donated to Ukraine, ensuring no net loss in Swedish armor. Currently, 10 Swedish Leopard tanks are actively deployed on the Ukrainian battlefield, operated by Ukrainian crews who received training in Sweden. The new tanks, to be known as Stridsvagn 123, are set to begin delivery in 2028, with all units expected to be in service by 2031. This move marks the most extensive upgrade of the Stridsvagn 122 (the Swedish designation for the Leopard 2) since their acquisition in the early 2000s. The refurbishment involves bringing the existing tanks up to par with the new ones, featuring upgrades such as new cannons for enhanced combat effectiveness, improved crew protection, increased digital capabilities, and an extended service life. Notably, getting up to the Leopard 2A8 standard means Sweden operates the same tank system as Germany and Norway, which provides opportunities for purchasing ammunition and spare parts — the kind of interoperability that NATO members are seeking in the wake of the Ukraine conflict. Additionally, the government has approved the renovation of 90 existing CV90s, set to be completed by 2030, at a rough price tag of $448 million. This maintenance and upgrade are deemed essential due to the evolving security policy landscape. 'This investment in tanks and combat vehicles is a pivotal part of the largest rearmament effort by the Swedish defense since the 1950s,' Jonson added, underlining the urgency driven by the deteriorating security situation.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/sweden-bolsters-defense-with-44-new-leopard-2a8-battle-tanks-upgrades-to-cv90s/	2025-01-09T09:36:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/01/20180522_matnys02_P4_Vareld_pansarskytte_065.jpg
Aussies buying 40 more Bushmasters for long-range fire C2	An Australian Army Bushmaster disembarks during Exercise Keris Woomera at Banongan Beach, Indonesia. (LSIS Rikki-Lea Phillips) SYDNEY — The Australian Army will buy 40 more Bushmaster Armored Personnel Vehicles, in a deal valued at over $100 million AUD ($61 million USD). Thales Australia builds them in a town called Bendingo, where Pat Conroy, minister for defense industry, announced the purchase. 'The Bushmaster vehicles will contribute to the acceleration of a land-based long-range strike capability for the Army, demonstrating a commitment to modernizing the Australian Defence Force,' Conroy said, according to a transcript. 'We’re taking and transforming the Australian Army from an army capable of striking 40 kilometers to an army capable of striking 500 and then, eventually 1,000 kilometres away, which is all about deterring aggression in our region.' Conroy announced today the Australian military will be establishing a second long-range fires regiment and that the new vehicles will be 'providing what's called command and control (C2) for that regiment.' He also said the newly contracted vehicles will enable 'targeting and the coordination and communications that will allow that regiment to strike targets at range to deter aggression.' The new Bushmasters will provide C2 capabilities for the Kongsberg's Naval Strike Missile (NSM) or Lockheed Martin's Precision Strike Missile Increment 2 contract, to be awarded by the end of this year. Last July, a $45 million contract was awarded to Thales for 15 Bushmasters to provide C2 for the first long-range fires regiment. The first regiment will be equipped with HIMARS launchers using Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems and Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). The Jan. 8 Bushmaster announcement carried strong political overtones. An Australian federal election is expected in March and Bendigo is held by a Labor member, Lisa Chesters. The election is expected to be very close, with Labor probably hanging on to power in coalition, public polls indicate. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has spent a big chunk of the extended holiday period touring Western Australia, with crucial Labor seats, as well as other regions he will need to hold on to power. 'These 40 new Bushmaster vehicles represent a contract in excess of $100 million for Thales Australia and secures the future of 250 direct jobs at this facility,' Conroy touted.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/aussies-buying-40-more-bushmasters-for-long-range-fire-c2/	2025-01-09T08:32:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/20241112ran8650158_0211-scaled-e1736427859609.jpg
Why Saudi Arabia is interested in GCAP – and whether it should be	A Global Combat Air Programme(GCAP) core vehicle concept on display at DSEI, London (Breaking Defense) Much remains unclear about the Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP), including design, technical specifications, and cost. But perhaps the most intriguing aspect is Saudi Arabia’s desire to join the United Kingdom, Italy and Japan in developing the sixth-generation fighter. Saudi officials first expressed their interest in GCAP back in 2023, citing defense industrial and economic reasons. They see an opportunity in localizing parts of GCAP, be it in manufacturing, technology, or human capital. The goal, they insist, is not a symbolic or junior partnership but an equal one whereby the kingdom has a stake and participation in the program that meets its defense and economic ambitions. But let’s be blunt: While there are several reasons why the three GCAP nations should entertain adding Saudi Arabia to the program, there are fewer clear reasons why the Saudis would want to join up. And that requires a closer examination of what leadership in Riyadh may be thinking. A good starting point is to consider how the UK, Italy, and Japan could benefit from including Saudi Arabia. GCAP’s development is guaranteed to have a significant price tag given its planned, next-generation capabilities which are supposed to surpass the fifth-generation, American-made F-35 and compete with the six-generation programs of the United States, China, and the FCAS effort from France, Germany and Spain. So, reducing the costs through access to Saudi capital would be quite welcome, as it could accelerate the aircraft’s development, shorten export timelines (thus generate revenue earlier through sales), and ease the burden on the already constrained defense budgets of London, Rome and Tokyo. Solidifying strategic ties with Saudi Arabia through GCAP is also not a terrible idea. This is a country whose geopolitical stock is on the rise, with its $925 billion sovereign wealth fund, ambitious economic and defense transformation plans, and $100 billion investment in artificial intelligence — the tool that’s slated to contribute $19.9 trillion to the global economy through 2030 and impact its future like no other. It is my understanding that London is the one who’s pushing the hardest of the three for Saudi Arabia’s inclusion, which should be no surprise. UK-Saudi security relations are old and deep, dating back to the early twentieth century. British prime ministers and their closest aides have often suggested that the security of the island is tied to Gulf security of which, of course, Saudi Arabia is a huge part. The UK is the second most important security partner of Saudi Arabia, after the United States, providing it with equipment, training, advice, professional military education, and various defense services both in the UK and on Saudi soil. UK military contracts to the kingdom have seen sales over the years of dozens of billions of pounds for various aircraft (Tornados and Typhoons), missiles, bombs, and maintenance and spare parts. Without continuous technical, engineering, and maintenance support from British personnel in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia would not have been able to pursue a range of military operations in Yemen in its recent war against the Houthis. London has some work to do to persuade first the British public (very little discussion so far has taken place in the Parliament about Saudi Arabia’s potential inclusion in GCAP, and politics is definitely going to play a role here) and second its Italian and, especially, Japanese partners about the advantages of bringing Saudi Arabia on board. Tokyo has voiced human rights concerns, but its resistance, in my view, is more of a negotiating tactic vis-à-vis its other partners to protect or increase its industrial equities in GCAP. Certainly, it’s true that if Saudi Arabia makes major financial contributions to GCAP, it will expect industrial production in some capacity — last year, a Saudi official told Breaking Defense that 'there’ll be no transaction without serious, decent and important localization in Saudi Arabia.' But that local production would likely be limited to smaller aspects of the program, not the kind of major engine and body work that Japan is currently eyeing in the program. And the return for Japan could be mighty. In addition to Saudi dollars driving the overall program cost down, it would also provide geostrategic returns, creating stronger ties between Japan and a Gulf power while helping support the broader GCAP ambitions of a greater share of the sixth-generation aircraft market and less reliance on the US security umbrella. London proposed a feasibility study in March 2023 about Saudi Arabia’s potential inclusion in GCAP, but it either hasn’t been completed or its recommendations have stayed confidential. In any case, absent consensus on this issue among the partners themselves and in British politics, a set timeline to decide whether or how Riyadh could join GCAP will remain elusive. And yet, despite that uncertainty, Riyadh remains eager to secure the trio’s commitment, which means it is time to dissect what Saudi Arabia might get from its public flirtation with GCAP. The economic case for Saudi Arabia joining GCAP is not compelling. Putting in billions of dollars to help with the development of the aircraft when you are likely to be constrained to only smaller parts of the production or localized MRO is a losing economic argument. Sure, Saudi Arabia’s engineers and technicians can benefit from the experience they would earn, be it in maintenance or other modest services, but even for the Saudis, dropping tens of billions of dollars for such little benefit is questionable. Geopolitically, Saudi Arabia knows how essential military ties with the UK are and is constantly looking for ways to upgrade them. During the World Defense Show in Riyadh in February 2024, the two sides met and agreed to work together on advanced new capabilities in land-based systems, including air defense and armored vehicles, as well as unmanned aerial systems. But those ties, as covered above, are longstanding, and it is unclear how much the Saudis would benefit more in London by joining GCAP. Similarly, how much Riyadh needs to increase its ties with Italy and Japan for its interests is unclear. The tactical security case is not much more compelling. Saudi Arabia’s present and future defense requirements can be met through fifth-generation aircraft and more importantly, through better organized defense management practices tied to its own defense transformation plan. Also, GCAP is not expected to be operational before 2035, and Saudi Arabia cannot wait this long to upgrade its capabilities, especially when the F-35 option already exists. And that brings us to possibly the real reason why Saudi Arabia is so eager to publicly communicate its desire to join GCAP: to pressure the United States to sell it the F-35 and more broadly to secure an agreement on a mutual defense treaty, as has been discussed for the past couple of years. If the public flirtation with GCAP is enough to tip American leaders to finally clear the F-35, as a way to maintain dominance in the Saudi defense realm both from a market share and a strategic standpoint, then Riyadh will likely be content to wave goodbye to its sixth-gen ambitions and happily take a more proven, currently in production jet — one which Israel has reportedly used against the Saudis’ traditional foe, Iran, over the last year. The Trump administration is expected to prioritize arms sales as a foreign policy issue. Whether it calls the Saudi’s GCAP bluff or not could be a strong sign of how the next four years of relations in the Gulf will go. Bilal Y.

With its commander as president and amid fragile ceasefire, Lebanese Armed Forces take center stage	The Lebanese Army is deployed on the ground as search operations continue at the site of the israeli strike in Basta, Central Beirut on Nov. 23, 2024. (Photo by NAEL CHAHINE/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Already charged with a high-profile, critical mission in the tenuous ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Armed Forces was thrust further into the spotlight today after its commander was elected president of the nation. Joseph Aoun, who has run the LAF for eight years, came away with the victory after candidates from different Lebanese parties, including one backed by Hezbollah, dropped out and many pledged their support. Before fireworks began exploding in Beirut following the election — a welcome change for many citizens who became accostumed to real Israeli airstrikes — retired LAF Gen. Wehbe Katicha told Breaking Defense that Aoun's election will likely enhance the LAF's profile at home and abroad, at a critical time for the force. 'The Lebanese army is the most trusted national entity by the international community, and as its commander reaches Baada [the presidential palace], I expect the LAF's mission in the south to be facilitated and international military aid to be provided where they are needed most,' Katicha said. Aoun's victory comes 43 days into the 60-day ceasefire between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah, which is mostly holding. Lebanese army commander, General Joseph Aoun (C), speaks with Major General Aroldo Lazaro, Head of Mission and Force Commander of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) (L) during a visit to the southern Lebanese village of Khiam on December 23, 2024, after the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the area under a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah. (Photo by AFP) (Photo by -/AFP via Getty Images) In his oath of office, Aoun pledged to 'respect the ceasefire with Israel,' and said the government 'will not compromise Lebanon's independence and sovereignty, and it is time to place our bets on Lebanon, not on foreign powers.' As Israel pulls back from Lebanese territory in the phased withdrawal plan, all eyes will be on the LAF and its obligation to ensure the areas it controls are safe for thousands of civilians who are attempting to rebuild after months of devastating combat. Experts who spoke to Breaking Defense were divided on whether the LAF has the necessary resources to be up to the task, but agreed that like its chief, the army is stepping into its most important mission in decades — and will need support at home and from abroad to pull it off. 'As part of the Mechanism-enabled transition, the LAF immediately deployed forces to the area to clear roads, remove unauthorized munitions, and provide security for the people of Lebanon,' the US embassy said in a statement on Tuesday. A top US official involved the ceasefire efforts, Maj. Gen. Jasper Jeffers, said that the LAF is 'the legitimate security provider for Lebanon and continues to demonstrate to me and the rest of the Mechanism it has the capability, intent, and leadership to secure and defend Lebanon. They have acted decisively, rapidly, and with clear expertise.' When a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was struck in late November, all parties were aware how tenuous it would be — that was one thing experts who spoke to Breaking Defense for this report agreed on. Retired Lebanese Armed Forces Brig. Gen. Ziad Haykal was perhaps the most optimistic, saying, 'The most likely expectation is that the ceasefire agreement will hold, especially since it is supported directly by the United States and several major powers on the one hand. On the other hand, it is also [in] Hezbollah's interest for the ceasefire to hold amid all the destruction and displacement.' The Lebanese army begins clearing roads and searching for mines and explosives in the area, on December 12, 2024 in Khiyam, Lebanon. (Photo by Ramiz Dallah/Anadolu via Getty Images) A key aspect of the ceasefire is the implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which Haykal said calls for 'no weapons' other than those belonging to the LAF present in the south. That, he said, was 'one of the basic tasks that the army must carry out' and one that at least for now, Hezbollah 'has expressed its full readiness to cooperate [with the LAF] in this regard.' (In his oath of office, Aoun specifically highlighted that the state alone should carry arms.) Specifically, Aram Nerguizian of the Washington, DC-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that at an 'operational level, there is an expectation for the LAF to redeploy forces to bolster existing troop strength in the SLS [South Litani Sector] (5th Brigade, 7th Brigade, 5th Intervention Regiment).' He added this mission entails 'allocating resources for troop housing/barracks, logistics and mobility capacity (critical to conducting additional patrols), and executing EOD [Exploding Ordnance Disposal] and other actions tied to Hezbollah weapons caches in the SLS.' As such the acquiescence of both Hezbollah and its backer Iran have been key to the ceasefire holding, according to Middle East Institute Vice President for International Engagement Paul Salem. 'The implementation of the [ceasefire] agreement always had to be in the following way that Hezbollah and hence Iran would accept certain conditions, implement them, and the Lebanese army, with UNIFIL [United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon] would go in, fill the void, ensure that it's being done, and build the military presence as Hezbollah withdrew,' he told Breaking Defense. If all sides abide by the agreement, retired LAF Brig. Gen. Khalil Helou argued the LAF has plenty of manpower and firepower to do its limited mission. 'The LAF is in South Lebanon in order to restore the sovereignty of the Lebanese state south of the [Litani], [hence] no tanks, artillery and air force are needed,' he said. 'Lebanese Armed Forces have enough man and material in order to deploy in all of South Lebanon. &#8230; So the Lebanese army is well equipped.' But it's unclear what would happen if Hezbollah attempts to reassert itself militarily or if Israel decides to reinvade, and Israel has made it known it is not completely satisfied with LAF's efforts. Last week was accused of breaking the ceasefire by striking what it called Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon. The IDF claimed the LAF had failed to neutralize rocket launchers there. Elie Elias, the director of the Middle East Institute for Research and Strategic Studies, said that the LAF's success is among several factors that are 'far from guaranteed.' The LAF's 'current capabilities fall short of effectively securing the southern borders. To fulfill this role, the LAF needs advanced surveillance systems, armored vehicles, air defense mechanisms, and better coordination tools to respond to border violations,' he told Breaking Defense. 'Without these platforms and international support, its ability to protect the southern borders and all borders remains limited, particularly against threats from both Israel and non-state actors.' Nerguizian agreed, arguing that the LAF is vastly under resourced for its current role regardless. 'At the level of raw logistics, the LAF's current resourcing environment — which is subordinated to the constraints set by the Government of Lebanon and the national defense budget — have meant that the force has been able to secure less than 20 percent of its needs with the resources at its disposal,' he said. While the LAF gets to work on the ground, Elias and Salem said support from the international community will be indispensable. The LAF 'potentially have the capacity [to implement the ceasefire], but certainly they need clear support, particularly financial and logistical from the international community, and the international community is well aware of that,' Salem said. The Lebanese military has benefited from military aid for years, including Foreign Military Funds provided by from the United States, and continues to direct that aid to support LAF’s mission in South Lebanon. The force got another shot in the arm this week after the State Department redirected $95 million in military aid from Egypt to Lebanon, a development first reported by Reuters and confirmed to Breaking Defense by a State Department official. 'These funds will directly support the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) as they work to implement the Lebanon-Israel Cessation of Hostilities,' the official said. 'The LAF’s deployment into southern Lebanon – and Hizballah’s withdrawal – will represent the most significant steps towards implementation of UNSCR 1701 since the resolution was passed in 2006. Supporting the LAF to exert sovereignty across all of Lebanon will constrain the malign activities of Hizballah and their Iranian backers both in Lebanon and their destabilizing activities across the globe.' Lebanon is also seeing vocal (and financial) support from France, which organized a conference in October that raised $1 billion for the country, $200 million of which was dedicated to the security forces. It remains to be seen what impact Aoun's victory in the presidential race will have on the LAF's mission in the south, but it could have a more direct impact on international support. He was reportedly the preferred candidate of two nations with historically deep pockets: the US and Saudi Arabia.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/with-its-commander-as-president-and-amid-fragile-ceasefire-lebanese-armed-forces-take-center-stage/	2025-01-09T06:00:57-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250108_LAF_beirut_GettyImages-2185633357-e1736362566933.jpg
AIS@P: Army aims to get AI ASAP for intel, jammers and sensors	Brig. Gen. Ed Barker, Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare and Sensors, left, and Staff. Sgt Ross Helmuth, a military intelligence noncommissioned officer in 2nd Battalion, 7th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, previews a new radio system at Fort Stewart, Georgia. (US Army photo by Pfc. Benjamin Hale) WASHINGTON — As the DC area lay stunned by snowfall, over 900 people tuned in Tuesday for hours of virtual briefings on a forthcoming Army contract vehicle for 'Artificial Intelligence &amp; Software at Pace' (AIS@P). At stake is a projected $1 billion over the next decade. But to keep tech updates innovative, competitive and quick, AIS@P aims to divide those dollars into at least 40 individual 'task orders' of at most $25 million apiece, with anywhere from five to 30 vendors bidding for each one. (It’s possible that a few task orders may exceed that $25 million threshold, officials said). Only vendors who prove their expertise in the relevant specialties will be allowed to bid on relevant task orders — poor performers will be liable to get kicked out of the approved 'pool' at any time, and promising new vendors may be brought on as they emerge. Each individual task order is supposed to be turned around within a month: Once the official Request For Proposals (RFP) is published, vendors will have just 14 days to submit bids, and the Army will have 16 days to evaluate and make awards. That’s an extraordinarily tight timeline for a Pentagon procurement, especially since AIS@P will follow the standard Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). But, officials argued, such speed is essential to 21st century warfare. 'We’re trying … to really open the aperture for government to access innovative solutions … lower barriers to entry [and] keep pace in our space of AI and EW,' said Brig. Gen. Ed Barker, the Army’s Program Executive Officer for Intelligence, Electronic Warfare, &amp; Sensors (PEO-IEW&amp;S). Barker’s Chief of Staff, Kyle Perkins, added: 'We fully expect, when we get out into the fight, we’re going to see things we haven’t seen before, [so] our EW systems have to change at a moment’s notice.' While PEO-IEW&amp;S is creating AIS@P for the PEO’s own programs, which cover everything from backpack radio jammers to truck-sized satellite terminals, officials suggested other Army organizations might use the contract vehicle as well. It’s worth noting that an earlier PEO-IEW&amp;S initiative on AI, Project Linchpin, was swiftly scaled up to serve the entire Army. (Linchpin plans to make extensive use of AIS@P, its leadership said during the briefings). Certainly Barker made no bones about his big ambitions: 'The end goal is really trying to change how the Army does business,' he said. To bid on AIS@P task orders, vendors must qualify for at least one of seven specialized 'pools' (Army graphic) To start, however, Barker and his team must get AIS@P off the ground. While officials have been talking informally with industry for some time, the PEO issued a draft RFP in late November, accompanied by feedback forms, a survey, and an email inbox for comments. At Tuesday's industry day briefings, Perkins said he wanted to get a final Request For Information (RFI) out 'on or around 13 January,' an updated draft RFP in February, and a final RFP in March. The initial contract awards should come this summer, Perkins continued, in the final quarter of federal fiscal year 2025. But, he and other officials emphasized, those are just 'base' contracts. While they’ll carry a 'nominal' monetary value, the real worth of these initial awards is that they get a company in the 'pool' the Army deems qualified to bid. 'If you’re not in one of the pools, you cannot bid on a task order,' one official emphasized. Currently, the plan is for seven pools. Four will cover aspects of AI: onboarding (reserved for small businesses); data management and labeling; model development and training; and test and evaluation. Three will apply to software more broadly: engineering support, electromagnetic spectrum support (including highly sensitive electronic warfare techniques), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). A single company may belong to multiple pools, but it has to qualify for each one separately; that means submitting a separate proposal, white paper, tech demo, and past-performance data tailored to each pool’s specific technical focus. Once the pools are filled, the Army can begin issuing individual task orders (TOs), which could be for everything from licensing off-the-shelf software to developing new cutting-edge tech. Each TO should cover six months of work, with options to renew. In all other respects, the task orders can vary widely, using different contract types, security rules, intellectual property agreements and technical standards. The vendor pools won’t be static, officials emphasized: The Army reserves the right to 'offramp' underperformers and to bring on promising new vendors at any time. This process, which officials called 'perpetual onboarding,' will open to newcomers sometime in early FY26, Perkins said. The Army may even add new pools as new technology needs emerge. Constant communication between industry and the Army is essential to making all this work, officials emphasized over and over again. 'We’ve asked for feedback and you haven’t been shy to give that,' Barker said. 'You’re making us better … I appreciate the fact you give it to us straight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/aisp-army-aims-to-get-ai-asap-for-intel-jammers-and-sensors/	2025-01-09T05:55:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/8163105-scaled-e1736369498851.jpg
New Biden MTCR policy will free long-range missile tech, space launcher sales to key allies, partners	White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — New presidential guidance on the application of the Missile Technology Control Regime is designed to help US partners and allies build up their space and missile capabilities by easing the export of space launch vehicles, precision-guided munitions and technology to enable them to develop advanced missiles, according to current and former government officials. The new National Security Memorandum (NSM) was signed by Biden on Jan. 3 but not announced formally until Tuesday via a White House fact sheet. The full text of the NSM has not been released but a spokesperson confirmed the guidance went into immediate effect. While the Biden team is less than two weeks from its exit, NSMs remain in force from administration to administration unless and until a new president proactively decides to overturn them. While it's not clear what a Trump administration may do, the first Trump administration made updating the MTCR guidance part of its focus on increasing arm sales abroad. The new standard 'Means we now have more opportunity to boost our friends’ production of advanced missiles, strengthening collective deterrence and defense by increasing the global availability and interoperability of long-range and other Precision Guided Munitions among U.S. allies and partners,' a spokesperson for the National Security Council (NSC) told Breaking Defense today. 'At the same time, we will continue to impede access to advanced missile technology by bad actors.' Sean Wilson, who recently stepped down as director of International Space Policy at the National Space Council, told Breaking Defense that 'This is an important policy shift for the United States. It strengthens the U.S. ability to deter our adversaries, expands U.S. exports (and associated jobs) in crucial high-tech sectors, and broadens the scope of future space partnerships with U.S. allies and partners.' The MTCR, established in 1987, is a voluntary multinational agreement that constrains the spread of nuclear capable missiles by imposing strict export controls on 'rockets and unmanned aerial vehicles capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kg to a range of at least 300 km and on equipment, software, and technology for such systems' to non-member states, according to a State Department fact sheet. These technologies are known as Category 1 items under the MTCR, and traditionally Washington has had a policy of discouraging even allies and partners who are members from building their own such capabilities. However, there have been efforts — under both the Trump and Biden administrations — to change how the government views arms export requests under MTCR due to the spread of capabilities, such as long-range drones or space systems, that are no longer rare technologies. Under the new rules, the White House 'directs the interagency to provide increased flexibility for case-by-case review and facilitate support for certain MTCR Category I military missiles, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), and Space Launch Vehicle (SLV) systems to certain partners with strong export control systems,' the White House fact sheet said. The NSC spokesperson elaborated that the new policy 'wholly overhauls and replaces the longstanding U.S. government policy for implementation of the MTCR guidelines, re-emphasizing U.S. commitment to nonproliferation and accounting for the global availability of Precision Guided Munitions and other technologies and capabilities.' Previously, the US unilaterally has barred the sale of space launch vehicles (SLVs) to MTCR members with the exception of countries that were among the original signatories — Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom — and India, which was granted an exception to the rule in 2005. (India joined the MTCR agreement in 2016.) The new policy eliminates those restrictions. 'The NSM establishes that the MTCR is not designed to impede national space programs or international cooperation in such programs as long as such programs could not contribute to delivery systems for WMD [weapons of mass destruction],' the White House fact sheet states. Now, 'transfers of MTCR Category I SLV related commodities, software, and technology will be considered on a case-by-case basis for select and vetted partner space programs and participation in international space programs, whether such programs are governmental or commercial in nature.' The new guidelines thus support the efforts by the Biden administration — with strong support from the Defense Department — has been pursuing over the past several years to bolster commercial and military space 'integration' with allies, particularly those in the Asia-Pacific region to help counter China's military space buildup. For example, in remarks Jan. 6 at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi in New Delhi, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan noted that the policy changes would spur increased bilateral space cooperation. '[A]s a result of new updates to our missile technology control export policies that President Biden signed out just last week—and which I’m glad to announce publicly for the first time today—our commercial and civil space partnership is set for lift off,' he said. The Pentagon also has been eagerly pursuing military cooperation with India, including through commercial cooperation in areas such as space domain awareness and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. The revised MTCR guidelines around space assets further were designed to fit the needs of the United Kingdom and Australia, the two allies involved in the trilateral AUKUS pact, as well as South Korea, according to a former administration official familiar with the NMS development. 'I think AUKUS was a special pain point,' said the former administration official, explaining that Washington is working with the United Kingdom and Australia 'on nuclear powered submarines armed with conventional missiles on one hand,' but on the other refusing to sell those countries 'liquid fueled SLV' rocket stages. Indeed, the White House fact sheet notes that the new policy will help with AUKUS implementation. The Biden White House insists that the new MTCR policy is not only consistent with, but actually reinforces, US nonproliferation goals. 'These updates reflect a renewed U.S. commitment to nonproliferation, while advancing the President’s goals of strengthening allied defense capabilities, bolstering the U.S. defense industrial base, streamlining defense trade, and deterring adversaries,' the fact sheet states. However, some long-time export control advocates are wary. 'Our government may want to make love by sharing dangerous missile technology with countries it views as &#8216;people like us.' That’s a policy decision. But in this case, the White House is trying to dress this love up as if it’s making nonproliferation. It’s not,' said Henry Sokolski, executive director of The Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, who served as the head of Pentagon nonproliferation policy under George H.W. Bush. Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, expressed some concern about the potential for widening sales of long-range drones. 'All the major drone manufacturers want to be able to sell their weaponry to all sorts of countries. So there's been a big industry push to loosen MTCR guidelines in that regard,' he said. Further, he said, the fact that Sullivan made the announcement in India may backfire on the US efforts to talk an already-reluctant Pakistan out of pursuing long-range ballistic missiles. (Pakistan is not an MTCR member.) In remarks at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace on Dec. 19, Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer said that if Pakistan builds such missiles, Islamabad 'would have the capability to strike targets well beyond South Asia, including in the United States, raising real questions about Pakistan’s intentions.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/new-biden-mtcr-policy-will-free-long-range-missile-rocket-sales-to-key-allies-partners/	2025-01-08T13:29:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/230602_sullivan_arms_control_GettyImages-1258375495-scaled-e1685724331637.jpg
Israel taps Elbit for munitions, raw materials in push for defense industrial independence	Dozens of 155mm shells sit in a facility in Israel. (Elbit Systems) JERUSALEM — Israel’s Ministry of Defense has signed two deals with Haifa-based Elbit Systems totalling more than $274 million to secure more munitions and to increase raw material production lines intended to make the country more self-sufficient. 'These strategic agreements are crucial for enhancing the IDF's operational endurance and force build-up capabilities,' the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday. Eyal Zamir, the Israeli Ministry of Defense’s Director General, said that the two contracts lay 'the foundations for expanding manufacturing independence in two critical areas for the IDF's operational sustainability' and said the two agreements are initial investments in capabilities that 'will soon gradually expand until we achieve full independence in both areas. This is a central lesson from the war that will enable the IDF to continue operating powerfully in all theaters.' Zamir’s assessment comes a day after the Israeli Prime Minister received a report from the Nagel Committee that was empaneled over the summer to assess future threats to the nation. The committee, chaired by Reserve Brig. Gen. Yaakov Nagel, recommended that Israel always be prepared to defend itself independently and highlighted the importance of armaments and self-sufficiency. 'Wars are won primarily in the military buildup phase, necessitating maximum investment alongside operational readiness,' the committee noted in its report. The ministry did not specify the amounts for each contract with Elbit, but it did say that the first contract relates to the support of 'thousands of heavy air munitions.' For its war in Gaza, which began with Hamas's attack on Israel on Oct. 7, the IDF has partly relied on a stream of US munitions. But the geopolitical fragility of that normally ironclad arrangement was briefly called into question when the US reportedly paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs over Israel's conduct in Gaza. And though the arms shipments have continued, including a new White House approval of some $8 billion in arms at the end of December, it's apparent Israel is seeking a domestic fallback. Similarly, the second contract in the deal is focused on establishing a 'national raw materials plant to produce raw materials that were sourced mainly from abroad before the war,' the ministry said in a statement. 'The new facility will feature advanced production lines for energetic materials that Israel's defense industry uses. This project is expected to strengthen domestic manufacturing independence and reduce reliance on imported raw materials.' 'Both agreements will ensure sovereign capability in producing bombs and munitions of all types. We initiated this historic move before the war but accelerated it during it,' Zamir said. The ministry noted that the two agreements are part of the larger policy to support 'Blue and White' manufacturing in Israeli-owned defense manufacturing. 'The projects are expected to strengthen the economy, expand domestic production lines, and ensure optimal response to the IDF's current and future operational needs,' the ministry added. Early in the war the ministry began to focus on the need to ramp up domestic production and secure supply lines, preparing for a long war effort that had already strained Israel’s economy because 300,000 people were called up for IDF service when the war began. Elbit was already a major supplier of munitions for the IDF prior to the war, receiving a major contract of $760 million in May 2023. In November 2024 Israel also finalized plans to acquire five new warships locally.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/israel-taps-elbit-for-munitions-raw-materials-in-push-for-defense-industrial-independence/	2025-01-08T11:47:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/230801_elbit_155mm_shells-e1716395714402.jpg

(US Army photo by Spc. Orion Magnuson) WASHINGTON — The Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Pacific awarded space and electronic warfare (EW) company BlueHalo $49.9 million to develop technology and provide support for sensors on uncrewed aerial systems (UAS). The nearly $50 million award will be fleshed out over a five year period and calls for BlueHalo to 'deliver hardware, materials and components, engineering services, and integration and operational support' for modular payload EW sensors used on UAS by the US Navy and US Special Operations Command (SOCOM), according to a company release. 'BlueHalo continues to deliver inspired engineering and tactical solutions to help our Nation stay ahead of global threats,' James Batt, BlueHalo Chief Growth Officer, said in the news release. 'NIWC Pacific has relied on our EW sensors to support mission success for more than 15 years. This contract underlines the confidence customers have in BlueHalo to field the very best capabilities when it matters most.' According to the release, this award will help facilitate the NIWC Pacific's 'broader strategy' in maintaining the function of sensors through 'timely repairs and replacements.' BlueHalo is also mandated to train operators on the modular payload systems through the award. BlueHalo has previously provided sensor systems that were deployed on various platforms maintained by NIWC Pacific and 'fielded' by the US government for a number of programs that used both a modular open system approach and a sensor open systems architecture. These include the Group 3 UAS program, SOCOM’s multi-mission tactical UAS program and the mid-endurance UAS program, which are all in support of the Joint Threat Warning System Program Office, the company said. BlueHalo has also won Pentagon contracts with the missile defense agency and the Air Force. Related: The Army’s ‘most challenging’ unmanned threat?

Inside Russia’s plan to build autonomous drone swarms	Remain of Shahed 136 at an exhibition showing remains of missiles and drones that Russia used to attack Kyiv on May 12, 2023 in Kyiv, Ukraine. (Photo by Oleksii Samsonov /Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images) In December 2024 Ukrainian military sources shared with Western media that Russia had started equipping its Shahed-136 strike drones with artificial intelligence. According to Kyiv’s EU Ambassador Vsevolod Chentsov, the upgrade made these drones 'smarter' — better able to evade Ukrainian air defenses and identify high-value targets such as energy infrastructure. This is important because Shahed-type drones, including the Russian version of Shahed (dubbed Geran) and simpler decoy models like the Gerbera, have become Russia’s most frequently used strike drones for daily attacks on Ukraine, and their usage continues to rise. As shown on the figure below, the number of these drones’ deployment has been on a steady growth since they were first used in September 2022. The 'good' news, as much as any news out of Ukraine can be viewed as positive these days, is that a Ukrainian military official clarified to me that the technology currently used in these striking drones is more conventional than it appears, and falls short of creating true autonomous drone swarms. But even so, the capability is yet another sign that Russia is investing heavily to the idea of AI-powered swarms of drones that can overwhelm Ukraine’s defenses. And if the US and its partners do not take action soon, Moscow may well have this capability in the field within the next few years. Let’s start with what Russia apparently has put into the Shahed-136. According to the Ukrainian official, it involves two upgrades to existing technologies. Number of Russian Shahed or Shahed-type drone attacks on Ukraine, by month Source: Ukrainian Air Force, statistics compiled by the author First, the enhanced navigation is likely based on computer vision algorithms rather than advanced AI. The fact that these drones can operate without GPS suggests they use the new generation of Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator (DSMAC), a well-known guidance system that compares images from onboard camera to a pre-loaded terrain map in real time. Therefore, this system cannot be considered true autonomous navigation, a critical prerequisite for transitioning to networked drone swarms. Second, the same computer is likely being loaded with an AI model trained to recognize energy infrastructure. That’s a step toward automated target recognition, but the idea itself is not new to modern striking drones. Still, modern technology allows these models to be trained on smaller datasets and quickly adapt to changing conditions — like new protective anti-drone shelters built around Ukrainian power facilities—enabling onboard software not only to recognize the target but also to pinpoint the most vulnerable spot with high accuracy. The fact these upgrades do not appear to be true AI as dreamed of (or feared by) military planners, they still do represent a threat upgrade. That’s especially concerning when autonomous navigation merges with automatic target recognition and the drone is authorized to engage the target without human supervision. At that point, it becomes a genuinely autonomous weapon system — potentially deployed in swarms. These upgrades to the Shahed-136 already being in the field is a major warning sign that Russia is actively testing and developing unmanned swarming capabilities. In fact, public information reveals that there are four key indicators suggesting this is precisely the direction Russia is moving towards. First, for swarming drones to work, mass production is needed. Russia is already well on its way at the key manufacturing site in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone: According to a CNN report, this factory produced 2,738 Geran drones in 2023, and in 2024 it more than doubled its output to 5,760 units during the first nine months of the year. Serial production has also begun for the so-called 'Gerbera' decoys — simpler plywood-and-foam drones that mimic real Shaheds on radar but cost ten times less. Russia planned to build 10,000 Gerberas by the end of 2024, twice the planned Shahed output. To sustain this surge, Moscow relies on imported components from China. Despite official statements of neutrality, Chinese firms allegedly supply 60 percent of critical drone parts via a network of over 30 companies, fueling the growth of Russia’s drone fleet. Second, there is evidence that the Shahed are being equipped even now with the necessary components for future AI capabilities. A January 2024 leak of classified documents revealed a new Shahed variant labeled 'MS 236,' featuring an electro-optical guidance head — an upgrade displayed in March 2024 during Vladimir Putin’s visit to the Special Technology Center in St. Petersburg. More information came to light in December 2024 following Ukraine’s attack on a Shahed production facility in Alabuga. Defense Intelligence reported the facility was stocked with enough parts for 400 Shaheds, including thermal imaging cameras and navigation systems. Equipping drones with these sensors allow the drone to do mid-flight reorientation and not to rely solely on preloaded coordinates. While earlier versions of Shahed drone still depended on an operator, integrating machine vision moves the Shahed closer to autonomous navigation and automated target recognition. A third step is the way Russia is in the early stages of using both quantity and technological upgrades to unleash coordinated mass attacks, which would be a key tactic for AI enabled drone swarms. Early signs of this approach have already appeared with the 'Gerbera' decoys, which reportedly employ mesh modems allowing them to share data and form a sort of a swarm. These modems can relay real-time information such as each drone’s position, operational status, and any detection of electronic countermeasures, enabling the swarm to reroute and remain effective. Meanwhile, Shaheds equipped with electro-optical sensors can carry out target identification missions in real time, paving the way for a subsequent wave of numerous drones to strike. By combining autonomous navigation, AI-enabled target detection system, and data sharing, Russia is moving closer to deploying large-scale, coordinated drone swarms that require minimal human input. Of course, to make an autonomous swarm work, Russia needs to get its artificial intelligent software up to snuff, which is the fourth place where we can see clear investments. Russia is doubling down on this front, relying on partner countries to evade sanctions and secure much-needed technology. In March 2024, for instance, Russia and Iran signed a memorandum of understanding on AI development to enhance 'technological and cultural dialogue' and to conduct research of AI applications. Additionally, Russian institutions, such as Moscow State University, are collaborating with Iranian universities to develop advanced AI algorithms for robotics, signaling that these international partnerships may soon channel AI breakthroughs into autonomous unmanned systems. A further indication of Russia’s AI push — even under Western sanctions — appeared in December 2024, when President Vladimir Putin announced the launch of an AI alliance within BRICS. He unveiled the new 'AI Alliance Network,' initially bringing together 20 companies from Russia, Brazil, India, China, Iran, and the UAE — a portion of a larger pool of 50 international businesses reportedly ready to join. Despite Western chip export bans, Russia’s AI sector has raised its spending on equipment by 40 percent in 2024, contributing to a 10.5 percent increase in technology output. Finally, on Dec. 30, President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian Government and Sberbank, the Russian leading institution and investor in AI development, to collaborate with China on artificial intelligence research. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin and Sberbank CEO Herman Gref must submit a roadmap for collaboration by April 30, 2025. These are all the moves of a player serious about hitting its ambitious goals for AI development, systematically building partnerships to secure both the hardware and software essential to its war machine. Compounding the challenge, Russia shares military technology advancements and battlefield lessons with allies such as China and Iran, deepening the risk of speeding up deployment of fully autonomous AI-driven weapon systems. To counter this growing threat, the United States must (1) expand export controls and sanctions beyond directly involved Russian entities, encompassing the broader network of middlemen, shell companies, and covert operatives in third countries; and (2) prioritize blocking Russia’s access to AI-related expertise and knowledge by limiting academic and research connections with both state-owned and private Russian institutions, and ensure more stringent visa reviews for individuals involved in sensitive fields. By combining these measures with incentives for western private AI firms and universities worldwide to avoid partnerships with sanctioned Russian organizations, Washington can more effectively constrain Moscow’s ability to make progress in developing autonomous weapon systems in mass, such as Shahed and Gerbera drones.

Army restarts work on new HADES spy plane program	A Bombardier Global 6500 aircraft. (Bombardier via US Army) WASHINGTON — The US Army has officially restarted work on its new spy plane after the Government Accountability Office (GAO) denied L3Harris’s contract protest late last month, according to a service spokesperson. The release of the stop work order was signed out on Monday, essentially enabling the Sierra Nevada Corporation (SNC) to resume integration work on the High Accuracy Detection and Exploitation System (HADES) program. 'The memo to SNC stated all activities associated with the specified work activity, including administrative actions, procurement, physical work, submittals, subcontracts, etc., pertaining to subject contract are back in full force and effect,' the Army spokesperson told Breaking Defense today. If the Army's HADES program stays on track, the service plans to have an initial aircraft ready for the force by the end of 2026 or early 2027. In all, the service could acquire more than a dozen aircraft under a one-per-year buy, depending on budgets and the threat analysis. In August 2024, the Army selected SNC to convert Bombardier’s Global 6500 business jets into an intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platform for the HADES program. An industry team composed of L3Harris, Leidos and MAG Aerospace had also bid on the program to replace the legacy fleet of RC-12 Guardrail turboprop aircraft. In October, L3Harris filed a protest with the GAO, and the Army halted SNC’s HADES work until the government watchdog agency issued its ruling. The GAO issued its verdict on Dec. 23 and later released a redacted 21-page report noting that it denied the protest in part and dismissed it in part. The GAO report included details about how the Army ranked both teams' final proposals. When it came to cost, the L3Harris team’s projected price tag came in at $133 million, while SNC was at $93 million, or $40 million less. As for the technical evaluation, the service rated the L3Harris bid as 'unacceptable' and SNC’s as 'outstanding.' Specifically, in the design and integration subcategory L3Harris was given an 'unacceptable' and SNC was given a 'outstanding.' For their certification approaches, L3Harris was again marked as 'unacceptable' while SNC received a 'good.' Both teams received 'good' scores for their Modular Open System Approach and maintenance and operations plans. 'L3Harris challenges nearly every aspect of the agency’s evaluation and source selection decision, including the evaluation of proposals under the technical factor, the cost/price evaluation, and the eligibility of the awardee,' the GAO wrote. 'We find that the agency reasonably concluded that the protester’s proposal was unacceptable under the technical factor due to four deficiencies, rendering the proposal ineligible for award,' it later added. 'The protester’s allegations in this regard are based on SNC’s corporate conversion to Sierra Nevada Company, LLC in September 2023,' the GAO wrote. 'Based on our review of the record, we find that these arguments do not provide a basis to sustain the protest.' SNC did not immediately respond to questions today about the GAO report, and L3Harris declined to comment beyond past statements. Last month the company said it would weigh its options and determine it next steps.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-restarts-work-on-new-hades-spy-plane-program/	2025-01-08T08:50:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240103_bombardier_hades_army-e1704312802342.jpg
Army’s CECOM levels up modernization with rapid software updates, new AI tools	Sgt. Keila Peters tests the Tactical Computing Environment software at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland, in October 2019. (Photo by Daniel Lafontaine US Army Combat Capabilities Development Command C5ISR) WASHINGTON — From faster software delivery to new artificial intelligence tools, the Army has taken strides to enhance the technological resilience of its warfighters and the service at large over the past few years. Far from the heroics and high drama of combat, it's this kind of behind-the-scenes heavy lifting that could decide a future conflict, and much of that lifting is being done in a little-discussed Army organization called the Communications Electronics Command, or CECOM — part of Army Material Command. Within CECOM lies the software engineering center (SEC) which has been focusing on three main areas to help the service level up its digital modernization, SEC's director told Breaking Defense in a recent interview: speeding up software delivery, creating a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform and developing a new AI tool. Garrett Shoemaker said that historically SEC has been a sustainment organization that ensures the Army’s command, control, communications, computers, cyber and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C5ISR) capabilities remain operational and secure. As the service developed a sharper focus on digital modernization, the SEC has inherited a more developmental role in such capabilities. 'We're adapting and modernizing with the Army. What excites me is that it really opens the aperture of who we are as an organization. We now can provide cradle-to-grave software services for Army organizations,' he said. However, 'it’s not enough to just develop software,' he added. 'We need to get it into the hands of soldiers at the time of need.' Shoemaker said after several months of trying, his office is now able to update software in the field within 72 hours. Such software includes that on radar systems belonging to airborne platforms like the Chinook and Apache helicopters or ground based platforms like the Duke system, which counters remote controlled improvised explosive devices. 'The result is, as we're able to detect, identify and defeat those threats, we're saving soldiers' lives every day,' Shoemaker said. 'We're able to adapt very quickly and update our software to those new threats, whether it be in a specific AOR [area of responsibility], whether it be a specific threat, a ground pace threat or an air based threat, we're able to adapt our software extremely quickly and provide that to the soldiers so they're protected from them' he said. 'If it has a signal and it can threaten our platforms, we can detect it and defeat it,' he added. Another behind-the-scenes effort by SEC is the creation of its own CI/CD platform. In simple terms, CI is the practice in which small pieces of new code are automatically added to an organization's software repository and then go through an automated testing phase with the rest of the code within the repository to make sure the new code will work seamlessly with the already existing code. This happens after each integration and ensures that bugs are spotted at an early stage in the development process. CD is the process that occurs after these automated tests are completed and passed, in which the new code is then automatically released to the repository and can further be deployed for production. Shoemaker said now that SEC’s CI/CD platform is operational within his organization, his office is working with the Army’s Chief Information Office to get the platform certified so it can be used by other organizations within the Army so they don’t have to build their own CI/CD platform. 'It's really become something we see as a core capability within the center,' Shoemaker said. 'That, first of all, is an efficiency, because we can save a lot of money by being able to do that in one environment, rather than building multiple duplicative environments. Then also, we're able to modernize it as new tools become available, we're able to integrate them into the platform to provide greater capability to our teams.' In today's day digital age, it would be an anomaly if artificial intelligence wasn’t at the forefront of a software center’s list of ambitions. Shoemaker told Breaking Defense that one of SEC’s proudest accomplishments is building A.I. Flow, an experimental program that uses Microsoft Azure Government open AI structure to assist in various tasks such as contract writing and sorting through request for proposal and request for information responses. (SEC started developing A.I Flow nearly 18 months ago.) SEC partnered with Army Contracting Command (ACC) to set standards for the program by uploading example documents to create a framework for a justification and approval document — a piece of DoD contracting that is required for solicitations. The Army reported that A.I. Flow was able to generate a justification and approval document that was 80 percent complete. This usually takes up to days or weeks, but was completed in minutes, the Army said. A.I. Flow also enables users to track metrics to show how much time, money and resources were saved by using the tool. 'One thing I encourage within our organization is to experiment and see where we can provide better value to the army. What grew out of that was A.I flow, and we've had great reception from anybody. We've shown that we're seeing a lot of different use cases that we didn't even consider when we first started building,' Shoemaker said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/armys-cecom-levels-up-modernization-with-rapid-software-updates-new-ai-tools/	2025-01-08T08:14:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/6471199-scaled-e1736347334492.jpg
US should fortify, expand airbases to ward off ‘menace’ of Chinese threat: Report	U.S. Air Force F-16 Fighting Falcons from the Colorado Air National Guard's 120th Fighter Squadron taxi for takeoff during a training sortie June 7, 2017, at Kadena Air Base, Japan. (U.S. Air Force photo by Naoto Anazawa) WASHINGTON — A relative shortfall of air base fortifications on the part of the US has created an 'imbalance' in the Indo-Pacific that favors China, requiring renewed American efforts to shore up base defenses as a potential war with Beijing looms, according to a new think tank report. Since 2010, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has undertaken a vast campaign to expand and reinforce its own airfields resulting in significantly more runways and over 3,000 aircraft shelters — the latter enough to cover the 'vast majority' of Beijing’s combat aircraft, Hudson Institute authors Thomas Shugart and Tim Walton write in their report 'Concrete Sky: Air Base Hardening in the Western Pacific.' American efforts, by contrast, have remained 'modest' in recent years with much smaller growth of aircraft shelters and ramp space, the report says. In the event of a war over Taiwan, where observers fear China may invade and invite a US response, the report notes that greater Chinese airfield capacity within range of the island nation 'creates an imbalance in which PLA forces would need to fire far fewer &#8216;shots' to suppress or destroy US, allied, and partner airfields than the converse.' Some American efforts, like the Air Force’s Agile Combat Employment method to disperse operations, have been rolled out in response to the rising threat of China, but the report argues that more is needed to protect vulnerable aircraft parked on the ground amid the advent of precision weapons. The report offers three specific initiatives for policymakers to pursue, with the first aimed at inducing China to spend more on defenses and less on offensive capabilities as a result. According to the authors, the US should field cheaper and more easily-produced standoff and stand-in munitions that could hold relevant airfield targets at risk, and which could be paired with other measures like new concepts of operation. Secondly, the report calls for improving the 'resilience' of air base infrastructure, particularly by building more aircraft shelters and expanding airfields — including for bases in the US. The authors warn planners not to have the 'distorted perception' of hardened shelters as 'an anachronism' just because American forces made such quick work on them in the Gulf War. They still have value for defense, especially when complemented with effective, active air defenses. Policymakers should focus on other ways to make bases themselves more resilient as well, including by ensuring damage can be rapidly repaired and that the proper 'low-cost and high-capacity' kinetic and non-kinetic defenses are in place, the report says. RELATED: &#8216;Sanctuary' no longer: New Air Force plan seeks to rejuvenate installations The report’s third initiative calls for evolving the US’s force design toward long-endurance aircraft that can operate from distant locations and spend considerable time in the air, as well as systems that can fly from damaged or non-existent runways. Regardless of the fate of projects like a next-gen fighter or futuristic tanker for the Air Force, which would likely satisfy requirements for operating at relevant ranges and in contested airspaces, the report notes that military planners 'cannot hope future aircraft procurement will obviate its current need to enhance the resilience of its airfield operations.' 'Worldwide, US airfields face the threat of attack,' the report says. 'The US Department of Defense can continue to largely ignore this menace, inviting PRC [People’s Republic of China] aggression and potentially losing a war, or it can face the reality and organize and resource its forces and infrastructure to prevail.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/us-should-fortify-expand-airbases-to-ward-off-menace-of-chinese-threat-report/	2025-01-08T05:02:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/F-16-kadena-scaled-e1736283319432.jpg
US completes $9B B61-12 nuclear warhead upgrade	Workers at Sandia National Labs prep a B61-12 for a safety test. (NNSA) WASHINGTON — Seventeen years after it began design and development, the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) has completed work on the B61-12 nuclear warhead, the agency announced today. The Last Production Unit of the upgraded warhead was completed on Dec. 18, roughly three years after production formally started on America’s updated nuclear gravity bomb. An October 2024 report from the agency [PDF] put the total program cost at around $9 billion. 'Completing the B61-12 on schedule is the latest example of what we’ve been saying for several years now: NNSA is delivering capabilities at the pace and scale needed by our Department of Defense partners and our deterrence requirements,' NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby said in the announcement. While the Defense Department has oversight on the delivery systems for nuclear weapons, nuclear warhead modernization is run through the NNSA, a semi-independent branch of the Department of Energy. The B61-12 life-extension program consolidated the older B61-3, -4, -7 and -10 variants while updating with newer technologies. Technically, B61-12 is not a 'new' nuclear weapon that increases the stockpile, as the US is taking the warheads from the older bombs and placing them in new housings. In 2020, the F-15E became the first jet to be certified to carry the B61-12, and in March Breaking Defense first reported that the weapon has been certified on the F-35A. According to the October 2024 report from the NNSA, it has also been certified to fly on the B-2, F-16, and German Air Force PA-200 Tornado jets, and is working towards certification on the Italian Air Force’s Tornados and the US Air Force’s B-21 bomber. Notably, the agency announcement says that with 'production of the B61-12 LEP now complete, NNSA will transition to producing the B61-13 bomb.' The B61-13, announced in October 2023, is designed to have a higher-yield in the range of a 360 kiloton blast, which would represent a major step up from the 50 kiloton B61-12. A first production unit on the B61-13 is scheduled for fiscal 2026, according to the announcement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/us-completes-9b-b61-12-nuclear-warhead-upgrade/	2025-01-07T12:50:36-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/03/b61-test-e1710272177859.jpg
Joint European force launches AI-enabled tool to track Russia’s shadow fleet, monitor undersea cables	The Russian oil tanker Eagle S is suspected of causing undersea cable damage in the Baltic Sea (Finnish Border Guard) BELFAST — The multinational Joint Expeditionary Force (JEF) has activated a new operation centered around a UK-led and artificial intelligence (AI) based reaction system capable of assessing threats to undersea cables and monitoring movements of Russia’s shadow fleet. Dubbed Nordic Warden, the operation began last week, said the UK Ministry of Defence in a Monday statement and follows reports of a Russian oil tanker suspected of causing damage to the Estlink undersea cable in the Baltic Sea. Key to the operation is an AI-developed computer program that can examine data from a 'range of sources, including the Automatic Identification System (AIS) ships use to broadcast their position, to calculate the risk posed by each vessel entering areas of interest,' according to the MoD. 'Specific vessels identified as being part of Russia’s shadow fleet have been registered into the system so they can be closely monitored when approaching key areas of interest.' Should a suspicious vessel be identified, the system can use real time tracking and instantly send a warning to JEF members and other NATO allies. London also explained that Nordic Warden demonstrates how JEF is employing 'innovative technologies to boost European security, while supporting and complementing NATO’s own operations.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer added, 'Growth and national security are vital to our Plan for Change, which is why this government is working closely with our allies to protect critical national infrastructure, such as undersea cables.' In a statement coinciding with the UK announcement, JEF said that it is 'concerned about the recent damage to the Estlink-2 power cable and several data undersea cables in the Baltic Sea on 25 December 2024.' It condemned the incident as one which had caused 'direct economic and security implications for Finland and Estonia.' Finland has taken firm action in response to the alleged Russian sabotage, launching an investigation and seizing the Eagle S tanker. Last week, Finland's National Bureau of Investigation said that it was 'about to' wrap up seabed related activities related to the probe, according to a statement. Prior to the latest incident, Ben Key, First Sea Lord of the UK Royal Navy, had admitted NATO nations were struggling to deal with attacks on undersea cables and connectors because of rights associated with territorial ownership and international maritime conventions. In 2023, he singled out JEF as a potential aid to counter the problem, because it could provide 'some agility in the sub threshold space.' The 10 nation expeditionary body is made up of Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/joint-expeditionary-force-launches-russian-shadow-fleet-undersea-cable-ai-tracking-system/	2025-01-07T12:12:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/9b0be5c6-88c5-5421-44ed-36f42a0d7a7b-e1736271996333.jpg
Navy would need billions more than estimated to build future fleet: CBO	Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group and Cavour Carrier Strike Group sail in formation. The United States Navy and the Italian Navy held the first-ever bilateral Multi-Large Deck Event (MLDE) in the Indo-Pacific. (US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist Seaman Apprentice Daniel Kimmelman) WASHINGTON — Independent government auditors estimate the US Navy’s latest long-term shipbuilding plans will cost 46 percent more than historical congressional appropriations have provided and 17 percent more than the service projects. That analysis comes from a new report published Monday by the Congressional Budget Office, which is statutorily tasked with analyzing the Navy’s annual 30-year, long-range shipbuilding plans. The 2025 version of that document focuses on achieving a fleet of 381 manned ships, a target established a 2023 Navy assessment formally called the Battle Force Ship Assessment and Requirement report. The latest shipbuilding plan offers two shipbuilding profiles: one supported by the Biden administration and an alternative that assumes lower funding levels from future lawmakers. CBO’s analysis focuses on the profile supported by the administration. 'The Navy’s 2025 plan would cost 46 percent more annually in real terms … than the average amount appropriated over the past 5 years,' according to the new report. 'CBO estimates that total shipbuilding costs would average $40 billion (in 2024 dollars) over the next 30 years, which is about 17 percent more than the Navy estimates.' Auditors also project that to operate and maintain those ships, purchase aircraft and weapons, and fund the Marine Corps, the total Navy budget would have to jump from $255 billion today to $340 billion in 2054. (CBO routinely adjusts its estimates to remove the effect of future inflation.) Historically, the Navy’s price estimates are always more optimistic than CBO because predicting future shipbuilding costs requires analysts to make a series of assumptions about the costs of labor and materials, as well as the capabilities and characteristics of new vessels. The further out into the future an estimate reaches, the less certain analysts can be about the bottom-line price. The chaos inflicted on the defense industrial base by the COVID-19 pandemic is one example of a factor that had significant impact on shipbuilding costs but was impossible for CBO or the Navy to predict prior to 2020. Both CBO and the Navy acknowledge the costs of the 2025 plan have risen over the three options laid out in the 2024 shipbuilding plan. Auditors’ projections show an increase of between 7 and 16 percent while the Navy's estimates are between 5 and 14 percent. 'The growth in costs reflected in the Navy’s and CBO’s estimates for the 2025 plan is attributable to both an increase in the estimated costs of many shipbuilding programs and to the larger number of ships that the Navy would purchase under that plan compared with what it would have purchased under the alternatives in the 2024 plan,' according to CBO’s report. One key price tag neither CBO nor the Navy can predict yet is the costs of the future unmanned fleet. The service’s 2023 assessment concluded that the fleet should contain 134 unmanned ships, but due to the technology’s early stages — as well as levels of uncertainty about that fleet’s final composition from the Navy — the new report does not make any estimates about its price tag.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/us-navys-future-fleet-could-cost-46-percent-more-than-recent-budgets-cbo/	2025-01-07T11:02:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/8580602-scaled-e1733847381422.jpg
4 ways Trump should work with the China Commission to secure supply chains	Central Computer Processor digital concept (Getty images) When Donald Trump takes office at noon on Jan. 20, 2025, he will face a very different threat environment from when he left office four years ago. In particular, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) that he will confront will not only be the pacing threat that he identified during his first term, but will pose an even greater challenge than the Soviet Union did during the Cold War. The PRC is wealthier, in both absolute terms and relative to the United States, than was the Soviet Union. While COVID damaged both the American and Chinese economies, Beijing has nonetheless seen its GDP grow from $14.8 trillion in 2020 to about $18 trillion today. And China has more levers of power than its Soviet predecessor, able to mobilize its academics, media, businesses, diplomats and military to compete with Washington. Perhaps the greatest difference between China and the USSR: America is fully intertwined economically, including on supply chains with the PRC. And while that’s an issue lawmakers have been working to figure out, the focus all too often is only on what matters for cutting edge technologies, ignoring that China holds key positions in less noticed, less sexy supply chains that can nonetheless have devastating consequences. In 2019, for example, 'China accounted for 95 percent of U.S. imports of ibuprofen, 91 percent of U.S. imports of hydrocortisone, 70 percent of U.S. imports of acetaminophen, 40 to 45 percent of U.S. imports of penicillin and 40 percent of U.S. imports of heparin, according to Commerce Department data.' As Rosemary Gibson, author of China Rx, has noted, 'Medicines can be used as a weapon of war against the United States.' Similarly, although the PRC has not established a globally competitive position in terms of the most advanced logic chips, it holds a strong position in terms of 'legacy chips.' As defined in the CHIPS Act, legacy chips are semiconductors built on process nodes that are 28nm or larger. A far cry from the logic chips that are currently at 7nm and pushing 2nm nodes, but legacy chips are essential parts of virtually every piece of equipment that uses electronics, from microwaves to automobiles to combine harvesters to fighter jets. To address these threats, the Trump administration can leverage the bipartisan efforts of the House Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party (aka, the House China Committee). This committee has emerged as a vital platform for examining and recommending policies to counter China’s strategic maneuvers. By working alongside this body, the administration can engage in a truly broad-based, bipartisan effort to counter China’s supply chain position, and prioritize the development of strategies that directly target vulnerabilities. To reduce reliance on China, the administration must adopt an innovative and multi-pronged strategy that incorporates both domestic reforms and international collaboration: These measures will inevitably have trade-offs, including higher consumer costs and potential retaliation from China. However, prioritizing national security while mitigating economic impact requires a clear, forward-looking strategy. Just weeks after the US election, China banned exports of gallium, germanium and antimony. These minerals are critical for US defense manufacturers because they are essential in advanced technologies, including semiconductors, defense systems, and renewable energy. Gallium and germanium are key in producing high-performance chips used in radar, communication systems, and military electronics. The restriction highlights vulnerabilities in the global supply chain for strategic materials, underscoring the importance of securing alternative sources to sustain US defense capabilities and technological development. Efforts to reduce dependency on China align with growing bipartisan consensus that economic resilience is inseparable from national security. A secure and resilient supply chain of both cutting edge technologies and the broader range of critical strategic resources not only underpins military readiness but also protects critical infrastructure and ensures America’s ability to maintain its global leadership. As the House China Committee underscores, confronting these challenges head-on is crucial to countering China's ambitions and ensuring US sovereignty. Long-term investments in infrastructure, innovation, and allied collaboration will strengthen the US supply chain against future disruptions. Programs that incentivize advanced manufacturing and encourage partnerships with allied nations will position the United States as a leader in critical sectors such as clean energy, semiconductors, and rare earth processing. The Trump administration has an opportunity to act decisively, leveraging the House China Committee’s insights and bipartisan support for supply chain reforms. By addressing these vulnerabilities with urgency, foresight, and innovation, the United States can secure its economic future, protect its citizens, and counter China’s strategic threats in a complex global landscape. The actions taken today will shape America’s ability to navigate the challenges of tomorrow and reaffirm its position as a global leader.

Air Force clears BAE’s F-15 electronic warfare kit for full rate production	An F-15EX fighter jet taxis to its parking spot at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio (US Air Force) WASHINGTON — A new electronic warfare kit for the Air Force’s F-15 fleet has been cleared to enter full-rate production, the Pentagon announced. 'BAE Systems is currently on schedule in support of Boeing’s F-15 EPAWSS LRIP [low-rate initial production] activities and is looking forward to supporting Boeing in the FRP [full rate production] phase of the program,' Kevin Fournier, EPAWSS Program Director at BAE Systems, said in a statement to Breaking Defense. Boeing confirmed receipt of the award but declined to comment more broadly. EPAWSS completed operational testing last year, and a June 2024 Government Accountability Office report [PDF] found that officials aimed to proceed to full-rate production before October 2024. A full-rate decision typically signifies satisfying criteria like design maturity and confidence in an underlying manufacturing process, paving the way to produce a system at a greater rate. Electronic warfare systems like EPAWSS help pilots survive in contested battlespaces by alerting them to dangers like enemy radars and offering tools to jam them in response, among other features. Underscored by conflicts like the war in Ukraine, officials frequently emphasize the need to quickly retool EW systems to combat emerging threats in the electromagnetic spectrum. Pointing to a demand for effective EW capabilities in the modern battlefield, Boeing officials have said they are exploring ways to turn the F-15EX into a platform similar to the Navy’s EA-18G Growler electronic attack jet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/air-force-clears-baes-f-15-electronic-warfare-kit-for-full-rate-production/	2025-01-07T08:54:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240216_f15ex_taxi_6959449-e1708094519988.jpg
Leonardo unveils British Navy Proteus rotary wing UAS final design	Leonardo's Proteus Rotary Wing UAS demonstrator is aligned with the Royal Navy’s Maritime Aviation Transformation (MATx) strategy – a long term Fleet Air Arm evolution plan that stretches to 2040. (Leonardo) BELFAST — Leonardo has released the final design of the Proteus Rotary Wing Uncrewed Air System (RWUAS) demonstrator, under development for the UK Royal Navy, ahead of its first flight expected later this year. Bearing resemblance to the manufacturer’s AW09 light single-engine helicopter, the three-ton aircraft is distinguished by a five blade main rotor system and modular payload bay. In a company statement today, Leonardo said that Proteus 'will be used to demonstrate advances in autonomy and payload modularity and interchangeability, whilst developing cutting-edge new rotorcraft technologies including design and manufacturing techniques.' Proteus sits under a four-year RWUAS Technology Demonstration Programme (TDP) contract, valued at £60 million ($75 million) and issued to Leonardo by the UK Ministry of Defence in July 2022. The demonstrator is aligned with the Royal Navy’s Maritime Aviation Transformation (MATx) strategy — a long term Fleet Air Arm evolution plan that stretches to 2040. Leonardo noted that the strategy includes 'building mass at sea and supporting future anti-submarine warfare missions.' To reduce design costs and quicken the pace of Proteus aircraft development, the manufacturer has also drawn heavily on 'components' from within the company’s helicopter and UAS portfolio. The Proteus technology demonstrator aircraft’s design has been unveiled by Leonardo @RoyalNavy and @DefenceHQ’s @DefenceES Future Capability Innovation (FCI) team. The circa three-tonne uncrewed rotorcraft will be used to demonstrate advances in autonomy and payload modularity… pic.twitter.com/hk5WQmAUE3 &mdash; Leonardo Helicopters (@LDO_Helicopters) January 7, 2025 'This design will demonstrate the viability of large UAS in the maritime environment and will function as a test bed for the development and demonstration of autonomous capability,' it added. 'This includes flight control laws and algorithms for large autonomous Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) aircraft.' Leonardo labels its production facility in Yeovil, southwest England, as the 'Home of British Helicopters,' and said that the site 'maintains an aggressive autonomy development roadmap, which covers the capabilities required to conduct autonomous flight and deliver mission capability.' The manufacturer has leaned on autonomy and cutting edge technology to support development of Proteus, which includes a digital twin and 'more than 40 components manufactured with advanced composite materials and the use of AI in its control software.' As Breaking Defense previously reported, Leonardo had settled on an assessment of 'potential systems' for integration before moving to a final aircraft design, with a model displayed at DSEI in 2023 largely based around intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance, as well as maritime and logistics supply missions. Leonardo did not share details of key subsystems that will be integrated on Proteus, including an engine type, though France's Safran Arriel 2K engine, the AW09 powerplant, stands out as an obvious candidate. Phil Bartlett, head of future programs at Leonardo Helicopters UK told Breaking Defense in a statement that Proteus first flight preparations — a milestone set for mid-2025 — are 'progressing at pace.' 'We're pulling together a range of exciting new technologies for the Proteus demonstrator, so there's a lot to do and a lot of moving parts to get in place before that happens, but the team are highly motivated to deliver this key milestone and we're really seeing the benefits of our use of digital engineering techniques such as digital twinning,' he added. Echoing such sentiment, James Morris, UK Defence Equipment and Support, Future Capability Innovation maritime head, said in comments to media, 'This is an exciting and novel project that demonstrates collaboration, new ways of working with industry, the application of Agile principles and highlights how DE&amp;S can work at speed to deliver ground-breaking capabilities into the Royal Navy.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/leonardo-unveils-british-navy-proteus-rotary-wing-uas-final-design/	2025-01-07T07:12:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/image001-1-e1736259614244.png
How China’s new next-gen fighters could impact America’s plans for NGAD	A Boeing rendering of a next-gen fighter. (Boeing photo) SYDNEY — On Dec. 26, the People's Republic of China celebrated the birthday of its founder Mao Zedong by unofficially unveiling two new advanced aircraft designs. And while details on those jets are thin, experts tell Breaking Defense that there are hints about how the new systems could impact American interests in the region. The planes appear in videos that leaked out on social media. It's unclear the provenance of the videos, but the fact they penetrated China's formidable firewalls and have remained online indicates that the 'leaks' have official sanction. The videos show two planes of previously unknown design. The larger plane, which appears as an advanced flying wing design somewhat reminiscent of the American B-2 and B-21 bombers, has been dubbed in public discussions as the Chengdu J-36, called such because it is believed to have flown from Chengdu Aircraft Corporation’s (CAC) headquarters. The second plane, which is less clear, appears to be fighter sized and likely came from Shenyang Aerospace Corporation (SAC). Several experts on advanced Chinese and US aircraft say the larger J-36 is probably designed for long-range operations and to carry a large weapons load. (CAC also builds China's premier fighter, the stealthy J-20.) 'The tailless design is intended to be stealthy and the delta-wing design is intended to give it long-range. It is about the same size as a strike-fighter, so I don’t think it is intended to be a B-21 [bomber] analog,' Bryan Clark, an expert at the Hudson Institute in Washington, said in an email to Breaking Defense. What is the J-36 being built to do? pic.twitter.com/IZ9BlwjoOc &mdash; Justin Bronk (@Justin_Br0nk) December 26, 2024 'With respect to the actual CCP advanced aircraft, these don’t look like aircraft with traditional air to air characteristics,' Dave Deptula, the head of the Air and Space Force's Association's Mitchell Institute, said in an email to Breaking Defense. 'More like very stealthy with large payload bays (to carry long-range weapons) so they can get close enough to get off first shots against U.S. high value aircraft…and/or deliver ordnance (missiles or bombs) against U.S./allied high value surface targets, to include surface ships.' Malcom Davis, a China expert at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told Breaking Defense in an email that the 'large weapons bay on the J-36 gives it the ability to be an excellent long-range air interceptor that would be optimized against US and allied combat support platforms such as AWACS/AEW, tankers, and other reconnaissance MPA-type platforms.' That 'would make it more difficult for US Navy carrier aviation to project power inside the first island chain, if their key combat support platforms cannot survive in the face of a high-speed, long range, stealthy interceptor like the J-36,' David said. The Chinese have long made much of their long-range and high-speed missiles like the DF-21, with its presumed ability to strike US carriers and targets such as Guam. Because the smaller, second aircraft is harder to see, experts had less to weigh in on. But Davis posited that 'its fully maneuverable tail fins are highly innovative, allowing superior stealth when flat and superior maneuverability when active.' He thinks the SAC is a shorter-range platform, with less payload than the J-36, 'so maybe its optimized for operations within the first island chain, whilst the CAC J-36 has much greater speed and range and payload,' Davis said. 'Simply put, we need more information on the SAC platform to make sensible analysis, and this is why most analysis is on the CAC platform.' While the Peoples Liberation Army may have flown two new aircraft, the question is how they can impact American strategic thinking. As a whole, Chinese aircraft 'appear to be well behind their US counterparts in stealth, sensor fusion, and speed/maneuverability,' Clark said. 'This is because, while the PRC can steal or emulate the exterior elements of a US design, the mission systems, stealth coatings, and propulsion/control technologies inside are either highly-classified and therefore hard to access or difficult to replicate with indigenous Chinese technology.' He and Davis both pointed to the Chinese struggles to build jet engines with high-quality and durable turbines. 'China’s jet engine and avionics industries are immature, which is why COMAC has not been able to field a viable commercial aircraft until recently and even that aircraft is only being purchased by Chinese carriers who don’t have a choice. Many of China’s military and commercial aircraft depend on western propulsion and avionics parts,' Clark said. The reality, Clark said, is oftentimes the Chinese build weapon systems that physically mimic what the US has in order to 'demonstrate China’s technical prowess and suggest the PLA is not behind the US in weapons development.' Still, he and other experts painted the J-36 as a potential counterpart to the American Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) program — which is currently in a reassessment phase with no guarantee of coming to full fruition. The images of the J-36 should give American planners incentive to keep NGAD moving forward, argued Deptula. The market appears to agree. At the start of the new year, stock analyst Scott Deuschle of Deutsche Bank downgraded Lockheed Martin stock from a Buy to Hold in part because of the appearance of the Chinese jets. He said they made the case for the F-35 less compelling and increased the need for NGAD. The developments in China are likely to accelerate the need for NGAD, and the ultimate success in fielding NGAD by the early-mid 2030s could…partially cut into the F-35 procurement program,' Deuschle said. Davis believes the J-36's appearance 'will inject new urgency into the US NGAD/FA-XX programs, as well as GCAP. There will be concern, especially in the new Trump Administration, that China could steal a lead in next generation (or sixth generation) aircraft.' He points out that 'NGAD is on hold pending review in the Trump Admin — and I'm willing to bet Trump will say &#8216;damn the torpedoes' and fund the full project simply to avoid being left in the wake of the CAC-J-36 and whatever may follow. GCAP too will become much more urgent in terms of delivery, and the large size of the J-36 — and the configuration of GCAP — may drive US designers to think about a larger platform, where speed, stealth, payload and range are more important.' Davis predicted the Chinese will push hard and fast to deploy these new aircraft. 'You will recall how quickly the Chinese moved to deploy the J-20 operationally after its first flight in 2011, and the Chinese will be incentivized to repeat or improve on that, most notably because the CAC J-36 and the SAC platforms will light a fire under the USAF/USN and DoD re NGAD and F/A-XX,' Davis wrote. 'Beijing won't want to waste an opportunity to humiliate the US by operationally deploying a sixth-gen platform before the US. So I'm tipping we won't be waiting ten years for this to enter service — look for the J-36 in particular to enter service before the end of this decade.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/how-chinas-new-next-gen-fighters-could-impact-americas-plans-for-ngad/	2025-01-06T23:55:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/Boeing-R1-scaled-e1718985449640.jpg
Ligado files Chapter 11, commences restructuring to slash debt burden	As part of its post-bankruptcy restructuring plan, Ligado has signed an agreement with AST SpaceMobile to lease some of its spectrum for satellite-to-phone communications. (Image: Getty) WASHINGTON — Ligado Networks today announced it has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and is putting in place a restructuring plan that the company says will reduce its current debt load of $8.6 billion to approximately $1.2 billion — in large part financed by a deal with satellite-to-phone company AST SpaceMobile. In addition, creditors holding some 88 percent of the firm's debt have agreed under the restructuring plan 'to provide $115 million of additional incremental financing to fund Ligado during the restructuring process,' the Ligado press release explained. The bankruptcy, filed in the US Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, is itself not a surprise. The company has been signaling that might be an option since last year when it sued the Defense and Commerce Departments for allegedly 'seizing' its L-band spectrum license. That license was granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in 2020, but the DoD, Commerce and a number of other government agencies have been protesting the decision ever since, arguing that Ligado's plan to use that spectrum for cellular communications rather than traditional satellite communications would dangerously interfere with GPS signals widely used by the military, commercial aviation and myriad other industries for positioning, timing and navigation. Ligado has contested that claim. The deal with AST calls for the firm to lease 45 MHz of Ligado's mid-band spectrum — the same spectrum at the center of the DoD controversy — for use by its satellites in low Earth orbit providing connectivity with cellular telephones. That was something of a surprise move for AST, according to veteran telecommunications consultant Tim Farrar. 'The transaction associated with [Ligado's bankruptcy] is fairly unexpected, in terms of AST agreeing to lease their spectrum, because AST has been all about partnerships with cellular operators and using terrestrial spectrum &#8230; and building satellites to operate in lower frequencies,' he said. 'It's really a sort of 180 degree turn for AST to basically go and move to MSS [mobile satellite service] spectrum and move to these higher frequencies, where as they had said they were much better off with the low frequencies which were going to penetrate buildings.' According to Ligado's press release, AST 'has agreed to provide Ligado, subject to certain conditions precedent, with approximately $113 million of AST SpaceMobile warrants, and usage rights payments to fund Ligado’s payments under certain spectrum agreements. Additionally, Ligado will receive economic participation in AST SpaceMobile’s direct-to-device business in the U.S. and Canada.' For its part, AST in a press release today said the deal would help the company expand its services. 'Adding premium lower mid-band spectrum access in the United States to the AST SpaceMobile network gives us long-term access to a large block of a scarce resource, significantly enhancing our planned space-based cellular broadband offering,' said Abel Avellan, Chairman and CEO at AST SpaceMobile. Farrar said the likelihood is that Ligado will 'hive off' this part of its business as a sub-unit while keeping its one satellite in geosynchronous orbit active in order to maintain its spectrum license in order 'to continue to make their lease payments to Viasat,' which According to the Ligado release, the company had been for the past year making an effort 'to secure a comprehensive resolution with satellite communications company Viasat to restructure Ligado’s significant payment obligations to Inmarsat, which Viasat acquired in 2023.' Viasat had been planning to partner with Ligado on satellite-to-cell services. Meanwhile, the company said it has no intentions of dropping its lawsuit against the federal government — which, if won, could also be a source of income to pay off debtors. 'Ligado will continue to vigorously prosecute its litigation against the U.S. government to enforce its constitutional right to just compensation for the government’s unlawful taking of Ligado’s licensed L Band spectrum,' Doug Smith, president and CEO, said in the firm's press release. But that effort is likely to come with a twist, said Farrar, who predicted that Ligado will also pursue an effort to come to an out-of-court settlement with the incoming Trump administration. During Trump's first term, federal officials leaned strongly into efforts by the mobile telecom industry to take over spectrum traditionally used by government agencies and satellite firms for use by developing 5G networks. Indeed, Trump's FCC Chair nominee, Brendon Carr, along with the rest of the FCC, in 2020 voted to support Ligado’s application, and he was a vocal supporter of opening up spectrum for economic benefits. However, Farrar said that there are myriad complicating factors at play both with regard to the fate of the lawsuit and the conclusion of Ligado's restructuring plan. 'The question is, is this new administration going to be willing to settle that lawsuit?' he asked. And that may depend, he added, on whether new Trump advisor Elon Musk 'is going to weigh in as a example of this not being government efficiency at its finest? &#8230; The problem is if Elon Musk weighs in, because AST is obviously a competitor with Starlink, then all bets are off.' At the moment Musk's SpaceX, which operates the Starlink satellites, has been focusing on making alliances with terrestrial wireless providers for satellite-to-phone services, with an agreement already in play with T-Mobile. But as AST and others companies move to instead use spectrum allocated to satellite rather than wireless communications, SpaceX will need to decide whether it also wants to pivot, Farrar said. Further, he explained that government agencies including the FCC have to approve the Ligado/AST deal. And that may be impacted by the fact that Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) on Dec. 17 opened a new study on potential interference from direct-to-device networks with GPS signals that has implications for the Ligado case. It is unclear when that study will be completed; industry representatives have until the end of this month to make initial comments on a series of NTIA questions. For NTIA, which coordinates spectrum usage by federal agencies including by DoD, there is a conundrum at play with regard to the impending 'direct to device' boom. On one hand, the Pentagon and other agencies are worried about GPS interference, but on the other hand, DoD in particular is itching to gain the benefits of secure satellite connections to phones and other handheld devices for use behind enemy lines. 'This is not something that is going to be solved in a few days or a few weeks. This is going to take months, if not even a year or more,' Farrar summed up.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/ligado-files-chapter-11-commences-restructuring-to-slash-debt-burden/	2025-01-06T13:50:17-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/250106_phone_data_GettyImages-1443156022-scaled.jpg
Trump slams Navy’s frigate program over cost increases	Graphic rendering of the future USS Lafayette (FFG 65), named in honor of Marquis de Lafayette and his service during the American Revolutionary War. The Constellation-class guided-missile frigate represents the Navy’s next generation small surface combatant. (Photo by Chief Petty Officer Shannon Renfroe) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump criticized the management of the US Navy's Constellation-class frigate program today following cost increases due to what he called people 'playing around and tinkering and changing the design.' In an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump appeared to refer to a deal originally struck in 2020 during his first administration between the Pentagon and the American arm of Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri for the new class of ships. 'And they were going and really doing a good job, and the generals, you know, the Biden admirals and generals and all of the people that are involved, they started playing around and tinkering and changing the design, and this, you know, that costs. That costs a lot of money,' Trump said, according to a transcript of the interview posted on Hewitt's website. 'But the generals or the admirals went in and they said oh, why don’t we make it a little bit wider? Why don’t we do this? Why don’t we do that? And it was designed specifically for speed and other things. When you start making it wider, you start making it slower,' Trump continued, insisting the Pentagon should have purchased and built the ship without any changes made to the original design. 'We had it down, and they made changes. They always have to make changes. You know, these guys get in there, and they think they’re smart, and in many cases, unfortunately, they’re not smart, and they take something and they make it worse for a lot more money. That’s what they do. I mean, they spend more money to make it worse,' he said. Elsewhere in the interview, Trump praised his nominee for Navy Secretary, John Phelan, as a 'successful business person.' During his first administration, Trump took a personal interest in specific Pentagon programs at times, such as the presidential aircraft better known as Air Force 1. Robert O'Brien, Trump's national security advisor from 2019 to 2021, was known to be a Navy hawk and proponent for increasing shipbuilding cadences. A number of Trump's GOP allies on Capitol Hill, such as Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who now leads the Senate Armed Services Committee, used Trump's first term in office to codify into federal a law a mandate for the US Navy to maintain a fleet of 355 warships — a requirement the service still far from meeting. Without disclosing specific details, Trump also foreshadowed a desire to rapidly grow the Navy's fleet size. 'We’re going to be announcing some things that are going to be very good having to do with the Navy. We need ships. We have to get ships. And you know, everybody said oh, we’ll build them. We may have to go to others, bid them out, and it’s okay to do that. We’ll bid them out until we get ourselves ready,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trump-slams-navys-frigate-program-over-cost-increases/	2025-01-06T12:36:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/7888456.jpg
Kratos wins firm’s largest-ever $1.5 billion award for DoD hypersonic testbed	An artist's rendering of Kratos's Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle. (Kratos image) WASHINGTON — Defense technology firm Kratos has inked a deal worth up to $1.45 billion with the Pentagon to help develop a low-cost testbed for hypersonic technologies, the company announced today. The award, issued as an other transaction authority agreement under the Multi-Service Advanced Capability Hypersonic Test Bed (MACH-TB) 2.0 program, has a performance period of five years if all options are exercised. The team led by Kratos includes several players such as Leidos, Rocket Lab and others. 'Kratos is honored to receive the largest contract award in our company’s history, a testament of the value Kratos’ employees and team bring both to our Company and United States National Security,' Kratos CEO Eric DeMarco said in the release. 'This programmatic milestone underscores our unwavering commitment to making upfront investments for rapidly developing, and being first to market with affordable, mission-critical solutions that meet the evolving needs of the warfighter,' he added. The MACH-TB program, which began as a US Navy effort, includes multiple 'Task Areas,' with Kratos’s award falling under Task Area 1. For its part, Kratos will be tasked with 'systems engineering, integration, and testing (SEIT), to include integrated subscale, full-scale, and air launch services to address the need to affordably increase hypersonic flight test cadence,' according to the company’s release. Awards and missions for the other task areas were not immediately clear. Kratos last year revealed that its Erinyes hypersonic test vehicle successfully flew for a Missile Defense Agency experiment. A company spokesperson told Breaking Defense today that the Erinyes 'is one of the hypersonic frontends' planned to fly under the MACH-TB effort. However, the spokesperson added that '[t]here will be others as well.' Officials have long raised concerns that hypersonic efforts are stymied by limited testing infrastructure. As the MACH-TB program’s name suggests, the effort aims to provide a wide array of DoD users increased hypersonic testing capacity. Flying testbeds like one envisioned for the MACH-TB effort typically allow users to evaluate the performance of key subsystems under relevant conditions — meaning speeds greater than Mach 5 in the case of hypersonics. The Pentagon is racing to catch up with adversaries Russia and China that have already fielded hypersonic weapons. A recent successful test for a joint Army-Navy missile may mean that goal is closer at hand, as the Air Force moves forward with its own fast-flying projects.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/kratos-wins-firms-largest-ever-1-5-billion-award-for-dod-hypersonic-testbed/	2025-01-06T12:15:44-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/Erinyes-e1736190052857.jpg
Raytheon secures near $1B Patriot order from Romania	Romania has placed an additional order for Raytheon made Patriot air and missile defense systems (Raytheon) BELFAST — RTX’s Raytheon has received a $946 million contract from Romania for the supply of additional Patriot air and missile defense systems, marking a third such order by the European nation. The acquisition is designed to replace Patriot equipment supplied to Ukraine and falls under a wider Western coalition military aid effort led by Germany, the Immediate Action on Air Defense (IAAD) project, to urgently co-fund and transfer a variety of modern air defense systems to Kyiv. In an announcement last week RTX noted that the new contract 'includes fire units consisting of radars, control stations and missiles.' Similarly, Romania's Minister of National Defence Angel Tilvar welcomed the order on X, sharing that 'The radars, control stations and missiles that will equip the next 3 Patriot systems for Romania, contracted in 2023, will strengthen Romania’s strategic air defense capabilities.' Pete Bata, senior vice president of Global Patriot at Raytheon, said in the announcement that 'Romania’s continued investment in Patriot is a testament to the nation's dedication to ensuring collective security, deterrence, and stability across Europe.' Norway and Sweden are partly funding the new procurement for Bucharest with Oslo contributing approximately $127 million and Stockholm offering around $27 million, according to figures from the Romanian and Swedish governments. Romania said last year that it was acquiring 200 Patriot Advanced Capability-2 (PAC-2) Guidance Enhanced Missiles-Tactical (GEM-T) surface-to-air missiles, valued at €1.09 billion ($1.13 billion), as part of a wider NATO joint procurement. Breaking Defense reported at the time that the $5.5 billion alliance procurement, which also includes Germany, the Netherlands and Spain, could lead to a combined total of 1,000 GEM-T units being procured. The missile interceptor has been designed to destroy tactical ballistic missiles and is a 'primary effector' for Patriot, according to RTX. Patriot has been credited with shooting down Russian Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missiles during the war in Ukraine, but delivery delays have been a point of tension in recent months. 'Sometimes these gaps are excessively long. You cannot do military planning. You cannot calculate what you [should be able to] count on, on the battlefield,' said Dmytro Kuleba, former Ukrainian minister for foreign affairs, last year. Alongside Patriot, Ukraine also operates Soviet-era S-300 surface to air missile systems against Russia, while the US and Norway have provided Kyiv with National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS). Additionally, Germany has also supplied IRIS-T SLM (Surface Launched Medium Range) missiles.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/raytheon-secures-near-1b-patriot-order-from-romania/	2025-01-06T11:29:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/Raytheon-In-Focus-lead.jpg
Tehran’s proxies are on the back foot. An Iran-Russia defense pact could revive them.	Russian and Iranian flags on a desk. (Getty Images) The sudden collapse of Bashar al-Assad's government in December 2024 has led many to focus on Russia, and its inability or unwillingness to prioritize Syria due to the conflict in Ukraine. But focusing too much on Russia understates the role that Iran, and more specifically Tehran’s proxies, played in propping up Assad. After all, Russia has been at war for almost three years, but it was only when Hezbollah was preoccupied with its war against Israel and Iran was no longer willing to spare resources to prop up the failing dictator that Assad's regime finally crumbled. Under the proposed 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between Moscow and Tehran, we are likely to see the Iran-Russia relationship strengthen over time, not just on a conventional level but in terms of Moscow’s support for Iran’s proxy forces. A renegotiated defense treaty is likely to result in Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and Iranian-backed Iraqi militias playing a more outsized role in the Iran-Russia relationship. With a renewed 'all-encompassing' Iran-Russia defense agreement, Iran is likely to budget more funds for its overseas proxies and increase weapons shipments, creating new opportunities for Russia to tap sources of black-market weapons and skirt sanctions. Russia has started doing this already on a small scale; in March and April 2022, Iran-backed Hashd al-Sha’bi militants shipped Iranian rocket-propelled grenades (RPGs), anti-tank missiles, and Brazilian Astros II rocket launchers to Russia by sea, which were later used in Ukraine. The reverse flow of weapons also exists. Less than a month after Hamas’s horrific Oct. 7, 2023, assault on Israel, CNN and The Wall Street Journal reported that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad agreed to send Hezbollah the SA-22 missile system — an advanced Russian anti-aircraft weapon — via Russia’s state-sponsored mercenary Wagner Group. While officials never confirmed whether Wagner completed the delivery, the IDF later released photo evidence of other 'state-of-the-art' Russian missiles stored in Hezbollah weapons caches, smuggled over-land into Lebanon via Syria. According to an unnamed Israeli major cited by The Wall Street Journal, Russian weapons alone constituted an estimated 60 percent to 70 percent of the Hezbollah weapons confiscated by the IDF in the first few days of the 2024 Israeli ground operation in southern Lebanon, prompting major concerns about Russian-Iranian weapons proliferation to proxy militias. As the benefits of a stronger military and diplomatic relationship between Iran and Russia trickle down to Tehran’s proxies across the Middle East, more frequent exchanges of technical military-industrial knowledge and personnel could equip all parties involved with an arsenal of lethal technical expertise, allowing them to use one another’s weapons more effectively on the battlefield. As with the flow of arms, this type of communication is already taking place. On Feb. 12, 2024, Ukrainian intelligence reported that Lebanese Hezbollah and the IRGC were training Russian troops to operate Iranian Shahed-136s, Ababil-3 UAVs, and the Raad remote-controlled air defense system prior to their deployment to the Ukrainian front line. The Wall Street Journal reported that Russia provided Iran-backed Houthi rebels with targeting data earlier this year for their attacks on global shipping in the Red Sea, in addition to prior shipments of small arms. Just one month after its illegal invasion of Ukraine, Moscow began recruiting Syrian mercenaries for its own military, and later reports confirmed that Iranian proxies were training the new recruits alongside Russian soldiers at an IRGC base in Syria. As Russian troops continue to suffer heavy losses on the Ukrainian front lines, Moscow has recently turned to other Iranian proxies for fresh draftees; according to The Financial Times, Houthi militants are promised 'high salaries' and Russian citizenship in exchange for military service in Ukraine. FT also reported that ordinary Yemeni men were tricked into travelling to Moscow and then forced to sign enlistment contracts. This mutually beneficial exchange of technical know-how and personnel not only encourages continued aggression against the West but allows Russia, Iran, and Tehran’s web of proxies to develop independent production, maintenance, and operational capabilities. Beyond the direct military cooperation already taking place, a 'comprehensive' defense treaty could accelerate Russia and Iran’s abilities to manufacture each other's weapons systems. Russia has already built a drone factory in Tatarstan’s Alabuga Special Economic Zone capable of churning out 6,000 Iranian-spec Shahed UAVs per year for its war in Ukraine. One tangible deliverable of a Russian-Iranian agreement could be a Tatarstan-style production plant on Iranian soil, with the capacity to transform the logistics and smuggling networks that funnel Russian weapons from Tehran to Yemen, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza. With the capacity to domestically produce more of the Russian weapons it sends to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and various Iraqi militias, Tehran could significantly reduce the risk involved and time required to carry out successful smuggling operations. A domestic Russian arms industry would also afford Iran with the resources needed to resupply its own air defenses and rearm its proxies as Tehran, Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis continue to engage in direct conflict with Israel. Trading amongst themselves allows both Russia and Iran — two of the most heavily sanctioned countries in the world — to self-sustain their own shadow economy, fueled by fleets of ghost ships and complex gold and oil smuggling schemes. Russia and Iran’s proposed agreement would see them cooperate on 'all the spheres of bilateral cooperation,' including trade, indicating that a renewed treaty could result in a greater reliance on backchannel networks to raise funds and transport illicit goods — which already sees millions of dollars flowing through the network. Although the United States continues to take decisive action against the Iranian-Russian illicit trade networks, a defense treaty could inspire more creative sanctions evasion schemes and prompt an uptick in weapons and oil sales between Moscow, Tehran, and Iran’s proxy network. The Russian-Iranian relationship has transformed over time from a marriage of convenience to a structured alliance between rogue states with shared economic and security interests. With this formalized agreement, Iran could secure both a steady supply of sophisticated weapons and also a P5 ally to safeguard its malign activities in the Middle East, potentially resulting in a more aggressive military strategy when carrying out direct attacks on Israel. This blanket protection afforded by Russian backing may in turn embolden Iranian proxies, prompting them to select riskier targets when attacking international shipping or American military assets. Russia also benefits from closer defense ties with Iran; it gains millions of dollars in weapons sales, Iran-backed forces to replenish its battered military still fighting in Ukraine, expert training on Iranian weapons technology from Hezbollah and the IRGC, and logistical support from a regional ally after losing its military positions in Syria. A renewed defense treaty between these two powers will render Iran’s web of proxies all the more dangerous by arming already destabilizing agents with more advanced weapons technology and the capacity to manufacture and ship arms to new battlefields.

Wrapping up 2024 and starting 2025, in the eyes of Breaking Defense’s reporters	Fireworks and light shows are held at the Champs-Elysees during the New Year celebrations in Paris, France on January 1, 2025. (Photo by Luc Auffret/Anadolu via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Big changes are on the horizon, but no one really knows what they will be. Talking with members of the national security community in the two months since Donald Trump won the November presidential election, that’s the clearest consensus: Trump and his team will be making major moves to the world of defense, but exactly what that’s going to look like is, for now, guess work. That uncertainty is reflected in the collection of pieces by the Breaking Defense staff, looking forward to 2025. But it also permeates the team’s reflections on 2024, which was a year in which the presidential election kept everything in limbo. That doesn’t mean there wasn’t news — we published almost 2,000 stories, op-eds and features on the site, and the editors have dark circles under our eyes to prove it. But 2024 felt like a transition year, and 2025 is going to be the payoff, in whatever form it takes. Each December I ask the staff to use the end of the year to reflect on their favorite stories from the year. In case you missed any of the year in review pieces, here’s your handy roundup: 2025 is going to be another busy one, both from a news perspective and for Breaking Defense, as we launch a new weekly video series and continue to deliver the best coverage of the defense sector out there. It's going to be a bump ride in spots, but we'll be there to guide you through. Happy new year, and thanks for reading.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/wrapping-up-2024-and-starting-2025-in-the-eyes-of-breaking-defenses-reporters/	2025-01-06T07:30:09-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/2025-paris-scaled-e1735832602652.jpg
Why Israel’s IAI is investing heavily in Indian startups	IAI has launched a new India Innovation Program called NeuSPHERE. (Israel Aerospace Industries) JERUSALEM — Israel Aerospace Industries is seeking to support start-up companies in India via a new program, as the company seeks to expand its relationships with a major market for Israeli goods, IAI CEO Boaz Levy told Breaking Defense in a recent interview. The NeuSPHERE Innovation Acceleration Program, announced in November, will see IAI giving Indian startups funding, as well as technical and marketing expertise, in order to help push capabilities into the market. It builds off 'over 40 years of mutual work' with India, Levy said, but better reflects the current goals of the Modi government’s Make in India effort, which emphasizes the need to produce locally. 'We need to tune ourselves and find the right ways to work together according to the new regulations in India,' Levy said in an interview conducted last month. 'This is why we decided our new strategy will be holding of several companies in India that will support our programs in India. Per a company statement, NeuSPHERE is 'aimed at focusing on the Indian technology startup community, in particular inventive deep-tech startups focusing on big data, signal and image processing, advanced navigation systems, AI and autonomy, XR-maintenance and training, green energy, advanced production, quantum, edge computing, Human Machine Interfaces and wearable technology.' Those technologies align efforts IAI has also made in Israel to invest in start-ups and take advantage of Israel’s nimble market that pushed new technology to the battlefield based on operational successes. IAI also opened a similar program to support innovation in the US. Levy stated that the company has already opened its first NeuSPHERE office New Delhi, but did not specify how many startups were involved or when the first partnership with local startups would begin. He sees the program as a gateway for better engineering processes and capabilities 'that we will demonstrate for our Indian users.' He added that 'the program is to build up technology. If the technology is there as a startup, then we will invest, but if this tech can bring benefits to our products then it could be a [joint venture], and that is a case by case situation and we are exploring. 'It is a long journey and time will tell,' he said, noting IAI plans to work to figure out what works best for each startup individually. India is a major market for Israel and a strategic partner of Israel, but Israeli defense companies also have relations with many other countries in the region, such as Singapore, Australia, South Korea and Vietnam. Asked whether he sees the work they are now doing in India as forming a hub for the wider region, Levy answered positively, but stressed that the focus is on the Indian market. 'It is a hub for IAI, a lot of our production has been done in India, some is part of the offset and some continues deliveries to other customers as well,' he says. 'We believe that the innovation program is a great starting point and we will continue to support it and see if we can make it as a platform for future collaborations with India.' Outside of the startup interest, IAI recently launched a new facility in Hyderabad. This site is involved in the maintenance of radars and is run by HELA systems. In addition IAI continues to be part of a multi-billion dollar deal that dates back almost a decade with India to develop missile systems. These systems, known as MR-SAM in India, are part of IAI’s Barak family. 'Barak is continuing in the three services in India and we are proud with the DRDO collaboration and the three armed services and I think that it symbolizes the good work we are doing together for the benefit of our two nations and more,' Levy said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/why-israels-iai-is-investing-heavily-in-indian-startups/	2025-01-06T05:55:26-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/India-Innovation-Program-Photo-credit-Israel-Aerospace-Industries-e1735935818356.png
Boeing taps Dana Deasy, former top Pentagon official, as CIO	U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick M. Shanahan formally, swears-in Dana Deasy as the Department of Defense Chief Information Officer, June 15, 2018 at the Pentagon, Wash. D.C. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Master Sgt. Angelita M. Lawrence) WASHINGTON — Boeing today announced it is appointing Dana Deasy, a top Pentagon official during the first Trump administration, as the company's new chief information digital officer and senior vice president of information technology and data analytics. 'Dana is a well-respected, global technology leader who has a track record of delivering on innovative technologies across large and complex organizations,' said Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg in a company statement. 'With the need to stay vigilant to protect against cyber threats, and emerging technologies like artificial intelligence playing a larger role across all industries, our IT team will have a key role as we focus on meeting our safety and quality goals, delivering reliably for our customers and positioning ourselves for the future.' Deasy worked as the DoD's top IT official from June 2018 until the end of the Trump administration, notably leading the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) cloud computing effort, as well as driving towards a 'zero trust' cybersecurity model. He was also the point person on making sure the department could function during the COVID-19 pandemic, when significant portions of the building shifted to remote work. Before his time at the Pentagon, Deasy spent four years as CIO at JP Morgan Chase, and previously worked for General Motors. According to his LinkedIn, since leaving office he has done consulting as well as 'some retirement.' His appointment comes as a rocky moment for Boeing, which is laying off 10 percent of its overall workforce as it tries to recover from financial turmoil on both its defense and commercial sides.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/boeing-taps-dana-deasy-former-top-pentagon-official-as-cio/	2025-01-03T14:48:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/4489494-scaled-e1735944289231.jpg

John Raven) WASHINGTON — The State Department on Thursday approved a possible $3.64 billion foreign military sale of RTX-made Advanced Medium-Range Air-To-Air Missiles (AMRAAMs) to Japan, including up to 1,200 missiles and associated additional guidance sections. 'This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a major ally that is a force for political stability and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific region,' according to a notice from the Defense Security Cooperation Agency. 'The proposed sale will improve Japan’s capability to meet current and future threats by defending its homeland and U.S. personnel stationed there. Japan will have no difficulty absorbing these articles and services into its armed forces,' the notice continues. Details in DSCA announcements are not final; quantities and dollar totals often shift during negotiations, and today’s announcements technically tee up an opportunity for lawmakers to block the deal within a 30-day period, though such a step would be unlikely given the close military relationship between the US and Japan. The approval comes at an otherwise tense moment for US-Japan relations as President Joe Biden today followed through on his threats to block Japan's Nippon Steel from purchasing a Pittsburgh-based facility. The Washington Post reported earlier this week the Japanese company had sent a new offer to the administration, pledging to maintain American jobs, in an effort to salvage the deal that had become embroiled in election year politics, but those efforts apparently failed to sway the outgoing administration.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/state-approves-3-64b-sale-to-japan-of-air-to-air-missiles/	2025-01-03T12:38:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/6144937-scaled-e1735935891699.jpg
Europe braces for Trump’s second term: 2025 preview	President Elect Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly (Bloomberg via Getty Images) BELFAST — President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House looks set to spark tension and trouble in Europe with fears that he will end the war in Ukraine on terms of greater advantage to Russia. Peace plan proposals reportedly floated by the incoming president’s team include Ukraine ceding territory to its neighbor and removing future NATO membership for Ukraine. Trump’s NATO position would be in direct opposition to the alliance’s stated approach — that Ukraine is on an 'irreversible path' to securing membership — and runs the risk of opening up a high profile dispute with allies and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Rutte already appears to be pre-empting Trump’s tactics and has openly talked of making Ukraine’s hand 'stronger' at the negotiating table with Russia by urging allies to increase military aid commitments and ramping up defense production across Europe. Despite not singling out Trump’s purported peace plan ideas specifically, Rutte has increasingly talked of not allowing a 'bad deal' for Ukraine to go ahead by messaging that, 'what you can never have is high fiving' between North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un and China's President Xi Jinping. He has also been clear that the peace deal must be fit for purpose because it is pivotal to the long term defense and security not just of Europe and the US, but the Indo-Pacific region too. More generally, Trump’s dislike of NATO will likely lead to uncertainty over the future of the alliance, though it remains to be seen if this time around, he will again threaten to pull the US from the institution. On several occasions during 2018, Trump privately said he wished to withdraw from NATO, according to the New York Times. Congress has since approved legislation that stops any president from making that move without approval from the Senate or via an act of Congress. Trump’s hands would not be tied entirely on the matter though, because he could call on presidential authority over foreign policy as a workaround, per Politico. However those permutations potentially play out, Trump’s undermining of NATO will ultimately continue to play into the hands of Russia, weaken deterrence, cast doubt on allied unity, and force European nations to look inward and take on more burden sharing. Enacted or expected rises in defense spending across Europe, notably from Poland and the Baltic nations, alongside moves like France and the UK discussing sending troops to Ukraine, appear to demonstrate that the continent will attempt to be more self-reliant on military matters. But there is little question that Europe will be considerably weakened if Trump's worst impulses are acted on.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/europe-braces-for-trumps-second-term-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T11:55:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_trump_laptop_GettyImages-1228653864-scaled-e1732226397800.jpg
CMMC 2.0 and the possibility of a cyber service: 2025 preview	Staff Sgt. Wendell Myler, a cyber warfare operations journeyman assigned to the 175th Cyberspace Operations Group of the Maryland Air National Guard monitors live cyber attacks on the operations floor of the 27th Cyberspace Squadron. (U.S. Air Force photo by J.M. Eddins Jr.) WASHINGTON — Over the past year, the Department of Defense has set the stage for how it wants to strengthen cybersecurity and information technology infrastructure against adversarial threats, namely the People’s Republic of China. But with another Donald Trump presidency on the horizon, all eyes are on him to see if he keeps the existing programs afloat or scales them back. Simultaneously, some cybersecurity experts and lawmakers have predicted that the president-elect will stand up a new cyber service. These are some of the programs and shifts to look out for in the next year. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] This year the Pentagon released its final rule for the long-awaited Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0, which sets new standards for contractors who handle controlled unclassified information (CUI). The 32 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) final rule, which lays the framework for CMMC 2.0, went into effect on Dec. 16, but the DoD won’t actually begin implementing the CMMC 2.0 requirement for contractors until the 48 CFR final rule is released — likely in the spring of 2025. However, in order to avoid a scramble to meet the new regulations with little notice, those requirements won't become mandatory until after a three-year phase-in period. The first official CMMC program was built under the first Trump presidency in 2020— one of the reasons why those in the cybersecurity realm believe the program won’t change under Trump. Stacy Bostjanick, the chief of defense industrial base cybersecurity in the DoD's office of the chief information officer, told a panel in November that CMMC 2.0 is not 'going anywhere.' 'CMMC was initially started under the first Trump administration,' she said. 'We have made such progress, and so many people recognize the need for it. It endured, and we went through and did the proper rule making steps to make it, to memorialize it. I don't see it going anywhere.' Not everyone is so sure that CMMC 2.0 is sticking around. Quentin Hodgson, formerly the Pentagon’s director of Cyber Plans, told Breaking Defense that given the fact that Republican administrations tend to scale back on regulations, CMMC 2.0 requirements could be reduced. 'It's possible that the new administration could decide to relook at that and say this is too high a burden or not the right way to approach improving cybersecurity standards in the defense industrial base,' Hodgson said of CMMC 2.0. 'I could see where there would be a relook at some of those things that were seen as maybe from a Republican or conservative point of view ... more heavy handed than it needed to be with respect to the private sector,' he added. Though experts and Pentagon personnel may have an opinion on the fate of CMMC 2.0, its future is in the hands of the next administration, and since we don't have a crystal ball, we will just have to wait and see what 2025 brings. The Potential For A 7th Branch In another effort to shore up cybersecurity protections and capabilities, some experts and lawmakers believe that with another Donald Trump presidency, an independent cyber service could be a real possibility. Though the idea of an individual cyber service has long been a point of contention within the Department of Defense, Hodgson told Breaking Defense that since Trump stood up the Space Force it’s possible that he could stand up a cyber force. 'This change in administration potentially could give more impetus to the creation of a separate cyber service,' he said. '[Trump] did that with the Space Force. It was something that the Department of Defense didn’t want, but he decided he wanted it, and it’s possible that that could also happen with cyberspace.' Separately, two Texas Republicans, Rep. Pat Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell authored an amendment in a draft version of the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that called for an independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. (The study is being conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.) However such plans seem to have been scaled back in the final version of the NDAA. The new language was vaguer, calling only for the assessment of 'cyber organizations' instead of a separate cyber service — an important change, as advocates of a future cyber force had been hoping to hang their argument off of a report from the academies. Although the final NDAA language could be seen as a setback, Rep. Fallon told DefenseScoop that he’s still optimistic that the DoD could create a cyber force based on the study’s results. 'I am sure that the incoming administration will take a hard look at everything within the cyber realm to ensure maximum protection, efficiency, and lethality. We in Congress will do the same and I am confident we’ll see changes based on the level of threats we are faced with,' he told the outlet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/cmmc-2-0-and-the-possibility-of-a-cyber-service-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T09:37:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/230210_DVIDS_cyber_dark_4259914-scaled-e1676042385196.jpg
Army chooses BAE Systems for prototype base defense artillery cannon	Army Gen. Randy George, the 41st Chief of Staff of the Army, addresses attendees at the 146th National Guard Association of the United States General Conference, Detroit, Michigan, Aug. 24, 2024. (U.S. Army National Guard photo by Sgt. 1st Class Zach Sheely) WASHINGTON — The US Army has chosen BAE Systems to prototype a new artillery cannon, envisioned to defend bases against a variety of threats including unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles and other advanced air threats. The system has been dubbed the Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon (MDAC) and Hypervelocity Projectile (HVP) prototype. The service announced the selection in a public Dec. 20 notice, which was sole-sourced to BAE, meaning the Pentagon did not hold a competition amongst private industry to determine its vendor. The Army's Rapid Capabilities and Critical Technologies Office 'has a requirement to develop and deliver a full Multi-Domain Artillery Cannon System (MDACS) Battery no later than Q4FY27 followed by an operational demonstration in FY28,' according to the notice. 'A full MDACS battery consists of eight Multi-Domain Artillery Cannons, four Multi-Function Precision Radars, two Multi-Domain Battle Managers, and separately, no less than 144 Hypervelocity Projectiles.' The announcement did not include details about the amount of funding the contract would include, but Breaking Defense previously reported the Army was planning to spend $67 million in fiscal 2025 to kick off its efforts before investing more heavily in future years. (The government is currently operating under a continuing resolution, with funding stuck at FY24 levels through at least March.) 'Throughout the developmental effort, soldier touchpoints will gather feedback for Army requirements generation and prototype maturation,' the service wrote in its budget justification documents. 'MDACS will use the Integrated Battle Command System (IBCS) and conduct a series of flight tests culminating in a battery-level operational assessment in FY 2028.' An assessment is expected in 2028 to determine the technology can be fielded, according to the service, which is increasingly prioritizing base defense as it preps for a potential conflict in the Pacific.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/army-chooses-bae-systems-for-prototype-base-defense-artillery-cannon/	2025-01-03T07:56:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/01/randy-george-scaled-e1735919540725.jpg
The future of Syria, Lebanon and geopolitical moves in the Middle East to come: 2025 preview	Fighters walk in the Syrian presidential palace in Damascus' Mount Qasyoun on December 8, 2024, after Islamist-led rebels declared that they have taken the Syrian capital in a lightning offensive, sending President Bashar al-Assad fleeing and ending five decades of Baath rule in Syria. (Photo by OMAR HAJ KADOUR/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Hopes are high that year 2025 will be one of peace in the region after an especially violent 2024. The fastest developing story, sure to dominate at least the start of the new year, is found in Syria, where leader Bashar al-Assad has been deposed, ending a 50-year family rule. Now, a coalition of rebels are in control of the capital, and the world is watching for how they will shape the nation's future — and whether democracy or extremism will blossom. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Additionally, this year is expected to reveal to future of Russian and Iranian influence in Syria, specifically the Russian military bases in the country. Will Moscow strike a deal with the rebels to keep Hmeimim air base and Tartus naval base as its power projection focal points in the Mediterranean or is 2024 the end of Russian presence in Syria? This remains to be answered and maybe sooner in 2025 than expected. After Syria itself, the region can be expected to keep a close eye on neighbor Iraq, which was already planning to end the US-led coalition mission there by September 2025. 'To be clear, the United States is not withdrawing from Iraq,' a senior administration official told reporters in September 2024. 'We are moving towards the type of productive long-term security relationship that the United States has with partners around the world.' Nevertheless, this upcoming year might put Baghdad under strain if ISIS and al Qaeda see a resurgence in Syria. Assad's fall in Damascus also may strain Iran's influence in Iraq, and could push Iranian-allied militias there to resort to asymmetric threats to compensate their retreat in other countries. Also in flux as the new year looms is the fate of Southern Lebanon, after Hezbollah and Israel agreed to a ceasefire there. On the Lebanese side, observers can expect the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) to be the jewel of 2025, as it will take on a key role in maintaining the ceasefire to the south, but also contend with instability from Syria's collapse that could mean more stress on Lebanon's other borders. On the technical side, I expect international conferences to support the LAF to take place to boost its armament parallel to the increased role entrusted to the military. The military aid is expected mainly from the US, the traditional donor to LAF, France and Arab countries like Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, for their own defense Gulf nations like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates can be expected to boost cooperation with Western defense firms through joint ventures, while at the same time they're likely to keep investing at home to boost domestic industry. Twenty-twenty-five could bring on fighter jet news, as Saudi Arabia may find its way into the British-Italian-Japanese Global Combat Air Programme, and the UAE may redouble its efforts to join the American F-35 program. Last but not least, 2025 could see another big push towards normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, something the Biden administration had flirted with accomplishing before Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023 attacks derailed that delicate process. Additionally Saudi Arabia might be able to seal the defense pact with US where Washington would be committed to defending Saudi territory in case of attack. Whether this pact, which was 'very close' back in May, according to US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, will be a prerequisite to normalization with Israel remains to be seen.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/the-future-of-syria-lebanon-and-geopolitical-moves-in-the-middle-east-to-come-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T07:43:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241219_rebels_assad_palace_inside_GettyImages-2188884856-scaled-e1734640650830.jpg
Pacific political turmoil, AUKUS, and the looming Taiwan deadline: 2025 preview	Soldiers try to enter the National Assembly building in Seoul on Dec. 4, after South Korea President Yoon Suk Yeol declared martial law. (Photo by Jung Yeon-je / AFP) (Photo by JUNG YEON-JE/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — Readers can expect the beginning of 2025 to be dominated by political turmoil in the Indo-Pacifc, with South Korea unexpectedly groping for an answer to the impeachment of its president, Australia possibly facing a closely divided parliament, Japan trying to build government that will last more than a year and China offering the prospect of more uncertainty in the highest reaches of its military. Once South Korea selects a replacement for impeached president Yoon Suk Yeol, whose unexpected declaration of martial law sparked a fundamental threat to the country's hard-won democracy, the outlines of the new foreign and national security policies will begin to emerge from the political fog. The most likely outcome, at this point, seems to be a more amendable approach to China, more skepticism of the tight intelligence ties with Japan and a less hardline approach to North Korea. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Japan, whose government led by Prime Minister Ishiba Chigger, suffered a sharp rebuke from the public in late October elections, may struggle to maintain the intelligence-sharing arrangement with South Korea. The General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) was originally signed for the two countries to share information on North Korea. Under the original terms of the deal, Japan would send satellite imagery and electronic information to South Korean analysts, who would reciprocate with human intelligence going to Japan. The agreement is also designed to allow the two sides to share real-time targeting information to counter North Korean missiles. The weakness of the Japanese government could also affect what have been rapidly tightening ties between Japan and Australia. For example, the two countries now speak each of other as partners second only to the United States, which is their primary ally. And the two countries defense ministers — flanked by outgoing US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin — announced in mid-November that Japanese marines would make regular rotations to Australia for training and exercises. Further south, Australia may also face its own electoral turmoil with national elections likely to be held in March (they must be held by May). The Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is widely expected to prevail, but there is a reasonable chance that the election may result in Labor losing much of its authority as the group of MPs known as Teals could swell their ranks and the coalition of Liberal and National Party MPs might surge. That could be good for defense spending. The Labor Party, which has spoken bracingly of the grim regional strategic situation and the need for the three-nation AUKUS effort and for Australia to bolster its conventional major weapons systems, has actually let defense spending plans dip in real terms from 2023-2026. The election results will determine whether that changes. AUKUS, at least in theory, could benefit from increased support from the Liberal Party leadership. Japan and South Korea's efforts to tie themselves more closely to the so-called Pillar II or AUKUS — research and development of advanced capabilities such as hypersonic, cyber, autonomy, artificial intelligence and underwater tech — will depend on their and Australia's political results, as well as the assessment of the incoming Trump administration. On the other side of the geostrategic coin, in 2025 military planners, diplomats and strategists will be closely watching China as it continues to purge top military leaders, for reasons uncertain. Finally, all of this will be taking place in the shadow of 2027 — the year by which the US says Chinese President Xi Jinping has said he wants the Peoples Liberation Army to have the capabilities to execute an armed takeover of Taiwan. Australia and Japan are keenly aware of the date. Japan has significantly boosted its defense spending to record levels and published a strategy that makes Taiwan the keystone of much of its planning. While few experts believe Xi has set 2027 as the year he will actually try to take Taiwan, with only two years to go, military strategists usually plan for the worst.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/pacific-political-turmoil-aukus-and-the-looming-taiwan-deadline-2025-preview/	2025-01-03T05:33:28-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/south-korea-coup-scaled-e1733326013659.jpg
For the Space Force, terrestrial turf wars and rising budgets await: 2025 preview	The moon as a crystal ball. (Images via Getty / graphic by Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld elicited some snickers back in 2002 with his famous quote about 'known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns' bedevilling US intelligence about Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction. But those words seem pretty appropriate when trying to prognosticate what 2025 will look like for the US Space Force. From bureaucratic turf wars to extra-terrestrial combat, the old crystal ball is just pretty darn cloudy right now. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] There are a few things that pundits by and large agree are clearly on the agenda next year, with outcomes that are fairly likely. First is the likely growth in both the Space Force's budget and force size. As this humble scribe predicted at the end of last year, service leaders over the past 12 months sought to make its case for growth in personnel numbers, in mission areas and in budget. Indeed, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall — who, according to sources, has on more than one occasion and only half-jokingly called the newest military service his 'biggest unfunded priority' — called for the Space Force's budget to be doubled or even tripled. Given that President-elect Donald Trump takes personal credit for the Space Force's creation, service advocates appear pretty confident on social media that the service's budget and status within the Defense Department will rise. But given the administration's much-touted effort to cut costs by finding efficiency in government departments including DoD, few analysts are putting their bets on a funding increase anywhere close to Kendall's call. Second, Congress is already making noise about looking to 2025, the Space Force's fifth year, as a kind of deadline for the service to show first results from efforts to pivot to new ways of doing business — that is, to demonstrate tangible progress toward new, more resilient capabilities based on 'proliferated' constellations and the use of commercial satellites and technologies. Service leaders are likely to have to answer the question: Five years on, what new capabilities to meet the growing threat actually are in the field? And Space Force officials swear that they will have something to show for the investment so far. In particular, the Space Development Agency (SDA) is expected to begin launching its first set of satellites with limited operational capabilities, called Tranche 1, in March or April. Tranche 1 includes 126 Transport Layer data relay satellites, and 35 Tracking Layer birds for missile tracking, and the agency plans to have all of them on orbit by early 2026. Tranche 1 will be the first opportunity for SDA and the Space Force to prove that constellations made up of large numbers of smaller satellites in low Earth orbit can speed needed data to warfighters while complicating adversary targeting efforts. In addition, Col. Rich Kniseley, the head of the Space Force's Commercial Space Office, told Breaking Defense on Dec. 17 that he is confident his shop will award the first contracts under the service's fledgling Commercial Augmentation Space Reserve (CASR) program early next year. CASR is being developed as the Space Force's answer to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet, and those first awards will be focused on commercial providers of space tracking data and analysis. Commercial industry officials are hoping CASR also will serve as a market stabilizer by providing predictable funding lines. Despite the intervention of White House budgetmeisters and the National Space Council, the long-running turf battle between the Space Force and the two key Intelligence Community agencies with space mandates, the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA), will continue to fester into next year. The most pressing source of strife is the question of who is in charge of buying commercial remote sensing imagery and products when and under what circumstances — an issue that a industry officials say threatens to undercut the nascent market. Government sources have told Breaking Defense that draft memos have been inked to clarify the lanes, in particular one between NGA and the Space Force, but that squabbling has broken out again in light of the pending administration change. It is anyone's guess whether, or how, the issue will be resolved over the next year. Savvy betters will be putting money on a marked shift in budget priorities next year towards the development of new kit and capabilities for targeting Russian and Chinese space systems, whether those be suspected killer satellites or more traditional military support systems such as intelligence-gathering satellites. Chief of Space Operations Gen. Chance Saltzman has spent much of this year advocating for such a shift — one that from all past evidence the incoming Trump administration likely will support. The unknown here is how far that tilt will go, given that the Space Force is still struggling to make a number traditional satellite systems foundational for warfighting fit for purpose. And as noted above the budget will not be unlimited. All things considered — the churn in domestic politics, the famous unpredictability of the incoming POTUS, the increasingly volatile international security scene and the runaway pace of technology innovation in the commercial space market — 2025 seems even more ripe than this year for supernova-sized surprises. Honestly, who had the fall of Syria or North Korean garbage balloons on their 2024 bingo card? What's next, extra-terrestrial craft among the ever-increasing drone swarms? Chemical weapons production in space? A materials breakthrough enabling a (squee!) space elevator? Obviously, all of those are pretty far out — but you never know. Proceed at your own risk, and hardhats are highly recommended.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/for-the-space-force-terrestrial-turf-wars-and-rising-budgets-await-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T12:01:15-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241218_space_crystal_ball_GFX.png
Trump administration inherits Air Force funding hurdle: 2025 preview	Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin makes remarks before presenting Maj. Brady Augustin the 2022 Koren Kolligian Jr. Trophy during a ceremony at the Pentagon, Arlington, Va., Feb. 7, 2024. (US Air Force photo by Eric Dietrich) WASHINGTON — In a March briefing with reporters outlining the service’s fiscal 2025 budget, Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall issued a warning: Although spending limits imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Act are set to expire by FY26, leaders would still have to make 'tough choices' about big priorities that year. The FY26 budget is now (almost) here, and decisions within it are in the hands of the incoming Trump administration. In conjunction with incumbent Chief of Staff Gen. David Allvin, Kendall’s successor — who has not been announced as of this writing — will officially chart the way forward for a service that is struggling with a shrinking fighter force, pressing modernization needs and a wholesale revamp aimed at countering China. An early preview of the problems facing the next administration was recently laid out by Kendall, who mused that the service’s plans for a next-gen tanker may not be affordable. Similar funding constraints apply to a next-gen fighter whose fate will now be settled by the incoming Trump team, a key program for the Air Force that Breaking Defense previously reported is supported by the service's internal analysis. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Other critical efforts additionally need funding in the upcoming FY26 budget, most notably two legs of the nuclear triad. As a seemingly successful flight test campaign continues, officials expect to ramp up production of the service’s B-21 Raider built by Northrop Grumman. And work on the new Sentinel ICBM, where Northrop is also the prime contractor, must proceed after a congressionally mandated review determined that there was no alternative for the increasingly expensive program. Compounding the service’s woes, the FY25 budget has yet to be approved by lawmakers, and likely won’t be until March at the earliest. Trump-appointed officials alongside lawmakers will then simultaneously have to finalize the FY25 budget and craft FY26 spending plans — leading one top outgoing Pentagon official to predict the FY26 budget may not arrive until April or May. How the new leadership in Washington influences the Air Force is an open question. But even two big milestones ahead that will likely be welcomed by the service may be interpreted differently by up-and-coming power players — notably Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, co-leads of a planned commission that will seek to slash government spending. A leading example is the service’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft program. The drone wingmen are set to make their maiden flights next year, as the likes of Ramaswamy call to pour more investment into uncrewed systems, rather than 'a wide range of other expenditures for new kinds of fighter jets' among other capabilities. A successful CCA program could bolster calls to scale back manned fighters, but for now, officials are pushing back against moving to fully unmanned combat. As Allvin recently told attendees at the Reagan Forum, his vision for the future consists of manned–unmanned teaming. In a similar vein, upgraded versions of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 could finally be cleared for combat in 2025. While likely to be celebrated by officials once it’s achieved, significant delays for the upgrade may only embolden the likes of Musk, who has called officials 'idiots' for continuing to build the stealth fighter. As always, it'll be Congress that makes the final call on Pentagon programs. And though incumbent Biden administration officials have said they’ve been working to a higher topline for a notional 2026 budget than what was the norm under the Fiscal Responsibility Act, it’s not clear if congressional conservatives — who backed the legislation in the first place — would support major boosts to defense spending. However, proponents of a bigger Air Force budget will still have allies on Capitol Hill under the new GOP majority. One key champion for a larger Pentagon topline will likely be Kentucky Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, who is set to chair the Senate subcommittee that oversees defense spending. Incoming Senate Armed Services Chair Roger Wicker, R-Miss., has also called for a 'full-scale rebuilding of the shrinking US Air Force,' including by pressing forward with the Next Generation Air Dominance program. Speaking Dec. 10 during a virtual discussion hosted by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, outgoing Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter described two principal challenges awaiting the next administration: getting the proper resourcing, and ensuring systems are effectively integrated in a new, highly connected age of warfighting. '[I]f the Fiscal Responsibility Act shapes the resource posture of the nation, we will not be able to fulfill the national defense strategy,' Hunter said of budgetary challenges. Regarding the 'sophisticated integration mission,' Hunter then said that 'I think we’ve got people who can hit it out of the park,' although '[y]ou’re still going to have to swing at the pitch and make contact.' Lauding 'wins' notched under his tenure, Hunter added, 'there is a lot still to be done.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/trump-administration-inherits-air-force-funding-hurdle-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T10:30:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/06/allvin-scaled-e1718387249735.jpg
From a new civilian leader to modernization priorities, Army changes afoot: 2025 preview	Gen. Randy George, Chief of Staff of the Army, discusses next generation command and control (C2) system capabilities with a 1st Infantry Division Soldier during a human machine Integration demonstration at Project Convergence &#8211; Capstone 4. (US Army/Sgt. Brahim Douglas) WASHINGTON — An upcoming civilian leadership shakeup across the entire Department of Defense next year could usher Daniel Driscoll in as the 26th Army secretary if Senators give their blessings. President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick — a former soldier and adviser to Vice President-elect JD Vance — to lead the ground service in early December. The gig brings with it a host of decisions including ways to move weapon development programs into production; revamp ones that have foundered in early development; and carve out efficiencies. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George, who still has several years left of his tenure, talked about some of these challenges back in October. 'It should be clear to all of us that the days where we indiscriminately could buy an entire Army’s worth of inventory in a single program of record are gone,' he told an audience during the Association of the US Army annual conference. 'We can’t afford to invest in obsolescence. 'There are also some things that we are going to stop buying, old, stand-alone tech that doesn’t connect to our network, equipment that can’t operate in our [transformation in contact] formations, all of the outdated stuff that isn’t survivable on the modern battlefield,' the four-star general later added. 'Even if it was a requirement in the past, even if it was a program of record, we may have to stop buying it.' While he didn’t name names of possible programs on the cutting room floor, the service has been grappling with a flat budget as it pushed forward with modernization priorities categories — long-range precision fires, next-generation combat vehicles, future vertical lift, the network, air and missile defense and soldier lethality — that were inked out during the first Trump administration. By and large, those priorities remained during the Biden administration, with the exception of some systems being killed off, like the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA), and others sent back to the drawing board. While service officials haven’t disclosed if 2025 will be the year they need to make sweeping cuts and prioritize funding, they do have some key decision points set for the coming 12 months. This year, for example, the service officially announced it was halting development on its Extended Range Cannon Artillery (ERCA) platform after spending several years integrating and testing out the addition of a 30-foot, 58-caliber gun tube to BAE Systems’ Paladin M109A7 self-propelled howitzer. It subsequently announced that five companies had been picked — Rheinmetall, BAE Systems, Hanwha, General Dynamics and Elbit Systems — to demo their existing platforms. In early December, Director of the Long-Range Precision Fires Cross Functional Team Brig. Gen. Rory Crooks said those early evaluations indicate that the vendors are 'absolutely ready for competitive evaluation,' which means the service may decide not to delve into another lengthy development phase, and a decision is likely coming in 2025. Depending on when a new Army civilian leader is ultimately sworn in, a couple of other big-ticket items may await including the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS) Next and a single vendor selected for the Robotic Combat Vehicle Phase II. The Army is also poised to use next year’s Project Convergence capstone event to test out the service’s future command and control (C2) architecture to see if it’s on the right track. If testing there goes well, senior leaders will likely hand the prototyping project over to the Army Futures Command's (AFC) Network Cross-Functional Team to continue work. That team is 'already getting the requirements developers together. They’re already looking at the budget that it will require, and working [on] the acquisition approach,' explained Col. Michael Kaloostian, the AFC’s networks and security director for Next Generation C2. Part of that tentative plan ahead revolves around delivering a 'minimal viable product' to units later in 2025 for continued testing before the service begins fielding it to soldiers, possibly in 2026. Another hot topic across the government next year is poised to be the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. An initiative rather than a department, there have been threats of major cuts to the DoD, and for his part, George has said is in favor of finding efficiency inside the Army. 'We’ve talking about process innovation in the Army for the last year,' he told an audience in early December out at the Reagan National Defense Forum. 'If it doesn’t make us more lethal or our teams more cohesive, we have to be looking at, you know, should we be doing it? So I think we have to review everything that we’re doing in that light.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/from-a-new-civilian-leader-to-modernization-priorities-army-changes-afoot-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T08:14:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/8298347-scaled-e1734367699797.jpg
Ireland and Airbus agree to $95 million H145M helicopter deal	The Airbus H145M helicopter can be fitted with a range of ballistic and guided weapons BELFAST — The Irish Department of Defence has signed a contract with Airbus UK for the acquisition of four H145M light-utility helicopters, in a deal valued at €91.7 million ($94.6 million). Announced this week in a statement by Micheál Martin, Irish deputy prime minister and minister for defence, the new multirole rotorcraft — set to replace two aging EC-135 aircraft — will be used for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), light attack operations, police air support and training. 'These helicopters will not only significantly boost the capacity of the Defence Forces pilot training programmes, but also enhance intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and light combat capabilities of our Air Corps,' said Martin. Dublin also stressed that the new aircraft will 'greatly improve' operational support for Special Forces and the Army Ranger Wing. General Officer Commanding of the Irish Air Corps, Brig. Gen. Rory O’Connor, said the aircraft 'will provide vital light tactical transport support to the Army, Navy, and Army Ranger Wing, reinforcing our interoperability with Special Operations Forces.' He added, 'These helicopters will also play an important role in shaping the next generation of rotary-wing pilots, ensuring the Irish Air Corps remains agile, adaptable, and mission-ready for years to come.' Dublin did not disclose which weapons will be fitted on the H145M fleet, but a first aircraft delivery is scheduled for Q1 2027. The H145M is typically outfitted with the Airbus HForce weapons management system, which covers a range of ballistic and guided missile options, including machine gun (12.7mm), canon (20mm), rocket (70mm), as well as air-to-air, air-to-ground and laser guided rocket munitions, according to company literature [PDF]. The latest aviation acquisition by the small, militarily neutral nation comes weeks after signing a €53 million order with France's Dassault for a Falcon 6X multipurpose strategic reach aircraft, which will be used for 'transport, airlift and medical capabilities,' per the announcement. Set to be operated out of Casement Aerodrome, Dublin, the fixed wing aircraft is set for delivery in December 2025 — and likely will play a VIP transport role when Ireland takes over the presidency of the European Union in 2026. More broadly, Ireland has committed to transforming its defense forces by 2028, based around the implementation of recommendations made by the Commission on the Defence Forces. To reach such an ambition, Dublin is focused on the Commission’s Level of Ambition 2 (LOA2) concept and addressing 'priority gaps' related to 'an assault on Irish sovereignty.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/ireland-and-airbus-agree-to-95-million-h145m-helicopter-deal/	2025-01-02T07:44:59-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/12/H145-EXPH-1745-11-scaled-e1702556338132.jpg
For the Navy, all eyes will be on the China-Taiwan question: 2025 preview	The Arleigh-Burke class guided missile destroyer USS Barry (DDG-52) transits in the Taiwan Strait. (US Navy photo by Ensign Samuel Hardgrove) WASHINGTON — Chief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti has ordered the US Navy to be prepared for the possibility of conflict with China over Taiwan in 2027. But for better or worse, the Navy the US has today is largely the one it will have in 2027, and what last-minute preparations Franchetti can make will be my focus in the new year. In the Pentagon, there are three budgets that exist. (Technically, Congress has not yet passed an appropriations bill for 2025, but for the sake of simplicity, let’s assume they will by March.) That means the budgets in play next year will be the one being executed, fiscal 2025; the one being debated on Capitol Hill, FY26; and the one being crafted inside the Pentagon, FY27. In other words, the service has just one more budget cycle to make meaningful pre-2027 changes to its fleet composition that haven’t already been publicly disclosed. As Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn., likes to say, 'Shipbuilding is a long game.' One year is not enough time for dramatic change, as long-time Congressional Budget Office analyst Eric Labs pointed out earlier this month. Which leaves the question of: What can the Navy do before then to prepare for a potential conflict with China? The answer the service has presented comes from Franchetti’s recently published Navigation Plan, which includes her 'Project 33,' the spearheading initiative setting the service’s focus on 2027. Franchetti lays out numerous goals but one that stands out to me is her focus on 80 percent surge readiness. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] 'Think back to 9/11. We know that all of a sudden we need to get ships underway to do different missions … We want to be able to have a process through each one of our communities: aviation, surface and submarines, that they can certify a ship as combat surge ready, and get it out the door on the timeline that it’s needed,' she told reporters earlier this year. It certainly seems like a worthwhile goal, but the Navy’s struggles with maintenance keeping pace with operational tempo — even in peacetime, never mind wartime — are well documented. The CNO will be trying to rapidly overcome problems that I suspect many, if not all, of her predecessors, and their respective counterparts in the Commandant’s office, grappled with when they were at helm. Franchetti has also taken to using the phrase 'Getting more players on the field,' referring to building traditional warships, but also unmanned vessels, among other efforts. The service has spent considerable time and money in the first half of the 2020s going through the steps to incorporate unmanned surface and subsurface vessels into its fleet. And there are success stories such as Saildrones patrolling the seas in support of 4th Fleet. My focus in 2025 will be watching to see if the service can maintain its momentum in adding unmanned vessels to its fleet and when will we more frequently hear about those vessels’ inclusion in real-world operations alongside the manned fleet. Engaging Houthis alongside a carrier strike group in the Red Sea is a vastly different mission than surveilling the coast of South America. Lastly, there’s the money. Franchetti’s plan states candidly that without a larger budget, the service will face 'deep strategic constraints.' When faced with a difficult financial situation this past year, the service opted to heavily cut into its future modernization budget to make up the difference. Cutting funds for next-generation strike fighter development was one big bill payer. While conventional wisdom suggests a Trump administration will certainly request more funding for defense, whether Congress — with all its varying factions, even within the GOP alone — provides that higher level of funding is still very much a question in my mind. How the Navy copes with whatever money it does receive will be a key point on my watch list in 2025. For those who haven’t heard Franchetti speak publicly recently, she has said she has a countdown timer in her office indicating the number of days until 2027. China and its intentions toward Taiwan are clearly at the front of mind for the CNO; she has it put it at the front of mind for her service and, indeed, it will be front of mind for me in the new year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2025/01/for-the-navy-all-eyes-will-be-on-the-china-taiwan-question-2025-preview/	2025-01-02T06:03:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/6185323.jpg
Defense industry could see big shakeup under Trump: 2025 Preview	A model of the proposed paint scheme of the next generation of Air Force One is on display during a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau in the Oval Office of the White House June 20, 2019 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) WASHINGTON— No one could predict the twists and turns of the first Trump administration, even for an area as obscure and mundane as the defense industrial base, and it would be a fool’s errand to try to do that for a second one. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Instead, let’s break down the current state of play in the political environment, look back at the first Trump term, and think about some of the major questions facing the defense industry during a second Trump administration: Will Trump personally involve himself in defense acquisition, again? For defense acquisition nerds, Trump’s first term was marked by his highly unusual personal involvement in weapons contracting. Whether it was his stated desire to return to 'goddamn steam' catapults on the Ford-class carrier, interrogating Boeing executives on the possibility of buying a 'Super Duper Hornet' F/A-18 variant, or having personal meetings with defense CEOs on Air Force One and F-35 contracts, Trump delved into the minutia of defense acquisition in a way that no US president had done in the modern era. With the Wall Street Journal reporting that Trump has already spoken with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg about the Air Force One replacement program — as well as the return of the F-35 and drone warfare to the mainstream news cycle — it’s highly probable that we could see Trump once again try to make his mark on a program, putting pressure on defense contractors to highlight his deal-making skills to the American taxpayer. If I were a gambler, my money would be on Trump interference on big-name aerospace projects — most likely F-35 or Air Force One, again — but potentially also other fighter jets, including the Navy and Air Force’s sixth-generation fighter programs. What happens with defense spending? The fiscal 24 defense budget was constrained by the spending limits imposed by last year’s Fiscal Responsibility Act, and while final appropriations for FY25 won’t be passed until spring (at earliest), signs point to a budget that conforms to those limits. Those restrictions will be gone in time for FY26 — the first chance the Trump administration has to shape the defense budget, albeit not from the bottom up. While the groundwork for the FY26 was performed by the Biden-era Pentagon, whether the incoming administration doubles down on that stagnant Pentagon spending or bumps it up could be a bellwether for its approach in future years. Analysts who spoke to Breaking Defense immediately after the presidential election were split on whether Trump would be good for defense spending. Roman Schweizer, a defense analyst with TD Cowen, pointed to boosts in defense spending under the first Trump administration and cited support for higher toplines among Republican leaders on the defense committees. However, whether defense budgets ultimately see a boost could be down to the interplay of House Republicans, as the razor-thin GOP majority in the House has given hardline fiscal conservatives enormous bargaining power. The Department of Government Efficiency, spearheaded by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, could be another fly in the ointment for defense spending hawks. Musk has declared his intent to use DOGE to slash $2 trillion from the federal budget. And although lawmakers, defense executives and military leaders have suggested they’re on board to cut wasteful spending (who doesn’t love government efficiency?), I don’t see defense companies lining up to suggest programs where they should receive less money. RELATED: Such efficiency, very defense: Congress, industry waiting for Elon's DOGE to wow Is Trump a friend or foe to the defense industry, and who benefits? During his last term, Trump got cozy with the defense primes, celebrating the business acumen of defense executives such as then-Lockheed Martin CEO Marillyn Hewson and — before the Boeing 737 MAX crisis — Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg. It remains to be seen whether any CEOs from legacy defense primes win Trump’s favor, but so far his regard seems to be centered on business leaders from the defense startup and venture capital world. The incoming president recently tapped Stephen Feinberg, who leads private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, as deputy secretary of defense. Other executives from firms like Anduril and Palantir are also reportedly being considered for major roles inside the Pentagon, and Musk could be helping to cut Pentagon spending despite leading a major defense company in SpaceX. One way this dynamic could play out is greater preference for inexpensive uncrewed systems — an area where defense startups have firm footing — instead of the exquisite, expensive weapons platforms traditionally made by defense primes. Pentagon leaders could potentially opt to sacrifice a discrete quantity of a major weapons system such as a single Virginia-class submarine or several dozen F-35s in order to buy hundreds of autonomous weapons and improved networks, Byron Callan, a defense analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, wrote in a Dec. 18 note to investors. 'The tension between GOP fiscal hawks and defense hawks will likely push the administration to look for lower-cost options for defense in the form of autonomous air and naval systems. The role of persons with defense tech/venture/start-up backgrounds in senior administration positions adds firepower to this battle,' he wrote. Down further into the weeds are questions about the regulatory environment, changes to defense contracting, and how Trump’s overall trade policy influences defense contractors. The previous Trump administration took a more hands-off approach to antitrust enforcement, resulting in increased mergers and acquisitions, most controversially seen in Northrop Grumman’s purchase of Orbital ATK. (The Biden administration would later block a similar proposal for Lockheed to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne.) Analysts speculate that the second Trump administration will revert back to a more permissive environment for M&amp;A.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/defense-industry-could-see-big-shakeup-under-trump-2025-preview/	2024-12-31T11:45:18-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/220427_trump_af1_model_GettyImages-1157175271-scaled-e1651086105288.jpg
Austria picks Leonardo M-346 light fighter to replace retired Saab 105s	The M-346, produced by Leonardo, showed off some of its weapons options at the 2023 Paris Air Show. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Austria has taken the next step in shoring up its small and aging fleet of jet fighters, with the formal announcement that Vienna will procure 12 Leonardo M-346FA aircraft. The announcement, made by Defense Minister Klaudia Tanner on Dec. 28, had been been anticipated for months. It comes four years after the neutral nation retired its Swedish-built Saab 105 trainers. The M-346 model selected is light fighter variant of the Italian firm's jet, which is best known as an aircraft trainer. Austria will buy the jets from the Italian government under a government-to-government contract whose details are still under negotiation, the Bundesheer announcement said. While the timeline and pricing for the purchase remain unclear, the Austrian government budgeted 1 billion Euros (currently just over $1 billion US) for the purchase in 2022. Leonardo declined to comment for this article. Until the M-346s begin arriving, the Austrian Air Force’s only combat aircraft are 15 Eurofighters, according to a Flight Global database [PDF] — six of them purchased second-hand from the German Luftwaffe and all of them in the barebones Tranche 1 configuration. (The latest Eurofighter upgrade is Tranche 4). The single-engine M-346 is a significantly lighter aircraft than the twin-engined Typhoon, albeit heftier than the 1960s-vintage Saab 105s it replaces. The M-346 first flew in 2004 as an advanced training aircraft, but like many trainers it can be configured for air defense or ground attack as well. It is currently operated by Italy, Poland, Singapore, Israel, Greece and Qatar, and Leonardo is pitching the aircraft aggressively both to Latin American nations and to the US Navy to replace its aging T-45. The M-346 is also used by the Italian-run International Flight Training School, where Austrian jet pilots have trained since the Saabs were retired. That training will return to Austria once the nation has its own M-346s, Tanner said in her announcement. 'By purchasing the jets, we are closing a significant capability gap in our air force,' Tanner said, according to an online translation of her German statement. 'In this way, we are not only bringing 100 percent of the training of our pilots back to Austria, but we are also significantly strengthening airspace defense. This increases the protection of Austria, the Austrian population and our neutrality against threats from the air.' Replacing the Saabs will also shore up the military value of Vogler Air Base and protect local jobs, Tanner said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/austria-picks-leonardo-m-346-light-fighter-to-replace-retired-saab-105s/	2024-12-31T10:45:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/06/IMG_4965-scaled-e1713255621953.jpg
China stirred the Pacific pot, Japan powered up and Aussie AUKUS anxiety emerged: 2024 in review	A China Coast Guard ship (L) is seen from the Philippine Coast Guard vessel BRP Cabra during a supply mission to Sabina Shoal in disputed waters of the South China Sea on August 26, 2024. (Photo by JAM STA ROSA/AFP via Getty Images) SYDNEY — Turmoil, violence and reaction. That was the theme of 2024 across the Indo-Pacific, with China's belligerence and attempts to remake the international order to its liking at its core driving many decisions of the nations in the theater. In several instances this year Chinese forces engaged in hostile behavior, ramming Philippine ships, allegedly attacking Vietnamese fishermen and threatening Taiwan. But the actions were not without repercussions as they drove China's neighbors and NATO countries to sign major new agreements, increase exercises, sail more joint Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPS) and bang the diplomatic drums more loudly and more often. Japan made among the biggest moves in 2024. Tokyo and Canberra signed a Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA), clearing the way for regular deployments of Japanese marines to Australia, similar to the rotational force the US Marines have at what Australians call the Top End. Japan and Britain also signed an RAA. Japan also announced its biggest defense spending increase since World War II in September. 'The international community is facing the greatest post-war trial yet, and has entered a new era of crisis,' the first page of the their defense budget declared. In the Pacific Islands, scene of much turmoil over the last two years as China pressed to gain advantage in the region, the situation has seemed to stabilize in favor of Australia and its allies. Nauru, the troubled island that once had the world's highest GDP per capital and now faces possible ruin from climate change, agreed to accept $64 million USD from Australia in return for a veto of future Chinese activities in the tiny island. Nauru President David Adeang came to Canberra and signed the agreement on Dec. 9. This is similar to a treaty with Tuvalu, the Australia-Tuvalu Falepili Union, which came into force in late August this year. In addition, the Pacific Island states agreed to join an Australian initiative to improve the region's police forces. Australia committed $400 million AUD ($253 million USD) over five years, which included creation of a regional training center in Brisbane, which opened the day after the Nauru treaty was agreed. The Chinese military itself also wasn't free of internal turmoil, which came into clear view with the suspension from office of a senior member of the powerful Central Military Commission and the previous disappearance of China's third defense minister. All that 'does not give a sense of stability within the PLA [People's Liberation Army],' Meia Nouwens of the International Institute for Strategic Sutfies told Breaking Defense earlier this month when the story broke. One of the few events largely divorced from China of great import in the region was the remarkable declaration of martial law — and its retraction — by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol. Now that Yoon has avoided immediate impeachment, there may be more regional stability than first expected, but his actions did, analysts said, put the crucial General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Japan at risk because the opposition is likely to suspend or scrap if should they take power. There is also concern among China watchers that should the opposition take power, they are likely to listen more carefully to Chinese policymakers than did Yoon. Meanwhile, threading through all these events has been the uncertain course of AUKUS, the massive effort by Australia, the UK and the US to help Australia buy at least three Virginia-class nuclear-powered attack submarines and build a small fleet of SSN AUKUS boats over the next 20-plus years at an estimated cost of $368 billion AUD ($237 billion USD). Australia's defense budget will not increase in real terms until after the next election — likely to be held by March or April next year — at least. Sir Angus Houston, former chief of the defense force and co-author of the Defense Strategic Review, said in late November that Australia must increase overall defense spending to 3 percent of GDP to avoid cannibalizing the military in order to pay for AUKUS. The current plan would only boost spending to 2.2 percent of GDP by 2028. And there are signs of concern among senior Australian officials about budget and execution. Australia killed a $5.3 billion AUD satellite contract with Lockheed Martin, which would appear to be very sort of cannibalization Houston worried about. The Australian government claims it has protected the money and will invest in a new approach, but the cut occurred roughly 18 months after the award was announced. And in a little noticed declaration at a conference in the Indian Ocean focused on AUKUS, an Australian admiral voiced public worry that Australia’s generational effort to buy and deploy nuclear powered submarines was 'at risk' if the government does not take quick, decisive action on infrastructure. The military and government needed to 'get going' on crucial work to ready Western Australia for AUKUS submarines or risk falling behind, Rear Adm. Wendy Malcolm said. He added that Australia’s generational effort to buy and deploy nuclear powered submarines is 'at risk' if the government does not take quick, decisive action on infrastructure.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/china-stirred-the-pacific-pot-japan-powered-up-and-aussie-aukus-anxiety-emerged-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T09:26:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/241213_china_philippine_ships_GettyImages-2167796597-scaled-e1734121917898.jpg
Middle East was designed by regional conflicts and increased indigenous production: 2024 in review	A cloud of smoke erupts during an Israeli air strike on the village of Sujud in southern Lebanon on September 25, 2024. (Photo by RABIH DAHER/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — As the war drums fade in Lebanon and to the east the half-century Syrian regime has toppled, I've leaned toward labeling 2024 as 'the year the Middle East was reshaped.' [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] The conflict between Israel and Lebanese group Hezbollah reached a ceasefire after a dramatic course of events including an Israeli attack on Hezbollah that included exploding pagers and walkie talkies, Israel targeting storage warehouses in civilian neighborhoods, and the assassination of Hezbollah Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah. The US-mediated ceasefire launched a 60-day truce between Israel and Lebanon starting on Nov. 27, with a monitoring committee comprised of the US, France, Lebanon, Israel and the United Nations Interim Forces in Lebanon (UNIFIL). Then, on Dec. 8 Bashar al-Assad fled to Russia while rebel forces swept through the country and captured Damascus. After the regime collapse, eyes moved to the fate of the Russian military bases in Syria and the potential collapse of an Iranian weapons pipeline to Hezbollah. In late 2023, the Red Sea saw attacks from the Yemen-based Houthi rebel group, which led to an international coalition to secure the waters. Notably, Saudi Arabia and the UAE were absent from these coalitions, and Bahrain was the only Gulf state to take part in the US-led operation Prosperity Garden. While parts of the Middle East reeled from those geopolitical earthquakes, the defense industries of other nations in the region doggedly pursued their own goals, including parallel focuses on localization and expansion with international partnerships. For instance, Qatar's Barzan Holdings is cementing the investments it's already made in platforms like unmanned vehicles, counter-UAS solutions, command and control systems and ammunition. 'We have built a good portfolio in the last seven years, and we are planning to strengthen this portfolio in these sectors,' deputy CEO Mohammad Al Marri told Breaking Defense in a March interview at DIMDEX in Qatar. 'We are not planning to diversify since what we have right now is competent enough. Our focus for the next five years is to ensure capability and sustainability for our platforms,' he added. UAE defense conglomerate EDGE Group expanded in 2024 its international reach with cross border cooperation plans, including founding an ammunition production line in Indonesia, signing an agreement with Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri to codevelop underwater solutions in the UAE, and signing another agreement with the Brazilian navy to codevelop counter-drone systems. 'This year [2024] for us is a year to catch up on our deliveries, our commitments, whether that is a delivery of a solution, or a development,' Hamad Al Marar, EDGE Group CEO told Breaking Defense in February. The firm also made its first stride in the space domain this year, launching a new company dubbed FADA. Saudi Arabia has worked on its ambitious defense plans this year, as it eyes to join the international sixth-generation fighter jets program, GCAP. Saudi Arabian Military Industries showed off its defense plans and platforms developed at second edition of the World Defense Show this year. Turkey made confident strides in its defense production projects. Its national fifth-generation fighter jet, dubbed KAAN, performed its maiden flight in February. Ankara also launched its first mostly indigenous communications satellite to orbit and expanded its deals with other nations, including its first export contract to a NATO nation.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/middle-east-was-designed-by-regional-conflicts-and-increased-indigenous-production-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T07:12:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/GettyImages-2173524754-scaled-e1734622532317.jpg
Russia doubled down on nuclear threats in Europe: 2024 in review	View of the Kremlin in the aftermath of a drone attack by Ukraine (Getty Images) BELFAST — This year Russian President Vladimir Putin ramped up threats to his enemies across the NATO alliance by lowering the threshold for a nuclear strike — a move that directly followed Moscow accusing the US of approving Ukraine to fire Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia for the first time since the war began. Shortly after, Washington went on to publicly acknowledge the policy to loosen weapon restrictions was in place, after months of resisting calls to do so. [This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2024 and look forward to what 2025 may hold.] Russia's new nuclear doctrine, signed by Putin in November, laid out in clear terms that any non nuclear power aligned with a nuclear state, or receiving support from a nuclear state — effectively all 32 members of NATO — will be considered targets if Russia thinks it is under threat. William Alberque, former Director of NATO’s Arms Control, Disarmament and Non-Proliferation Center, noted in an op-ed published on Breaking Defense, that 'In all, the new doctrine says that Russia will use nuclear weapons whenever the president decides to do so.' He added, 'But by expanding the role of nuclear weapons beyond … deterrence, and by expanding the dangers that could become threats — to include military infrastructure or exercises near its borders — it risks sending ambiguous or non-credible deterrent signals that could, in turn, require Putin to act out further in order to credibly deter the West.' On the ground in Ukraine, another 12 months have passed, over 1,000 days in all since the war started, without either side able to strike a winning blow — though Russia continued with slow advances. Kyiv has shown renewed resilience and ingenuity, most notably making a surprise incursion in the border territory of Kursk that featured an estimated deployment of 10,000 troops. At the time, the tactical gamble was looked upon by Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, as Ukraine's way of cracking 'open' debate in NATO over whether to allow long range weapon strikes in Russia, but it was only when North Korean soldiers were deployed to Kursk that Washington finally dropped long range weapons restrictions to strike inside Russia. It is estimated that Pyongyang has sent around 11,000 troops to Kursk. Losses on the North Korean side, shared for the first time in December by Ukraine's main defense intelligence agency, are said to amount to at least 30 dead or wounded in action, reported ABC News. Europe's efforts to increase weapons production on Ukraine's behalf and to restock equipment offered to Kyiv remains in the shadow of Russian industrial might. Morten Brandtzaeg, CEO of Norway’s Nammo, suggested that competing with Russian artillery shell production output on a 'one-to-one' basis is futile, and that European industry would be better served by concentrating on quality over quantity. He did share reasons for optimism however, explaining that European production took a 'huge step forward' over the last year, off the back of 'separate nations' supporting 'local industry' through government subsidies. Brandtzaeg added that Norway, Sweden, Finland and Germany had all followed such a path. As the year draws to a close, top of mind for European leaders is the potential threat posed by President-elect Donald Trump; not just from the fallout that could occur from the US ending military aid to Ukraine — a move he has threatened — but a peace plan that might take Ukraine membership of NATO off the table. The sudden collapse of French and German governments in quick succession has not helped to allay fears that European unity on defense issues will suffer to boot.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/russia-doubled-down-on-nuclear-threats-in-europe-2024-in-review/	2024-12-31T05:45:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/05/kremlin-scaled-e1683228223123.jpg
Turkey’s Baykar acquires Italian firm Piaggio Aerospace	A full-scale mockup of the Piaggio Aerospace's P.1 HH Hammerhead unmanned aerial system is presented at the International Paris Airshow at Le Bourget on June 17, 2015. (ERIC PIERMONT/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Baykar has been approved by the Italian government to buy Italian aviation giant Piaggio Aerospace in a move that thecompany says will expand its reach in the European Union. 'The relaunch of the company is guaranteed, with a clear and ambitious industrial vision,' Industry Minister Adolfo Urso said, according to a statement from the Ministry of Business and Made in Italy. 'After six years of waiting, we are giving Piaggio Aerospace a future, a strategic asset for our country, with a long-term production perspective, safeguarding corporate complexes and workforce.' Baykar outbid two other offers for the sale, according to the ministry's statement, though the value of the deal was not disclosed. Piaggio Aerospace was launched in 1884, and specializes in designing developing, manufacturing and maintaining aircraft, UAVs and engines. Piaggio Aerospace has developed the P.1HH HammerHead and P.180 Avanti unmanned aerial systems — giving it obvious synergies with Baykar, which rose to prominence on the back of its own UAV designs — and also conducts maintenance repair and overhaul (MRO) services. 'It makes sense for Baykar to buy an Italian company. This will provide access to European markets, but also access to EU funded projects,' Caglar Kurc, a defense analyst and assistant professor at Abdullah Gül University, told Breaking Defense. 'I also think that this would protect Baykar's business with European countries if there are any crises between Turkey and European countries (or EU),' he said. Turkey was previously part of the Lockheed Martin-led F-35 fifth-generation aircraft program, with Turkish firms producing parts of the aircraft. In 2019, however, the US suspended Turkey’s participation in the program over Ankara’s purchase of the Russian S-400 air defense systems. Piaggio Aerospace was selected in 2004 by Pratt &amp; Whitney America to produce and supply components of F-135 engine for the F-35. With the purchase of Piaggio, it is possible Turkey could regain access to the F-35 supplier program. Spokespeople for Pratt &amp; Whitney did not respond to a request for comment by press time about what Piaggio’s current role on the F135 engine production line is or whether the company had any concerns about that role. A full return to F-35 program is 'unlikely' as long as Turkey has the S-400, Kurc said. But, 'Baykar, through Piaggio will become a supplier to F-35 [which] is pretty interesting to watch,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/turkeys-baykar-acquires-italian-firm-piaggio-aerospace/	2024-12-30T14:03:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/12/GettyImages-477405560-scaled-e1735574795992.jpg
Pentagon unveils new $2.5 billion package for Ukraine; USAI funds depleted	The National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, or NASAMS, firing a missile. The system, jointly produced by the US and Norway, is a critical part of Ukraine's air defense. (Photo: Kongsberg Defense and Aerospace) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department today announced a new package of military assistance for Ukraine collectively worth roughly $2.5 billion, as the Biden administration in its waning days rushes to get aid to Kyiv out the door. Included in the announcement is $1.25 billion worth of equipment delivered via presidential drawdown authority, as well as $1.22 billion stemming from Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) funds. Drawdown equipment is taken directly from US stocks, whereas USAI funds can support a range of activities from training to the purchase of new equipment. The aid package, the Biden administration’s final of 2024, represents the depletion of USAI dollars Congress appropriated in an April supplemental spending bill, according to a White House press release. According to the Pentagon, drawdown equipment focused on Kyiv’s 'most urgent needs,' such as missile defense articles, artillery munitions and anti-tank weapons. For its part, USAI funds covered capabilities such as air defense and drones. The full list of equipment from a DoD press release is as follows: The package comes during a tough winter for Ukraine amid an onslaught of Russian strikes, including a Christmas Day attack on the country’s power grid. With USAI funds depleted, President Joe Biden is hurrying to spend remaining drawdown authority before President-elect Donald Trump takes office — whom many observers fear could turn off the spigot of military assistance for Kyiv. 'I’ve directed my Administration to continue surging as much assistance to Ukraine as quickly as possible — including drawing down older U.S. equipment for Ukraine, rapidly delivering it to the battlefield, and then revitalizing the U.S. defense industrial base to modernize and replenish our stockpiles with new weapons,' Biden said in the release. 'At my direction, the United States will continue to work relentlessly to strengthen Ukraine’s position in this war over the remainder of my time in office,' he added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/12/pentagon-unveils-new-2-5-billion-package-for-ukraine-usai-funds-depleted/	2024-12-30T12:23:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/06/NASAMS-Firing-RMD-e1735589628352.jpg
