Boeing inks contracts worth more than $4B for KC-46s, P-8s	A Boeing KC-46A Pegasus takes off at Yokota Air Base, Japan, Oct. 25, 2018, during a system evaluation. (U.S. Air Force photo by Yasuo Osakabe) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon this week awarded Boeing a pair of separate contracts for 15 KC-46A Pegasus tankers and seven P-8A Poseidon maritime surveillance aircraft, deals that are collectively worth more than $4 billion. Although both contracts had been expected under existing plans, getting the deals signed is good news for Boeing, whose defense arm logged $2 billion in losses for its last fiscal quarter and which is facing company-wide layoffs. The P-8A deal is valued at $1.67 billion and includes non-recurring engineering work for foreign military sales made to Canada and Germany. It will bring the number of P-8As on contract up to 207, 135 of which are for the US Navy. Australia, India, the United Kingdom, Norway, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Germany and Canada all fly the maritime surveillance aircraft, which has played an integral part in experimentation done at the behest of the AUKUS trilateral security pact. 'This $1.67 billion undefinitized contract for seven additional P-8A Poseidons not only reinforces the U.S. Navy’s commitment to maintaining a robust maritime presence but also highlights Boeing's dedication to delivering safe, reliable platforms that enhance the Navy’s operational capabilities, readiness and effectiveness,' Tory Peterson, vice president and P-8 program manager at Boeing. 'We look forward to delivering these additional P-8A maritime patrol aircraft to ensure the continued safety and security of our nation and allies.' The KC-46A deal is valued at $2.38 billion and includes 15 additional planes for the US Air Force. The new deal brings the number of planes on contract up to 168, according to a Boeing statement. The company to date has delivered 89 KC-46As to the US Air Force as well as four to Japan. RELATED: Boeing Machinists Vote To End Strike, Putting KC-46, P-8 Programs Back On Track The State Department previously cleared Japan to purchase up to nine KC-46 tankers for its air force in a deal valued at a $4.1 billion. If the Japanese proceed with that deal, it would more than double its current fleet, which is currently set to eventually reach six planes. Israel is also under contract on the tanker, which has been plagued by delays and cost overruns over the last decade.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/boeing-inks-contracts-worth-more-than-4b-for-kc-46s-p-8s/	2024-11-22T09:09:58-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/240913_DVIDS_kc46_japan_4866234-scaled-e1726259068659.jpg
After watching Ukraine, Central Asian nations ‘turning away’ from Russia for arms: US officials	The Kazakhstan National Defense University welcomed then-Lt. Gen. Michael Garrett, the commander of US Army Central, as its guest speaker Dec. 13, 2016, in the capital city of Astana. (US Army photo by Sgt. Brandon Hubbard) WASHINGTON — The war in Ukraine has prompted 'introspection' among Central Asian nations about buying military equipment mostly from Russia, and pushed them to look farther from home for arms — from Beijing all the way to Washington, according to State Department officials. 'I would argue that's not countries turning towards China; it's countries turning away from Russia,' Ambassador Donald Lu, assistant secretary at the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs, said on a panel at the Center for New American Security last week. 'And they're not just looking at China, they're looking at Iran, they're looking at Europe, they're looking at the United States. They're having to go further afield because military equipment is just not available in the way that it was before the Ukraine war.' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense this week that before the Kremlin's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the Central Asian nations — Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan — already had been 'diversifying away from Russia.' But the process has been hurried along not only by the strain the war has put on the pipeline for Russian equipment and parts, but by the view of Russia's experience on the battlefield. 'The second factor that has caused sort of a reexamination is all the five Central Asian nations have observed the performance of Russian equipment in Ukraine and have raised questions about how that equipment would perform in a regional conflict, should they have that requirement,' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity. The official declined to comment on the broader political implications of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in the region, but an analysis by the Foreign Policy Research Institute in May said Central Asian nations, as fellow former members of the Soviet Union, were spooked by Russia's move. 'For Russia, the invasion deeply damaged its reputation and self-appointed role as the sole security manager for the region,' reads the analysis, written by Robert Hamilton, head of research at the FPRI's Eurasia Program. 'Given what the Central Asian governments, especially Kazakhstan, have seen in Ukraine regional states, they view Moscow’s motives with deep suspicion and have lost considerable faith in its military capabilities.' Central Asia is not a large defense market. The combined military expenditure for Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan in 2023 was approximately $1.84 billion, according to a Stockholm International Peace Research Institute database, by far the lowest expenditure by region that SIPRI tracked. (Figures for Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan were not available.) For comparison, the next closet regional expenditure, from Central America and the Caribbean, was approximately $14.7 billion. But the nations sit at a key geostrategic crossroads, with Russia immediately to the north, China to the east and Iran and Afghanistan to the south. Since the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, the region has become an even more important player in the realm of counterterrorism, according to the State Department official. 'So it is one part of the world where you do get a lot of these strategic competitors kind of working in a similar place,' the official said. The FPRI analysis notes that China has been a prime beneficiary of Central Asia's slow pull away from Russia, and Beijing has offered attractive economic packages as well as arms deals to draw them closer. But it also notes that Turkey has a presence in defense sales as well, especially when it comes to drone sales, according to SIPRI data. As Breaking Defense has reported, Ankara has been aggressively expanding its military export portfolio in recent years. Turkey 'frankly, [has] a share that is sizeable and growing,' the official added. The State Department official didn't expound on Lu's reference to Iran, and the SIPRI database makes scant mention of public Iranian exports to the region. But Breaking Defense has reported that global interest in Tehran's indigenous, relatively cheap unmanned aerial vehicles, used in mass in Ukraine by Russia, has only grown since the beginning of the Ukraine conflict. In 2022, Iran publicly inaugurated a drone manufacturing facility in Tajikistan. As for the US, the State Department official said Washington has seen a 'very high level' of interest in American-made defense products, platforms and services, but 'there's a couple of limiting factors there.' 'As you can imagine, expense is one of those,' the official said. 'Our defense articles and services are fairly advanced, right?' And, therefore, tend to be expensive. Relatedly, there are 'tech release' issues, as the US is cautious when it comes to handing over high-tech equipment, presumably especially to nations that have such historically close ties to Russia and China. Coming information-sharing agreements, the official said, could help with that particular obstacle. 'So we do see that we need to balance sometimes US protection of our tech against where we're going to be able to release those things. The Central Asians, though, are again very interested in our particular products; it's really just a matter of making a good match,' the official said. As such, the official said it's unlikely that big ticket items, like fighter jets, will be part of any deals any time soon. (One of the only announcements about major US Foreign Military Sales to the region on the website for the Defense Cooperation Security Agency, for instance, was a 2020 notice that the US had approved a potential $128 million deal with Kazakhstan for airborne ISR systems.) The official said what the US has seen, instead, are very precise requests, 'the sort of smaller capabilities that tend to fill niches they have.' 'So it will be things like, &#8216;I need a UAV with a 20-kilometer range, with some amount of loiter time that can do X, Y and Z,' the official said. 'Or I need an over-the-horizon radar, which will pick up the following kind of targets. 'I say that as an example that they're fairly sophisticated, or at least clear-eyed, about what they're looking for from us,' the official said. Another 'great place to start,' the official said, is small arms and ammunition — a lower-profile but ubiquitous military need that Central Asian nations have expressed interest in having the US fill. 'And we find that pretty significant because &#8230; these countries have been firing Russian caliber ammunition forever and ever,' the official said. 'But they look at the US small arms inventory and think, &#8216;I want to get to that; I want to get over to that capability.'' Another State Department official told Breaking Defense that Central Asian nations have also expressed interest in boutique equipment used by American special operations forces — sometimes after witnessing the equipment in action during joint training exercises. 'But yea we certainly see working ourselves up the ladder to bigger systems, to more capable systems,' the first official said. 'This is one of the way that we connect with countries around the world,' that official said. 'It's perhaps magnified in Central Asia because of the competition that's happening in the region.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-watching-ukraine-central-asian-nations-turning-away-from-russia-for-arms-us-officials/	2024-11-22T08:20:06-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_kazakhstan_armored_vehicle_3077375-scaled-e1732128967704.jpg
Integrating commercial off-the-shelf computing on military platforms and how to make it work	The NCS Technologies division responsible for additive manufacturing is subject to the same quality controls as third parties. NCS Technologies photo. The threats to maneuver-force ground vehicles and their crews today are in many ways akin to what platforms faced in Iraq and Afghanistan faced years ago. The need for mechanical systems to drive sensors and computers for command and control and situational awareness, for example, remains relevant today. Back then, maneuver forces needed 360-degree cameras to help identify subtle changes in a given area, like a truck that wasn’t there the day before. The cameras required sophisticated data handling and storage systems that were stressed even under good conditions, as vehicles traversed rough terrain in all kinds of weather, with limited cooling and power, and perhaps with bombs exploding nearby. In that environment, the systems also required filters to keep sand out of the ventilation, uninterruptible power supplies to prevent sudden shutdowns resulting in lost data – not uncommon on military vehicles – and removable data storage so the data collected by the vehicle can be shared with a command post. Steve Stuck is vice president of the Appliance and Server Engineering Group at NCS Technologies. 'We designed several different iterations of that for a customer,' said Steve Stuck, Vice President of the Appliance and Server Engineering Group at NCS Technologies, which designs and builds custom computing solutions for mobile military platforms. 'They used them in the field in Afghanistan and came back to us with lessons learned. We completely re-architected the design based on their feedback.' Subsequent versions proved resilient against just about anything short of physical destruction of the vehicle, Stuck says. The camera system is but one example of the type of requests NCS Technologies routinely fields today from its military customers trying to address threat scenarios across European, Indo-Pacific, and Middle East battlespace. Oftentimes, these customers know what capabilities they’re looking for and turn to NCS Technologies to bring them to fruition.' NCS does this in a variety of inventive ways. Custom computing with a COTS twist Modern military platforms rely on advanced computing systems that must be protected against natural elements, extreme temperatures, and salt water, as well as decidedly human threats ranging from kinetics to supply chain sabotage. Ground vehicles are becoming smaller, more autonomous and mobile, amplifying the challenge. There are no one-size-fits-all solutions. Different platforms have varied missions, not to mention their own size, weight, power and cost (SWAP-C) requirements. In addition, data processing and storage systems must be compatible with other onboard electronics with which they connect – whether by design or not. The company is often contracted to do technology insertion into legacy platforms, with the onboard electronics to which it must interface sometimes many years behind mainstream – necessitating some creativity in designing leading edge computer systems that can communicate with legacy systems. Checking all necessary boxes in an affordable way is complicated, but that’s what NCS Technologies regularly accomplishes with its builds. Ronald Keene is vice president of military business development for NCS Technologies. 'We're dedicated to providing solutions that deliver performance, security, and reliability for every scenario that our customers put in front of us; that’s all,' said Ronald Keene, the company’s vice president of military business development. NCS packages commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) computing and storage components to fit within the space and power constraints of a given platform, be it a ship or combat vehicle, and ruggedizes them against all operational scenarios. The company relies on model-based systems engineering, additive manufacturing, and inventiveness to do this. 'Almost everything we develop requires some degree of engineering, even if it's a COTS offering; nobody wants something exactly the way they see it on the website,' Stuck noted. 'Sometimes that's easy, sometimes that's harder.' Take, for example, the often-complex network of fans, ducts, and vents needed to prevent compute systems from overheating. Typically, fans draw and expel air from opposite sides of a system, but sometimes a customer needs customization for a specific vehicle integration. 'A requirement came to us recently where airflow had to come from adjoining sides so we're having to design the system in a very unconventional way,' Stuck said. 'We're using off-the-shelf technology, but you don't find systems where airflow comes in the side and goes out the back. It doesn't exist in a normal environment.' That said, NCS is careful not to over-customize. 'We don't want to add cost by driving a customization that's not necessary for the use case,' Keene said. The role of additive manufacturing Not everything can be bought off the shelf, and this is especially true of the brackets and other hardware necessary to house, support, and protect sensitive computing systems customized for mobile military platforms and vessels. This is where NCS’s in-house additive manufacturing capability, colloquially known as 3D printing, comes into play. During the digital design and engineering process, NCS uses additive manufacturing to quickly build prototype component parts to see what works and what doesn’t. Having the additive manufacturing in house means that engineers can design several notional designs, print all three of them and see which one works best and move on. Even though these parts are manufactured in-house, the NCS division responsible for additive manufacturing is subject to the same quality controls as third parties. Additive manufacturing is also a valuable tool in making modifications relatively late in the design and production process. Stuck cited an example of this where a single semiconductor chip was overheating and the ability to cool it by increasing fan speed was found to increase Airborne Noise (ABN) and Structure-borne Noise (SBN) beyond allowable Environmental Qualification Testing (EQT) tolerances, resulting in a bit of a 'Catch-22'. A tight schedule precluded a system redesign, so NCS engineers designed and additively manufactured an unusually shaped plenum – a chamber where a substance is collected for distribution – that drew air from a specific spot and directed it toward the chip. Problem solved. Structured for success In an era where many companies are embracing vertical integration, NCS’s design and development organization has a horizontal structure that strings together disciplines including design, systems engineering, and manufacturing to tackle the complex challenges of SWAP-C. The company’s customer interfacing team, meanwhile, has deep expertise in specific mission areas. 'We help drive the requirements working with our product management and engineering experts to devise an offering that specifically meets the business use case that the customer's looking for,' Stuck says. The NCS engineering-design team in one area interfaces directly to the manufacturing engineering team to ensure that a specially designed product can be manufactured at scale. For example, when the engineering team designs a system to optimize airflow while minimizing costs, the manufacturing engineering team weighs in to ensure it can be built quickly and affordably, a process that can involve some compromises. This horizontal back-and-forth manufacturing approach differs from siloed structures where engineering teams handoff designs to a production team that only then figures out how to build it. Instead of subcontracting for hardware fabrication and waiting for parts to be built, delivered, then tested for shock and vibration, and properly integrated, NCS keeps the entire process in-house, speeding design iteration, manufacturing, and quality control. This approach also improves sustainment. NCS’ field products have an expected lifecycle as long as 8-10 years, so the company designs products with LRUs (line replaceable units) in mind to speed up field service should it become necessary, and to also enhance its customer’s support experience with a comprehensive sustainment offering. NCS Technologies packages COTS computing and storage components to fit within the space and power constraints of a given platform, be it a ship or combat vehicle, and ruggedizes them against all operational scenarios. NCS Technologies photo. Resilience testing and supply chain security Like any contractor, NCS wants to ship its products with a high confidence level that they will pass muster with the customer. The Navy, for example, requires that machinery, electronics, and structures to be deployed on ships pass MIL-DTL-901E Floating Shock Testing, also known as barge testing. This entails placing items on a covered barge in a deep-water pond that then is exposed to explosions at various depths and distances to ensure they can withstand the rigors of combat. NCS has in-house shock and vibration test equipment that can emulate the effects of barge testing. 'Going to the barge, which is a required step in qualifying products or solutions for the Navy, is expensive and takes time to schedule,' Stuck says. 'The last thing you want to do is go to the barge and fail.' Confidence in systems also applies to the supply chain and security of the industrial base. Combat-bound computer systems face threats before they reach the field in the form of counterfeit parts or chips deliberately infected with spyware or malware. To address this, NCS has partnered with another innovative Northern Virginia company to identify and counter supply chain threats by isolating and monitoring a device’s electromagnetic emissions. The resulting signatures are measured against an established baseline, using patented machine learning capabilities to identify differences that might be indicative of counterfeiting or malware. 'It's powerful,' Stuck says. 'We've used this in our supply chain environment to make sure that a board that we're using is what it's supposed to be.' It’s one more layer of resiliency that NCS Technologies brings to its military customers and OEMs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/integrating-commercial-off-the-shelf-computing-on-military-platforms-and-how-to-make-it-work/	2024-11-22T08:08:05-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/The-NCS-Technologies-division-responsible-for-additive-manufacturing-is-subject-to-the-same-quality-controls-as-third-parties.-NCS-Technologies-photo.jpg
Lockheed, Pentagon reach handshake deal for next 2 F-35 production lots	An F-35B lands aboard Japan's Izumo-class multi-functional destroyer JS Kaga (DDH-184) for the first time on Oct. 20, 2024. (Photo by Cmdr. Darin Russell.) WASHINGTON — After protracted negotiations, the Pentagon and Lockheed Martin have reached an informal agreement, known as a 'handshake deal,' for the next two production lots of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the parties confirmed to Breaking Defense. 'We have reached an initial agreement as part of ongoing negotiations for the Lot 18/19 Air Vehicle Production Contract,' the F-35 Joint Program Office (JPO) and Lockheed said in a joint statement. The statement did not share final quantities or prices, saying only that those figures will be disclosed 'when a final agreement is signed.' The news was first reported by Air &amp; Space Forces Magazine, which stated the agreement covers roughly 300 aircraft. Progress on F-35 negotiations is likely welcome news to Lockheed, which has recently been funding the tri-variant stealth fighter’s production out of pocket as talks dragged on. A Lockheed executive told Breaking Defense last year that the aerospace giant aimed to finalize the lot 18/19 deal by the end of 2023, marking a significant delay for the negotiations. The program has recently battled inflation woes, supply chain challenges and technical problems that halted deliveries of upgraded jets for a full year. It’s not clear what the price might be for the forthcoming jets, though Lockheed has telegraphed that inflation may hike costs. Jets in lots 15 through 17 came in at an average price of $82.5 million for the conventional takeoff and landing F-35A, $109 million for the short takeoff and vertical landing F-35B and $102.1 million for the carrier-launched F-35C, Breaking Defense previously reported. Unlike the previous contract structure that included three production lots, the upcoming F-35 deal only covers two. Officials have discussed lot 20 serving as the first multi-year production agreement. Lockheed maintains that its Fort Worth, Texas, plant can build 156 jets annually. If the past is any guide, it could be several months before an agreement is inked. When the two parties reached a similar handshake agreement for lots 15-17 in July 2022, the contract was not finalized until December of that year. Asked when Lockheed planned for the 18/19 deal to become official, a company spokesperson referred Breaking Defense to comments from Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave during the firm’s third quarter earnings call in October. Malave said then that company officials anticipated the lot 18/19 contract will be awarded this year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/lockheed-pentagon-reach-handshake-deal-for-next-2-f-35-production-lots/	2024-11-22T07:06:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/10/8708105-scaled-e1729541848808.jpg
Lawmakers backing separate cyber force see opening with Trump’s return	U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during the United Nations General Assembly seen on a laptop computer in Hastings on the Hudson, New York, U.S., on Tuesday, Sept. 22. 2020. (Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has long pushed back against the establishment of a new military service dedicated to cyberspace, but with President-elect Donald Trump on his way back to the White House, a separate cyber force has a real shot at becoming a reality, according to experts and to lawmakers who support the move. 'This change in administration potentially could give more impetus to the creation of a separate cyber service,' Quentin Hodgson, formerly the Pentagon’s director of Cyber Plans, told Breaking Defense. '[Trump] did that with the Space Force. It was something that the Department of Defense didn't want, but he decided he wanted it, and it's possible that that could also happen with cyberspace.' Hodgson was hardly alone in connecting Trump’s then-controversial move to stand up the Space Force in 2019 to visions of what his second term could bring to the cyber realm. Among those who made the comparison to Breaking Defense was Rep. Pat Fallon, a Texas Republican and vocal supporter of the cyber force idea. 'As the past half century has shown us, there will be naysayers and contrarians within the Pentagon who will do everything to slow-roll major changes. However, only six years ago, we had the same issue in the space domain,' Fallon said in an email. 'We need concrete progress and limited stagnation in cyber, something I know the Trump Administration will emphasize throughout the next four years.' Fallon and Rep. Morgan Luttrell, another Texas Republican, authored an amendment in the 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that called for an independent third-party study to help lawmakers and DoD leaders determine if a separate cyber force is necessary. The study is being conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. 'Incumbent on the results of the commission, which I think will affirm the need for a cyber service, I believe there’s a good chance we will see [a cyber service] come to fruition in soon. The Trump administration has shown that they will not put up with the status quo, and will opt for bold action, if necessary, especially when US national security is at risk,' Fallon said. Luttrell, like Fallon, said in an interview that he thought that if the third-party study came back recommending an independent cyber force, Trump would likely be on board, but ultimately, it is 'most certainly the president’s call.' 'As a congressional member, if I want to know the advancements in AI, technology, name any given space, where do I get to go to that? Do I have to go talk to the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, or go talk to [Cyber Command]?' Luttrell told Breaking Defense. 'Or could I go to cyber force, talk to the leadership, like, ‘Hey, where are we?’ And then they could say, ‘This is where we stand. This is what we implemented.’' Outside experts agreed that a Trump administration would, as the Foundation for Defense of Democracies Mark Montgomery put it, 'look more favorably' on a separate cyber service. Montgomery, the senior director for FDD’s Center on Cyber and Technology Innovation, said such a service could 'address our poor cyber force generation efforts over the past decade.' Emily Harding, vice president of the Defense and Security Department at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told Breaking Defense that the possibility of a cyber force under Trump’s second term is a 'big shrug' and that she has 'zero evidence' it’s in the works. But, she said, 'I also know these guys like to build things, and you know they were the ones responsible for Space Force, so why not?' She added that Trump’s seemingly close relationship with SpaceX founder and technology innovator Elon Musk — who was recently tapped by Trump to co-lead the new Department of Government Efficiency — is another factor that could lead to a cyber force. 'You could see somebody like Elon Musk understanding this in a way that you know other people might not. So I don't know. I think there's a decent chance that they pursue it. I think they should pursue it,' she said. Harding said she primarily supports a cyber force because she believes an independent service will allow the military to find the most cyber-capable fighters. 'The kinds of skills that you're recruiting for in a cyber service or in a cyber role are very different from the kinds of skills you're recruiting for in what you consider the other branches of the military,' she said. 'I think you would want a different setup for recruiting and for training. In the other services, each one of them has a cyber skill set. They have a cyber specialty, but there's not necessarily the same path to advancement. So I think it's worth it to create the separate service, to create the talent pipeline and the specific structures that you would need for reserve,' she added. The Pentagon disagrees, arguing that the creation of a separate cyber force could create new challenges for the DoD in terms of understanding warfighting needs within each service. 'A cyber service might have some benefits in ease of administrative management, but we have a variety of …military services in the Department of Defense who perform a variety of missions,' Mieke Eoyang, deputy assistant secretary of defense for cyber policy, said last year. 'Having a cyber service that is divorced from those particular mission sets may pose some challenges in understanding the warfighting needs of the services to provide cyber to enable that fight.' 'I think the question is that for people who think the cyber service is the answer to our … current challenges in cyber personnel management: be careful what you wish for,' she said. Related: ‘Be careful what you wish for:’ DoD official warns separate cyber force could pose new challenges Furthermore, at the end of September, the department formally requested that lawmakers shut down Fallon and Luttrell’s proposal for the independent assessment. DoD leaders contended that Congress had already called for an assessment of the current cyber landscape within the Pentagon, which included the potential for creating a cyber service in the 2023 NDAA. Jacquelyn Schneider, a fellow at the Hoover Institution where she serves as the director of the Hoover Wargaming and Crisis Simulation Initiative, is also against the creation of a new cyber service. She argued that rather than consolidating cyber expertise and infrastructure, it would lead to information silos that would make the military less effective in the cyber domain. 'In a world in which warfare is inherently joint, every time you create these different organizations, you create information stove pipes,' said Schneider, who also previously served as a senior policy advisor to the Cyberspace Solarium Commission. Right now it’s unclear where exactly Trump stands, and his transition team did not respond to a request for comment. 'Trump likes to make services,' she said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/lawmakers-backing-separate-cyber-force-see-opening-with-trumps-return/	2024-11-22T05:20:16-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_trump_laptop_GettyImages-1228653864-scaled-e1732226397800.jpg
Navy to sideline support ships, re-assign mariner crews amid worsening workforce shortages	The Military Sealift Command fleet replenishment oiler USNS Big Horn (T-AO 198) conducts a fueling-at-sea with the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), July 10, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Rashan Jefferson) WASHINGTON — The Navy late last month approved a plan to put a number of Military Sealift Command logistics ships into extended maintenance periods as well as re-assign certain crews to higher priority vessels, the service announced today. 'Our civil service mariners play invaluable roles providing continuous logistics support to our deployed naval forces, and they are working overtime to sustain that mission globally,' Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro said in a written statement. 'This initiative will not only address operational logistics challenges we face now, it will ensure that Military Sealift Command has policies, programs and incentives it needs to recruit and retain future generations of civil service mariners.' Military Sealift Command is responsible for managing civilian crews that operate the various support and auxiliary ships that resupply US Navy warships around the world. It employs roughly 5,500 civil service mariners, 1,500 contracted mariners, and operates 140 logistics supply ships, such as fleet replenishment oilers and dry cargo/ammunition ships. Rear Adm. Philip Sobeck, MSC's chief, told reporters ahead of the announcement that up to 17 ships would either be put into extended maintenance periods or undergo planned inactivation periods by the end of 2026, but declined to name specific vessels. USNI News first reported earlier this year the Navy was considering such a move. There is 'a critical shortage across the US, across the civilian mariner landscape, which certainly affects our ability to grow our Combat Logistics fleet and the other [government-owned, government-operated] ships, and our ability to fully generate ready forces,' Sobeck said. 'This shortage is an industry-wide problem, and we find ourselves direct in direct competition [with commercial industry.]' 'In fact, we're just not competitive,' he added, citing numerous obstacles MSC's mariners face, including delayed relief, extended deployment times and pay caps. By reassigning crews to higher priority vessels, the Navy is hoping to provide more predictable schedules for current crews and minimize 'overdue reliefs.' The shortage of qualified merchant mariners has been a long-festering problem. Ann Phillips, head of the Transportation Department's Maritime Administration, told lawmakers last year that a 2017 study found, 'concurrent operations of the commercially operated U.S.-flagged fleet and sustained military sealift operations' would require roughly 13,600 mariners with 'unlimited credentials.' At that time, there were roughly 11,760 mariners who were both qualified and actively sailing, a deficit of more than 1,800. Sobeck declined to provide updated numbers on the mariner shortage writ large across the country, but said within his purview, MSC is currently coping with roughly 800- to 1,000-person shortages daily. 'The goal is to fully execute MSC's workforce initiative by the end of fiscal year 2026,' he said. 'This brings us directly in line with [the chief of naval operations'] Project 33 goal, ready to sustain high-end, joint and combined combat by 2027.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-to-sideline-support-ships-re-assign-mariner-crews-amid-worsening-workforce-shortages/	2024-11-21T13:00:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/8524368-scaled-e1727186104760.jpg
ULA’s Vulcan may forfeit planned Space Force launches this year	ULA’s first Vulcan rocket lifts off from Space Launch Complex-41 at 2:18 a.m. EST on January 8, 2024. (United Launch Alliance photo) WASHINGTON — The United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan has two national security missions on its launch manifest this year, but given that the Space Force has yet to certify the heavy-lift rocket, it will likely be difficult to pull off either mission before 2025, a Space Force official said today. ULA launched its second certification flight in October, roughly a month behind schedule, following a first flight in January that was nearly four years behind schedule. The Space Force is still assessing data from the October launch in partnership with ULA to support the certification that will pave the way for the rocket to carry national security payloads. But even if that blessing comes swiftly, the calendar is unforgiving. With only six weeks left in the year, and other steps required like mounting payloads on the rocket, 'we are getting challenged to be able to launch this year,' Lt. Gen. Philip Garrant, head of the Space Force’s Space Systems Command, told reporters this morning during a breakfast hosted by the Defense Writers Group. And how much schedule margin is left for 2024? 'Probably not much,' he replied, though he deferred to ULA for specifics. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Amid dominance by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, the Pentagon has been eager to field more launch providers to help foster competition, drive down costs and provide redundant launch options. ULA has since been racing to certify Vulcan, particularly after retiring the Atlas V and Delta IV Heavy rockets from military service. Two well-executed launches are requisite to achieve certification for carrying national security payloads, meaning ULA could soon be given the go-ahead for Defense Department missions following the October launch. The January launch was deemed a success, but there was an anomaly during the October flight with one of Vulcan's solid rocket boosters that currently is under investigation. Nonetheless, Garrant noted, Vulcan was still able to achieve the criteria for certification by successfully continuing on its planned flight path. 'If they are not launching by the end of the year, we would delay those launches,' Garrant said of the two national security missions on Vulcan’s manifest. 'We are working with [ULA] to evaluate the data from their second flight, and they are making significant progress.' Garrant separately noted that the Space Force’s contract vehicle for launches, known as the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program, is currently in limbo due to the ongoing continuing resolution (CR), which appears likely to stretch into 2025. The service in June awarded the first contracts under the latest NSSL iteration, called Phase 3, to ULA, SpaceX and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin, for non-critical and/or lower altitude launches under the program's first 'lane.' Due to the CR, the next tranche of awards under NSSL Phase 3 — for must-succeed missions under the program's Lane 2 — will not move forward until the full fiscal year 2025 budget is passed, Garrant said. While ULA’s Vulcan has not been certified, Blue Origin’s New Glenn rocket has yet to even make its maiden flight — though that could occur this month. Still, Garrant indicated the Space Force expects the two companies will be able to compete against SpaceX for NSSL Phase 3, Lane 2 contracts. (SpaceX is currently the only certified launch provider for those missions.) 'We anticipate that they will be certified,' Garrant said of ULA and Blue Origin, though he added it’s 'probably too early to say how' the Space Force would divvy up contract awards between the three potential providers once the FY25 budget is passed.

Pentagon plans secure cloud pilot to defend small businesses from hackers	Two engineers working on laptop in a factory. (Getty stock image) WASHINGTON — Next year, the Pentagon’s Office of Small Business Programs (OSBP) will launch a pilot project to create creating a secure, cloud-based enclave for small contractors, who often struggle to meet DoD’s extensive cybersecurity requirements. 'We're building [a] secure cloud that we’ll offer as a platform and environment for all small business' that work with the Department of Defense, said Derrick Davis, director of industrial cybersecurity for SBP. While still very much a work-in-progress, the plan is to include a virtual desktop, secure communications and other tools for use by smaller firms, Davis told the GovExec Cybersecurity Futures Forum on Wednesday afternoon. The as-yet unnamed pilot will be run out of OSBP’s Project Spectrum. Created in the defense policy bill for 2019 [PDF], Spectrum provides online resources to educate contractors and a marketplace for government-vetted cybersecurity tools, but it hasn’t built such a comprehensive suite of services before. The plan is start small, initially recruiting firms that have prior experience working with DoD — 'all you in this room know that you need a doctorate degree just to navigate the defense contractor process,' Davis said wryly — but still need cybersecurity help. One model that SBP is looking at is the Army’s two-year, $26 million pilot project, NCODE, which is also creating a secure cloud to host small businesses. 'That's a great program that they have, we’ve reviewed it within our office, we're going to partner with those guys,' Davis told the GovExec conference. 'I’m headed to the Pentagon after this to actually speak with the Army CIO, Mr. [Leo] Garciga, about NCODE.' Driving both initiatives is the realization that while big prime contractors can build extensive in-house cybersecurity teams, small businesses generally lack the resources to hire cyber experts or even buy the latest security software. 'Especially just starting out, your laptop that you use to run your small business, it's also your [personal] laptop that you use to manage your family's finances,' Davis said. 'You may even help have your kid do their homework on your laptop.' But even tiny mom-and-pop shops working with the Defense Department can end up handling sensitive information or technology, or providing some obscure but critical component for a high-priority weapons system. So, besides the inevitable spammers and scammers that go after everyday internet users, small firms contracting with the Pentagon might be targeted by so-called 'Advanced Persistent Threats,' Davis warned: Nation-states using sophisticated techniques and technologies to suck up vast amounts of defense-related data and look for unlocked backdoors into sensitive networks. 'If we're going to force companies to get compliant with CMMC [Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification], we should also, on the flip side, offer assistance, and that's what we're trying to do,' Davis said. 'But … when we do something, everybody wants it to be perfect. The problem is, as you know, it takes time.' 'Have patience and grace with us,' he told the GovExec audience. 'We’re just trying to help.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-plans-secure-cloud-pilot-to-defend-small-businesses-from-hackers/	2024-11-21T11:20:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241121_stock_factory_computer_GettyImages-648822919-scaled-e1732202717985.jpg
Romania signs LOA to secure entry to F-35 club	Romania has ordered 32 F-35A fifth generation fighter jets, joining a host of other European nations (US Embassy in Romania) BELFAST — Romania has formally committed to the acquisition of 32 Lockheed Martin F-35A Lightning II fifth-generation fighter jets after signing a Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA) today. The procurement is valued at approximately $6.4 billion. Romania joins a wide base of European customers for the platform including Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland and the UK. Reacting to the inking of the LOA, Lockheed Martin said in a company statement, 'This decision marks a significant milestone in Romania's defense strategy and its commitment to maintaining a robust and advanced military force.' Lt. Gen Mike Schmidt, director and program executive officer of the F-35 Joint Program Office said in the statement, 'The integration of the F-35 Lightning II aircraft into the Romanian Air Force will significantly strengthen NATO's deterrence capabilities by providing unmatched strategic, operational, and tactical advantages.' He added, 'The F-35 Joint Program Office is dedicated to continuing a strong relationship with Romania, ensuring a successful transition and providing comprehensive support for their pilots and maintainers as we move forward together on this great effort.' US Ambassador to Romania Kathleen Kavalec told reporters at the LOA signing ceremony in Bucharest, 'We expect by 2030 these planes will be flying above Romania,' and that in the interim, the southeastern European country will continue to 'benefit' from its fleet of Lockheed Martin F-16 fourth-generation planes, while transition to the F-35 will be supported by a F-16 training center. The F-35 order 'will take Romania even a step forward, [beyond the F-16 protecting national borders] both on behalf of Romanian security, but also on behalf of the NATO Alliance,' she said. 'Because these planes will also be part of air policing, Romania participates in NATO wide air policing, air policing occurs here in Romania, it occurs in other parts of NATO territory, so this will allow Romania to keep up with the rest of the alliance and to have an even stronger security footprint.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/romania-signs-loa-to-secure-entry-to-f-35-club/	2024-11-21T10:25:23-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/53991823469_169e0d4a7c_k-e1732211600494.jpg
As adversaries attack, Pentagon’s zero trust office shifts focus to protecting ‘operational technology’	Chief of the Department of Defense Zero Trust Portfolio Management Office Randy Resnick (right), and DoD Senior Information Security Officer, David McKeown (left), hold an off-camera, on-the-record virtual press briefing on the release of the DoD Zero Trust Strategy and Roadmap at the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Nov. 22, 2022. DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders. 'For OT and weapon systems, we are coming out with initial zero trust guidance. Why? Because the adversary is attacking,' Randy Resnick, the director of the Zero Trust Office within the department’s Chief Information Office, told Breaking Defense Tuesday. 'The adversary wants to get into weapon systems to prevent their launch, or mess with the GPS coordinates, so the DoD is looking to initially secure these things beyond what they are today.' 'OT also has vulnerabilities that we are concerned about,' he said. Unlike IT that primarily deals with software and data, OT generally refers to systems and devices that control physical processes, like thermostats, water tanks and machinery on a factory floor. They're key components in critical infrastructure for civilians, but also in the sprawling defense ecosystem of facilities and systems. Defense critical infrastructure, meanwhile, is more related to weapons systems, Resnik said. Resnick said that language in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act mandated that the Pentagon focus on zero trust for IT, OT and DCI. As a result, Resnick’s office stood up the plan to transition to a zero-trust cybersecurity framework by the end of fiscal year 2027, which plans to have zero trust fully implemented into IT by that time. Given adversarial threats and the department’s progress in implementing zero trust into IT, Resnick said the next step is to create guidance for implementing zero trust in OT and then eventually DCI. 'At the end of [2027] we're going to have a number of successes that achieve [our 2027] target, if not [advancing it],' he said of the IT zero trust strategy during the panel. 'We are going to be coming out with guidance for OT, and that'll probably come out at the end of summer [2025] and we'll have a date beyond 2027 where we start establishing ZT [zero trust] into OT. 'Then, of course, we're also concerned about defense critical infrastructure, so that's another thing,' he added. If adversaries are able to hack into the DoD’s OT like machinery in factories, it could lead to catastrophic results, Resnick warned. 'The DoD leases and owns factories, the communication between every single piece of equipment is not IT. So it's OT, okay, the whole factory runs on OT,' he told Breaking Defense. 'If they coordinated across 10 to 15 things simultaneously, it means a tremendous amount.' 'It could shut the factory down for a period of time until they’ve recovered. DoD could be put out for a month. I hope not, but that's the worst case scenario. It's a point of vulnerability, it's a point of attack. The whole point of zero trust is to prevent these attacks in a modern day sense,' he added. Resnick explained that vulnerabilities in OT can lead to threat actors hacking into IT as well because OT is often connected to IT or the internet because that’s how the OT systems communicate with each other — think the Internet of Things. 'This creates a back door to get to IT, so I could break into OT, and it's called ‘swim upstream.’ I want to prevent that,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/as-adversaries-attack-pentagons-zero-trust-office-shifts-focus-to-protecting-operational-technology/	2024-11-21T07:50:20-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/02/Chief-scaled-e1686258310375.jpg
Israel likely partner for Greece as it looks for integrated air defense systems	The Army has two Iron Dome batteries and is fielding both at JBLM. (David Huskey/DVIDS) JERUSALEM — Greece is kicking the tires on Israeli-made air defense systems, as the NATO nation seeks to build a multi-layered air defense system capable of countering both enemy jets and low-level drones, sources confirm to Breaking Defense. News of Greece’s interest was first reported by Reuters, with the Greek daily Ekathimerini reporting that the multi-layered systems could surpass $2 billion in cost. 'The defenses would likely mimic Israel’s Iron Dome and other systems that intercept short- and long-range missiles launched during strikes from its neighbors amid the ongoing conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon,' per Ekathimerini. A pair of sources told Breaking Defense that Greece is in the fact-finding process of what systems Israeli might be willing to sell, and while it appears Athens plans to cast a wide net as it looks for options, the two are a clear match: Israel, which has grown closer to Greece in recent years, already possesses a multi-layered air defense system, all parts of which are in varying states of being sold or used by other countries. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems makes the short-range Iron Dome system, used primarily against rockets and small drones; that system is soon to incorporate laser air defenses as well. Rafael also makes the medium-range system David’s Sling, which was jointly developed with the US and has been sold to Finland, as well as the Spyder, which can defend against aircraft and other threats. IAI makes Arrow, an exoatmospheric defense system jointly developed with the US which has been sold to Germany, as well as the Barak air defense system. IAI's Elta also makes the air defense radars used with Iron Dome, radars that have been sold to Czech Republic and Slovakia. The initial Reuters report came after a closed door briefing in Israel with Greek Defense Minister Nikos Dendias, who has emerged as a key figure in advancing Israel’s closer ties with Athens. A former foreign minister for Greece, Dendias visited Israel in August 2023 and met with then-Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. 'We discussed the important achievements of our Strategic Defence Relationship and expressed our wish to further broaden it,' he wrote on social media. He highlighted the joint exercises between Israel and Greece and also said that Athens and Jerusalem had 'agreed to enhance our mutually beneficial cooperation in the area of defence research and technology with the involvement of the defence industry, research institutions, and other innovation bodies.' The Israel-Greece ties are part of a growing context of emerging partnerships in the eastern Mediterranean that also include Cyprus. This trilateral relationship is the background in which Athens’ interest in a multi-layered defense system have emerged, noted Eran Lerman, a former Israeli deputy national security advisor and now vice-president of the Jerusalem Institute for Strategy and Security. He said he uses the term 'alignment' for these ties, as opposed to 'alliance,' because there aren’t agreements on the horizon involving mutual defense. 'It’s enough to generate intelligence cooperation, military training — this is essentially a triangular relationship because the Cypriots are part of this story,' Lerman said, citing two key ways the relationship with Cyprus is benefitting Israel. The first is training in Cyprus for units such as Israeli commandos, which helps them familiarize with long-range operations in terrain similar to Lebanon. The second development is that Cyprus can be a logistical backstop if there are interruptions in trade with Israel — for instance, when flights were cancelled due to the recent war with Hamas and Hezbollah, airlines would fly to Cyprus and then Israeli jets would take them the rest of the way. 'That’s not a trivial matter when we faced the possibility of serious limitation on flights to Israel,' Lerman added. The burgeoning ties also have roots in joint drills with Greece, where Lerman says there has been 'close cooperation, particularly with the air forces.' Israel has participated in the annual multi-national air exercise called Iniochos in Greece and the Greeks have participated in Blue Flag, a semi-annual air force drill in Israel. In addition, Israel is deliver M-346 training aircraft to Greece as part of a government-to-government deal, and Israel’s Elbit Systems is creating a flight training center in Greece.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/israel-likely-partner-for-greece-as-it-looks-for-integrated-air-defense-systems/	2024-11-21T06:29:14-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/6798386-scaled-e1659458065341.jpg
Anduril could receive up to $100M for Space Surveillance Network upgrade	A sunset view of Maui Space Surveillance System on Mount Haleakala, above the clouds at 10,000 feet. (US Air Force photo/Tech. Sgt. Bennie J. Davis III) WASHINGTON — The Space Force has awarded artificial intelligence startup Anduril a contract worth up to almost $100 million to create a modern, machine-to-machine communications network to link sensors for monitoring the heavens to command and control (C2) systems and data analysts, the company announced today. The indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity contract, managed by Space Force Space Systems Command, covers a five-year program to deliver its Lattice software to US Space Command (SPACECOM) 'as a resilient mesh networking capability' to modernize the Space Surveillance Network (SSN), Anduril's press release said. 'The U.S. Space Command has mandated full deployment by the end of 2026,' the release added. The SSN is composed of primarily ground-based radars and telescopes that detect and track objects in space, ranging from active satellites to debris such as jettisoned rocket bodies and pieces from satellite breakups. That observational data is downlinked to SPACECOM computer systems for use by analysts who are charged with characterizing whether those objects present threats to US and allied space systems — as well as figuring out whether any are on a course to potentially collide with other space objects, especially any operational satellites. Anduril's mesh network, called the Space Domain Awareness Network (SDANet), includes hardware that will be deployed at every SSN sensor type over the next two years, a company official told Breaking Defense. That hardware will use the Lattice open software platform, which can bring in data from any type of sensor, then employ machine learning to process that information and fuze it, and finally distribute the results. SDANet will replace SPACECOM's Space Defense Interface Network, which is 'a 40-year-old system of point-to-point network connections leveraging serial lines coupled with aging infrastructure' used by SSN sensors, the company official said. That legacy network 'can only move data at speeds of roughly one-tenth of old dial up internet (i.e., ~4,800 Baud),' the official explained, and doesn't have any way to automatically reroute data if any part of the network goes down. SDANet thus will 'increase the level of connectivity between sensors, command and control systems, and data platforms to drastically decrease communications/messaging latency, increase availability/resiliency, and enable new concepts of operations essential to space warfighting operations currently not possible with legacy communications systems,' Anduril's press release said. Specifically, the company official said, the new network will be 'transporting and translating data' from SSN telescopes and radars to the C2 systems at Space Force Delta 2's 18th Space Defense Squadron at Vandenberg SFB, Calif. and 19th Space Defense Squadron at the Naval Support Facility Dahlgren, Va. The 18th Space Defense Squadron is the primary space domain awareness unit for SPACECOM, and is charged with C2 of the SSN sensors and managing the command's computerized database of space objects, according to a Space Force fact sheet. It also is responsible for sharing space tracking data with Defense Department, interagency, commercial, international and academic users. The 19th Space Defense Squadron provides tasking orders to the SSN sensors 'to maintain up-to-date orbital parameters for over 40,000 man-made Earth-orbiting objects,' according to a Space Force fact sheet. In particular, its role includes 'expanding cislunar and extra-geosynchronous awareness via current SSN and commercial capabilities' and contributing to 'space-based environmental monitoring missions.' Anduril's network already is operational at a subset of the SSN sites in Maui, Hawaii, via an experimental program with Space Systems Command first initiated in November 2022. Under that program, the Anduril official explained, the SDANet is feeding data to the Non-traditional Data Pre-Processor system built by L3Harris — essentially one of a series of software patches that have been developed over two-plus decades of unsuccessful efforts to overhaul the aging computer processing, data analysis and C2 systems used by SPACECOM to manage space domain awareness operations, and enable integration of new sensors and observational data. Specifically, the official said, the Non-traditional Data Pre-Processor feeds Anduril's SDANet data to SPACECOM's 1980s-era Space Defense Operations Center (SPADOC) computer system and software. SPADOC links directly with legacy SSN sensors, pulls it down, and processes it. That pre-processor also will be used to feed data into SPADOC's replacement system, called ATLAS (Advanced Tracking and Launch Analysis System) also being developed by L3Harris. ATLAS, however, is facing it own developmental problems. SDANet further will enable connections to 'various mission partners that currently rely on this data for intelligence and analysis mission sets,' the Anduril official said. The Defense Department and the services began experimenting with Anduril's AI-powered Lattice platform as long ago as 2020, including for counter-drone operations — winning a $1 billion contract from US Special Operations Command in 2022 — and as an enabler of its ambitious Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) concept. Further, Anduril has ambitious plans for its own constellation of space monitoring satellites, to be launched by 2025, based on Lattice.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/anduril-could-receive-up-to-100m-for-space-surveillance-network-upgrade/	2024-11-21T05:00:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Maui-Space-Surveillance-site-e1732138371199.jpeg
Norway puts France, Germany, UK and US in the frame for future frigate partnership	Norway is looking to replace aging Fridtjof Nansen-class frigates through a 'strategic' partnership with one of four newly shortlisted nations (Norwegian government) BELFAST — Norway has officially shortlisted four countries it will consider as options to support a future frigate 'strategic' partnership. France, Germany, the UK and the US are set to receive invitations to begin discussions on the matter, said the Norwegian Ministry of Defence in a Wednesday statement. Although Norway's statement does not say what designs are up for discussion, it is expected that the options will cover France's Defense and Intervention Frigate (FDI), Germany's F126, the UK Type 26/City-Class and/or Type 31, and the US Constellation-class. 'The new frigates represent the largest acquisition planned for the Norwegian Armed Forces in the coming years,' Bjørn Arild Gram, Norway’s Minister of Defence, is quoted as saying. 'Norway is an important maritime nation in NATO, and through this and other maritime investments we will be strengthening both national and allied security.' A strategic partner for the effort is due to be picked in 2025. Between five and six new frigates could be ordered to meet a requirement set out in Norway’s long term defense plan. The future ships will also be capable of embarking anti-submarine helicopters. Additionally, the proposed partnership will cover 'joint acquisition, operation, maintenance, continuous development and upgrades of the new frigates throughout their service life,' per the MoD statement. Oslo is focused on joining an active production frigate program in order to minimize the need for Fridtjof Nansen-class upgrades. 'Solid and predictable cooperation on both security and defence policy will be at the heart of the strategic partnership that we envision, which will include everything from force generation to operations and joint development of new capabilities,' said Arild Gram. 'It is therefore essential that we and our partners have the same long-term interests.' The frigate partnership push comes on the heels of Gen. Eirik Kristoffersen, Norway's Chief of Defense, telling Breaking Defense in April that, 'we need to' work in 'close cooperation with one ally. We need the same frigate as another ally. We cannot be the one user of a system, we are too small for that.' Such an outlook also mirrors Norway's favored approach to submarine investment, where it has opted for a joint procurement with Germany of Thyssenkrupp-made 212CD class vessels. A first Norwegian sub, of four on order, underwent construction at the shipbuilder's Kiel yard in September last year.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/norway-puts-france-germany-uk-and-us-in-the-frame-for-future-frigate-partnership/	2024-11-20T13:53:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/knm-fritjof-nansen-foto-johan-ludvig-holst-scaled-e1732136926280.jpg
Army picks Red Cat’s small quadcopter for 2nd Short-Range Reconnaissance tranche	A soldier flies a Red Cat quadcopter in this image from the company. (Red Cat) WASHINGTON — The US Army announced it has picked systems made by Red Cat subsidiary Teal Drones for the service’s Short-Range Reconnaissance (SRR) program of record. After the company preempted the service announcement on Tuesday, the Army confirmed today that it had selected Red Cat’s quadcopter for SRR but noted that 'exact funding, quantities, and other details' will be hammered out throughout the rest of the year as the duo work though the contract details. 'The selection was made based on a combination of criteria that included soldier feedback, performance, and reliability during the SRR tranche 2 prototyping effort,' an Army spokesman said in a brief statement. The Army spokesman did not disclose if Red Cat’s small Teal drone would be the only drone selected for this second tranche but noted that the program office is focused on fostering competition among companies and will be continually assessing new technologies for future tranches. 'The long-awaited production selection marks a new era for our company and the future of American drones,' George Matus, Red Cat’s chief technology officer, said in an announcement on Wednesday. 'Our top priority now is to start ramping production of the next generation system, recently announced as the Black Widow and WEB, and give warfighters the tools they need to be successful on the modern battlefield,' he later added. Skydio’s RQ-28A quadcopter was picked as the first tranche of the SRR program and was first delivered to soldiers in 2022, one of which noted at the time that the man-portable drones were so new that the service didn’t have tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) for using them in operations. The service is moving out on plans to acquire and field a host of new aerial drones to provide soldiers at every echelon with a system. That plan includes:	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-picks-red-cats-small-quadcopter-for-2nd-short-range-reconnaissance-tranche/	2024-11-20T13:01:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241120_red_cat_drone_HANDOUT-e1732136676896.jpg
AUKUS will ‘cannibalize’ other programs with no budget boost: Former top Aussie general	Sir Angus Houston (L) delivers the Defence Strategic Review 2023 to Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Deputy PM and Minister of Defence Richard Marles at Parliament House on February 14, 2023 in Canberra, Australia. (Photo by Martin Ollman/Getty Images) SYDNEY — Sounding the alarm that the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal will eat into non-naval priorities, the former head of the Australian Defense Force today called for a significant boost in defense spending, up to 3 percent of GDP. Sir Angus Houston was Australia's top military officer from 2005-2011 and was tapped to co-lead the recent Defense Strategic Review, making him a key, respected voice on matters of defense. While the DSR TKTKT, his comments today reflect what he sees as changed situation. The review and its Integrated Investment Plan projected a $55.5 billion AUD budget for 2024-25, rising to $67.9 billion in 2027-28 — roughly 2.2 percent of GDP. Part of that is simply acknowledging that the world is much more dangerous than when the review was completed in early 2023. When the strategy was published Houston made headlines with his claims that Australia faced the most dire strategic situation since World War II, and the situation has only expanded, with the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, the back and forth between several actors in the Middle East, a modernized and aggressive China and the increasingly close ties between North Korea, China, Russia and Iran. But in comments at the US Studies Centre here, Houston made clear he wasn't just talking about spending more because of the threats. He made an important structural point, that Australia must increase its defense spending so that buying and building nuclear powered attack submarines — the AUKUS program with the US and UK — does not consume too much of the defense budget. Houston said the AUKUS boats 'must be a net addition to Australia's military capability. The only way they can be a net addition to Australian military capability is to increase our defense spending by 3 percent plus of GDP as we move into and through the 2030s.' If that does not happen, it will mean the military can only buy the subs 'through the cannibalization of other military capability. So that is the challenge for us. And I don't think either side of the body politic in Australia has really come to terms with that.' The question of whether AUKUS will eat up other programs for the Australian defense community has been an open one ever since the project, the most expensive endeavor in the country's history, was launched. Officials have largely towed the line that the Lucky Country can do everything. For instance, Richard Vagg, the service’s head of Land Capability, told Breaking Defense in October that he was not concerned about losing out to AUKUS, noting 'we’ve made some very, very considered decisions about our investment plans from a ADF perspective, and are quite comfortable where we’re sitting in terms of our land projects.' However, there may be signs of budget pressure emerging already. Earlier this month, Australia killed a $5.3 billion AUD satellite contract with Lockheed Martin, with one analyst saying more cuts will likely have to happen as the true cost of AUKUS emerges. The current government in Canberra has pledged to increase defense spending by $50.3 billion over the next decade, with the plan being to hit $100 billion by 2033. That would put the country at 2.4 percent — well below what Houston believes is needed. Earlier in the conference, US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, who won't have a government job after Jan. 20, urged the incoming Trump administration to work closely with Australia and New Zealand to counter a 'relentless' China and not to turn inward. 'China is relentless. They want to build bases. They want to extend their power there. We are going to have to do more, and do more with Australia and New Zealand,' he told the conference on a feed from Washington. 'This is a time right now to be innovative, to be optimistic, to work, to make the argument about why common purpose is in our best interests, and why the United States should not withdraw from the world, from partnerships, to work more closely than ever with Indo-Pacific partners. Nowhere is that more important than Australia.' RELATED: AUKUS faces little threat from Trump, Aussie officials say Campbell made a direct appeal to the presumptive Secretary of State in the Trump administration, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida. Trump has talked about large cuts to the State Department and other parts of the US foreign policy structure and his public rhetoric is about America First, which could mean ignoring or withdrawing from engagement in the Indo-Pacific. 'My hope is that Senator Rubio, the Trump administration, will recognize that this is a moment of acute strategic competition,' the deputy said. A range of speakers from Japan, the United States and Australia said at the conference they thought the Trump White House would support AUKUS, citing the incoming president's penchant for transactional diplomacy. Australia is spending billions to buy and build nuclear-powered attack boats, is helping the US expand its industrial base and Trump is likely to recognize that, they said. Unlike some NATO countries, which Trump has criticized for spending too little, Australia has committed more than $6 billion USD to expanding the tripartite sub industrial base and plans to spend a total of $368 billion on Virginia- and SSN AUKUS-class subs.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/former-top-aussie-general-warns-aukus-will-cannibalize-other-programs-with-no-defense-boost/	2024-11-20T12:47:00-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/angus-houston-scaled-e1732110317443.jpg
Turkey joins drone-carrier operations club with first takeoff and landing from Turkish ship	Bayraktar TB3 prepares to take off from Turkish ship TCG Anadolu. (Photo credit: Baykar) BEIRUT — Turkish firm Baykar's unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV) Bayraktar TB3 performed its first successful flight test to take off and land on the Turkish ship TCG Anadolu, a short runway vessel, the firm said Tuesday in a statement. 'The flight, conducted at the convergence of the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, lasted for 46 minutes before the aircraft successfully landed back on the same short runway, without the need for any landing support equipment,' Baykar said in the statement. Bayraktar TB3 performed the test on Nov. 19 after completing open-sea shipboard trials. The drone had completed its maiden flight from land in October 2023, and Tuesday it became the first Turkish UAV to be deployed from the drone carrier TCG Anadolu. The vessel is expected to also host Bayraktar TB3 and Kizilelma drones. Bayraktar TB3 PT1 and PT2 UCAVs underwent flight trainings from the company’s Flight Training and Test Center in Edirne to Dalaman Air Base Command. Bayraktar TB3 PT1 was deployed in flights during day and night on TCG Anadolu and 'successfully complet[ed] Approach Tests without any issues,' according to the statement. Though the company hailed the takeoff and landing as a world first from a short-runway ship, other drones have executed flights from maritime vessels before, including US drone-maker General Atomics's Mojave, which conducted a short takeoff and landing from the UK Royal Navy's HMS Prince of Wales a year ago this month. Bakyar did not respond to a request for additional comment by press time. Either way, the demonstration shows the continued interest of the world's navies in carrier-drone operations. Beyond the Mojave tests, the US Navy is pushing ahead with carrier-based drone control rooms. In May reports emerged that China may have constructed a relatively small carrier specifically designed for drone operations.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/turkey-joins-drone-carrier-operations-club-with-first-takeoff-and-landing-from-turkish-ship/	2024-11-20T11:45:53-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Bayraktar_TB3_TCG_Anadolu_Take_off_and_Land_on-8-scaled-e1732123005228.jpg
INDOPACOM’s Paparo acknowledges stockpile shortages may impact his readiness	Adm. Samuel Paparo receives a tour of the ballistic missile submarine USS Henry M. Jackson (SSBN 730) during a tour of Naval Base Kitsap (NBK)-Bangor, Wash. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Brian G. Reynolds) WASHINGTON — As the American weapons packages for Ukraine and Israel have started to include increasingly more complicated systems, the commander of US Indo-Pacific Command conceded finite munitions stockpiles could mean American assistance heading elsewhere around the world will impact the readiness of his own forces. 'Up to this year, where most of the employment of weapons were really artillery pieces and short-ranged weapons, I had said not at all,' Adm. Samuel Paparo told an audience at the Brookings Institute yesterday when asked about the issue. 'But now, with some of the Patriots that have been employed, some of the air-to-air missiles that have been employed, it’s now eating into stocks … and to say otherwise would be dishonest,' he continued. As commander of US Indo-Pacific Command, Paparo is the most senior American military officer who is tasked on a daily basis with managing aggression from China as well as aiding in diplomatic efforts with other key US allies and partners in the region. He went on to say that the United States’s stockpiles are 'fungible' across all the possible military theaters they may be used in. Additionally he said his area of responsibility, however important it may be given the Pentagon’s rhetoric, has nothing 'reserved.' RELATED: &#8216;Up our game': The Pentagon's 3 strategies to shore up munitions stockpiles 'Inherently, it imposes costs on the readiness of America to respond in the Indo-Pacific region, which is the most stressing theater for the quantity and quality of munitions, because [China] is the most capable potential adversary in the world,' he said. When asked if he agrees with Paparo's assessment, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said today he had not seen the admiral's comments but 'every time we do a presidential drawdown, we take things that we have in our stocks, provide them to the country in need, and there's been a significant need, and then we replace those items with new items and better items. And those munitions and those weapons are built in the United States of America.' 'That creates jobs,' he continued. 'It puts us in a better position militarily &#8230; but it takes a little time and we recognize that. So we work with industry to expand capacity in our industrial base and that's happening. In many cases industry has is rising to meet the demand, meet the challenge, and we're going to continue to do that.' The admission, though reserved, is significant coming from someone as senior as Paparo. The notion that America’s aid to Ukraine in its fight against Russia is hampering the country’s ability to respond to China and potentially assist Taiwan has gained an audience in certain sectors of the GOP. Those criticisms intensified last October as it became clear the US would also divert some of its munitions — as well as key assets like capital warships — to the Middle East to help defend Israel. When called to testify in front of lawmakers, senior military officials from across the services have acknowledged the packages to Ukraine and Israel have made a noticeable dent in the stockpiles held for US forces. But at a policy level, the Biden administration has made assisting Ukraine a top priority and staved off suggestions that the US must choose between helping Ukraine or preparing to counter China. That could soon change. Some of Trump’s allies in the GOP have been the most vocal in their criticisms against continuing to send weapons to Ukraine, and with Republicans controlling both the White House and the two chambers of Congress, continued support to Ukraine is anything but assured. When pressed about whether Taiwan should be 'concerned' about US stockpiles and the effect multiple global conflicts are having on them, Paparo said, 'When you say concerned — should it keep them up at night? 'We should replenish those stocks,' he continued. 'I was already dissatisfied with the magazine depth. I’m a little more dissatisfied with the magazine depth.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/indopacoms-paparo-acknowledges-stockpile-shortages-may-impact-his-readiness/	2024-11-20T11:08:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240214_DVIDS_paparo_sub_7263379-scaled-e1707925090340.jpg
Nets, jamming and ‘cyber scalpels’: Pentagon weighs homeland counter-drone tech in mountain tests	Fortem's DroneHunter floats to the ground as a captured sUAS hangs in a net underneath. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) FORT CARSON, Colo. — Hovering hundreds of yards away, the small quadcopter drone was nearly invisible to the naked eye, but its size didn’t make it any less of a potential threat to operations on the ground here. Spotted by sensors, defending personnel dispatched their own drone — this one armed with a net. A few minutes later, in the Colorado air, the friendly drone snagged the interloper, popped a parachute and both floated harmlessly to the ground. The incident, this time, was not a real threat but a demonstration, part of a series put on by US Northern Command (NORTHCOM) to explore ways to counter small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS), an increasingly ubiquitous presence not only on the battlefields of Ukraine and the Middle East but lurking around American bases back home. The Pentagon has documented hundreds of suspected drone incursions at military facilities in the last few years, even if many are thought to be the work of hobbyists. Nets were just one tactic on display during this two-week exercise in October called Falcon Peak, which was limited to non- and low-kinetic mitigation techniques to stop small unmanned aircraft systems, or sUAS. On this Army base here, defense industry firms brought kit tailored to defeat the drones in scenarios where military officials emphasize their options are limited by regulations that protect civilian travel, largely preventing them from using many commonly available but more aggressive kinetic and non-kinetic tools. 'By all indications, sUAS will present a safety and security risk to military installations and other critical infrastructure for the foreseeable future. Mitigating those risks requires a dedicated effort across all federal departments and agencies, state, local, tribal and territorial communities, and Congress to further develop the capabilities, coordination and legal authorities necessary for detecting, tracking and addressing potential sUAS threats in the homeland,' said NORTHCOM chief Gen. Gregory Guillot. According to a handout from NORTHCOM, representatives at Falcon Peak from industry included Leidos, Teledyne FLIR, Trakka Systems, D-Fend solutions, HGH USA, Fortem Technologies, and ICR. A handful of fielded DoD systems were also brought along. According to a spokesperson for NORTHCOM, 'Every participant' in the exercise, whether industry or DoD, 'had to detect, track [and] identify sUAS.' Only 'some' participants 'had the additional ability to mitigate/interdict' a drone threat. The vendors set up along a strip of road here near the foothills of Cheyenne Mountain, in an area of Fort Carson called Agony Hill, displaying their systems in demos throughout the Falcon Peak event. During the actual trials, the counter-drone systems were set up along a simulated perimeter of a base and were tasked with tracking and in some cases taking out adversary systems flown by a 'red' team, however they could. In countering drone incursions, the first step is knowing that it’s happening at all, and that’s where cutting-edge sensing technology, calibrated to spot small drones, comes in. 'I'm pretty confident in our ability to detect and track' mid-size and large drones, Guillot said in a roundtable with reporters ahead of the visit to Fort Carson. 'The purpose of this demonstration is to improve our ability to detect and track' small UAS, he added. For Falcon Peak, Teledyne FLIR brought along its Cerberus XL system, dragged straight from its debut at the AUSA expo in Washington. The Cerberus XL fuses radar, electro-optical/infrared and radio frequency (RF) sensors to detect and track drones, according to a press release from the company. That data can then be fed to different third-party effectors to defeat the drones — in the case of another demonstration, connecting to jammers aimed at taking down offending drones’ datalinks and denying them access to global navigation systems, according to the handout from NORTHCOM. (Breaking Defense did not view it in action.) Steve Pedrotty, Teledyne FLIR’s director of US Air Force programs, said in an interview on the sidelines of Falcon Peak that the event was a great opportunity, though he hoped to see the government firm up requirements. 'It's still kind of early in this cycle' of rapidly changing drone and counter-drone technologies, Pedrotty said. 'So honing in on the requirements would help.' Falcon Peak wasn’t just an opportunity for industry to see if their tech was up to snuff; the event was also a chance for existing DoD systems to make improvements. According to NORTHCOM’s handout, the SUADS — an apparent reference to the small uncrewed aircraft defense system — was among those in attendance, which the handout says uses electro-optical/infrared sensors to sense drones. 'Before you can shoot something, you have to see it,' Jason Mayes, counter-small unmanned aerial systems deputy test director for NORTHCOM, told reporters. 'So that's why we want to present profiles that those systems have never seen before, and see if we could, from a detection standpoint, beat those systems so that now the services understand you do really good up to this point, but they're not there yet,' he continued. 'So even on that side of the house, they have some homework to go do.' A small drone flies over a bus for distinguished visitors at Falcon Peak. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) Once the drone is spotted, there are myriad ways to try and take it down — even before getting into options like shooting the things out of the sky, which current policy mostly prohibits on US soil. On the non-kinetic side, there’s cyber and electronic warfare: either hacking the drone to disable it or take it over, or jamming or spoofing its communications or navigation signals to render it 'lost' mid-operation. (Tactics like navigation disruption had to be closely coordinated with the Federal Aviation Administration at Falcon Peak, as any disruption to civilian travel could spell danger to the general public.) One example outlined at Falcon Peak was ICR’s 'system of systems' called TMX and a specific cyber tool crafted by the company called Bullet. According to Mike Powell, executive director of counter-UAS at the company, Bullet works like a 'cyber scalpel RF system' that exploits the downlink of an adversary device to take it over. 'There's no footprint. You're not going to see it. It is a tiny signal that is only pointed at one drone at a time,' he said. 'We can do drones every second. So in 30 seconds, I can control a small swarm of drones with this system' and force them to land at a designated area, return to where they were launched from or force them straight down to earth by turning off rotors. (The Bullet tech was not demonstrated during Breaking Defense’s visit.) Even then, Powell acknowledged challenges to Bullet’s tactics in light of ever-evolving drone tech. For example, as intense signal interference has dominated the war in Ukraine, drones belonging to both sides have often had trouble reaching their targets. And now, newer systems are on the rise that can offer more resistance to interference, like drones that follow onboard maps rather than GPS to find their targets. That approach, in turn, makes hijacking drones electronically that much harder, if not impossible. A good radar is needed to sense those threats especially because they don’t emit detectable transmissions, Powell stressed, and a different effector is required to take the drone down. 'There's no RF signature. There's nothing to break into,' Powell said. 'That's the hardest problem.' Breaking Defense did not witness any electronic warfare or cyber techniques at the Falcon Peak demo, and a spokesperson for NORTHCOM said although the tactics were used over the course of the event, the 'specific number, type, and system is classified.' In the low-kinetic realm, there was Fortem Technologies’s DroneHunter, the one armed with a net referenced at the start of this report. In that demo witnessed by Breaking Defense and other media outlets, the system appeared to successfully demonstrate a non-intrusive, low-collateral way to bring down an sUAS threat with little threat to anyone else in the area. Spencer Prows, executive vice president of solutions engineering at Fortem, explained that the DroneHunter can integrate with other systems or work standalone with the company’s equipment, boasting a towing capacity of about five kilograms. If the intercepted airframe is small enough, DroneHunter can drag its captured quarry back to base, or, as Breaking Defense witnessed, simply bring it straight down to the ground with a parachute if it’s too heavy. Leidos’s AirShield also played a part in the demo, featuring a spindle-shaped drone effector called the Co-axial Unmanned Guided Autonomous Rotorcraft (CUGAR). It’s designed to take down sUAS by blanketing them with streamers, like ones you’d see at a gender reveal party. But the streamers were never launched in the demo Breaking Defense viewed, as Mayes, the event’s emcee, explained that a target drone was down for maintenance. Sometimes, it’s the enemy’s equipment that fails. Capabilities like net capture and streamers do hold promise for defeating sUAS along the lines of hobbyist systems, said Mayes. But the technology is challenged by faster and more agile drones like first-person view (FPV) systems gaining traction in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 'They do very, very good with that, because the profiles are fairly steady,' Mayes said of their ability to deal with slower, hobbyist-type drones. 'Once you start getting into some of the faster [UAS], like your FPV drones, these racing ones that are 150 to 200 miles an hour, or drones that have been outfitted to be very agile, the systems themselves are not able to keep up with that because of the agility of the other [drones].' Leidos's CUGAR effector hovers above attendees at Falcon Peak. (Michael Marrow/Breaking Defense) The military is pondering whether its options for taking out drones could expand with the right guardrails — potentially featuring weapons like lasers and microwaves — as it pushes for policy changes that can better accommodate the need to fight off small drones on American soil, a key intergovernmental effort that will be the subject of a future Breaking Defense report. But at the end of the day, beyond all the complexities of new tech, the counter-UAS problem broadly is a cultural one too. Branches like the Marine Corps have declared plans to equip every squad with the capability to defend themselves against UAS, for example, and any new tactics or technologies will require doctrinal changes — as well as buy-in from troops doing the work. 'It takes time to change doctrine and tactics and techniques and procedures. It takes time for culture and the climate to change,' Command Sgt. Maj. Demetrius Johnson, senior enlisted advisor to the Pentagon’s Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, told reporters when asked what the timeline for a new counter-drone culture might look like. 'It's still a relatively new threat. And the threat is evolving. Every time the threat evolves, we have to go back to the drawing board and change doctrine and change tactics,' he said. 'So it's going to be ongoing, and I can't see where there's an end anywhere in sight.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/nets-jamming-and-cyber-scalpels-pentagon-weighs-homeland-counter-drone-tech-in-mountain-tests/	2024-11-20T10:52:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/fortem-net-capture-scaled-e1732126428452.jpg
UK makes sweeping defense cuts, doing away with several warships, scores of helicopters and drones	The UK has announced it will scrap a fleet of British Army Watchkeeper drones BELFAST — In a surprise announcement, the UK has said it will scrap five warships, 31 helicopters and a fleet of 46 intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance (ISTAR) drones. The move, announced in parliament today by UK Secretary of State for Defence John Healey, will generate savings of £500 million ($632 million) over the next five years, he said, and get rid of 'outdated capabilities.' But it also drew immediate criticism from opposition party lawmakers. The cuts are 'all backed' by service chiefs and were made in consultation with personnel involved in the UK's strategic defense review — set to release results of equipment planning and strategic thinking in mid-2025. 'Allies have been informed and we have constant dialogue with NATO,' added Healey. On the naval side, two amphibious assault ships, HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, will be withdrawn from service at the end of the year. Healey suggested the vessels had been 'effectively retired by previous ministers, but superficially kept on the books,' at a cost of £9 million a year. The Type 23 frigate HMS Northumberland will be axed because of 'structural damage that makes her simply uneconomical to repair,' he noted, alongside two Wave-Class tankers, 'neither of which has been to sea for years.' Elsewhere, the British Army’s Watchkeeper drone fleet will be retired, a fate that follows years of delays, cost overruns and a series of test and operational crashes. As of September 2022, the UK had spent £1.31 billion on the program, according to a lawmaker statement. Watchkeeper initially entered service in 2014, supporting Afghanistan force protection efforts, but has not been involved in military operations since. The aircraft was deployed in 2020 over the English channel in a surveillance capacity to monitor migrant boats. A total of 14 CH-47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters, including 'some' that have been in service for 35 years, will be retired, in parallel with 17 Puma multirole rotorcraft. The Pumas had been due to be replaced under the £1 billion New Medium Helicopter acquisition, but that plan was thrown into disarray in August after Lockheed Martin and Airbus walked away without submitting bids for the NMH, leaving Leonardo as the last competitor standing. Prior to Healey's Puma declaration, London's strategic defense review, set for release in mid-2025, was expected to determine if NMH moved ahead or not. The phasing out of older Chinooks is a different matter because they are set to be replaced with new H-47ER (Extended Range) platforms beginning in 2027. 'The UK is the only nation to be provided access to this class-leading heavy-lift helicopter capability outside of the US,' said Grant Shapps, former UK defence secretary, in March. Healey revealed that in all the new cuts 'are set to save the MoD £150 million over the next two years, and up to £500 million over five years, savings that will be retained in full in defense.' Reacting to the changes, Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense think tank, said in a statement, 'These are mostly capabilities that are approaching retirement anyway, have been at low levels of readiness or aren’t worth further refits or investment (Watchkeeper is probably obsolete).' 'But the fact that Defence either can’t crew them, or is prepared to cut them to make very modest savings over five years in the current international environment is an indication of just how tight resources must be in the MOD right now,' he added. 'In particular, the Defence Review will be under pressure to set out the future role of the Royal Marines; how the Navy will bring into service and sustain more escorts, which are the workhorses of the fleet; and the impact upon helicopter capacity and procurement.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/uk-makes-sweeping-defense-cuts-doing-away-with-several-warships-scores-of-helicopters-and-drones/	2024-11-20T09:14:48-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/APOLOND-OFFICIAL-20221017-114-013.jpg.iCfFhcbqMWATAA.EhYLNwi3LY-e1732120552526.jpg
DIU picks 7 companies to support Replicator autonomy, C2 efforts	AeroVironment’s Switchblade 600 bares its teeth at Sea Air Space. The loitering munition has gotten real-world practice during the Ukraine conflict, as a number of the weapons have been sent from the US to Kyiv. (Aaron Mehta/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — The Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) has inked deals with seven software developers and tasked them with moving out with autonomy and command and control work, aimed at propelling the Replicator initiative forward. 'Many leading AI [artificial intelligence] and autonomy firms are outside of our traditional defense industrial base, and DIU is working actively with partners across the department to bring the very best capabilities from the US tech sector to bear in support of our most critical warfighter needs,' DIU Director Doug Beck said in today’s announcement. 'This latest step in the Replicator initiative is a critical example of that teamwork in action.' While DIU did not disclose contract values or the work timeline associated with those new C2 and autonomy deals, it did provide a few insights into the competition pool while also announcing the winners. In the category of Opportunistic, Resilient &amp; Innovative Expeditionary Network Topology (ORIENT), 119 companies submitted 130 solution proposals. From that pool, DIU selected Aalyria, Higher Ground, IoT/AI and Viasat for prototyping work. Meanwhile, the office’s call for help with Autonomous Collaborative Teaming (ACT), designed to better automate the coordination between hundreds or thousands of unmanned drones, sparked 132 companies to submit 165 solutions. DIU has now whittled that down to three, awarding prototyping deals to Anduril Industries, L3Harris Technologies and Swarm Aero. 'We are seeing the strength of the joint teams that assemble to collaborate on the challenges of deploying autonomous systems including policy, software architecture, experimentation, and more,' Pentagon AI chief Radha Plumb said in the press release. In August 2023, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks launched Replicator as an avenue for countering China’s military mass by cranking out multiple thousands of 'attritable autonomous systems' within two years — think unmanned surface vessels and loitering drones. Earlier this month, the Pentagon confirmed a host of details about the initiative including that the two drones selected for the Army’s Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft System program — Ghost X from Anduril Industries and the C-100 from Performance Drone Works – were also both under the Replicator-1, Tranche 2 umbrella. The Marine Corps’ Organic Precision Fires program, which revolves around Anduril’s Altius-600, has also been deemed a Replicator initiative, and is there to complement the Switchblade-600 loitering munition that was previously announced as part of Replicator. The Air Force’s Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV), a drone prototyping competition, is also joining the Replicator pack. In addition to work on Replicator 1, the department announced plans for a second Replicator initiative in September, this time focusing on finding systems to counter small drones at US military installations across the globe.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/diu-picks-7-companies-to-support-replicator-autonomy-c2-efforts/	2024-11-20T09:00:35-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/04/230405_SAS_underwater_drone_Mehta_crop.png
F-35 EW system for the future fight	Image courtesy of BAE Systems. Lisa Aucoin is the vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems (ES) sector. With more than 35 years of experience in the aerospace and defense industry, she has held numerous positions in engineering and program management. Previously, she was vice president of Engineering for the ES sector, leading more than 5,000 engineers and technical support staff. She is a certified Six Sigma Black Belt and holds a master's degree in physics from Northeastern University, and a bachelor's degree in physics from Valparaiso University. Lisa is exceptionally passionate about developing our next generation of scientists and engineers and is actively involved with organizations that foster curiosity in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) subjects through active student participation. We sat down to interview Lisa about electromagnetic warfare, the F-35 program, and her leadership. You are the vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems. Can you describe your organization and its focus? Lisa Aucoin, vice president of F-35 Solutions at BAE Systems’ Electronic Systems (ES) sector. As a key partner on the F-35 program, we hold a 13 to 15 percent workshare of each aircraft, excluding propulsion, and we play a major role across multiple markets. I specifically lead the company’s F-35 program in the U.S. that has more than 1,000 employees dedicated to providing the electromagnetic warfare (EW) system for the F-35. As the EW system provider for the fifth-generation fighter, a role we’ve held since the program’s inception in 2001, we deliver a system that helps protect U.S. and allied forces. For those unfamiliar with EW, simply put, it is the use of electromagnetic (EM) or directed energy and integrated cyber capabilities to carry out military and intelligence missions. The more rigorously a military force exploits the full EM spectrum –– radio waves, microwaves, millimeter waves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet light, and gamma rays – and cyber effects, the more successfully it can pre-empt adversarial threats and respond to attacks electronically. The system needs to detect threats and identify them, and give pilots the opportunity to evade or engage. These threats include other fighter jets, missiles, anti-aircraft systems, drones, and other adversary weapons systems. Everyday those threats are evolving, becoming more complex and harder to detect and counter as the electromagnetic spectrum grows more congested. Our F-35 team is busy designing, developing, manufacturing, testing and repairing advanced systems that protect warfighters and enable them to conduct missions in highly contested battlespaces. Our people are highly skilled in disciplines including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, software development, manufacturing, supply chain management, and program management. The program requires everyone to come together to deliver an exceptional technical system for integration into one of the most sophisticated fighter jets ever flown. The AN/ASQ-239, the F-35 EW system, can detect a broad spectrum of electromagnetic signals in a 360-degree sphere around the aircraft at long range. This is done passively without emitting energy, making the F-35 less observable to adversaries. The systems’ 'staring' sensors are embedded throughout the aircraft, providing immediate detection of electromagnetic signals, giving pilots critical situational awareness, and allowing them to act first. By delivering long-range, all-aspect (360-degree) broad-spectrum EW capabilities, the system also increases the probability of signal intercept. BAE Systems has a long history in EW, how does the F-35 system fit into that portfolio? Our EW history goes back more than 60 years and our systems have flown on over 120 platforms. They operate on 80 percent of U.S. military fixed-wing aircraft, over 95 percent of U.S. Army rotary-wing aircraft, and those of U.S. allies. The F-35 EW system is a key part of our extensive EW portfolio that includes protecting fighter aircrafts like the F-15, F-16, and the F-22 platforms. What is the current status of the F-35 program and the EW system? To date, 1,600 F-35s have been delivered around the world. Each aircraft is equipped with our integrated EW system. The F-35 is expected to stay in service until 2070 and was designed for continual upgrades to help it outpace emerging threats throughout its six-decade service life. Recently, the F-35 platform achieved a significant milestone – it was cleared to enter full-rate production. As part of a broader strategy focused on whole-life mission effectiveness, the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD) entrusted BAE Systems to design and manufacture the next-generation 'Block 4' version of the system. The powerful Block 4 EW system will offer greater situational awareness, enhanced survivability, and increased capabilities to counter evolving threats. As an upgradeable system, Block 4 will combine adaptable hardware and incremental software updates to accelerate the delivery of advanced EW capabilities to warfighters. This will also reduce engineering and sustainment costs for the U.S. DoD and its allies. Block 4 systems will include significantly advanced hardware and software that improve sensing and signal-processing capabilities. New, high-performance sensors will boost the system’s ability to detect more difficult-to-observe threats. It will help warfighters execute missions today and into the future. What does success look like for you? There are two primary ways we measure success – technology and operational milestones. These are driven by evolving mission requirements and the need to innovate. Both types are important, but at the end of the day, it is about people –– our customers and our end-users. Protecting the warfighter is our north star. It really is what drives us. None of this would be possible without our people. We employ the best and brightest and we ask them to do very hard things. We talked about our long history in EW, but looking forward, a platform like the F-35 is expected to fly for 60 years. So, to achieve this, it is about culture. We have always focused on our current workforce, but we know culture is a long-term strategy. In many ways a focus on the future helps to drive today’s success. For example, the F-35 EW system was developed with the future in mind. Designed to be adaptable and upgradeable, it will be able to keep up with threats that haven’t been developed yet. It’s not a moment-in-time system, it is designed for the future fight, wherever that future leads. You mention preparing for the future, how do you build your workforce for the future? Internally, we have several leadership development programs for employees. Looking further into the future, we support STEM initiatives like FIRST® Robotics. BAE Systems has supported FIRST for 30 years –– working together to inspire students to pursue careers in STEM. The company provides funding to FIRST teams near ES sites nationwide, helps with robotics and coding grants for Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, and funds an annual college scholarship program for FIRST students. We value this partnership because we believe FIRST is building the next generation of innovators. Another element of building our future workforce is identifying and creating non-traditional entries into industry. One success story is our long-running Microelectronics Boot Camp program with Nashua Community College. The Microelectronics Boot Camp is a 10-week hands-on career training that was developed in partnership with BAE Systems in 2016 to prepare students for entry-level careers in wire/ribbon bonding and die attach for microelectronic components in manufacturing. The program recently celebrated its 30th cohort graduating class and has now graduated over 300 students with a 98 percent job placement rate –– with BAE Systems having hired more than half of these graduates. Final thoughts? Today’s F-35 system was built on the shoulders of giants. The technology leverages decades of innovation, lessons learned, and techniques and procedures cultivated over generations of an entire F-35 ecosystem and community. Past employees influenced those working on the program today and we are cultivating the workforce of tomorrow to assure that we continue to serve our warfighters for generations to come. At the end of the day, it is the history, the ecosystem, the focus on people and the future that drive me every day to come to work knowing I’m helping to safeguard generations of warfighters.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/f-35-ew-system-for-the-future-fight/	2024-11-20T07:42:52-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/BAE-F-35-600x300-2.png
Why Germany’s Scholz won’t follow Biden on long-range strikes for Ukraine	Members of the German Armed Forces Bundeswehr carry a 'Taurus' weapon system during the International Aerospace Exhibition (ILA) in Schoenefeld on May 30, 2016. (TOBIAS SCHWARZ/AFP via Getty Images) BELFAST — In the wake of the US government approving Ukraine to use Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) surface-to-surface artillery weapons inside Russia, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to bow to new calls to supply Kyiv with desperately needed Taurus long-range precision missiles. The Swedish-German ballistic missile offers a range in excess of 500 kilometers and is designed to hit hardened targets like bunkers, bridges, and command and control facilities. Germany completed an order of 600 units for integration on Tornado IDS (Interdiction/Strike) fighter jets in 2010. Scholz publicly justified the decision not to make a Taurus approval on Monday at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, saying that he did not want to be held 'responsible' for the weapons 'targeting,' — a reference to his long stated redline that Taurus should not draw Germany into the war. Ukraine has reportedly since fired ATACMS to strike into Russia for the first time. Ukrainian officials said an initial salvo targeted an ammunition depot in the Bryansk region of southwestern Russia, according to the New York Times. Analysts Breaking Defense spoke with suggested that Scholz's position on Taurus effectively amounts to an attempt to protect his political career and argued that he has limited clout over Russia more broadly. If he was to change course, it would be 'deeply unpopular' with the left-leaning faction of the Social Democratic Party — to the extent that Scholz could 'say goodbye' to any chance of the SDP considering him for the chancellorship again, ahead of a new general election planned for February, according to Fabian Hoffmann, a missile expert at the University of Oslo in Norway. The election was prompted by the Free Democratic Party leaving the coalition government, which is also made up of the SDP and the Greens. Speaking before Scholz's G20 press conference, Matthew Savill, director of military sciences at the Royal United Services Institute, a British defense think tank, said, 'If Scholz could be moved, I suspect he would have done so by now — he was extremely negative about Taurus over the weekend, and although the Russian strikes almost immediately after his call with Putin show how little influence he has, it doesn’t look likely that he would respond by changing policy now.' Even if approved, Taurus would face problems reaching the frontline in Ukraine in a timely fashion. In February, a conversation about potential deliveries to Ukraine by German Air Force officials was intercepted by Russia and shared online by state broadcaster RT. The leak included the suggestion that Taurus operations could only begin eight months after political approval, based on training and mounts needed to integrate it on fighter jets. 'Taurus would require a new round of integration and validation work before they could be launched by Ukrainian aircraft (most likely the UAF’s relatively small number of Su-24 strike planes, which already carry Storm Shadow),' said Jacob Parakilas, research leader for defense strategy, policy and capabilities at RAND Europe. 'It might be easier to integrate onto the UAF’s newly-arrived F-16s, which have NATO-standard mounts and connectors, although Taurus is not currently certified for F-16 carriage and launch either — so it would be a matter of months before they could be used in either case.' The UK and France are expected to follow the lead of the US on ATACMS and approve Ukraine to launch Storm Shadow and SCALP long-range cruise missiles inside Russian territory. French newspaper Le Figaro reported that approvals by Paris and London had been given but later edited the story to clarify that debates are still ongoing. A spokesperson for the French President's Office declined to comment on specific weapon systems, deferring to an address by French President Emmanuel Macron during a state visit to Germany in May where he stated that, 'we must allow them [Ukraine] to neutralise the military sites from which the missiles are fired and, basically, the military sites from which Ukraine is attacked, but we must not allow them to hit other targets in Russia, obviously civilian capabilities or other military targets.' Macron added at that time, 'When Ukraine is attacked from identified targets in Russia, well, I think we have to be able to allow them to do that if we really want to retain our objective. And I think I can say that, factually, we are not escalating by doing this, since it is Russia that is organising itself in this way.' In the case of the UK and Storm Shadow, the Ministry of Defence declined to comment on whether an approval for Ukraine had been made. Earlier this week, UK Defence Secretary John Healey told another lawmaker that commenting on the issue 'risks operational security and the only person that benefits from public debate is President Putin,' according to the BBC. From a 'Ukrainian perspective it would be preferable for this [approvals on Storm Shadow and SCALP] to take place privately and not be announced until after first use, though the Russians already have some advance warning,' said Savill.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/why-germanys-scholz-wont-follow-biden-on-long-range-strikes-for-ukraine/	2024-11-20T06:44:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/240229_taurus_missile_germany_GettyImages-535764452-scaled-e1709243670892.jpg
Putin’s new nuclear doctrine: It’s my arsenal and I’ll strike if I want to	In this pool photograph distributed by the Russian state agency Sputnik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin meets with Yevgeny Balitsky (not pictured), the Moscow-installed head of the Zaporizhzhia region of Ukraine, at the Kremlin in Moscow on November 18, 2024. (Photo by VYACHESLAV PROKOFYEV/POOL/AFP via Getty Images) Russian President Vladimir Putin signed Russia's new nuclear doctrine on Nov. 19, just days after US President Joe Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russian territory with US-made weapons. The timing of its publication surely is intended to send a message of displeasure to the West about this decision — as well as a larger anger around Western support for Ukraine in general. It also comes in the context of talks among the P5 — the nuclear weapon states defined in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty: the US, UK, France, Russia, and China — that were scheduled earlier to discuss nuclear doctrine, but delayed by Russia and now back on the calendar. However, the contents of the document should not shock those paying attention. In truth, the changes contained in the doctrine are consistent with longer-term shifts in Russian public messaging about its nuclear deterrent, practical changes in Russia’s threat environment, as well as its own capabilities and confidence in those capabilities. In fact, the 2024 doctrine is likely closer to Russia’s actual nuclear doctrine, which is that Russia will use nuclear weapons whenever Putin thinks it necessary to do so. Public-facing, unclassified nuclear doctrine documents are a product of the post-Cold War thaw in relations, with the US publishing its first Nuclear Posture Review in 1994. Russia’s military was in a state of collapse at the time, with concern in Moscow that the United States might intervene in Russia’s bloody Chechen wars or in Iraq (twice) and Yugoslavia, or worse, overthrow the regime in Moscow. While Russia did not release an unclassified version of its nuclear doctrine during the 1990s, its leadership engaged in very public nuclear messaging, culminating with simulated nuclear strikes against NATO at the end of its ZAPAD 1999 exercise and a public discussion on a very-low Russian nuclear threshold. However, Russia’s nuclear threats were increasingly at odds with its position in the United Nations — particularly in the dialogue around the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty — which has led to confusion about what, exactly, their doctrine allowed or precluded in terms of actual nuclear use. Finally, in 2020, Russia released its first public nuclear doctrine document, which appeared to have a very high threshold for nuclear use — with nuclear weapons used 'exclusively as a means of deterrence, their use being an extreme and compelled measure.' There are mentions of nuclear weapons in other official documents — such as Russia’s official Military Doctrine (current version: 2014), but they have a similarly high threshold. Such a high perceived threshold for nuclear use is not consistent with Russia’s nuclear posture — which includes nuclear weapons designed for warfighting — and became a direct impediment in President Vladimir Putin’s threats against the US and NATO for their support of Ukraine. Thus, something had to change. Russia’s new Nuclear Doctrine was published on the Kremlin website as Decree 991, 'On the Fundamentals of the State Policy of the Russian Federation in the Field of Nuclear Deterrence,' replacing the previous version — Decree 355 of 2 June 2020. As with all things, the devil is in the details. And, because bureaucrats are bureaucrats (that is, naturally lazy), a side-by-side comparison of the 2020 and 2024 documents is the best way to highlight and analyze the changes. So, what's different? Structurally, it's almost identical, with a few minor deletions alongside some highly-significant new language intended to make Russian threats more credible against its adversaries — particularly NATO and the United States. It is still about six pages, with 26 paragraphs (versus 25 in the old one) and a number of sub paragraphs, organized around four sections: Informed from 1,000 days of conflict in Ukraine and the world’s response, Russia’s new doctrine first and foremost seeks to lower the threshold for nuclear weapons use. The new doctrine accomplishes this by removing the word 'exclusively' for the use of nuclear weapons (new doctrine paragraph 6: 'The Russian Federation considers nuclear weapons as a means of deterrence, the use of which is an extreme and necessary measure'). It also replaces the threshold for use against actions that threaten the existence or viability of the state to include actions that pose a critical threat to Russian or Belarusian sovereignty or territorial integrity (new doctrine paragraphs 18 and 19.d, 2020 doctrine paragraph 17) including conventional attacks — a far more subjective judgement, leaving open nuclear use in far more abstract threat scenarios. Then, in Sections 2 and 3, Russia’s new doctrine expands who it is seeking to deter with nuclear weapons, under what conditions it would use nuclear weapons, and who it is defending under its nuclear umbrella. Section 2 expands the 'who it is seeking to deter' by adding not just nuclear weapon states (e.g., the US) or states in military blocs (new paragraph 10 in the 2024 doctrine) allied with nuclear weapon states (i.e., NATO) to include states that enable attacks on Russian territory from their borders and states that have significant conventional capabilities allied with nuclear weapon states (paragraph 11) or not allied with a nuclear weapon state (paragraph 9). In plainer terms, this now gives Russia the doctrine that any nation aligned with a nuclear state, or any state receiving assistance from any nuclear state or state aligned with a nuclear state — i.e., all of NATO — can be the target of nuclear weapons if Russia feels threatened. Section 3 expands the part about 'what conditions it would use nuclear weapons' significantly, to include not only launch on warning of ballistic missile attack (old doctrine paragraph 19 a), but a new formulation aimed towards a more comprehensive program of Launch on Warning: 'receipt of reliable information on the massive launch (take-off) of aerospace attack weapons (strategic and tactical aircraft, cruise missiles, unmanned, hypersonic and other aircraft) and their crossing of the state border of the Russian Federation' (new paragraph 19 e). Further on conditions for nuclear use, Russia’s nuclear doctrine lists dangers that might become threats that would require nuclear use. The old and the new doctrine both list the possession of WMD by adversaries, expansion of and deployment of missile defenses, buildups of conventional forces, nuclear weapons in outer space, nuclear weapons stationed on the territory of non-nuclear weapon states, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (the old doctrine highlighted the threat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons only, the new doctrine expands this to all WMD). But the new doctrine adds new or expanded blocs of countries allied against Russia with military infrastructure nearby (15.f), the threat of blockades of Russia (15.g), the threat of damaging facilities that could cause widespread environmental damage (15.h) and the planning or conduct of exercises near Russia's borders (15.i). I guess Russia will try to deter what it does best? Finally, Section 3 expands 'who it is defending' with nuclear deterrence to include not just Russia and its allies (as in the 2020 doctrine), but specifically Belarus, and Belarus as part of the Union State (additions to paragraphs 18 and 19d), and to use nuclear deterrence Russian military forces outside its territory (new paragraph 19.b). The remaining changes are consistent with recent developments, including central control by Russia of its nuclear forces based abroad (read: Belarus), and it eliminates any reference to compliance with arms control — a bad sign for the future of New START, scheduled to end Feb. 4, 2026. In all, the new doctrine says that Russia will use nuclear weapons whenever the president decides to do so. It also contains a laundry list of things it doesn't like, in an effort to try to shape Western behavior. But by expanding the role of nuclear weapons beyond 'exclusively' deterrence, and by expanding the dangers that could become threats — to include military infrastructure or exercises near its borders — it risks sending ambiguous or non-credible deterrent signals that could, in turn, require Putin to act out further in order to credibly deter the West. It remains to be seen if President-elect Donald Trump will seek to stabilize the relationship with Russia, seek new arms control arrangements with Russia and China, acquiesce to Russian demands over things like Ukraine or NATO, or move in other unexpected directions. Regardless, in the interim, we can expect more threats from Moscow on the basis of a doctrinal document that is interesting but remains firmly in the world of propaganda rather than military doctrine.

Navy needs industry all in on 3D printing parts for subs, or else	The Virginia-class attack submarine Minnesota (SSN 783) is under construction at Huntington Ingalls Newport News Shipbuilding. (US Navy photo courtesy of Newport News Shipbuilding/Released) WASHINGTON — Leading Navy admirals and officials now see additive manufacturing as a potential savior of the overstretched submarine force and its 'exceptionally fragile' industrial base. But they need industry to get on board, ASAP. 3D printers are already churning out an ever-larger array of ever-larger parts, from simple plastic safety covers, to high-end specialty valves, to robust metal structures weighing a ton and a half. And while many companies are embracing the new approach, the service’s program executive officer for attack submarines (PEO-SSN) had stern words for the laggards. 'If you are a supplier, and your lead time is too long, and you refuse to work with us to give us your tech and help us figure out how to reverse-engineer it and how to manufacture it — not that we’re trying to take it from you — [but] we're going to figure it out,' said Rear Adm. Jonathan Rucker, the PEO-SSN. '[That’s] not a threat — [it’s] a fact of life. 'We're going to figure out how to get these parts quicker,' he told a ballroom full of contractors at last week’s Naval Submarine League conference. 'We need your help. We don’t have a choice. Time is not on our side.' Rucker reassured industry that 'we’re not trying to steal anyone’s IP [intellectual property].' He made a point to praise what he said were a large number of small businesses that were 'already … leaning forward [and] helping us in additive manufacturing.' 'All of us can benefit together,' he exhorted the conference. 'For all small businesses, I implore you to be part of the team with us.' The military has 3D printed small numbers of small, non-critical plastic parts for years, like safety covers for switches and connectors for LAN cables. But aerospace and defense firms are increasingly able to print large, high-strength metal components. Up until this year, the Navy had only installed two 3D-printed metal parts on its submarines, said Vice Adm. Robert Gaucher, commander of Naval Submarine Forces. But this year, he told the conference, they quadrupled that to eight — and when USS Michigan comes in for overhaul next year, 'we plan to have 33.' 'Delivering these parts will be faster than traditional casting, so we can mitigate our supply chain shortfalls,' Gaucher emphasized. 'Where I really want to press forward with metal data manufacturing is at our regional maintenance centers.' But in the longer term, 3D-printed metal parts can speed up construction of new submarines as well, said Matt Sermon, executive director of PEO-Strategic Submarine. 'Metallic additive manufacturing … it’s our Manhattan Project,' Sermon told the conference. It’s a 'national security imperative,' he said, along with increasing use of automation, robotics and other advanced manufacturing technologies to overhaul an ailing industrial base. The stakes are existential for a submarine force that is struggling to simultaneously maintain an overworked and aging fleet, build the upgunned and upgraded version of the Virginia-class attack sub fast enough to meet both US and Australian demand, and launch the first Columbia-class nuclear ballistic missile boat by 2027. 'We have a huge hole to dig out of,' said Adm. Bill Houston, director of the Navy Nuclear Propulsion program. 'We’ve let too much of the shipbuilding industry go away [because] we essentially stopped building submarines for about seven years' after the Soviet Union fell. The Navy is still paying for that decision today, he told the conference, rushing to ramp up production of new boats and improve maintenance of old ones 'with an industrial base that’s less than half the size' it was during the Cold War. 'It’s an exceptionally fragile supply base,' Houston said. That said, in recent years, the service and industry have had some success in reconstructing old-school heavy-metal industrial capabilities, such as the casting of hundred-ton hull sections. 'Castings [were] the bane of our existence when I talked to you two years ago,' Rucker told reporters at the conference. 'That chokepoint’s gone.' A big part of that breakthrough has been the United Kingdom, Rucker said: Whereas the Navy used to have just one vendor it deemed qualified for certain crucial, large-scale castings, 'we now have four' — two of them British. These four companies use conventional casting techniques, not additive manufacturing, which has historically been restricted to much smaller parts. But 3D printing has potential to speed up production of even heavy-metal, high-strength components. The traditional process 'takes years of machining' to smooth out the massive castings and remove the inevitable imperfections left by the traditional process, before they can be installed on a sub or ship, Sermon told Breaking Defense. By contrast, he said, 'as additive manufacturing matures &#8230; we believe we can print those [parts] with better quality,' saving time and expensive skilled labor. Sermon’s team has already 3D printed a 3,300-pound (1.65 ton) metal part and is beginning tests to ensure it’s up to standard, he told Breaking Defense. For the future, they are studying additive manufacturing of the kind of massive hull sections that currently can only be produced by casting. 'I see a world, not science fiction … but in the relatively near term, where we’ll be able to print submarine hull and ship modules,' he said. America’s AUKUS allies, Australia and the United Kingdom, need to be a part of this additive manufacturing revolution, Sermon added. 'We want to do it with our partners,' he said. 'We absolutely want their industrial base [using] a 2030s model … not a 1970s industrial base.' An Australian additive manufacturing firm, AML3D, joined the US Navy’s R&amp;D efforts last year, Sermon told reporters at the time. The firm’s work for the US is moving ahead, Rucker told reporters last week: Just before he came to the Submarine League conference, he said, he got an email asking for his formal approval on one of their engineering drawings.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/navy-needs-industry-all-in-on-3d-printing-parts-for-subs-or-else/	2024-11-19T13:11:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/8630521-e1732050099734.jpg
Morocco exempts defense firms from taxes, eyeing national and international investments	A Royal Moroccan Air Force CH-47 Chinook military helicopter takes off near the medical-surgical field hospital deployed in Akka municipality, province of Tata, Morocco during Moroccan-US military manoeuvres, as part of the Africa Command's largest joint annual exercise 'African Lion 2024,' on May 29, 2024. (Photo by FADEL SENNA/AFP via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Moroccan government has approved a proposed 2025 budget that exempts defense firms from taxes, in what's seen as an attempt to boost military production and encourage foreign and national defense producers to invest in the kingdom. 'This draft decree aims to enable the manufacturers of defense and security equipment, weapons and ammunition to secure a temporary exemption from corporate tax,' government spokesperson Mustapha Baitas said on Friday. The budget proposal is reportedly expected to increase the defense budget slightly from $124 billion MAD ($12.4 billion USD) in 2024 to $133 billion MAD ($13.32 billion USD) in 2025. RELATED: In North Africa, a fighter jet arms race, with Russia and the US on either side Moroccan defense expert Abdel Hamid Harfi told Breakiing Defense that the tax exemption comes as the North African nation is aiming to boost its reputation as an incubator for military industries. That, in turn, 'creates added value and benefit from Morocco’s international relations and partnerships as a good platform for export-oriented industrial investment, and within the framework of granting military industries the same privileges granted to civilian industries such as automobile industries and others,' he said. Harfi said that the income tax exemption is not the first for defense firms, as the Moroccan government approved a few months ago a complete exemption from value-added tax for a specific number of years. Taken together, 'these privileges would enhance the appeal of the emerging sector for foreign and local investors wishing to invest in this sector in the Kingdom,' Harfi said. In addition to the tax breaks, Harfi noted that Morocco has established 'two industrial zones that are scheduled to host military industrial units, where the construction of a number of factories has actually begun.' Senior advisor at Gulf State Analytics Theodore Karasik said that it is likely that 'Morocco seeks to boost its industry in several industrial parks while diversifying potential clients that had been steered away before because of taxation. Morocco seeks greater knowledge transfer and advanced weapons testing and production.' Like most Arab states, Morocco is still in the development phase of its defense industrial base. 'Up to now, there are experiences of some Moroccan firms in the field of the military industry, limited to military UAV industry that is still in the scientific research and development phase, military clothing manufacture, and 3D printing techniques of spare parts,' Harfi said. He highlighted that UAV development in Morocco is intended to create a competitive outcome capable of meeting the national needs as well as those of friendly countries. Elsewhere, Morocco has joined forces with US-based Lockheed Martin and Belgian firms Sabca and Sabena to maintain and support F-16 and C-130 Hercules aircraft locally.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/morocco-exempts-defense-firms-from-taxes-eyeing-national-and-international-investments/	2024-11-19T09:40:54-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241119_moroccan_helo_GettyImages-2154639442-scaled-e1732032991714.jpg
‘Self-inflicted wound’: Pentagon comptroller warns Trump against mass firings of federal employees	Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)/Chief Financial Officer Mike McCord delivers remarks at a Business Executives for National Security industry discussion at the National Defense University, Washington, D.C., April 11, 2022. (DoD photo by Lisa Ferdinando) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s stated plans to tee up the firings of thousands of federal employees has shaken many in the career workforce and is damaging productivity, the Pentagon’s chief accountant warned today. Mike McCord, the Pentagon comptroller, also predicted the current continuing resolution would stretch until March and the fiscal 2026 budget will not arrive before April or May. Near the end of his first term in office, Trump signed an executive order reclassifying thousands of government employees — often the type who typically remain in place regardless of presidential administration — as new 'Schedule F' staff without employment protections, essentially making them at-will workers who are easier to fire. Critics lambasted the move as politicizing the bureaucracy and an attack on civil servants amid calls by Trump to purge the 'deep state.' Now, as Trump prepares to return to the White House, critics fear the policy could make a return after it was quickly rescinded by President Joe Biden. Trump has campaigned on reviving the Schedule F approach. 'I would certainly hope that the next administration can resist the temptation to [impose] self-inflicted wounds on the workforce with the Schedule F-type approach,' McCord said today in a keynote address at the Professional Services Council Vision 2024 Federal Market Forcecast conference. 'I can tell you that the career workforce is worried — those that I talked to already in anticipation of what might happen,' McCord said. 'It's not helpful for productivity.' 'There's a lot of hard-working, dedicated people in the Defense Department, and if you work with them instead of trying to stomp them, I think that we will get to a much better place,' McCord said. Based on the results of the November election, McCord also said he anticipated the current continuing resolution (CR) for the 2025 fiscal year, set to expire in December, would be stretched out to March as a new Republican congressional majority asserts its influence — though he characterized any gains the GOP could make on its priorities as marginal. 'There's a time value of money we all know in our personal life, and having a bill in December and a two percent better bill in March would be a bad trade for most of us, but that's not how things tend to get looked at here,' McCord said. 'So I think we're headed toward, probably, the two percent different bill in March than what we'd like to see in December.' The Defense Department, along with the rest of the federal government, is well-acquainted with CRs, which military officials have long complained set back modernization efforts by freezing spending at prior-year levels and preventing the start of new programs. By McCord’s count, there have been 15 CRs over the last 16 years, averaging four months a year. 'A third of the year wasted in CRs consistently over 15 straight years,' he said. 'Ridiculous.' Despite the current CR and uncertainties ahead of the November election, Pentagon officials still put together an FY26 budget through the regular process, McCord said. That budget has almost been finalized, he said, details of which can then be shared with the incoming administration. However, McCord noted Trump officials have still not signed transition documents, largely preventing current officials from communicating with their successors. Even when those documents are signed, the process of bringing on new staff from the incoming administration and formulating a new budget likely means the Pentagon’s FY26 spending plan won’t be released until April or May, he added. Freed from constraints of the Fiscal Responsibility Act, which capped defense toplines for both 2024 and 2025 — though Congress circumvented those limits in April by passing a $95 billion supplemental defense bill anyway — McCord said the DoD would recommend getting back to the levels of topline growth defined by budgets in years like FY23 and FY24. 'This year, we’re working to a higher [topline],' McCord said of the FY26 proposal. 'But there’s no agreement, and there is going to be a new decision from the new team about what their topline looks like that will help inform their look at what program mix we’ve left for them.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/self-inflicted-wound-pentagon-comptroller-warns-against-mass-firings-of-federal-employees/	2024-11-19T08:14:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/mccord-e1732031536913.jpg
AeroVironment purchases BlueHalo to ‘redefine the next era’ of defense technology	AeroVironment's Switchblade launcher sits on display at AUSA 2023. (Tim Martin / Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Unmanned systems manufacturer AeroVironment is purchasing tech firm BlueHalo, the companies announced today, setting up a merger that could result in a major player on the unmanned systems market. The deal is an all-stock transaction, with a value of approximately $4.1 billion, according to an AeroVironment announcement. The combined company is 'expected to deliver more than $1.7 billion in revenue.' BlueHalo has 'more than $900 million in revenues for 2024,' per the statement. 'For over 50 years, AV has pioneered innovative solutions on the battlefield, and today we are poised to usher in the next era of defense technology through our combination with BlueHalo,' Wahid Nawabi, AeroVironment’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in the announcement. On paper, the two companies have little overlap, although some back-office jobs inevitably end up cut when companies merge. BlueHalo has focused on technologies in the space, counter-UAS, directed energy and electronic warfare realms, while AeroVironment has made its bones on unmanned systems, including loitering munitions. The company has found success particularly with its Switchblade family of loitering munitions, which has won Army contracts and been featured as part of the Replicator initiative. It isn’t hard to imagine taking BlueHalo’s technologies and integrating them onto AV systems. Or, as the announcement puts it, 'The companies’ shared culture of agile innovation and mission expertise will enable the combined entity to develop and deliver next-generation technologies that will have significant military value and redefine the next era of Defense Technology.' In a note to investors, Byron Callan, an analyst with Capital Alpha Partners, said that this deal fits into a broader trend across the defense space. 'The structure of the global defense sector is changing, and this transaction underscores that transformation. Mid-tier suppliers largely disappeared in the 1990s during sector consolidation. There was another wave of M&amp;A [mergers and acquisitions] in the mid-late 2010s as force protection companies that thrived during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars were bought up. 'The 2010s-2020s have seen a rise in new defense tech entrants, with capital provided by venture and private equity. BlueHalo is an example of that change,' Callan continued. 'We expect this emerging mid-tier will take share from larger contractors.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aerovironment-purchases-bluehalo-to-redefine-the-next-era-of-defense-technology/	2024-11-19T07:21:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/231011_switchblade_launcher_MARTIN.jpg

We are family.' Austin's two-day stop saw him meeting with Philippine Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, breaking ground for a new joint intelligence center at Manila's Camp Aguinaldo, and talking with Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. at Malacanang Palace. During the visit with Teodoro, the two signed a General Security of Military Information Agreement, an important change in security posture that permits the two allies to share classified information and ease the sale of sensitive technologies. The US has signed similar agreements with Indonesia in 2021, Japan in 2007, the United Arab Emirates in 1987, Ecuador in 1985. Egypt in 1982, Denmark in 1981 and with a host of other NATO and non-NATO allies and partners. 'Not only will this allow the Philippines access to higher capabilities and big-ticket items from the United States, it will also open opportunities to pursue similar agreements with like-minded nations,' Philippine Department of National Defense spokesman Arsenio Andolong said, according to local media reports. Neither country provided details or released a copy of the agreement. Austin traveled to Palawan, an island on the edge of the South China Sea, with Teodoro today. They visited Antonio Bautista Airbase, one of nine Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement sites, as well as the command center for the Philippines Western Command. The latter is the command in charge of waters that, while legally Philippine according to a UN tribunal, have seen multiple skirmishes with Chinese ships over the last several years. 'The leaders discussed efforts to advance operational planning and deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation with like-minded partners in the South China Sea,' an official joint statement said. Austin also observed a Philippine Navy demonstration of American-supplied Mantas T-12 surface drones, built by Maritime Tactical Systems (MARTAC), on Palawan.

US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called it a 'once in a generation' investment. The T-12s were provided as part of this financing. The drones will be used in part to monitor China's aggressive actions in the Philippines Extended Economic Zone, which have included ramming and using high-pressure water cannons against Philippine ships and attacking Filipinos with axes. The Mantas can carry sensors as well as electronic warfare gear. China issued a muted response to the intelligence-sharing agreement between the two countries. 'No military agreement, or defense and security cooperation, in whatever form, should target any third party or harm the interests of any third party. Nor should it undermine regional peace or exacerbate regional tensions,' Chinese Foreign Ministry Lin Jian said at the regular press conference. 'The only right choice for safeguarding national security and regional peace and stability is to uphold good-neighborliness and friendship and maintain strategic independence.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/philippines-us-build-tighter-intel-ties-ease-exports-we-are-family-says-austin/	2024-11-19T06:20:34-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/austin-phillipines-scaled-e1732023474834.jpg
India’s hypersonic missile test more stepping stone than game-changer	India test-launched what it called a hypersonic missile on Nov. 16. (Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh via X) WASHINGTON — India is claiming a successful test of a hypersonic missile over the weekend, but the system is likely a ways away from being a real game changer, analysts tell Breaking Defense. Little is actually known about the test, including the name of the new weapon. According to a statement from defense minister Rajnath Singh, the 'historic' launch happened Nov. 16 from Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Island, off the coast of Odisha. A photo shows that it was tested from a mobile launcher. And the weapon, produced by the Defense Research and Development Organization, has a range of greater than 1,500 km, according to a government statement. 'The flight data &#8230; confirmed the successful terminal maneuvers and impact with high degree of accuracy,' the statement reads, according to Reuters. Without greater detail, however, it’s unclear exactly how different this weapon is from systems already in Indian hands. Technically, most ballistic missiles are able to reach hypersonic — Mach 5 or higher — speeds. What sets apart the current crop of weapons loosely grouped as 'hypersonic' is the ability of the reentry vehicles to maneuver at high speeds, making them much harder to intercept. Tom Karako, a missile defense expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that while it's entirely possible this new weapon has that capability, it’s never good to leap at assumptions. The @DRDO_India has successfully conducted a flight trial of its long range hypersonic missile on 16th Nov 2024 from Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island, off-the-coast of Odisha. Raksha Mantri Shri @rajnathsingh has congratulated DRDO, Armed Forces and the Industry for successful flight… pic.twitter.com/wq7yM2YS9f &mdash; रक्षा मंत्री कार्यालय/ RMO India (@DefenceMinIndia) November 17, 2024 'It may well be that this particular missile partakes in several characteristics of so-called &#8216;hypersonic flight,'' he told Breaking Defense. 'But it’s important to emphasize that there is no such thing as ‘a’ hypersonic missile, there is a spectrum of delivery systems that contend with the challenging and violent aerodynamic and thermal environment. 'Whether it is a game-changer or not is debatable, but it is clearly part of a larger trend towards high speed maneuvering missiles of various types.' Ankit Panda, the Stanton Senior Fellow in the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said the weapon sounds less like a game-changer and more of an 'evolutionary step.' And, he said, moving to the next level will take a confluence of factors: 'Much will depend on whether this system receives political sanction and if it can lead to cost-effective procurement plans for hypersonic payloads. Both are indeterminate at the moment.' In the Pacific region, where long-range strike is a vital tool for any nation expecting to go to war over great distances of water, the lure of hypersonic weapons is easy to understand. The United States, China, Russia and North Korea have all claimed some version of a hypersonic weapon in recent years. As a result, India's pursuit of such systems is as much about military benefit as it is political, said Panda. 'I think this test is the result of technical, political, and strategic factors. At the strategic level, China’s growing midcourse missile defense capabilities no doubt have had planners in India thinking about the problem of assuring retaliation in the future. Hypersonic payloads will be naturally appealing for this reason,' he said. 'Politically, India has also ascribed value in the past to making clear that it can join the ranks of the few, elite states that have mastered certain strategic technologies. We saw this previously with their direct-ascent anti-satellite weapon test in 2019, and similar dynamics may underpin the push to develop hypersonic weapons.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/indias-hypersonic-missile-test-more-stepping-stone-than-game-changer/	2024-11-19T04:15:41-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/india-hypersonic.jpg
Ligado’s $39B lawsuit against federal government can move forward, judge rules	The GPS constellation that provides positioning, navigation and timing signals to the US military and civilians around the world, is made up of 31 active satellites. (BlackJack3D/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — A federal judge has ruled that Ligado Networks can move forward with its lawsuit against the US government, a major win for the communications company. In October 2023, Ligado sued the government for $39 billion over claims that officials at the Departments of Defense and Commerce took 'unlawful actions' to, in effect, improperly seize without compensation the firm’s L-band spectrum. In January, the government had asked a judge to dismiss the suit. Today Judge Edward J. Damich of the US Federal Claims Court ruled in part in favor of Ligado and in part for the government over aspects of the case, but ultimately said the case 'may proceed.' 'Ligado is encouraged by the decision and looks forward to pursuing its case to hold the government accountable for the just compensation it owes the company.,' a Ligado spokesperson said in an email. 'In the Order, the Court agrees with Ligado’s position that the spectrum bands it was licensed to use by the FCC are property vis-à-vis the Department of Defense,' per the statement. 'Accordingly, and as long argued by Ligado, the Department’s unauthorized occupation of the spectrum, which has blocked Ligado’s ability to use its own property, is a constitutional taking that must be compensated by the government.' The ruling marks the latest episode in the decades-long drama over Ligado’s plan to use L-band spectrum to develop a wireless cell phone network, which the Departments of Defense, Commerce, Transportation and a number of other federal agencies insist could interfere with signals from the Global Position Satellite (GPS) network. In 2020, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) voted over department objections to grant Ligado the license to build a 5G network. GPS is used by myriad military weapon systems; the US air traffic control network; trains, planes and automobiles for navigation; and everyday citizens trying to find their way from here to there using interactive maps on their cell phones. The concern from defense officials has been that it will impact everything from soldiers trying to navigate on the ground to missile guidance systems. One complication for Ligado, according to expert Tim Farrar, is the Pentagon has not revealed which specific systems the department believes are at risk due to classification, so the firm has been hamstrung in mounting a counterargument. The Senate Armed Services Committee in June included language in the National Defense Authorization Act that would force the Pentagon to reveal that information, but it is unknown if that language will survive the final NDAA negotiations, currently ongoing. Farrar, an independent consultant on spectrum issues, told Breaking Defense, 'This is what it comes down: Is there going to be some justification for Ligado's claim of occupation, and if this will be a fight over the provision in the policy bill, because that’s what would provide Ligado with the leverage to discover some evidence to support that claim.' Outside of the courtroom, Ligado’s situation may end up being very different following the electoral victory of president-elect Donald Trump. Under Trump’s first administration, key administration officials pushed hard to open up the spectrum in order to boost economic growth. Leading the pushback at the time on behalf of the Pentagon was then-SASC chairman Jim Inhofe. However, Roger Wicker, the Republican from Missouri widely expected to take over the SASC leadership come January, was more sanguine about the situation, perhaps a sign that there will be less Senate pushback on Ligado’s spectrum moves going forward. Notably, Trump has announced he will nominate FCC member Brendon Carr as his FCC chair. In 2020, Carr, along with the rest of the FCC, voted to support Ligado’s application, and he was a vocal supporter of opening up spectrum for economic benefits. (Carr is also reportedly close to Elon Musk, who has sought to reduce oversight of systems such as the SpaceX Starlink satellite network, another issue that falls under the FCC.) 'This was an internal Trump administration back and forth last time around, and we’ll have to see what the positions are of people in this administration,' said Farrar. 'Ultimately, its going to be down to this administration to settle Ligado's claim, if it does need to be settled.'

AUKUS nations ink new hypersonic tech sharing agreement	Navy Strategic Systems Programs (SSP) conducted a successful test of the Second Stage Solid Rocket Motor (SRM) on August 25th in Promontory, Utah as part of the development of the Navy’s Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) offensive hypersonic strike capability and the Army’s Long Range Hypersonic Weapon (LRHW). (US Navy photo) WASHINGTON — The United States, United Kingdom and Australia today signed a new agreement under the AUKUS trilateral security pact that will allow the three countries to use one another's hypersonic weapons testing facilities as well as share technical information needed to develop and manufacture the technology. The new agreement has been dubbed the Hypersonic Flight Test and Experimentation (HyFliTE) Project Arrangement, and will include 'up to six' trilateral test flight campaigns by 2028 using a $252 million funding pool, according to a US Defense Department statement. 'We are increasing our collective ability to develop and deliver offensive and defensive hypersonic technologies through a robust series of trilateral tests and experiments that will accelerate the development of hypersonic concepts and critical enabling technologies,' Heidi Shyu, the Pentagon’s senior civilian overseeing research and engineering, said in the statement. 'Collaborative efforts are accelerating the development of underpinning enabling technologies, such as high temperature materials, advanced propulsion systems, and guidance and control. Each of these technologies is integral to the performance of hypersonic weapon systems and provides enhanced operational capability,' she continued All of the American military services have invested heavily into developing hypersonic weapons in recent years, with the Army and Navy designing a common glide body, while the Air Force has started — and closed — several air-launched weapons programs. 'This landmark arrangement with our US and Australian partners demonstrates the commitment of AUKUS partners to staying at the forefront of battle-winning defence technology,' said John Healey, the United Kingdom’s defense secretary. 'This work will keep us ahead of our adversaries on the battlefield, enhance our collective security and contribute to maintaining peace and stability in an increasingly complex and dangerous world.' The British statement added that the 'Hypersonic Technologies and Capabilities Development Framework' was used to source industry support and includes 'more than 90 suppliers and has a commercial headroom of' up to 1 billion British pounds, or 1.27 billion USD.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aukus-nations-ink-new-hypersonic-tech-sharing-agreement/	2024-11-18T10:38:02-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/08/210825-N-NO191-0002-e1726510358325.jpg
To counter China, Trump’s administration should build on Biden AI memo	Keyboard with China flag key (Getty images) Across both the Biden and Trump administrations, the US has consistently viewed China as the primary global rival, particularly in the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence. President Biden’s administration recently underscored this stance with the first-ever National Security Memorandum (NSM) on AI, which set a firm foundation for addressing the AI challenge posed by Beijing. The memo could prove to be a defining moment in the US strategy to retain global technological dominance, linking AI to national security and the broader competition with China's geopolitical and technological ambitions. The NSM directs the US government to implement concrete and impactful steps to ensure American leadership in the development of safe, secure, and trustworthy AI. While there are some differences between Biden’s and Trump’s approaches to AI development, the overarching theme of AI as a national security imperative in the geopolitical competition with China remains a point of continuity and commonality. Rather than unraveling this framework, the Trump administration, upon its return, should consider building upon these elements. Continuity in this strategy would not only strengthen America’s position against China’s AI-driven ambitions but also demonstrate a cohesive and steady approach to technological competition on the global stage. The memo is part of a broader push to shape the global conversation around AI, aiming to establish norms and regulations that counter Beijing and temper down Brussels. For instance, the United Nations earlier this year passed a US-led resolution on AI, marking a pivotal step in the global push to set standards for the technology. And the document builds on a host of previous directives, including the Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, Voluntary AI Commitments, AI Bill of Rights, and the CHIPS Act. For the US, this norm-setting effort is crucial — not only to safeguard its standing as a global leader in AI but also to prevent restrictive policies that could hinder American tech companies' competitive edge in the sector. The NSM’s focus on global competition with China reflects broader concerns about the balance of power in the current 'decisive decade.' China’s AI investments are tied to its 'Digital Silk Road' initiative, aimed at establishing control over global technological infrastructure, including AI-powered systems and digital communications networks. The NSM outlines the US objectives in the material side of technological competition: Diversifying chip supply chains and reducing reliance on traditional hubs like Taiwan while building partnerships with countries like India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Vietnam. A second priority is safeguarding American intellectual property from state-sponsored espionage. These goals have shaped Washington’s approach, as evidenced by the CHIPS and Science Act, which bolstered US semiconductor industries and spurred major progress. At the same time, forging deals like the G42-Microsoft agreement with the UAE, will help protect US intellectual property and foster tech collaboration with key allies. Acknowledging that technological developments will come largely from outside government, the NSM designates the AI Safety Institute as the primary US government point of contact for industry. The Institute will work with national security agencies and promote international cooperation on AI safety standards. It will also evaluate AI systems for national security and public safety implications and guide developers. However, the NSM intentionally overlooked the importance of export and capital controls, which are critical to Washington's strategy of containing China's technological rise and buying time. The Biden administration’s bet is that by creating a cohesive regulatory framework, it can give itself and its allies a critical head start in technology innovation and large-scale deployment of AI in the military and commercial domain. The key to this effort has been aligning export controls with allies like Japan and the Netherlands, which are nations that command essential technologies in advanced chipmaking. Furthermore, in addition to CFIUS's restrictions on investment in sensitive American technology, a 'reverse CFIUS' mechanism targets investments in semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence by restricting certain outbound investments in technology by US persons to China. Any new administration seeks to differentiate itself from its predecessors, and early signs are that is especially true for the incoming Trump team. But there is actually quite a bit of alignment between this NSM and the goals of the Trump administration, given the agreement that China is the greatest threat to the United States. In essence, the NSM on AI mirrors the Trump administration’s own Indo-Pacific Strategy, aiming to create a durable, bipartisan approach to managing technology competition with China. With China advancing AI to expand its geopolitical influence, the United States can’t afford fragmentation. Instead, the new Trump administration should build on the NSM as an essential blueprint, one that merits continuation. Embracing this continuity will ensure America, alongside its allies, maintains its edge in the race for technological supremacy in this defining domain. The AI vision outlined in the NSM reflects Washington's belief that sustained, coordinated efforts are essential to maintaining a competitive edge in the evolving technological landscape and ensuring US leadership in AI, tilting the technological competition with China in favor of the United States. Rather than viewing it as a relic of a previous administration, the new White House should look to build on this framework.

Amid its own war, Israel sending Arrow 3 air defenses to Germany in 2025	An Arrow 3 is tested by IAI. (IAI) JERUSALEM — Even as it relies on its own air defenses to fend off rockets, missiles and drones from enemies in the region — and anticipates a potential new attack from Iran — Israel said it’s preparing to send one of its key air defense systems to Germany, as previously agreed. Last week Israeli and German government and industry officials met for two days at Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), maker of the Arrow 3 high-altitude defense system, where they began coordinating 'joint preparations for the initial deployment of [Arrow 3] on German soil in 2025,' the Israeli Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Nov. 10. Arrow 3, originally developed as a joint project between Israel and the US, is the top layer of Israel’s three-layered air defense system and designed to primarily guard against ballistic missiles, while David’s Sling operates in the middle layer and Iron Dome sits at the bottom, taking out short-range, low flying threats. Though IAI is the Arrow’s prime contractor, the Israeli MoD said Israel’s Elbit Systems and Germany's MBDA Deutschland GmbH also took part in the meeting last week. That Israel would continue with the export of an advanced air defense system while using the same system to defend itself is evidence of Jerusalem’s commitment to its relationship with Berlin, according to Jeremy Issacharoff, former Israeli ambassador to Germany. The progress on the Arrow deal is a 'significant development and progression in the strategic partnership between the two countries,' Issacharoff told Breaking Defense. Prior to the Arrow deal, many of the largest deals between Germany and Israel involved Israel acquiring defense products from Germany, not the other way around, he said. For instance, Israel has purchased submarines and corvette ships to be built by German firms. This has changed in recent years, however. 'Germany’s national security mindset changed when Russia precipitated the crisis with Ukraine, creating a necessity to contend with a dramatically different security environment impacting Germany and Europe as a whole,' said the former ambassador, who left his post in May 2022 just weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 'When we saw what was happening with Ukraine … we passed on a clear message that we remain committed to German national security and would be willing to help in any way we could in providing defensive weapon systems needed in this new environment.' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz poses with senior Israel Aerospace Industrie (IAI) officials in front of an Arrow missile at ILA Berlin Air Show 2024 on June 5, 2024. (IAI) Yaakov Katz, author of the book Shadow Strike and a Fellow at JPPI, agreed that there is a worldwide focus on the need for more missile defense systems. 'Europe is concerned with Russian aggression and threats that they could face on the horizon. Every country today, especially after the last year here in Israel, with Iran’s different attacks by Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas, recognize the need to bolster missile defense systems,' he said. German and Israeli officials originally signed a letter of commitment to the deal for the Arrow 3 on Sept. 26, 2023, for $3.5 billion, just days before Hamas launched the Oct. 7 attack on Israel that drastically changed the security landscape of the Middle East. It sparked a deadly, devastating counterattack by Israel that has claimed tens of thousands of lives in Gaza as well as continuous mortar, rocket, drone and missile attacks against Israel from groups like Hamas, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen and, in two extraordinary cases, directly from Iran. Arrow 3 had its first successful war-time interception on Nov. 9, 2023, taking down a missile launched from Yemen. All the while the German deal was still in motion, and two weeks after the November interception, it was finalized with an estimated late 2025 delivery. Ever since, Israel has pledged to make the delivery on time, as IAI’s CEO Boaz Levy told Breaking Defense in March 2024. The Arrow deal is one of several Israeli deals in Europe for air defense systems, and part of a rapidly growing interest in these systems that have proven themselves throughout a year of war as Israel faces multi-front threats. Finland is acquiring the David’s Sling system, a medium-range interceptor. Slovakia is acquiring IAI’s Barak MX system. The US Marines recently completed a successful live-fire Iron Dome drill. On Nov. 14 reports indicated Greece is also interested in developing an air defense system similar to the multi-layered Israeli system that is anchored in Iron Dome. As for Germany, Issacharoff said, 'The close bilateral relationship between the defense and intelligence establishments of the two countries [Israel and Germany] has been very strong and will in my opinion remain strong. This is exemplified by the agreement for Israel to supply the Arrow 3 missile defense system to Germany.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/amid-its-own-war-israel-to-send-arrow-3-air-defenses-to-germany-in-2025/	2024-11-18T06:29:42-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/09/Product_Gallery_825X515_ARROW3_01-e1663010255599.jpg
Japanese marines to regularly rotate through Australia, as US-AUS-Japan military ties strengthen	Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III, Australian Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, and Japan’s Minister of Defense Gen Nakatani tour Royal Australian Air Force base Darwin, Australia, Nov. 17, 2024. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Tech. Sgt. Jack Sanders) SYDNEY — Against the backdrop of Chinese aggression in the region, the US, Japan and Australia this weekend agreed to closer military ties, including, for the first time, regular deployments of Japanese marines to the Lucky Country. The announcement together during a Sunday press conference in Darwin, US 'Today, we are announcing that there will be regular deployments of Japan's amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade to Australia,' Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles said during a televised press conference in Darwin. 'Today, we discuss the next steps to expand our exercises and training, and Japan's commitment to annual trilateral amphibious training in the Indo-Pacific demonstrates our momentum, including with the [US] Marine Rotational Force Darwin here in Northern Australia. We're also elevating key bilateral exercises into trilateral exercises,' US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said, appearing alongside Australian defense minister Richard Marles and Japanese defense minister Gen Nakatani. Austin is on his first stop of a four-nation swing through the Indo-Pacific theater, marking his 12th and last planned visit here. Rounding out his trip, Austin also has visits to the Philippines, a meeting of ASEAN defense ministers in Laos, and then the first-ever visit by an American defense secretary to Fiji. As part of the agreement, the Japanese will become regular participants in Australia's preeminent annual exercise, Talisman Sabre next year, and they will boost their participation in Exercise Southern Jackaroo, participating in more complex scenarios to increase trilateral interoperability. In addition, local press traveling with Marles said that the expectation is a regular rotation of roughly 600 Japanese Marines alongside the US Marines who regularly are in Darwin. Also, Australian forces will start taking part in Exercise Orient Shield next year and increase their enhanced participation in the traditionally bilateral US-Japanese exercises Yama Sakura, Keen Edge, and Keen Sword. Last year, 7,000 troops from all three nations took part in Yama Sakura, a command post exercise. Marles had signaled the likely commitment in September, when he and Foreign Minister Penny Wong joined their Japanese counterparts Kihara Minoru and Kamikawa Yoko near the town of Geelong for annual talks before heading north to Darwin. Marles represents the Geelong district. In addition to the increased participation in exercises and the regular rotation of Japanese troops, a trilateral statement said the countries 'continue to grow trilateral intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region as a priority, including Australian personnel's participation in the Japan-United States Bilateral Information Analysis Cell (BIAC).' The cell, opened two years ago, is located at Japan's Yokota Air Base and was created to allow the analysis and sharing of highly classified intelligence between the two militaries. This announcement will mean Australia, Japan and the US will be able to more effectively share intel. And Austin said categorically that 'we expect that Japan will join AUKUS Pillar Two at some point in the not-too-distant future to work on specific projects that have yet to be named.' He ticked off areas of R&amp;D cooperation for the three nations such as quantum, autonomy, Collaborative Combat Aircraft and Long Range Strike. There are, Austin said, 'so many things that that we can work together on.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/japanese-marines-to-regularly-rotate-through-australia-as-us-aus-japan-military-ties-strengthen/	2024-11-17T22:01:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/japan-us-aus-scaled-e1731878774116.jpg
Pentagon fails 7th audit in a row, eyes passing grade by 2028	Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller Mike McCord speaks during a press conference presenting the 2021 Department of Defense's audit results, the Pentagon, Washington, DC, Nov. 15, 2021. (DoD/US Air Force Staff Sgt. Brittany A. Chase) WASHINGTON — After the close of business Friday night, the Pentagon released the findings of its fiscal 2024 annual audit. And for the seventh consecutive year, it has failed, though claiming incremental improvements. 'This result was not a surprise, and I know that on the surface it doesn't sound like we're making progress. However, that is not the case,' Michael McCord, the Department of Defense Under Secretary of Defense and Chief Financial Officer, told reporters today. 'I believe the department has turned a corner in its understanding of the challenges, and more importantly, in addressing those challenges, momentum is on our side.' The annual audit is conducted by the DoD’s Office of Inspector General along with an independent public accounting firm that examined $4.1 trillion in assets and $4.3 trillion in liabilities. This year’s report provides opinions on 28 entities ranging from the various services to the Military Retirement Fund — one fewer than last year since Special Operations Command was placed under the consolidated audit. In total, nine entities have so far received an 'unmodified audit opinion,' or clean audit, which is one more than last year. In essence, this means auditors determined that those offices' financial statements were presented fairly and that they adhered to accounting principles. One entity this year has received a 'qualified opinion,' meaning auditors determined there were misstatements, or potentially undetected misstatements, but that those did not adversely influence the financial statements. Three entities still have outstanding audits — the Marine Corps, Defense Logistics Agency’s National Defense Stockpile Transaction Fund, and the DoD Office of Inspector General — so it is readily clear where they will fall. So far, though, the remaining 15 entities received a failing grade, or what are called 'disclaimers' since auditors are not able to determine if the financial statements are accurate. As a result of those findings, the department received a 'disclaimer' opinion, essentially a failing grade. 'Momentum is on our side, and throughout the Department there is strong commitment — and belief in our ability — to achieve an unmodified audit opinion,' McCord said in a press release. What isn’t abundantly clear yet, is if the DoD will achieve a clean audit on all of its financial statements by the end of 2028 — a mandate included in the FY28 National Defense Authorization Act. At the rate it’s going, McCord said that will not be possible. However, if the incoming Trump administration is able to provide audit process continuity and keeps 'getting faster and keep[s] getting better,' it may be obtainable. 'I would not fundamentally change strategy,' he told reporters. 'I would give some deference or lean in direction of keeping telling the team &#8230; doing what they're doing and then adjust at the margins, rather than say we're going to do a bureau-based review and everybody stop while we think about whether we're doing this the right way,' McCord later added. 'I would not recommend that course, myself.' Earlier in the day, the DoD Inspector General released its FY25 Oversight Plan that revolves around six challenges: increasing military readiness; strengthening the capabilities and capacities of allies and partners; protecting defense critical infrastructure, building the future force; improving the quality of life for military families; and bolstering financial management. On the financial side, the oversight office specifically noted concerns with 'inadequate controls over financial data and accounting records,' outdated financial data management systems, and a shortage of skilled workers.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-fails-7th-audit-in-a-row-eyes-passing-grade-by-2028/	2024-11-15T16:53:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/11/6940282-scaled-e1668617393730.jpg
Sub-launched nuclear cruise missile will need ‘an entirely new industrial base,’ warns Navy admiral	The guided-missile destroyer USS Gravely (DDG 107) launches Tomahawk Land Attack Missiles in response to increased Iranian-backed Houthi malign behavior in the Red Sea Jan. 12, 2024. (U.S. Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist 1st Class Jonathan Word) NAVAL SUBMARINE LEAGUE — As President-elect Donald Trump prepares to reenter the White House, a controversial nuclear weapon project launched during his first term is running up against industrial realities that challenge its tight timeline, according to the four-star admiral in charge. But a former Trump official who helped start the program thinks the Navy is exaggerating the difficulties. Intended as a relatively low-yield, submarine-launched weapon counter to Russian and Chinese 'tactical' nuclear weapons, the Sea-Launched Cruise Missile &#8211; Nuclear (SLCM-N) was denounced by arms control activists as destabilizing. The Biden administration attempted to defund it, only to be overruled by Congress. Trump's impending return to the White House can only help the program. Now, however, comes the hard part: actually building the thing. 'It’s a very, very aggressive timeline' to field an 'initial capability' for SLCM-N by 2034, as Congress requires, said Vice Admiral Johnny Wolfe, director of the Navy’s Strategic Systems Program (SSP). 'This is truly a capability we have to build from the ground up,' Wolfe told the annual conference of the Naval Submarine League on Thursday. 'How can I get other players in the game?&#8230; How do we bring this in organically and stand up an entire new workforce and industrial base?' Wolfe said the Navy had established a new program office dedicated to the project earlier this year and has launched in-depth studies of the trade-offs required. 'We’re starting to understand what is it going to take… to stand an entirely new industrial base,' he said. But Wolfe's skepticism was baffling to another key figure closely linked to the SCLM-N program: Robert Soofer, one of the leading architects of the Trump administration's plan for the missile. 'If you’re going to tell President Trump it’s going to take you 10 years to make a new missile, he’s going to go ballistic — pardon the pun,' Soofer, former deputy assistant secretary for nuclear and missile defense policy, said on a call with Breaking Defense. 'He’s going to say, &#8216;We’re going to need another option.'' Soofer said the work should take five years at most, modifying non-nuclear weapons already in service rather than starting from scratch and building new industry capability. 'I guarantee you that the Navy did not object to this the first time around. There wasn’t a peep, there wasn’t a sound, about how difficult this would be for the industrial base,' Soofer said. 'For goodness’s sake, don’t start from scratch!' he said. 'Why can’t we use the latest version of the Tomahawk missile, the Block V?' The original idea for Sea-Launched Cruise Missile &#8211; Nuclear was to simply resurrect the nuclear-tipped variant of the ubiquitous Tomahawk. While the nuclear version was withdrawn from naval service by George W. Bush and retired altogether under Barack Obama, non-nuclear variants of the Tomahawk have been in almost continuous production, with multiple upgrades, since the early 1980s. Now built by Raytheon in both land-attack and anti-ship variants, the adaptable weapon is in use not only on Navy submarines and surface warships, but also with newly developed land-based launchers in the Army and Marine Corps, as well as foreign allies like Japan and potentially the Netherlands. 'We have a missile, a Tomahawk missile, that has been upgraded continuously to the Block V. It’s got the range that we need,' Soofer told Breaking Defense. 'I guarantee you that the labs can put a nuclear warhead on that.' (The 'labs' are the longstanding nuclear weapons facilities at Los Alamos and elsewhere). Wolfe, however, was emphatic at the submariners’ conference that he couldn’t just recreate the Cold War nuclear-tipped Tomahawk. 'We can’t reconstitute that, okay?' he said. 'It’s not that easy.' Why not? Wolfe didn't divulge details, but a Navy spokesperson told Breaking Defense on Friday that the admiral's concern was not about finding a workable nuclear warhead — which is the Energy Department's job, not the Navy's, in any case — but about ramping up production of an appropriate missile. 'Vice Adm. Wolfe was referring to the industrial base required for producing the SLCM-N delivery system when he made that comment, not the warhead portion,' the spokesperson said. 'The requirement to deliver SLCM-N would increase the capacity requirement amongst industry to a level that had not previously been accounted for.' While the Navy didn't say so explicitly, the implication is that industry may struggle to make enough missiles — whether they're Tomahawks or something else — to meet demand for SLCM-N on top of all the other precision munitions the Pentagon is buying. Part of the context here is that US missile manufacturers are already ramping up production to meet the anticipated demands of a conventional war with China, including by US allies like Japan. In addition to standing up the new program office within Strategic Systems, Wolfe said he is reaching out to the Navy’s fast attack submarine (SSN) officers, who have not had to handle nuclear weapons since the 1990s. While Wolfe didn't discuss this aspect and details are classified, SSNs also may not have the same secure long-range communications systems that the larger ballistic missile boats (SSBNs) use to receive and authenticate nuclear launch orders, and the SSN’s tactical role often requires them to enter hostile waters in a way SSBNs do not. A further complication, Wolfe said, is SSP’s full plate of other programs. One is the introduction of a new non-nuclear hypersonic missile, known as Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS), for use by both Zumwalt-class destroyers and fast-attack submarines. (The same missile, with different packaging, will also be used by the Army’s truck-mounted Dark Eagle launchers). Hypersonics will also require building a new industrial base, as well as testing infrastructure, all on a tight timeline, he said. What’s more, as conventional weapons, they are also a sharp departure from SSP’s decades-long laser focus on nuclear weapons. The other SSP priority, however, is right in the organization’s traditional lane: a major upgrade to the mainstay of US deterrence, the strategic, ballistic Trident II D5, which will ultimately go on the Navy’s next-generation SSBN, the Columbia class. Keeping the Trident serviceable and up to date for decades to come is a non-negotiable top priority, Wolfe emphasized at the conference. 'We’re not going to take away from the strategic, Trident deterrent,' he said. 'We can’t hurt other Navy programs — or Air Force programs — as we stand this up.' For the nuclear cruise missile, Wolfe said, 'we are doing the trade studies. &#8230; We are going to continue the dialogue with OSD [the Office of the Secretary of Defense], we’re going to continue the dialogue with the Hill, as we start to understand what would a program would look like.' Soofer was optimistic about how that dialogue would go. 'Johnny Wolfe’s a good man,' he said. If he gets the guidance to shorten that timeline, he can be creative.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/sub-launched-nuclear-cruise-missile-will-need-an-entirely-new-industrial-base-warns-navy-admiral/	2024-11-15T11:24:55-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241115_DVIDS_tomahawk_8198875-scaled-e1731684014664.jpg
After US underestimated Ukraine, DIA developed ‘will to fight’ analysis and is applying it to China	A Ukrainian serviceman smokes a cigaret in a trench at the front line east of Kharkiv on March 31, 2022. (Photo by FADEL SENNA / AFP) (Photo by FADEL SENNA/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The pronouncements in February 2022 were dire. If Russian President Vladimir Putin decided to invade Ukraine, US analysts and officials thought Kyiv would fall within as little as three days. But today, exactly 1,000 days after the Kremlin rolled tanks towards the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv is still standing, supporting a war effort far into the country's east where the battle lines have stubbornly settled. Ukraine's valiant defense of its land, and Russia's largely inept attempt to take it, were certainly welcome surprises in Washington — but they were surprises nonetheless, which means it was also something of an intelligence failure for the 17 organization-strong American Intelligence Community. The chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, whose bread-and-butter mission is estimating the relative might of foreign militaries, said Thursday that one intangible factor threw off the calculations: the Ukrainians' 'will to fight.' 'The Ukrainians &#8230; exhibited a will to fight that was far beyond anything any of us had estimated,' Lt. Gen. Jeffrey Kruse said at an event put on by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance, contrasting Ukraine's resiliency with that of the Afghan armed forces, which collapsed as US-led coalition forces left that Southwestern Asian nation. Kruse, who was the military affairs advisor to the Director of National Intelligence in 2022 and took the DIA helm in February 2024, also noted the quality of the Russian's equipment, the training of individual soldiers and their willingness to share information within their own organization as all factors the US appeared to have misjudged. But it was the 'will to fight' factor that seems to have made the biggest impact on the DIA, so much so that Kruse said his agency is attempting to make the intangible tangible so it can be incorporated into military power reports going forward. 'And so the team went through and built a &#8216;will to fight' all-source tradecraft methodology [to ask] &#8216;What does that look like? How do we assess what that looks like?'' Kruse said. Incoming Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency U.S. Air Force Lt. Gen. Jeffrey A. Kruse provides remarks at the DIA Change of Directorship ceremony at DIA headquarters on Joint-Base Anacostia-Bolling, Washington, D.C., Feb. 2, 2024. (DoD photo by U.S. Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Alexander Kubitza) Kruse said the methodology has been applied to 'several militaries' so far, including the military's top priority, China, though he didn't offer any conclusion on that 'will to fight' analysis. More broadly, elsewhere in his talk Kruse said that the Chinese military did appear to be on track to meet leader Xi Jinping's goal of being able to invade Taiwan within a predetermined timeline should Xi decide to make that drastic move — likely a reference to reports that Xi set 2027 as the deadline for that capability, what's known as the Davidson Window. But, Kruse said, he was less sure China had a plan for what to do after the invasion — for the actual holding of land, for preventing Taiwan's allies from helping and, at the same time, for securing its own borders. 'I'm not convinced that [Xi] is in a place to do all those things just yet,' he said. 'So as you know we're working to make sure we [understand] where that is and, where we can, change the calculus' for Beijing. Back in Russia, Kruse offered an assessment of the surprise movement of North Korean troops to Russian territory — a number 'north of' 10,000 in DIA's estimation. It's a significant number, and one that Kruse said may allow Moscow to conduct an effective counter-attack in Kursk, Russian territory currently held by Ukraine. But, he said, the North Korean troops available might not be the best for the job at hand. 'These North Korean forces are from the 11th Corps; they're special operations forces. They're the best trained within North Korea, but I'm not sure they're up to Russian standards,' Kruse said. 'Special operations forces are designed to do certain things — raids, sabotage, a variety of things — [but] it may not be that they're well designed to go in and be at the front of a mass conventional counteroffensive.' Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's increasingly belligerent actions in the Pacific domain were evidence, Kruse said, of a 'macroshift' he's noticed in recent years, that from a rules-based framework to one in which more countries are willing to use 'raw power' to achieve their objectives. But another macrotrend he highlighted during his keynote address is the shift from a unipolar world to that of a 'multiverse.' Kruse took pains to say he wasn't even attempting to be hip enough to be referencing the multiverse as it exists in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but meant that even more than a shift toward a multipolar world, the influx of mis- and disinformation has created 'information microclimates' — multiple universes of truth. 'Today's information environment, as you all know, increasingly supported by AI, enables the viral growth of information microclimates that can be really hard to break through or change,' he said. 'So deciphering fact from fiction, which is important in the intelligence community, to support decision making and to support warfighters will be a significant hurdle for the foreseeable future.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/after-us-underestimated-ukraine-dia-developed-will-to-fight-analysis-and-is-applying-it-to-china/	2024-11-15T10:14:27-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/04/ukraine_smoking-scaled.jpg
Croatia to procure 6 Bayraktar TB2 drones from Turkey	Bayraktar TB2 performs during third edition of Turkiye's premier technology and aerospace event TEKNOFEST at Cigli Airport in Izmir, Turkiye on September 28, 2023. (Photo by Mehmet Emin Menguarslan/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) BEIRUT — The Croatian government reportedly gave approval to procure six Turkish Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicles in a deal worth $95 million. 'The Armed Forces of the Republic of Croatia expressed the need for priority and urgent procurement of the armed Bayraktar TB2 system, and the company submitted an informative offer and a proposal for the Bayraktar TB2 configuration based on the &#8216;total package' model,' Croatian Defense Minister Ivan Anusic said, according to Turkish news outlet Anadolu Agency. He added that the 'configuration is based on six aircraft equipped with electro-optical cameras for reconnaissance, including the initial set of weapons, and ensures double radio coverage of the entire territory of Croatia in stationary and mobile version.' The deal will include command and control stations, training simulator, ground monitoring and control stations, as well as set of initial spare parts enough to reach 4,000 flight hours. Training on the drones will take place in Turkey and the UAVs will have the necessary maintenance equipment, per the news report. Neither In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Anusic said that decisions 'on historical investments were made in the modernization and equipping of the Croatian Army. Decisions on the preparatory actions for the procurement of the most modern Leopard 2 A8 tanks, the Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial system and the maintenance of Rafale multi-purpose fighter jets were adopted.' Anusic added that the defense budget proposal for 2025 was also adopted, amounting to 1.5 billion Euros. Built by Turkish dronemaker Baykar, the Bayraktar TB2 unmanned aerial vehicle has been used in several recent conflicts, including the Russian and Ukraine war and the Azerbaijan and Armenian conflict. Baykar and the Croatian Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to Breaking Defense's request for comment. The TB2 became tied to Ukraine's fight against Russia, and early into the fight a Ukrainian government-organized song about the UAV had become an international trend.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/croatia-to-procure-6-bayraktar-tb2-drones-from-turkey/	2024-11-15T09:02:03-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/01/240117_baykar_tb2_GettyImages-1694439605-scaled-e1705516003620.jpg
As Air Force reviews ejection seat deal, Collins, Martin-Baker gear up for a fight	During routine flying operations, 144th Fighter Wing pilots and maintainers prepare F-15 Eagles for take off from the Fresno Yosemite International Airport Aug. 14, 2019. (U.S. Air National Guard photo by Capt. Jason Sanchez) WASHINGTON — Seated near a model of Martin-Baker's latest ejection seat design, company executive Andrew Martin looked incredulous. An official at rival ejection seat-maker, Collins Aerospace, had suggested that some Martin-Baker seats weren't as safe as they should be — an unfair claim, Martin said, because it was based on outdated data. 'Why would somebody want to fearmonger?' Martin told Breaking Defense. 'Why would somebody want to put out data and tell pilots, you know, things that are incorrect and give pilots pause for thought, when what they absolutely should be doing is pulling their handle? That's the part that we find slightly irresponsible.' Safety is, of course, the top priority for both ejection seat-makers, as their product is one that's only intended to be used when a pilot's life is in grave danger already. But the comments also come as hundreds of millions of dollars are on the line amid a ticking clock: By the end of the year, the Air Force plans to complete a review of the Next Generation Ejection Seat (NGES) program, whose contract is currently held by Collins. Sometime after that, the service could decide to change its acquisition strategy, potentially shifting the rights to produce ejection seats for hundreds, if not thousands, of US aircraft. To be clear, once the review concludes, the Air Force could still stick with its incumbent acquisition strategy, where Collins is already underway with work on the F-15E. And if the service does change its mind, that might not mean a complete switch from US-based Collins, a subsidiary of defense giant RTX, to UK-based Martin-Baker. A full competition could still lead to Collins emerging victorious, or theoretically result in some split of work between the two companies. But any time there is even the chance to grab market share, the two members of the ejection seat duopoly know they have to go all-in, given the narrow nature of the business. 'There are certain markets that are just a natural for a small number of entrants,' JJ Gertler, an analyst at the Teal Group consultancy, said in an interview. Likening the ejection seat market to hockey resurfacing work, where Zamboni and Olympia products dominate, Gertler noted that specific aircraft tend to use the same ejection seat — a departure from other circumstances, like when different engines could power the same fighter. 'So each contract tends to be all-or-nothing for the ejection seat companies,' he said. It’s unclear how a competition might impact the already-delayed seat plan. For each platform under the NGES effort, 'the Air Force projects a 36-month integration and test program, followed by a 24-month manufacturing lead-time, followed by aircraft modifications,' the Air Force spokesperson said. Asked how a competition could impact that timeline, the spokesperson replied that '[i]nformation gathered from industry in the [August] sources sought notice will inform us on potential impacts to platform integration timelines.' 'It's cheap leverage,' Gertler said regarding the new market research. 'It's a time-honored tactic for putting some pressure on an incumbent vendor to perform better.' The story starts back in 2019, when the Air Force awarded Collins Aerospace a sole-source deal for NGES. But much has changed since then, according to the Air Force spokesperson. First, the Air Force now wants to completely divest the A-10 Warthog — mirroring a raft of other retirements across the service — prompting officials to nix plans to put a new seat in the aircraft. And second, 'significant delays' to integrate new seats in the remaining platforms under the NGES program have prompted the service to re-open the potential for a competition by launching a new round of market research in August. When the NGES deal was awarded, the Air Force reasoned that Collins was the only company effectively able to offer a seat for the program via the firm’s ACES 5, which is separately slated to replace seats in the B-2 stealth bomber and serve as the ejection seat for Boeing’s new T-7A training jet. At the time, Martin-Baker officials say, the Air Force told the company it was going to offer Collins a sole-source contract because Martin-Baker simply wasn't going to meet the requirements the service sought. 'We disagreed violently' with the Air Force’s reasoning, 'but we didn't [protest] that,' Steve Roberts, the company’s head of business development, said in an interview at the Air and Space Forces Association conference in September. Then in 2020, Martin-Baker’s US18E was picked by Lockheed Martin for foreign sales of the F-16, and the NGES effort hit delays. The latter event in particular prompted the Air Force’s recent move to once again survey industry. The Air Force spokesperson did not comment on the exact length of the delays for NGES, but budget documents point to four years of added time for the program. Specifically, fiscal 2019 documents [PDF] projected that a qualification campaign for NGES would run until the fourth quarter of 2023, but FY25 materials [PDF] indicate qualification efforts aren’t expected to complete until the final quarter of 2027. A Collins spokesperson disputed that timeline in an email to Breaking Defense, acknowledging that while there have been delays, 'current qualification efforts[…] are not forecasted to be delayed by four years. The first qualification effort for the F-15 is expected to be completed in late Q2/early Q3 2025,' they said. The company 'is standing by to support qualification for follow-on platforms, including parallel qualification efforts, to support the U.S. Air Force’s schedule,' they added. Meanwhile, there have been some recent hiccups with NGES. The government issued a 90-day stop-work order in July, halting work underway on the F-15E 'while we re-validate the acquisition strategy,' the Air Force spokesperson said. A representative for Collins subsequently told Breaking Defense that the order stopping work was lifted in October. Asked why the Air Force lifted the stop-work order despite the ongoing NGES review, the Air Force spokesperson confirmed the order ended '[a]fter achieving alignment on contractual requirements' for the existing acquisition plan. 'The program office still projects the market research update and acquisition strategy review will conclude by the end of the year,' the spokesperson added. The Air Force spokesperson attributed initial NGES delays to COVID-19 supply chain issues, but said more recent setbacks stem from 'realized aircraft integration risks and misalignment on contractual requirements.' The service 'is focused on developing a safe, reliable, and sustainable new ejection capability for the warfighter,' the spokesperson added. Tech. Sgt.

(U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Emily Kenney) The delays have caught the attention of House lawmakers, who urged the Pentagon in a draft of the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act to evaluate whether the NGES acquisition strategy should be reconsidered. House authorizers additionally called out delays for a separate effort to integrate the ACES 5 in the B-2 stealth bomber. Asked about the NGES program’s setbacks in an interview at AFA, Rob Makros, a business development executive for ejection seats at Collins, told Breaking Defense that 'Safety is first and foremost' for the company. 'Anytime you have any type of concerns with the seat — not saying there were any concerns with the seat, but you have lots of issues that come up that are unforeseen — then you need to take the steps to make sure that you're addressing them,' he continued. He added that the company has a 'tailored approach' to get back on schedule. After the F-15, the Air Force will then move to qualify seats for the F-16, F-22 and then B-1, Makros said. (All four aircraft are equipped with Collins's legacy ACES II seat.) The Collins spokesperson added that the Air Force has removed requirements for the F-15C/D while keeping those in place for the F-15E, and that a contract modification was signed earlier this year 'to include the F-15EX as a qualified platform variant.' Looking ahead, the company is 'prepared to begin work on the NGES F-16 and have the infrastructure in place to support concurrent delivery orders to maintain our customer’s schedule,' the spokesperson said. Regarding the B-2, Makros said the seats for the stealth bomber have been manufactured, but that the planes need to enter their respective depot cycles to receive their new seats. The Air Force spokesperson told Breaking Defense the effort that includes placing a new ejection seat in the B-2, called the B-2 Safety and Sustainment Program, received airworthiness approval in July. Installing the new seats 'must be scheduled based on aircraft availability,' they added. On Oct. 21, the Air Force announced that one B-2 bomber dubbed the 'Spirit of Nebraska' had finished a planned depot stop more quickly than in previous years due to new techniques that sped up work. However, a spokesperson for the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center told Breaking Defense the B-2 in question did not receive the new ACES 5 seats. The Collins spokesperson referred questions on airworthiness to the Air Force, but stated that the company is 'on standby to support installations' for the B-2 fleet. There are only so many Western planes in the world that need new ejection seats at any given time, so contract opportunities often end up as a dogfight between Collins and Martin-Baker. But the idea that Collins could suddenly have to defend its NGES work after having the deal sewn up for five years is leading the company to take a more aggressive public posture. In an email to Breaking Defense, a spokesperson for Collins shared several stats on the company’s ACES seat, including the claim that 'unlike other seats that can have ejection back injury rates as high as 40 percent' — a clear swipe at its rival — 'ACES has an ejection spinal injury rate of less than 1 percent.' Representatives for Martin-Baker, including Martin himself, disputed those characterizations, arguing that Collins was operating with outdated data for seats going back decades. Martin-Baker’s current seats for Air Force and Navy aircraft meet a standard one percent spinal injury rate, said Roberts. 'There are parameters the government will ensure called dynamic response,' Roberts said at the company’s AFA booth, where video of a series of crashes for aircraft like the F-35, which has a Martin-Baker seat, played on loop. 'They make sure that the modern seats meet modern requirements.' Reducing risk of injury to pilots is a key goal of the NGES program, which includes a focus on accommodating a wider range of body types. NGES is also intended to compensate for changes to flying missions like the proliferation of helmet mounted displays — heavy instruments sitting atop a pilot’s head that pose hazards when punching out. Both firms say their seats have made the necessary changes to keep pace with modern demands. The two also say they’ve incorporated other design tweaks, like introducing greater modularity to ease the maintenance process. And as a potential competition looms, the seat makers are making their closing arguments. 'I see it as the Air Force doing their due diligence,' Makros said. 'I am confident that ACES 5, being the gold standard and the safest on the market, is the seat for the Air Force. I believe the Air Force thinks this too,' he said. For its part, Martin-Baker isn’t necessarily trying to unseat Collins as the sole manufacturer for NGES, Martin said. Instead, the company believes the Air Force should take a piecemeal approach at platform integration, opening up the opportunity for both firms to play a role in NGES. 'There's no frustration. There's no animosity. We're all in the life-saving business,' Martin said. 'And I think our message to the Air Force has been, it doesn't have to be winner-takes-all.' But the stakes are higher for Martin-Baker than Collins, Gertler observed. For its part, Collins has a diversified portfolio that includes other products like avionics, and is a division of a much larger aerospace company. Martin-Baker, on the other hand, is a 'pure play ejection seat company,' meaning new ejection seat work is relatively more important. 'So in a way, a new contract for Collins is a very-nice-to-have. A new contract for Martin-Baker is a must-have,' he said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/as-air-force-reviews-ejection-seat-deal-collins-martin-baker-gear-up-for-a-fight/	2024-11-15T07:45:19-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/F-15-scaled-e1731683936418.jpg
Chinese sanctions on US drone firm were ‘signal’ about supply chain weaknesses: DIU official	Soldiers from 5th Armored Brigade, First Army Division West, developed a course of instruction to counter the threat of commercial, off-the-shelf unmanned aerial surveillance vehicles at McGregor Range Complex, N.M., June 28, 2019. (DVIDS) 'As a former American soldier, I don't want Chinese things in the hands of my fellow soldiers. Unacceptable,' David Michelson, director of the autonomy portfolio at the DIU, said Wednesday during a Defense One event. 'I think this is just a signal from the PRC [People's Republic of China] that we are very tightly coupled with certain parts of the supply chain still.' Michelson had been asked about recent Chinese sanctions on the US small drone-maker Skydio over its business with Taiwan, though the company says its only customer in Taiwan is the National Fire Agency. In a blog post, Skydio said it sources components for its drones outside China, but had gotten batteries from Chinese sources — at least until the sanctions cut off that supply. In the Oct. 30 note, the company said it's rationing the batteries it has in stock and is developing other sources. Though Skydio counts the US military among its customers, the US isn't the only nation likely to be reminded of China's influence in supply chains. Ukraine, currently fighting of a Russian invasion, reportedly has hundreds of Skydio drones. More broadly the ubiquity of Chinese components in battlefield tech has long-troubled the Pentagon and American allies. In 2020 the DIU launched its Blue UAS program, a 'holistic and continuous approach that rapidly vets and scales commercial unmanned aerial system (UAS) technology for the Department of Defense (DoD)' in part to ensure parts don’t come from adversaries. Some companies like Lyten, a Silicon Valley battery startup, are already taking steps to avoid future run-ins with Section 154. Lyten announced on Wednesday that it acquired manufacturing assets from Northvolt, a Swedish battery manufacturer. This move will allow Lyten to manufacture up to 175 megawatt-per-hour (one million watts of power for one hour) of Lithium-Sulfur batteries 'to meet growing demand from defense, drone, and energy storage applications,' according to a company statement provided to Breaking Defense. 'The speed of Lyten’s manufacturing expansion represents a timely move to assist the U.S. Department of Defense and the military services in complying with the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which mandates the acquisition of domestic batteries,' Dan Cook, Lyten’s CEO and cofounder, wrote in the statement. The battery conundrum is a timely one, as Michelson said the US needs to seriously invest in drones. 'One of the things we've learned from Ukraine ... is you need a lot. You just have to have a lot, and the volume that we're seeing is just in a very difficult place right now,' Michelson said. 'So the more we can buy, the more that we can field, the more that we can have units have [drones] in their hands and learn, the better and better we're going to get.'

GREMLIN, but no aliens: Pentagon UAP office plans first deployment of new sensor suite	A trail of a group of SpaceX's Starlink satellites passing over Uruguay. The Pentagon is seeing an uptick in reports that mistake Starlink for UFOs. (Photo by Mariana SUAREZ / AFP) (Photo by MARIANA SUAREZ/AFP via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Defense Department today issued its fiscal 2024 report on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP), which once again, finds no evidence of aliens among the 757 UAP sightings documented — but does include a few new details about the Pentagon's mysterious GREMLIN sensor suite designed to detect, track and hopefully figure out what those weird lights in the sky (or under the sea) actually are. The report, issued by DoD's All-Domain Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), covers a total of 757 reported incidents: 485 that occurred between May 1, 2023 to June 1, 2024; and another 272 incidents between 2021 and 2022 but were not relayed to AARO until this reporting cycle. Many of those incidents occurred near military bases or US nuclear facilities, the report adds. AARO says it resolved 118 of the cases as involving 'prosaic objects such as various types of balloons, birds, and unmanned aerial systems (UAS); and another 174 are near to closure for same reasons. 'I want to emphasize that although only a very small percentage of reports to AARO are potentially anomalous, these are the cases that require significant time, resources and a focused scientific inquiry by AARO and its partners,' Jon Kosloski, AARO director, told reporters today. 'It is also important to underscore that to date, AARO has discovered no verifiable evidence of extraterrestrial beings, activity or technology. None of the cases resolved by AARO have pointed to advanced capabilities or breakthrough technologies,' he added. The AARO report, perhaps unsurprisingly, throws cold water on some of the more out-there allegations made during recent hearings in the House Oversight and Accountability Committee — such as claims that the Pentagon has discovered evidence of alien craft and biological material. For example, at a joint hearing of the Cybersecurity, Information Technology, and Government Innovation subcommittee and the National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Wednesday, several witnesses alleged that DoD and the White House are hiding evidence of alien activity, including crashes of extraterrestrial craft, from Congress and the public in top secret programs. (The Pentagon has denied such a concerted coverup.) Most of the cases documented in the AARO FY24 report, as in previous reports, involved objects in the atmosphere reported by civil and military pilots, the report explains. 'Of these reports, 708 occurred in the air domain, 49 occurred in the space domain, and none occurred in the maritime or transmedium domains,' it says. (Transmedium refers to objects that cross domains, such as flying from the atmosphere into outer space.) The report notes that there has been an uptick in cases that involve observers mistaking satellites in SpaceX's massive Starlink broadband constellation for UAPs. 'AARO increasingly receives cases that it is able to resolve to the Starlink satellite constellation,' it says. 'AARO is investigating if other unresolved cases may be attributed to the expansion of the Starlink and other mega-constellations in low earth orbit.' An overview of the GREMLIN network for detecting UAPs. (DoD All-domain Anomaly Resolution Office, Nov. 14, 2024) Aliens or not, the report further provides details about AARO's efforts to improve its ability to detect, track and characterize UAP — including a bit more information about the GREMLIN sensor architecture first revealed by the office last year. GREMLIN is a network of 2D and 3D radar, and long-range electro-optical and infrared telescopes developed by the Georgia Tech Research Institute, the report explains. 2D radar measure range and azimuth (direction); 3D radar measure range, azimuth and elevation of target objects. The report says that GREMLIN 'successfully collected data' during a test in March, and will now be deployed at a 'national security site' for a 90-day 'pattern of life collection.' Kosloski refused to reveal the exact location, although he said GREMLIN already is in place there. 'We'd rather not say exactly where it is, because we want it to be an unbiased test and don't want to invite folks to come and do flyovers and test against the system. We chose that specific location because of the environment. We expect there to be a lot of variety in the types of things that we're going to see. And there had been UAP reports in that general area,' he said. The report further says that AARO is developing a new science and technology plan to outline and address 'the challenges facing UAP detection and identification such as a lack of high quality sensor data and a series of gaps in the scientific knowledge base.' For example, Kosloski said his office intends to increase its engagement with foreign partners to obtain a broader array of sensors, data, and information on UAP. Finally, he acknowledged that Congress has an 'understandable concern' about secrecy surrounding UAP, but explained that the process for lowering classification is complicated because it involves numerous agencies, including from the Intelligence Community (IC). Nevertheless, he added, AARO has 'taken significant steps' to try to speed declassification of what it can release without jeopardizing 'sensitive' information, for example that could reveal IC sources and methods. 'We've hired a number of declassification experts. We're going to be hosting a declassification workshop so we can make sure we're implementing best practices from across the DoD and the IC. All of that takes more time than I think the public would like for it to take. But ARRO is working on it,' Kosloski said.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/gremlin-but-no-aliens-pentagon-uap-office-plans-first-deployment-of-new-sensor-suite/	2024-11-14T13:15:21-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/220830_starlink_sky_streak_GettyImages-1231167449-scaled-e1661980807658.jpg
FAA initiates review of commercial launch rules industry claims throttle innovation, new entrants	A couple views the Starship Flight 3 Rocket a day before its March 13, 2024 launch from the company's Boca Chica, Texas, facility. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) today kicked off a review of its rules for granting commercial space launch and re-entry licenses — rules that when published in 2020 were meant to streamline its processes to accommodate a booming market, but which have been savaged by industry as instead creating unnecessary obstacles and delays. While the FAA rules do not apply to launches by the US Space Force or other federal agencies such as NASA and the National Reconnaissance Office, a healthy and diverse US commercial rocket market is important for keeping down government costs. Further, national security officials in recent months have been fretting about the fact that at the moment, Elon Musk's SpaceX, in effect, has a monopoly on US space launch. For example, SpaceX currently is the only company certified to launch critical payloads under the Space Force's National Security Space Launch Lane 2 program. 'The FAA is seeking to update the licensing rule to foster more clarity, flexibility, efficiency, and innovation,' said FAA Associate Administrator for Commercial Space Transportation Kelvin Coleman in the agency's statement today. 'Making timely licensing determinations without compromising public safety is a top priority.' The FAA's announcement noted that it approved 'a record 148 licensed commercial space operations' in fiscal year 2024, an increase of 'more than 30 percent' over last year. 'The FAA forecasts that number may more than double by FY 2028 and is launching an Aerospace Rulemaking Committee to update the FAA’s Part 450 launch and reentry licensing rule,' it added. The Part 450 launch and reentry licensing rule is primarily focused on ensuring public safety, such as making sure that companies have proper containment measures in case of a launch pad explosion. But it also includes requirements for things like environmental protection. A number of commercial firms, and industry supporters in Congress, have complained bitterly about the rule, charging that it is confusing and is causing severe licensing delays that are harming innovation and US industry's market status. SpaceX in particular has been a vocal critic, especially following the FAA's Sept. 17 announcement that it was proposing to fine SpaceX $633,009 'for allegedly failing to follow its license requirements during two launches in 2023.' That action, which followed an earlier fine and delays in SpaceX obtaining a launch license for testing its giant Starship rocket — which the Space Force is eying as a possible through-space cargo carrier — has led to an ongoing feud between the agency and the company, with Musk threatening a lawsuit in a post on his social media site X (formerly Twitter). Musk now has been tapped by President-elect Donald Trump to co-chair a new 'Department of Government Efficiency' alongside former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to slash bureaucratic red tape. 'It was widely expected that the FAA would begin the process of updating its licensing regulations, and it is something the Trump administration is likely to accelerate. Given the apparent influence of Musk and whatever advisory or formal role he may play in the new administration, we should expect to see much more forward-leaning changes that make it faster and easier for companies to obtain launch licenses,' Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told Breaking Defense today. According to the FAA announcement, the review committee 'will consist of members of the commercial space industry and academia and will focus on nine topics, including flight safety analyses, system safety, and means of compliance.' A report enumerating recommended changes is expected 'by late summer 2025,' which in turn would underpin future rulemaking to legalize reforms, the agency's announcement explained. 'The FAA is reaching out to invite stakeholders to participate, with an initial meeting being scheduled during the first week of December,' it added.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/faa-initiates-review-of-commercial-launch-rules-industry-claims-throttle-innovation-new-entrants/	2024-11-14T12:00:22-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/05/240531_spacex_starship_GettyImages-2081922493-scaled-e1717175941296.jpg
‘Glimpse into the future’: US Central Command plans to fly MQ-25 unmanned refueler	MQ-25 Stingray prototype T1 refuels an F/A-18F Super Hornet in mid-air for the first time BEIRUT — Offering a 'glimpse into the future of naval aviation,' the Navy's MQ-25 Stingray unmanned refueling aircraft is expected to take to the skies over the Middle East, where it will join the MQ-4C Triton UAV that's already there, according to the Navy's leader in US Central Command. 'The [MQ-25] platform will set a new standard for future unmanned operations from the sea,' commander of the NAVCENT and Fifth Fleet Vice Adm. George Wikoff reportedly said this week at the Manama Air Power Symposium. The MQ-25, which is still in development, paired with the MQ-4C will 'provide fleet commanders the most modern detection and collection centers available with open architectures to allow future expansion,' he said. The two unmanned systems will be deployed on board of USS Abraham Lincoln carrier alongside P-8 Poseidon and F-35 lightning fighter jets, according to Wikoff's remarks as reported by National Defense magazine. A Central Command spokesperson confirmed Wikoff's comments. As of April, the Navy expected its first MQ-25s to go operational in 2026, though National Defense reported it could join the fleet in 2025. 'The MQ-25 gives us a glimpse into the future of naval aviation, demonstrating the potential force multiplier advanced uncrewed systems will play in the carrier air wing moving forward,' Wikoff said in Manama. In August the Navy said it had finished the first carrier-based control room designed to operate the MQ-25 aboard the George H. W. Bush, and the next month MQ-25 maker Boeing said it had demonstrated the ability for a crew of a P-8 surveillance aircraft to control the MQ-25 mid-flight.

(US Navy photo by LT Alex Delgado/released) The MQ-4C Triton, which reached initial operating capability last year, is a large, long-range unmanned platform based on the Air Force's Global Hawk. The Navy announced in October that it had established a third 'orbit' of Triton operations within Fifth Fleet's Area of Operations (AOR), after deployments to Guam and Italy. US Central Command's AOR covers Northeast Africa, Middle East, Central and South Asia, and the Fifth Fleet's encompasses the Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman and part of Indian Ocean, a vast expanse that also includes critical chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb and Suez Canal. The MQ-25 will join a host of other unmanned platforms the US has deployed to the Middle East, many of them surface maritime vessels, in a separate effort led by the Navy's Task Group 59.1.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/glimpse-into-the-future-us-central-command-plans-to-fly-mq-25-unmanned-refueler/	2024-11-14T11:09:25-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241114_DVIDS_mq4_triton_8516590-e1731610395723.jpg
Nuclear power for military bases will increase our national security	Twin containment domes, that house the nuclear reactors, clear the morning fog at the Diablo Nuclear Power Plant in San Luis Obispo on August 9, 2024. (Genaro Molina/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images) President-Elect Donald Trump enacted pro-nuclear policies during his first term and has supported an 'all-of-the-above' energy policy during the campaign. At a campaign rally in Michigan on Aug. 29, he stated, 'Starting on day one, I will approve new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new reactors and we will slash the red tape. We will get the job done.' This is exactly the posture needed to meet energy power demands — especially on the national security front, where the threats to energy infrastructure are all too real. We worked with our colleagues at the Pentagon, the Department of Energy and the White House Office of Management and Budget together during our time in President Trump’s first administration to launch several of these efforts, and his campaign comments are a good sign that they will continue going forward. The US Air Force, Army, and Navy, as well as other offices in the Department of Defense have been working on deployment of nuclear energy sources to enhance energy resilience for national security missions. And that progress needs to continue, despite pushback from critics of nuclear power who view any nuclear energy project with suspicion, fear or misinformation. A prime example of this kind of commentary can be found in an Oct. 7 op-ed by Alan J. Kuperman entitled, 'On Army bases, nuclear energy can’t add resilience, just costs and risks' published in Breaking Defense. While we are sure Mr. Kuperman and his Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Project (NPPP) intended to be honest brokers, they provided information that alternates between being incorrect and out of date. Given the likelihood that a new Trump administration continues to support nuclear power for military purposes, we would like to set the record straight. Any discussion on military nuclear power must begin by noting that the Department of Defense has a proud tradition of operating nuclear reactors safely on submarines and aircraft carriers with tremendous benefits for over sixty years. For certain critical missions, the resilience, reliability, and efficiency of a compact, high-power nuclear source is worth the engineering costs expended to reduce risk in contingency environments. With that backdrop, let us address a key part of Mr. Kuperman’s claims, that backup power requirements for the reactors being discussed for military bases would effectively neutralize any benefits gained by using nuclear power. A review of the programs within DoD show that current advanced reactor designs being considered by the Department of Defense may not require backup power. Natural air circulation and convection for heat removal eliminates the need for power driven cooling. For designs that do require backup power, it is a fraction of the primary power produced by the reactor. Further, and more importantly, many of the advanced reactor designs under consideration are inherently and passively safe, using the laws of physics to initiate protections in any conceivable situation. Kuperman also argues that nuclear reactors are an inherently risky target to have on a military base. Certainly, any power source on a base would be a likely target for an enemy striking at it — though we would argue that if an enemy is striking military bases in the homeland, the situation is already about as bad as it would get — which is why its important to note that over the last two decades, nuclear engineers have significantly increased safety in the reactor itself by using molten salts or liquid metals instead of water to cool the reactor. More importantly advancements in nuclear fuel, starting with tri-structural isotropic particle fuel (TRISO), which encloses the uranium in ceramic and carbon-based layers to keep the fuel contained and resistant to corrosion and melting, significantly reduces the concern for a radiological incident if attacked. Kuperman ignores these innovations to scare people about the risk of a wide-spread radioactive event. It’s like arguing about automobile safety today by citing the engineering concerns of a 1959 Corvair. We must acknowledge the role of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to protect human safety, and the innovations in nuclear fuel stability, methods of cooling, and modern reactor construction developed in our National Energy Labs and private industry over the last 5 years. Despite naysayers, it has been an amazing year for the resurgence of interest in nuclear power. Recent decisions by California, Michigan, and Pennsylvania to extend or restart existing nuclear power plants reverses decades of misguided closures that have made our nation more vulnerable to power outages. The private sector is investing billions of their own on reactors to meet the growing demand of digital technologies. Nuclear power provides an alternative to gigawatts of diesel generators and intermittent renewable sources whose varying outputs, according to the North American Electric Reliability Corporation are adding volatility to national electrical grids. Secretaries of Energy representing Republican and Democratic administrations have supported nuclear energy development and deployment, with current US Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm recently stating, 'Nuclear power is America’s largest source of carbon-free of electricity, supporting hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs across the country and will play a critical role in tackling the climate crisis and protecting public health and the environment from its impacts,' The DOE then followed with an updated strategy, Pathways to Commercial Liftoff: Advanced Nuclear report, to support the development of new generations of nuclear power technology. The military, rightly, is following suit. The US Navy just followed the Army’s lead by announcing its exploration of nuclear power for military bases in the mid-Atlantic region. The US Air Force continues its effort in Alaska and is looking for more opportunities to enhance energy resilience with dedicated nuclear reactors. NASA also wants to use nuclear fuel for propulsion and lunar energy. And the progress of Project Pele, a DoD transportable nuclear reactor being constructed at Idaho National Laboratory is real, despite Mr. Kuperman’s assertions otherwise. There should, of course, be a discussion about the challenges and efficacy of nuclear power to meet national security, energy reliability, and sustainability goals for the Department of Defense and our nation. But we can’t let bad information cloud that discussion. The Army is on the right path for interest and investments in the development of nuclear power for its critical bases and industrial activities. They have been carefully assessing developer responses from their June 2024 request, and will be down-selecting a preferred group of vendors in the next 30 days to continue exploration of nuclear power for installations. The service will do its due diligence, and we are confident in the end it will move forward with a smart, careful testing of nuclear power. And when they discover how well those tests work, a whole new frontier for nuclear energy will emerge — for the benefit of our national security.

Germany has given a ‘positive response’ to potential Turkish Eurofighter deal: Official	A German Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jet armed with Taurus long range cruise missiles takes flight (Taurus) BEIRUT — In what would be a key reversal, Germany is apparently coming around to the potential sale of Eurofighter Typhoons to Turkey, according to a senior Turkish official. 'We will acquire 40 Eurofighter Typhoon jets,' Turkish Defense Minister Yasar Guler said during a televised interview Wednesday. 'Germany had been reluctant for a long time, but with the constructive contributions of our NATO allies Italy, the UK, and Spain, they finally gave a positive response.' Those comments came hours before Reuters reported that an unnamed Turkish official claimed the German government had directed its sales authority to work on the potential sale, though he said that didn't mean the process is complete. Germany does not appear to have put out a statement about any change in Berlin's stance, and the German Ministry of Defense did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Breaking Defense. The Eurofighter Typhoon is a European fourth-generation fighter jet consortium comprised of Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and Spain, and is built by Airbus, BAE Systems and Leonardo. If any of the four partnering countries vetoes an export order, the deal is halted, as seen when Germany put a block on the sale of Eurofighter Typhoons to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Gular announced in November last year that Turkey was in talks to buy 40 Eurofighter Typhoons. At the time, analysts told Breaking Defense that the pronouncement could've been something of a gambit, aimed in part at giving Ankara bargaining power in its years-long quest for new American F-16s. In January, the Biden administration gave the greenlight for a potential deal for Ankara to buy 40 new F-16s for $23 billion. 'Turkey’s approach to securing the Eurofighter deal involves leveraging diplomatic relations, with the UK and Spain playing pivotal roles in persuading Germany not to veto the agreement,' Ali Bakir, nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative, told Breaking Defense when the potential deal was first announced. 'However, Germany’s history of imposing restrictions and sanctions on defense deals with Turkey, often under dubious or politically motivated pretexts, remains possible.' Can Kasapoglu, director of defense research at the Istanbul-based Edam think tank, emphasized in November 2023 that a successful Eurofighter deal wouldn’t necessarily preclude an additional F-16 deal. 'Turkish air power has a stopgap trouble up until the indigenous KAAN makes it,' Kasapoglu said. 'The [Eurofighter] can offer some relief, depending on the tranche.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/germany-has-given-a-positive-response-to-potential-turkish-eurofighter-deal-official/	2024-11-14T09:16:01-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/02/eurofighter-typhoon_flight-tests-with-taurus-kepd-350-missile-started_c_j-gietl_copyright-airbus-ds-e1731598143660.jpg
AUKUS partners to stand up electronic warfare intel-sharing framework	Australian Combat Systems Operators and Electronic Warfare sailors manning consoles in the operations room onboard HMAS Anzac during Exercise BERSAMA GOLD 21 in October 2021. (Australian Department of Defence) WASHINGTON — In alignment with its Pillar II priorities, the AUKUS trilateral security alliance is standing up a data-sharing framework dedicated to electronic warfare (EW), according to a Pentagon EW official. 'We are not out there alone, and we share that with our allies and partners, and they also have some pretty exceptional capabilities,' Travis Manning, the US lead for the AUKUS EW working group, said at a Defense One event Wednesday. Manning is also the deputy director of electronic warfare in the Office of the Under Secretary for Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment. The framework will take some time to come together, as the working group plans to iterate through cycles of feedback before going fully online. After these feedback cycles are completed, the nations and their respective military services can decide on how to implement the data-sharing platforms. Manning said that if all goes well, eventually maritime, ground and air units will be able to share EW intelligence with each other 'all in the same place.' Though AUKUS’ goal of sharing EW data on one network does not exist yet, the concept of data sharing between international allies in the Indo-Pacific isn’t new. At the end of last year, the Indo-Pacific Comand stood up the INDOPACOM Mission Network, which is designed to allow warfighters in the region to share data with partners and allies in a zero trust environment. Similarly, as Breaking Defense reported in December, Australia’s top intelligence official revealed then the development of a 'Top Secret' intelligence cloud that is planned to be interoperable with US and UK spy networks.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/aukus-partners-to-stand-up-electronic-warfare-intel-sharing-framework/	2024-11-14T07:06:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241114_aussie_EW_20211016ran8535379_0121-e1731596594417.jpg
Harnessing data to power the future of space domain awareness	Image: Courtesy of L3Harris. For the U.S. security community, space these days looks less like a vast, empty frontier, and more like the Los Angeles freeway system at rush hour. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), about 30,000 objects larger than a softball are currently orbiting Earth, presenting the U.S. military with a massive challenge: How to maintain an advantage in space and safeguard our assets in an increasingly complex, chaotic domain. In fact, the U.S. Space Command has called space domain awareness (SDA) — or the ability to detect, track and identify objects in orbit and predict potential threats — a top priority in upholding its mission to deter conflict and defend U.S. interests. L3Harris is serving as a vital partner in the effort, working to ensure the agency can effectively manage and analyze the vast amounts of data necessary for SDA. L3Harris is the sole vendor contracted on the development and long-term sustainment of the U.S. Space Force, Space Systems Command’s (SSC) Consolidated Operational Data Archive (CODA), a software system that can ingest and translate tens of thousands of data points from commercial and nontraditional sources and compare them against existing information in the Space Force’s Unified Data Library (UDL). L3Harris is responsible for the future development and long-term sustainment of Space Systems Command’s Consolidated Operational Data Archive, an automated system that provides U.S. Space Force operators with access to commercial and non-traditional data sources, expanding the amount of data that can be transformed into actionable information. CODA’s automation capabilities save hundreds of hours of manual labor and cut data processing times from hours to just 3-5 minutes, dramatically improving space operators’ ability to make informed decisions and respond to potential threats in near real-time. CODA was recently approved for an upcoming operational trial period, during which a Space Force operations unit will evaluate the system’s ability to integrate data streams from a commercial provider and the Air Force Research Laboratory’s Wide-Area Search telescope system into a standardized workflow. 'Traditional systems were not designed to handle the volume of data generated by satellites, debris, and other objects, introducing the potential for gaps in space domain awareness,' says Charles Clarkson, Vice President and General Manager, Space Superiority and Imaging, L3Harris. 'With CODA, we’re applying more than 30 years of space domain awareness expertise to give warfighters an advanced tool to detect, track and respond to potential threats faster and more effectively.' A critical contributor to CODA’s success, Clarkson notes, is its integration with commercial technologies to standardize and automate data processing and sharing across systems. For example, it can ingest JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data schemas from the UDL, translate them into one of several primary data formats, and deliver them to the Non-Traditional Data Pre-Processor (NDPP) for operational use – all in a fraction of the time it used to take. 'Enabling these systems to ‘talk’ to one another and work seamlessly together is a huge win for the warfighter,' Clarkson says. 'As operators get more familiar with the system, we’ll develop additional tools to support an even broader range of data, ultimately making space operations even more efficient and secure.' Futureproofing our space domain awareness architecture CODA is part of broader efforts to modernize, operate, and sustain the Space Force’s ground-based SDA sensors. In 2020, the service awarded L3Harris a contract for the Maintenance of Space Situational Awareness Integrated Capabilities (MOSSAIC) program, which built on previous 2020 efforts to maintain and upgrade radar and optical sensors, including the command and control systems that provide timely and accurate SDA data for military, civil, and commercial users. Subsequent option year awards have enabled L3Harris to perform maintenance and upgrades to space domain ground systems, supporting the execution of mission tasks associated with emerging threats. As for what’s next, L3Harris is already looking around the bend. 'As we expand CODA’s capabilities, we’re focused on how we can help warfighters not just respond to current challenges, but anticipate tomorrow’s,' Clarkson says. 'As the Trusted Disruptor, we’ll continue to push the boundaries of what’s possible in ensuring our nation’s space operations remain resilient, secure, and future-ready in an ever-evolving domain.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/harnessing-data-to-power-the-future-of-space-domain-awareness/	2024-11-14T06:51:49-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/26783-Mossaic-Hero-Image-1280x854-FINAL-1.jpg
Could Trump establish a Space National Guard? Officials and experts say it’s likely	US Air Force Staff Sgt. Rhyan Acey performs maintenance on the AN-TSQ-180 Milstar Communications Vehicle July 28, 2021 at the 233rd Space Group, Greeley Air National Guard Station, Greeley, Colo. (US Air National Guard photo by Master Sgt. Amanda Geiger) WASHINGTON — Given President-elect Donald Trump's vocal support, chances for the creation of a Space National Guard are high, according to experts, supporters of the plan and several Guard officials. Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said that there are 'pretty good odds for a Space National Guard,' although its congressional approval 'might have to wait for the legislative cycle.' However, he added, with Republicans soon to be in control of the House and Senate, it is 'hard to foresee any congressional barriers.' One Guard official agreed, noting that Trump in his victory speech vowed he would keep his campaign promises. 'This will be a very easy one to chalk up in his first 100 days, because it's been talked about for so many years,' said the official, who spoke to Breaking Defense on the condition of anonymity. Trump, who established the Space Force during his first term, told the National Guard Association in August that the 'time has come' for a Space National Guard. 'As president, I will sign historic legislation creating a Space National Guard,' he said then. Several supporters of a Space National Guard told Breaking Defense it might even be possible for lawmakers to give the green light in the fiscal 2025 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which is still being negotiated, especially if finalization is pushed until after the inauguration. At the moment, the Senate version of the NDAA supports the Defense Department position to forgo a separate Space Guard in favor of transferring Air National Guard members with space expertise to the Space Force either full or part time, a path opposed strongly by the National Guard and 48 governors of US states and territories. The House version would require DoD to get consent from the governors of the states for the transfers. Neither calls for the establishment of a new Space Guard outright. Given that the two sides differ, experts and officials said, there is scope for pushing through an agreement based on past bills introduced into both chambers, but never voted upon, that would instead approve the creation of a Space National Guard — the House version sponsored by Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo.; the Senate version by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. But timing is up in the air and if Trump's first term is anything to go by, nothing is final until the man himself signs on the dotted line. A second Guard official told Breaking Defense that while space practitioners within the Guard believe that 'the Trump team will push' for a Space National Guard, they also are cognizant that 'the president-elect has many agenda items to pursue.' For that reason, the official said, there unlikely will be any formal pressure put on Trump by the National Guard Bureau. While Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has been a strong supporter of the Pentagon's position against a separate Space Guard both from a cost and personnel view, the service not always been on board. In a March 2021 report to Congress, signed by then-Acting Secretary John Roth and obtained by Breaking Defense, the Air Force endorsed a two-pronged organization to handle the issue of Space Force reservists and Guard service members: a Space Force component that effectively would absorb reservists into active duty status as part-time personnel alongside full-time Guardians as well as a Space National Guard. The report outlined a study of options conducted by the Department of the Air Force (DAF) for a 'Single Component Service (SCS)' conducted from February 2020 to May 2020. That study found that 'a SCS introduced higher complexity, and irreconcilable legislative and policy barriers due to conflicting Title 32 and Title 10 authorities, when absorbing the current Air National Guard (ANG) construct into the new component.' Further, according to the report, the study found 'because the existing ANG space units are solely Guard manned and equipped, it would result in an unacceptable level of risk to USSF mission execution as analysis estimated most members in the ANG space units would not volunteer to transfer to the new component, creating an immediate gap in capability, and a cost to rebuild mission capability. Moreover, the Space National Guard (SNG) provides crucial and immediate access to the State Partnership Program, enabling USSF's ability to rapidly build partner capacity.' However, following the decision by the White House Office of Management and Budget to reject a Space National Guard announced in September 2021, the Air Force in April 2024 released to Congress a new study that supported the White House position.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/could-trump-establish-a-space-national-guard-officials-and-experts-say-its-likely/	2024-11-14T04:54:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/04/Air-Nat-Guard-space-exercise-scaled-e1714406537877.jpeg

(Anduril photo) WASHINGTON — Defense tech startup Anduril Industries and legacy dronemaker General Atomics have both completed a key assessment of their designs for the Air Force’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, a service official said today, paving the way for both companies’ drone wingmen to take to the skies next year. 'We've just finished up, basically, critical design review for both Anduril and General Atomics. Both industry teammates are on the path to get to first flight in a timeline that allows us to get operational capability by the end of the decade,' Air Force Col. Timothy Helfrich, senior materiel leader for the advanced aircraft division of Air Force Materiel Command, said during an event hosted by the Mitchell Institute today. 'We are on on track, if not ahead, in some areas,' he added. The CCA program aims to initially field roughly 1,000 of the drone wingmen that are expected to fly and fight alongside Air Force aircraft, like fighter jets. The service expects the drones to be operational by the end of the decade. After beating out aerospace giants Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman in April for the current CCA contract that will fund drone prototypes from the two companies, Anduril and General Atomics have started the manufacturing process for their respective drone wingmen designs. Anduril is offering a drone dubbed Fury, whereas General Atomics is pitching Gambit, which the company says is a modular system that draws from the firm’s work for the Air Force’s Off-Board Sensing Station program. After the prototyping phase, whose first flight is expected next year, the Air Force could choose to carry one or both of the vendors into production. Officials have also floated the possibility of selecting a different vendor for production that did not win the prototyping contract. There will be other opportunities to join the CCA program ahead as well, as the service plans to launch a second tranche in fiscal year 2025. Service officials have stressed the CCA program will act as a pathfinder for a new way of doing acquisitions, and an Anduril executive noted that the design review process reflects that approach. The CCA program doesn't necessarily follow 'traditional' steps like standard acquisition milestones, the executive said, meaning that the successful design reviews announced today are more of a rough equivalent to a CDR. (A CDR essentially verifies the maturity of a system's design.) 'I wouldn't necessarily say CDR. I would say that we have matured design to a critical point where we feel confident that it's moving forward,' Diem Salmon, Anduril vice president for air dominance and strike, told reporters on the sidelines of the Mitchell event. 'Fabrication is moving very quickly, and it's getting to the path where we're going to be able to integrate and support first flight that is more or less around the corner,' Salmon added. C. Mark Brinkley, a spokesman for General Atomics, said in a statement to Breaking Defense that the company is 'pleased to be on this path and proud of our work. Completing this design review for our CCA is one more step toward a new future in global defense aerospace and reflects more than a decade of investment, ingenuity and innovation.' The company’s CCA design is still 'on-track' for first flight in 'mid-2025,' Brinkley added. Several different efforts are feeding into the CCA program, including an experimental operations unit (EOU) that is exploring how to employ the drones in combat. In a separate event in Washington today hosted by Defense One, Air Force acquisition chief Andrew Hunter stated that the service now plans to buy more prototypes from Anduril and General Atomics to properly equip the EOU, but he declined to comment on the quantity.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/anduril-general-atomics-drone-wingmen-clear-critical-design-review-air-force-says/	2024-11-13T14:50:07-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/2024_Fury-Painting-scaled.jpg
From firing generals to limiting women in combat, Hegseth hints at possible Pentagon shakeup	Pete Hegseth hosts FOX News Channel's 'Fox &amp; Friends' All-American Summer Concert Series outside Fox News Channel Studios on May 31, 2019 in New York City. (Photo by Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — 'Going sideways' is how Fox News host and National Guard veteran Pete Hegseth, announced last night as President-elect Donald Trump’s choice for Secretary of Defense, recently dubbed the state of the Pentagon. The pick of Hegseth, who lacks extensive experience in the defense or foreign policy sector, caught many off guard, prompting a slew of questions about how he might approach the job overseeing the military and its over $800 billion budget. While a host of questions remain, Hegseth recently filmed an episode of the Shawn Ryan Show that dropped just five days ago. There, while promoting his new book, 'The War on Warriors: Behind the Betrayal of the Men Who Keep Us Free,' he offered a peek at possible priorities in the Pentagon’s top civilian post. Here are five key takeaways, in the prospective Pentagon chief's own words. One of Hegseth’s chief bones of contention, spread throughout the interview and seemingly the focus of his book, revolves around military 'woke shit' like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. One solution? A firing spree that starts with Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Air Force Gen. CQ Brown, who still has three years remaining in his term. 'First of all, you got to fire the chairman [of the] Joint Chiefs, and…obviously you’re going to bring in a new Secretary of Defense. But, any general that was involved – general, admiral, whatever –&#8230; in any of the DEI woke shit has got to go,' he said. 'Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it, that's the only litmus test we care about.' 'You gotta get rid of DEI and CRT [critical race theory] out of military academies,' Hegseth added. 'You're not training young officers to be baptized in this type of thinking.' Notably, the Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that the Trump administration is considering creating a board that would fire a number of three- and four-star general officers viewed as too invested in DEI issues, while both Politico and the Washington Post have raised the possibility that Brown would be removed from his position as America's top uniformed officer. When asked if he liked women in combat, Hegseth quickly said 'No.' However, his position appeared to become more nuanced as the interview went on. Women pilots? They have his support. But women in more 'labor intensive' jobs, they do not. 'I love women service members who contribute amazingly,' Hegseth said. 'Because everything about men and women serving together makes the situation more complicated, and complication in combat means casualties are worse. 'SEALs, Rangers, Green Berets, you know, MARSOC [Marine Forces Special Operations], infantry battalions, armor, artillery &#8230; I'm talking about something [where] strength is a differentiator,' he later added. 'Pilots? Give me a female pilot all day long. I got no issues with that.' Women have only been allowed to serve in all military capacities since the start of 2016. However, they are required to pass the same physical requirement as their counterparts. More broadly, Hegseth hit at the idea that the military has moved too far away from its traditional recruitment base. 'There aren't enough lesbians in San Francisco to man the 82nd airborne,' he said. 'And in trying to cater to that, they lost the boys from Tennessee and Kentucky and Oklahoma, the traditional dudes who did it because they wanted, they loved their country, or they wanted the adventure, or they, you know, wanted to try tough things, or they need an up and out of their community, whatever it is they're like, if I want to do the woke crap, I could go to the local community college or local college.' In 2023, the Pentagon renamed nine bases that had been honoring Confederate generals. On the campaign trail, Trump vowed to switch all the names back, and Hegseth is seemingly onboard with that plan, calling it a mistake of former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley. 'Suddenly, after George Floyd…after defund the police, it became faddish to insinuate that the military ranks are infected with racists, that it's all these white nationalists under the radar, the tattoos just waiting to pop up, and ultimately, on the recruiting side, what you've done is you Bud Lighted yourself.' Switching the names back may not be that easy, however, as Congress may weigh in. For the past six years, Hegseth said, he has been a 'recovering' neoconservative who now looks down on the 'foolishness' of US military interventions around the globe. In almost every case, he asserted, they have 'created something worse.' In retrospect, he added, that laundry list includes two spots he served in — Iraq and Afghanistan. And while Hegseth didn’t use the podcast to broadcast just how he would reshape military operations around the globe, it won’t be advising on counterinsurgency operations. 'The hubris of the Pentagon is that they want to now tell other countries how to do counterinsurgency based on what we did in Iraq and Afghanistan,' he said. 'Are you kidding me? So you really have learned nothing.' And any notion of sending US troops to Ukraine, would be a hard pass for him. 'The trust there that our political leaders or our generals would have our best interest of mind, is totally broken. Totally broken,' Hegseth said. 'I acknowledge that completely, and the last thing I want is my son deploying to the Donbas to defend eastern Ukraine.' When discussing the war in Ukraine — which Hegseth described as 'Putin's give me my shit back war' — he expressed skepticism about the idea that supporting Kyiv is needed to keep Russia from moving into NATO territory. 'I've friends who would probably agree with us on most things. They're like, well, if you don't stop them in Ukraine, then he's going to go all the way to Poland,' Hegseth said. 'I don't think he's — I mean, maybe in a perfect world where he had unlimited capabilities and he could crown himself King of Europe, he would [invade elsewhere.] I think he probably knows enough to know that is probably not going much further in Ukraine. And I don't think he's a suicidal maniac who's hell bent on bringing an Armageddon through nuclear warfare.' 'So if Ukraine could&#8230; defend themselves from that great but I don't want American intervention driving deep into Europe and making [Putin] feel like he's so much on his heels that then he does have to, because early on, he was talking about nukes.' However, his views on Ukraine may be more nuanced than the interview shows. According to the Kyiv Post, Hegseth in the past has criticized the Biden administration for being slow to arm Ukraine, and in 2022 described Putin as a 'war criminal.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/from-firing-generals-to-limiting-women-in-combat-hegseth-hints-at-possible-pentagon-shakeup/	2024-11-13T12:25:12-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/hegseth-scaled-e1731528223195.jpg
Satellite communications: A roadmap for securing tactical and strategic missions	The path to Nirvana has many stages in certain religions, not unlike some programs in the defense world such as satellite communications where construction of a resilient space architecture across orbits will require a staged expansion over many years. 'In addition to applying resiliency to existing waveforms or leveraging geosynchronous, MEO, or LEO orbits, what we are truly driving toward is that Nirvana state where we are able to provide any and all different communications means to the commanders so that they're able to fight the fight and build out their PACE plan or their primary alternate contingency and emergency communications,' said John Anglin, Chief, Technical Management Div., PM Tactical Network, Army PEO C3T, speaking during a recent Breaking Defense webinar. 'Through experimentation as well as the relationships that we formed with division commanders to understand [how] each unit in their theaters are fighting in different ways and have different needs. We need to build that network in a way that provides flexibility and is modular, scalable, secure, and definitely simple. The ability for soldiers to rapidly make changes to the network, to support and operate over any and all of those paths at the same time is truly what we're driving towards.' Anglin and other SATCOM experts discussed how to address those challenges, both tactical SATCOM and strategic SATCOM for the nuclear command-and-control mission, in the Breaking Defense webinar entitled: Cybersecurity Across Domains for Multi-Domain Operations. Besides Anglin, two other panelists participated in the one-hour webinar, which is now available on-demand. They were: Katherine Coens, Futures Branch Chief, Military Communications &amp; Positioning, Navigation, Timing PEO, Space Systems Command; and Bonnie Triezenberg, Senior Engineer, Rand. Amongst other topics, Coens discussed how Space Systems Command is viewing the challenge. 'In terms of the military SATCOM architecture, everything is very much in flux and on the table right now. There's a lot of different trades that we have to look at and make. One of the things that we're certainly looking at very closely is what industry is doing. The government is good at some things, but in terms of innovation, industry is second to none. 'The more diversity we have in terms of spectrum and in different company systems that we can use independently and in conjunction with each other, the more resilient we'll be. We have to find that balance point between a system that we can make work, but also give us the max resiliency.' For her part, Triezenberg examined some of the lesser known but vitally important SATCOM challenges. 'If you look at INDOPACOM and the Pacific region, you quickly realize there's a lot of ocean out there to be covered. You’ve got a lot of people cutting across wide oceans and they'd like to have communications. We really don't have a lot of SATCOM [and] we cannot cover the entire ocean with communications right now. Instead what you end up is sort of corridors of communications, and that's a limitation that an adversary could exploit.'

US, Canada, Finland ink joint MOU, latest step in high north-focused ICE Pact	Ice floes surround the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy in the Arctic Ocean on July 29, 2017. The cutter is the largest icebreaker in the Coast Guard and serves as a platform for scientific research. (Photo by Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images) WASHINGTON — Officials from the United States, Canada and Finland today signed a joint memorandum of understanding, the next step in the trilateral high-north focused ICE Pact initiative, one of the Biden administration's last, big foreign policy efforts. The resources in the Arctic are 'vital to the economic, national and homeland security of the United States and our allies,' Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said today at a ceremony held at DHS's headquarters. Mayorkas was flanked by Jean-Yves Duclos, Canada's minister of public services and procurement; Willie Rydman, Finland's minister of economic affairs; and Amos Hochstein, a special advisor to President Joe Biden. 'Ceding these reserves and the batteries, semiconductors, magnets and energy resources that are derived from them to our adversaries in Russia or to our rivals in the People's Republic of China, could soon lead to higher prices at our gas pumps and on our heating bills,' he continued. 'It could jeopardize the readiness of our armed forces. It could compromise the security of our computers, cars and cell phones, and in a crisis, it could subject us to Russian or Chinese largesse in order to access essential goods like food and medical supplies, among many other risks.' The new memorandum has four elements, according to a DHS statement, calling for enhanced information exchange between the three countries, workforce development collaboration, engagement with allies and partners, and research and development. 'Today, we're taking the next step under that agreement, the joint memorandum of understanding we're signing today will develop world-class Arctic and polar icebreakers through the exchange of knowledge and resources in each other countries, equally importantly, that will create more good paying jobs in the United States, in Finland and in Canada,' said Duclos. The new memorandum follows an announcement made by the three countries' leaders during the NATO summit earlier year where they announced the plan to work together to develop and build advanced Arctic icebreakers using the economic might of the American defense industrial base combined with the niche shipbuilding skill sets of the Canadian and Finnish workforces. RELATED: ICE Pact: Why The US Had To Recruit Help In Race With Russia, China For Arctic Icebreakers The need for such a collaboration is critical, as Breaking Defense previously reported, Russia is the world's leading producer of icebreakers, and Mayorkas cited comments from President Vladimir Putin made just last week when he welcomed one of his fleet's newest ships. 'President Putin told assembled shipbuilders that, quote, strengthening the nation's icebreaker fleet is crucial to our plans for Arctic development and boosting cargo traffic,' the secretary said. Finland's Rydman, whose country is credited as one of the most skilled builders of icebreaking ships in the world, said Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also shifted how Helsinki and other capitals must view the Arctic. 'Previously, the Arctic and its fragile environments offered untapped business potential to be realized in a sustainable way. But as said, now, our concerns are different,' he said. 'Current geopolitical situation means that we must be able to operate in the polar regions to maintain peace and stability, without which there is no or limited room for new, faster shipping lanes, nor the sustainable exploration of raw materials.' In practical terms, Finland's expertise in building icebreakers will potentially translate into significant cost savings for both the United States and Canada. Jason Moyer and Rickard Lindholm, associates at the Washington, DC-based think-tank the Wilson Center, recently wrote that building an icebreaker in Finland would be approximately 'a fifth of the price' compared to the United States and could be 'completed in about 24 months after a contract is signed.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-canada-finland-ink-joint-mou-latest-step-in-high-north-focused-ice-pact/	2024-11-13T09:57:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/icebreaker-healey-scaled-e1723496380361.jpg
Pentagon announces 4 drones, loitering munitions now under Replicator	US Deputy Secretary of Defense Kathleen Hicks (Photo by Drew Angerer/AFP via Getty Images) This story was updated on 11/13/2024 at 1:10pm with additional comments from Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks's office. WASHINGTON — The Pentagon confirmed new details about its Replicator initiative today, including that two existing Army small drones have been picked for it, along with loitering munitions and an Air Force drone prototype already under development. Since Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks launched Replicator in August 2023, details about what’s included have been sparse, and many included systems will 'remain classified' like low-cost, long-range strike capabilities and maritime systems, the Pentagon announced today. However, it confirmed that four aerial weapons, either already bound for troops or in design, now fall under the initiative. For example, in September the Army selected two drones for its Company-Level Small Uncrewed Aircraft System program — Ghost X from Anduril Industries and the C-100 from Performance Drone Works. Both are now under the Replicator-1, Tranche 2 umbrella. 'Ukraine has demonstrated the value of small, attritable drones on the battlefield,' Army Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George said in today’s announcement. 'The delivery of commercially available Company-Level Small UAS with support from the Replicator initiative will allow American soldiers to rapidly experiment, learn and innovate with these systems.' The Marine Corps’s Organic Precision Fires program, which revolves around Anduril’s Altius-600, is also now being deemed as a Replicator initiative, as it 'complements' AeroVironment’s Switchblade-600 loitering munition already under the initial Replicator tranche. The Air Force’s Enterprise Test Vehicle (ETV), a drone prototyping competition, is also joining the Replicator pack. In June, the Air Force and Defense Innovation Unit selected four companies to compete for a program that aims to field a drone prototype capable of being produced cheaply and at scale that can also serve as a test bed for new subsystems and materials. 'The ETV's modular design and open system architecture make it an ideal platform for program offices to test out new capabilities at the sub-system level, reducing risk, and demonstrating various options for weapon employment,' said Vice Chief of Staff of the US Air Force Gen. Jim Slife. 'We are excited to be a part of Replicator 1.2 and to increase the speed of the ETV effort.' Hick’s team has been on the hunt for existing service programs that can be rapidly scaled, looked at more than 500 commercial firms’ hardware and software solutions, and awarded more than 30 deals. And now that those four new initiatives are under Replicator, Pentagon spokesperson Eric Pahon explained that the department will be using additional funds to accelerate their production and speed up deliveries. 'The key here is applying high-level, enterprise-wide attention, to eliminate bureaucratic barriers and use our funding and authorities to put these systems into the hands of our warfighters at greater scale and speed,' Pahon wrote in an email to Breaking Defense. Observations out of the war inside Ukraine, in part, provided the Pentagon with a blueprint for how cheap, commercially-made drones may be used to overwhelm an adversary. Then in August 2023, Hicks launched Replicator with the first initiative resulting in two tranches of small aerial and maritime drones. By September 2024, plans for a second Replicator initiative were announced, this time focusing on finding systems to counter small drones at US military installations across the globe. 'I am confident the Replicator initiative will complement and advance the significant C-sUAS [counter small unmanned aerial systems] work already underway in the DoD,' Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin stated in the memo. 'The expectation is that Replicator 2 will assist with overcoming challenges we face in the areas of production capacity, technology innovation, authorities, policies, open system architecture and system integration, and force structure.' Austin charged Hicks with seeking new project funding in the upcoming fiscal 2026 budget request and fielding 'meaningfully improved' counter-drone capabilities within 24 months of receiving money from Congress. However, with a new Trump administration coming into power in January, it is unclear whether Replicator will remain a priority.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-announces-4-drones-loitering-munitions-now-under-replicator/	2024-11-13T08:48:24-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/08/GettyImages-2160730520-scaled-e1723040734514.jpg
Australia narrows $10B AUD frigate competition to German, Japanese firms: Reports	HMAS Parramatta arrives at Henderson Shipyard in Western Australia to begin her Anzac Midlife Capability Assurance Program (AMCAP) upgrades. (RAN) SYDNEY — As it scrambles to double the size of its surface fleet, the Labor government here reportedly has made its first major decision in the $10 billion AUD ($6.6 billion USD) competition to build 11 frigates, picking a German and a Japanese company in the downselect process. Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) and Germany's ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems (TKMS) are through the first gate, leaving South Korea's Hanwha Ocean and Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) and Spain's Navantia in the cold, according to news reports here. A spokesperson for the Australian Department of Defence declined to comment on the reported downselect, but told Breaking Defense the department 'continues to enhance the size and lethality of Navy’s surface combatant fleet, as directed by Government in February 2024, and is progressing the acquisition of Australia’s general purpose frigate by engaging with exemplar platform nations and tenderer.' The narrowing of the competition was first reported by the Australian Financial Review last week. The government has directed the companies not to discuss the program with the press. The General Purpose Frigate program (Sea3000) was created as a result of recommendations in the Defense Strategic Review. To some Australian observers, the German offering is the most favored because the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is familiar with German shipbuilders and its MEKO A-200 ships have a modular design, allowing integration of Australia's CEA radars and SAAB's 9LV combat management system, which is used on many Australian naval platforms including the ANZAC and Canberra classes. The existing ANZAC class fleet of nine is comprised of older MEKO designs. Meanwhile, the Mitsubishi Mogami 30FFM has an excellent reputation in many quarters, but Japan has never exported a major combat system of this complexity. In a rare disclosure relating to Sea3000, RAN chief Vice Adm. Mark Hammond said in August that 'base crews of 90 to 100' are set to staff the future ships, or 120 personnel when helicopters are deployed. However, at least one defense analyst is skeptical the new frigate fleet plan is the best choice for Australia, because of the limited number of Vertical Launching Systems (VLS). 'In my opinion, we need to maximize bang for buck. So maximum firepower combined with advanced sensors and combat systems really matters,' said Malcolm Davis of the independent Australian Strategic Policy Institute. 'Both the Hunter-class future frigates (which have now become larger in displacement than some cruisers) and these GP Frigates contenders have limited VLS cells, with these vessels only having 16 cells.' In other Australian defense news, Boeing Defense Australia was granted the authority Tuesday to produce the first locally manufactured parts for Australian F/A-18F Super Hornets. The Military Production Organization Approval (MPOA) authority makes Boeing the fourth company to receive such approval. It can now produce avionics, electrical and mechanical appliances, electrical, wiring and structural harness parts, as well as military display equipment, communication systems and components for the E-7A Wedgetails, P-8A Poseidons, C-17As, F/A-18F Super Hornets, EA-18G Growlers, Chinooks, EC135-T2+ helicopters and the AH-64E Apache. Davis said this appears to be a parallel to the Guided Weapons and Explosive Ordnance (GWEO) enterprise, designed to boost Australia's domestic capacity to build and matin long range precision strike weapons and the fuels that power them, he said. 'It contributes to Australia having the means to sustain and support the F/A-18Fs locally, and perhaps support US F/A-18Fs operating out of Australia,' he said. 'It would make sense to establish new servicing and support infrastructure along similar lines with GWEO.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/australia-narrows-10b-aud-frigate-competition-to-german-japanese-firms-reports/	2024-11-13T07:04:45-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/08/230816_aussie_anzac_RAN-e1692193702615.jpg
EXCLUSIVE: How the Pentagon (quietly) spent $1 billion of inflation relief money	A view of the Pentagon with financial charts in the background. (Graphic Breaking Defense, original images via Getty) WASHINGTON — When inflation soared in the wake of the pandemic, the defense industry emphatically warned the Pentagon of a problem: Climbing prices had begun pushing key projects across the military well past their planned budgets, raising the risk of those programs coming up short. So industry turned to Congress for a bailout, and lawmakers obliged. As part of the fiscal 2023 spending deal, Capitol Hill earmarked approximately $1.05 billion to offer relief to a range of projects across the Pentagon for 'revised economic assumptions.' And then, for much of the public, the money dropped off the radar, as selected projects were bundled in a trove of reprogramming documents [PDF] submitted to lawmakers with largely no explanations given for why, or how, those programs were selected. But a previously unreported document sent to Congress and obtained by Breaking Defense, along with new interviews with Pentagon officials, analysts and industry figures, reveals how the Defense Department determined which high-priority programs were worthy of the taxpayer aid — and what would happen if they didn’t get it. 'At the end of the day, we had a good bit more than a billion dollars’ [worth] of people who had their hand up,' DoD Comptroller Mike McCord told Breaking Defense in an interview at the Pentagon. 'So we had the Army, Navy [and] Air Force, who have most of the contracts, also identify priorities from their perspective of what they thought the worst problems were, which was helpful for us.' Of the 68 total projects selected for relief, 13 received over $10 million, 35 received between $1 million and $10 million, and the remaining projects were awarded less than $1 million. The top five programs by dollar amounts pulled in three quarters of the $1 billion pot, infusing cash into large-scale purchases of platforms like ships, fighter jets and helicopters. The leading recipient of relief was the Navy’s Constellation-class frigates, built by Fincantieri Marinette Marine, at a combined $310 million. That included two different pools of money: $222.8 million to cover expenses for ships FFG 62, 63 and 64, as well as a second $86.8 million payment for FFG 65. Todd Harrison, a defense budget expert at the American Enterprise Institute, noted that one reason shipbuilding topped the list was likely because of the peculiarities of naval procurement. 'You can’t buy half a ship,' Harrison said. 'Once the cost goes up, if you don't have the full amount, you can't order it.' In second place was the Air Force’s new F-15EX built by Boeing, which received $154.4 million to help procure the fourth production lot of the fighter jet. In third was the Navy’s Expeditionary Sea Base (ESB) program, whose prime contractor is General Dynamics NASSCO, which was allocated $107.4 million to finance shortfalls in ESB 7 and ESB 8. NASSCO’s John Lewis-class fleet replenishment oiler nabbed the fourth-place spot, garnering $102.4 million to spread across T-AO 206, T-AO 207, T-AO 208, T-AO 209, T-AO 210, T-AO 211 and T-AO 212. And rounding out the top five recipients was the Army’s AH-64E Apache attack helicopter, also made by Boeing, which received roughly $93.9 million to help purchase five additional aircraft. An analysis of program justifications shows the Pentagon viewed different forms of rising prices in the chaotic post-COVID environment as qualified examples of inflation, from the cost of materials to labor market competition driving wages up. 'This isn't just about value, it's about national security,' Harrison said regarding the inflation relief. 'Congress appropriated money to buy these weapons systems in these quantities for a reason, and we want to make sure that the quantities are actually bought that were deemed appropriate by Congress.' How the Pentagon spent more than $1 billion in inflation relief funding, by program, according to a 2023 DoD Comptroller report. (Graphic by Breaking Defense) Congress set aside the $1 billion-plus in inflation relief in Section 8121 of the fiscal 2023 defense appropriations bill, but not without some consequential caveats. The money had to be disbursed that fiscal year, for instance, a challenge since a continuing resolution had pushed the start of the spending period back three months. Also, the funds could only be spent on procurement and research initiatives. 'I would have loved to have been able to do it a little differently, maybe, but with the time constraints and the criteria, the people who showed up' — and met the Pentagon’s requirements — 'got a little more than other people did,' McCord said. According to an Air Force spokesperson, McCord’s office reached out and asked each of the military services to provide candidates for relief, with the understanding that funds had to be used by the end of FY23. McCord’s office then 'determined the final allocation between Services,' the spokesperson said, who in turn provided the relief funds to their specific programs. (Representatives for the departments of the Army and Navy did not respond to questions from Breaking Defense by press time.) One critical factor in the process was whether contracts were previously negotiated with provisions to raise prices in the case of inflation, according to McCord. Many programs in the Pentagon’s inflation report, as well as examples in reprogramming documents, cite increases under economic price adjustment (EPA) clauses — contractual arrangements that enable industry to raise prices when costs increase. EPA clauses also empower the government to negotiate lower prices in the event costs fall. 'The contract needed to be structured in a way that an inflation adjustment was payable,' McCord said of programs eligible for relief. 'They had a contract that had contemplated a problem like this.' With inflation mostly staying low since the 2008 recession, McCord posited that many defense companies had not sought out contracts with clauses that would protect against a sharp upswing in costs prior to the pandemic. Such clauses, like EPA provisions, are regularly written into shipbuilding contracts due to the oscillating price of raw materials like steel that can greatly affect the cost of the ship — a key reason why several of those programs carried the day in terms of raw dollars. '[T]heir contracts were written in a way that was very amenable to identifying price escalation,' McCord explained. 'And some contracts just are not written that way.' However, the EPA issue wasn’t a dead end: A provision in the FY23 defense policy bill enabled the Pentagon to simply modify existing contracts to provide them more money, even if they didn’t have clauses like EPAs, according to the Air Force spokesperson. That is how the B-21, Northrop Grumman’s new stealth bomber, was able to take advantage of $60 million in relief funds previously disclosed by the company, though it’s not clear what other programs may have benefited from the same process. Northrop referred questions to the Air Force. The change in the FY23 NDAA further directed that primes could apply for relief themselves or seek it on behalf of their subcontractors; subcontractors could apply directly too. But how much money filtered down to subs from the primes is difficult to identify. Under Secretary of Defense Comptroller Mike McCord speaks during a press conference presenting the 2021 Department of Defense's audit results, the Pentagon, Washington, D.C., Nov. 15, 2021. (DoD photo by U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Brittany A. Chase) The Pentagon’s inflation report identifies specific programs that received money, though it rarely tracked exactly how inflation relief was spent on the program, where it ended up in the supply chain and who, ultimately, benefitted the most — largely because the Pentagon doesn’t necessarily know, according to McCord. 'We don't have the visibility to say, if I gave Lockheed or Boeing $10 million, how much of that flowed to a small business,' he said. 'I would have liked to have had perfect information to know how much of this billion dollars went to small businesses. But in terms of straight from us to a small business, it wasn't a large amount, unfortunately, [or] as much as we would have liked.' (Boeing declined to provide a comment for this story.) Breaking Defense reached out to the prime contractors whose programs received a total of $10 million or more in inflation relief, as well as all companies otherwise mentioned in this story. By and large, those companies declined to provide specific data on how much relief funding was accepted by the contractor and how much filtered through the supply chain. In some cases, like a $9.4 million award for Freedom and Independence-class Littoral Combat Ships (LCS), payments appeared to be straightforward EPAs to prime contractors to account for rising costs of factors like labor and materials. In such examples, the relief likely moved through a tangled web of primes and their suppliers that can include other major businesses as well as small mom-and-pop shops. In other cases, prime contractors may not have even played as prominent a role in the inflation relief process. For example, the Pentagon’s report cites soaring costs of government furnished equipment (GFE) for the Constellation-class frigates — something prime contractor Fincantieri has little, if any, control over. The document specifically calls out GFE like the Aegis combat system built by Lockheed Martin, suggesting that much of the spending for the Constellation program ultimately went to Lockheed, not Fincantieri. And like in the LCS example, it’s not clear how much of that money may have gone to Lockheed’s major partners and subcontractors on Aegis. Fincantieri spokesperson Eric Dent confirmed the company did not receive inflation relief for the GFE on the Constellation-class, though he referred further comment to the Navy. On the Freedom-class LCS, which Fincantieri builds, Dent referred questions to Lockheed, which is the prime contractor. A Lockheed Martin spokesperson said that the company is 'regularly monitoring inflationary risks in active and future contracts so we can continue affordably delivering for our customers,' but referred specific questions to the Defense Department. Austal, which builds the Independence-class, did not respond to a request to comment. Only a tiny fraction of the total relief — $9 million — was awarded directly to small businesses, according to the Pentagon’s report. How the Pentagon spent more than $1 billion in inflation relief funding, by service, according to a 2023 DoD Comptroller report. (Graphic by Breaking Defense) In many cases, documents say the money functioned as a way to restore DoD’s buying power back to expected levels. For example, rising prices for RTX’s Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) meant that the Air Force needed an additional $13.6 million or would otherwise be forced to buy 14 fewer copies of the high-demand weapon, according to the Pentagon’s report. (The contract mechanism used to seek the relief isn’t clear, and RTX declined to comment.) Documents suggest ongoing contract negotiations got a boost from the inflation relief pot as well. In the case of the Apache, the Pentagon’s report cites the 'timing of negotiations' with Boeing for the attack helicopter’s multi-year contract. Boeing’s contract negotiations with the Pentagon for the F-15EX also benefited from the relief: Based on prior cost growth in the program, the Air Force anticipated Boeing’s forthcoming proposal for the fighter jet’s fourth production lot would result in the service only being able to afford 21 of 24 expected jets. For a few projects, the relief funding helped protect nascent research and development efforts, such as a $5.6 million award for the Off-Board Sensing Station (OBSS) drone for the Air Force. In justification documents, the Pentagon said officials would not be able to complete flight demonstration of the platform without more funding due to higher labor and material costs eating away margin on the program — explicitly listing several subcontractors who would be provided relief in the process — which is viewed as a key effort that will feed into the service’s Collaborative Combat Aircraft endeavor to build drone wingmen. OBSS prime contractor General Atomics declined to comment directly on the inflation relief and referred questions to the Pentagon. The levels of inflationary impact varied based on the root cause of the cost increases, with some programs stating that certain costs had ballooned by more than half. The Pentagon’s report cites a 49 percent increase in container costs for 155mm munitions, which ultimately spurred a $300,000 award. (155s are made by multiple contractors, and it’s not clear who the prime may have been in this case.) A total of $62.4 million was provided for the Armored Multi-Purpose Vehicle program, led by prime contractor BAE, due to a projected 50 percent increase in material costs, the report says. And justification documentation for the ESB, where General Dynamics NASSCO is the prime contractor, cites a 134 percent growth in the price of steel, 54 percent growth in long distance trucking and 47 perfect growth in copper. General Dynamics referred questions to the Navy. BAE Systems referred questions to the Army. In order to vet industry’s claims of rising prices, contracting officers would evaluate revised pricing proposals 'under standard cost and pricing procedures to ensure the cost was fair and reasonable,' the Air Force spokesperson said. One of BAE's two AMPV varients on the show floor at AUSA 2024, this one sports the company's Modular Turreted Mortar System. (Brendon Smith / Breaking Defense) Industry ultimately viewed the $1 billion relief fund as a critical damage reduction measure, but one that couldn’t completely mitigate the $110 billion loss in buying power caused by inflation from FY21 to FY23, said David Norquist, a former deputy defense secretary and comptroller who currently is president of the National Defense Industrial Association. (NDIA was one of the organizations that advocated for inflation relief to be injected into the FY23 budget.) 'From the point of view of industry, you didn't solve the problem, but it certainly helped key programs and particularly their supply chain,' Norquist said. 'It was a step in the right direction. And when you're dealing with Congress, you always appreciate when they take the step in the right direction,' he said. 'There's never enough time or money to solve everything. And the answer is, that's okay, we do what we can.' RELATED: Tired of being ‘shock absorber’ on inflation, defense industry wants new protections: AIA chief Richard Loeb, an adjunct professor of government contract law at the University of Baltimore School of Law and former official at the Office of Federal Procurement Policy, said that while much of the relief process reflected standard business practices, taxpayers should be vigilant about whether dollars were handed out carefully and with good judgment in cases where programs may have gotten inflation relief due to the special congressional carveout. 'I think that there's a heightened concern that we don't just turn fixed-price contracts into cost-type contracts,' he said. 'The parties chose a fixed-price contract, and now basically they're saying, because they're losing money, they want it to be cost-type,' he said. 'The big issue, I would say, is we're engaging in risk-shifting' in cases where the carveout could be applied. Harrison argued that the inflation relief did not adequately cover all Pentagon programs and that the fiscal environment forced some efforts to cover rising costs 'out of hide,' which in turn would require another round of targeted inflation relief issued in the form of a supplemental spending package. Still, he didn’t view such a package as likely to succeed. 'The appetite for trying to help the defense industrial base catch up from inflation, I think that may have passed,' he said. Loeb, Harrison and Norquist also agreed that the experience would likely shape contracting practices going forward. 'I definitely see [contracts] using more EPA clauses,' Loeb said. That trend, he added, should cause the Pentagon to scrutinize whether it would be more appropriate to use cost reimbursement-type contracts instead of fixed-price contracts in certain instances. The high inflation of the last few years, and industry’s attempts to ameliorate the issue, 'adds another variable to all of these contract negotiations, where the companies either have to seek this kind of a clause added to their fixed-price contracts or companies simply have to factor in the risk on their own,' Harrison said. 'So I think that's going to be at the forefront of people's minds now when they're negotiating contracts.' Norquist added that while top Pentagon acquisition officials such as Bill LaPlante, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, understand the pressures that industry is under, contracting officers sometimes simply do not have the budget to build in inflation protection clauses that reflect the risks that defense contractors are facing. McCord acknowledged the relief funding wasn’t a panacea for industry, but stressed that much of the defense budget — from the topline established by the White House to the final appropriations approved by Congress — remains out of the Pentagon’s direct control. 'As we work through the budget, we work internally to fix problems where we can move money around. And then, when the [congressional] committees give us an opportunity, we go to them with some problems,' McCord said. 'But the more well-defined our problems are, and the more scope, the better we do.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/exclusive-how-the-pentagon-quietly-spent-1-billion-of-inflation-relief-money/	2024-11-13T05:15:33-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/241111_inflation_main_img_FINAL.png
Tiltrotors will change CONOPS for Army aviation, bring 'step-change' to industry	Bell's FLRAA provides the Army with expanded options for maneuver, including significantly increased mission efficiency and a reduced number of flight hours to accomplish missions. (Bell photo). The significance of introducing the tiltrotor – a brand-new aircraft type for the Army fleet, in this case the Bell V-280 Future Long Range Assault Aircraft – from the point of operations, support, and training, will be a true step-change for both the service and the industrial base. Breaking Defense discussed FLRAA status, how the industrial base is stepping up, and new strategies around MOSA, intellectual property and data rights for FLRAA’s long-term weapon system sustainment with Ryan Ehinger, senior vice president and program director, FLRAA Future Long Range Assault Aircraft/V-280 Valor at Bell. Breaking Defense: The Army recently announced that FLRAA achieved Milestone B and has entered into the next phase of development. What work is being done during this phase? What does the Army require in order to continue advancing the program? Ryan Ehinger: Milestone B is a major step in the acquisition process and is a precursor to engineering and manufacturing development (EMD). The government and industry collectively have done a tremendous amount of work over the last decade to reduce risk and inform the requirements, and the current EMD phase is all about further maturation of the digital models, finalizing engineering hardware and software designs, maturing the sustainment artifacts, and driving toward a successful weapon system critical design review as the next major program milestone. It is during this phase that we ensure across-the-board alignment and finalization of the design as we transition into manufacturing and test of the FLRAA prototypes. The FLRAA program was identified as a pathfinder program in terms of how we leverage and expand the application of the digital environment and digital engineering. This has provided new opportunities for collaboration and insight for the government as the design matures and helps ensure that industry gets the necessary feedback early in the design phase to yield good long-term outcomes for the weapon system. We have seen that Bell has selected several companies across the defense industry to support FLRAA development. How will Bell leverage its industrial partners as it enters the EMD phase and starts to work on program deliverables? We have and there are more selections in process. We look at it as a partnership with like-minded industry teammates committed to the Army acquisition and sustainment goals. Bell takes a lot of pride in the internal vertical integration of many key components and final assembly, but it is a team of industry leaders spanning many layers of the supply chain that complete the weapon system. All parts are important, and each supplier should feel the weight of program success on their shoulders and an accountability to the warfighters who need this affordable and sustainable capability. We are all working together in EMD, developing myriad systems and components in parallel for integration into our models and assembly and test against the requirements set. With Bell's FLRAA, industry is at a unique time where a truly new weapon system is being created that leverages the latest in manufacturing technology to yield improvements in affordability and quality. (Bell photo). What is the significance of introducing the tiltrotor – a brand-new aircraft type for the Army fleet – from the point of operations, support, and training? From an operations standpoint, the tiltrotor provides unsurpassed speed and range relative to the enduring fleet. This provides the Army with expanded options for maneuver, including significantly increased mission efficiency and a reduced number of flight hours to accomplish missions. The benefit of the tiltrotor’s unique combination of vertical lift, speed, and range has been a differentiator in both combat and humanitarian operations. From a support and training standpoint, the tiltrotor systems – drive systems, rotors, airframe structure, and hydraulic, for example – should be familiar to existing rotorcraft maintainers. They are integrated in a different way than traditional rotorcraft with significant on-board health monitoring to optimize maintenance action. Digital engineering has allowed us to drastically improve the link between the original engineering source of truth and the maintenance data. These new digital tools further improve system-specific training, maintenance, and record keeping. What does tiltrotor production at FLRAA scale mean to the U.S. industrial base, not just Bell’s supply chain but the broader, global base? New start aviation programs occur infrequently and the barriers to entry to incorporate new manufacturing technologies on existing platforms can be high. The ability to provide the upfront non-recurring effort to produce a clean-sheet tiltrotor at large scale using the latest in digital engineering, manufacturing, and scaled automation advances the U.S. industrial base. This advancement incorporates new and more efficient methods of engineering, manufacturing, and inspection that weren’t available almost fifty years ago when the enduring fleets started their production. This step-change in capability provides the global supply base with the opportunity to realize affordability, lead time, and quality improvements while establishing a new manufacturing foundation which the program can build upon during its production life-cycle. Our industrial base, when looking through the multiple tiers, extends from small businesses to large businesses and across many states in the U.S. as well as partner nations. This distribution reduces overall program supply chain risk, allows for healthy competition, and oftentimes dual-sourcing strategies. FLRAA is a clean sheet design, leveraging new manufacturing technology and digital engineering. Do you see this impacting the industrial base and supply chain? How? Absolutely. As an industry we are at a unique time where we can create a truly new weapon system leveraging the latest in manufacturing technology to yield improvements in affordability and quality. Part of this is due to the advancement in machinery, as well as how the digital thread and software has matured to allow fewer steps in the transition from engineering to manufacturing to assembly and inspection, all leveraging the same source data and reducing the opportunity for defective data. The industrial base is advancing to embrace this and, from a supply chain perspective, those that are able to thrive in this environment of model-based definition and maintain the integrity of the digital thread are at a clear advantage. How does the Army view manufacturing quality within the supply chain for FLRAA? Is it different from enduring platforms? From an industry perspective, I think there is an entirely rational expectation that we have learned from decades of past production on previous platforms and have adapted both designs and processes for improved quality. We have to capture the lessons from the past, learn from them, and address them. The clean sheet design and modern manufacturing allows us to incorporate these changes from day one through design using efficient manufacturing processes, more automation, and more repeatable processes. We validated a lot of this on our V-280 Valor technology demonstrator and continue to do so in our Fort Worth, TX, Manufacturing Technology Center ahead of FLRAA production. The Army has developed some new strategies around MOSA, intellectual property and data rights for FLRAA’s long-term weapon system sustainment. How do you see this impacting the industrial base? I think some see it as a significant shift and are working through how that may affect previous business models. It’s important to remember, though, that maximizing the operational availability of our weapon systems and ensuring they are affordable to procure and sustain is critical to national security. We can optimize to both support the warfighter and have a healthy industrial base. With some of these new initiatives, suppliers that are able to provide the best value in a competitive environment will do well and suppliers that fail to adapt will see fewer opportunities. A key element of this requires collaboration between industry and government to really understand associated intellectual property and data rights, what is needed for long-term organic sustainment, and how industry can help facilitate that. Customers are rightfully passionate about their ability to sustain their platforms over the long term. MOSA is going to be a big game changer in terms of enabling affordable upgrades to mission systems and I am pretty excited for FLRAA to be a leader in the adoption of those principles for both hardware and software. How involved is the Army with the sub-tier supply chain and industrial base? The depth of the industrial base to support aviation platforms is remarkable. At the same time, every tier provides critical contributions to both the quality of the final product as well as the security of data used in getting to that final product. Customer interest in the supply chain at all tiers is high, as the impact of all tiers on their weapon system can be high. What are your thoughts on supply chain risk management and what are you focused on in terms of top risks? Supply chain risk management is key to a healthy production line. Aviation component lead times are long and requalification/switching costs for making changes mid-production are high. If a supplier has a track record of poor quality, poor schedule performance, financial instability, lack of resilience when faced with a dynamic world environment, or lack of accountability, what should be expected going forward? We have had good success with teammates and suppliers on our program that understand we all contribute to long-term program success and collaborate and communicate early and often to ensure that we meet commitments.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/tiltrotors-will-change-conops-for-army-aviation-bring-step-change-to-industry/	2024-11-13T05:13:46-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/lead-scaled.jpg
Trump to nominate Pete Hegseth, Fox News host and Army Guard vet, for defense secretary	Hosts Katie Pavlich and Pete Hegseth on 'FOX &amp; Friends' at Fox News Channel Studios on May 27, 2022 in New York City. (Photo by Roy Rochlin/Getty Images) WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump said today he intends to nominate Fox News host and Army veteran Pete Hegseth as his secretary of defense, one of the most powerful positions in the incoming administration. 'With Pete at the helm, America’s enemies are on notice — Our Military will be Great Again, and America will Never Back Down,' Trump said in a statement. Hegseth, currently a co-host of Fox News's 'Fox &amp; Friends Weekend', was an infantry captain in the Army National Guard and served in Afghanistan, Iraq and at the US outpost in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, according his Fox News biography. During his service he was awarded two Bronze Stars and a Combat Infantry Badge, the bio says. Hegseth is the author of several books, the most recent of which, 'The War on Warriors', extolled the 'kind of men prepared to face the dangers that the Left pretends don't exist,' according to a Fox News summary. In his statement, Trump said the Princeton graduate 'will be a courageous and patriotic champion of our &#8216;Peace through Strength' policy.' The Hegseth announcement is the latest in a string of Trump proclamations and news reports concerning senior officials he plans to bring into his administration. Earlier today Trump said he wanted John Ratcliffe, who served during Trump's first term as the Director of National Intelligence, to lead the CIA and Rep. Tim Waltz, a Republican from Florida, was tapped to be White House national security advisor.

Pentagon invests another $160 million from CHIPS Act to boost semiconductor manufacturing	A microchip developed jointly by the Air Force Research Laboratory and American Semiconductor. 'America's military systems are the most capable in the world, and that would not be possible without advanced semiconductor technology,' Arati Prabhakar, assistant to the President for Science and Technology and director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, said in a Nov. 8 Pentagon press release. The Microelectronic Commons is a network of technology hubs that has since grown to about 1,200 universities, private companies and other organizations from 35 different states, plus Washington, DC. It’s designed to spur the development of a domestic microelectronics manufacturing industry. Most of the new funding, $148 million, will go directly to the eight hubs spread across the country, which include: The $148 million will go toward 'building infrastructure, supporting operations, and accelerating workforce development across the eight established hubs,' the release read. Another $10 million will back a 'Cross-Hub Enablement Solution' that will enable the hubs to share access to critical Electronic Design Automation, software and hardware services that help develop electronic systems, and cloud computing tools, per the release. Another $2 million will go toward a prototype project list for the Silicon Crossroads Microelectronics Commons Hub. 'The Microelectronics Commons aims to enable lab-to-fab prototyping, evolving microelectronics laboratory prototyping to fabrication prototyping in domestic facilities,' Dev Shenoy, principal director of microelectronics for the Pentagon said in the release. 'More specifically, the goal is a national network of regional innovation hubs distributed across the U.S. that will foster a pipeline of domestic talent and innovative ideas, reduce barriers to innovation, and mature emerging microelectronics technologies.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/pentagon-invests-another-160-million-from-chips-act-to-boost-semiconductor-manufacturing/	2024-11-12T12:27:40-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/4046791-scaled.jpg
UK ‘needs’ GCAP future fighter to counter growth of Russian and Chinese stealth jets: Air Chief	The new GCAP next generation fighter concept is based on a delta wing design and increased wingspan for improved aerodynamics (BAE Systems) BELFAST — The UK Royal Air Force (RAF) must press forward with the multinational Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP) to deliver a next generation fighter jet if it wants to take a stand against the 'proliferation' of Russian and Chinese stealth aircraft, according to the head of the service. The joint British, Italian and Japanese effort has been the subject of uncertainty in recent months after UK Armed Forces Minister Luke Pollard refused to make a long term commitment to it on grounds that doing so could 'prejudge' the outcome of a new strategic defense review, set to report in mid-2025. Since Pollard's comments, the Financial Times reported that over the 'coming weeks' the Labour government will formally green light the multibillion-pound project. Government ministers have already agreed to such a decision, the publication said last week. In another boost for the project, Italy's parliament approved the country's continued participation today. 'The proliferation of stealth capability through the likes of the Chinese J-20 or the Russian Su-57 as well as increasingly long range air-to-air weapons like the PL-15 Thunderbolt, mean that we also need to be planning for the next generation capabilities now; that is why we need GCAP,' Air Chief Marshal Richard Knighton, RAF Chief of the Air Staff, said during a speech on Monday held by the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) — a UK defense think tank. 'GCAP is very deliberately being designed to complement and enhance the capabilities of F-35, not replace it, but we also know that even a force of F-35 and GCAP will need to be augmented by what we call Autonomous Collaborative Platforms [ACPs] to defeat the threats that we see emerging.' The GCAP fighter jet is planned to replace British and Italian Eurofighter Typhoons as well as Japanese F-2s, with a service entry date of 2035. It is also expected to operate alongside ACPs or adjunct aircraft, similar to US Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA). Additionally, GCAP industry partners are committed to flying a crewed, supersonic and low observable aircraft demonstrator within four years. Under the previous Conservative administration, London committed £2 billion ($2.55 billion) to GCAP out to May 2025. Knighton's support for GCAP comes on the heels of BAE Systems unveiling a new concept of the future crewed fighter jet, based around a conventional delta wing design and distinguished by an increased wingspan compared to previous iterations. &quot;Satisfaction with today&#39;s parliamentary approval of Italy&#39;s participation in the Global Combat Air Programme. The #GCAP is an ambitious project for the development of the 6th generation fighter aircraft in cooperation with the #UK and #Japan. It will be fundamental in ensuring… &mdash; Ministero Difesa (@MinisteroDifesa) November 12, 2024 All industry partners are 'steaming ahead' with design activities of the next generation fighter, Herman Claesen, managing director of Future Combat Air Systems at BAE Systems told reporters at the Farnborough Air Show in July. He added that the next engineering milestone for GCAP is a systems requirements review, directly supporting planning for launch of a development phase next year. Knighton did not share any comments relating to industry progress, other than to reconfirm that the RAF is on course to receive a first 'operationally useful' ACP 'before the end of the financial year.' The UK has not said which ACP it has selected specifically, but it will be a Tier 1 or disposable type, in line with comments made by Knighton to the Defence Committee [PDF] in February. At that time, he said that a focus on Tier 1 was based on assessment of costs against operational benefits. London also expects to operate a 'suite' of ACPs by 2030, according to its ACP strategy [PDF]. The RAF is targeting acquisition of ACPs to sit alongside GCAP and F-35 jets as a way of increasing combat mass and allow crewed platforms to be less vulnerable to attack. Such is the focus on the effort that London wants to see the air vehicles flying regularly alongside crewed fighters 'as part of a national or coalition force' by the end of the decade. 'This high-low mix of platforms will provide the cost effective way of delivering the combat mass we still need to win against the ever improving enemy,' said Knighton. 'With multiple nations such as the US, Australia, Japan, France, Germany, actively investing in their own versions of ACPs, now is the last safe moment to commit to an ACP if we're to retain a lead and seize the initiative as well as the market.' The UK has still to settle on an ACP budget. 'The exact level of resource to be allocated is yet to be defined,' states the strategy document, while the RAF's ability to 'rapidly' bring new drones into service took a knock when a lawmaker revealed in March that 216 Squadron, stood up in 2020 to specifically test and experiment with uncrewed aircraft, had yet to carry out a single drone test.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/uk-needs-gcap-future-fighter-to-counter-growth-of-russian-and-chinese-stealth-jets-air-chief/	2024-11-12T11:21:08-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/1721595970093-e1721613189775.jpg
Waltz reportedly in as Trump’s national security advisor, SecDef position remains a question mark	U.S. House of Representatives, The Hon. Mike Waltz attends the 2024 Concordia Annual Summit at Sheraton New York Times Square on September 23, 2024 in New York City. (Photo by Riccardo Savi/Getty Images for Concordia Summit) WASHINGTON — In the week since the US presidential election, a second Trump administration appears to be taking shape — with one key national security slot seemingly wide open. Over the last couple days reports emerged that President-elect Donald Trump is eyeing Rep. Mike Waltz, a Florida Congressman, as his White House national security advisor. Trump also reportedly plans to nominate Florida Sen. Marco Rubio as his Secretary of State and South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem as Homeland Security secretary. Waltz served in the Army as a Green Beret and, according to his bio, saw tours in Afghanistan and elsewhere. He also worked in the Pentagon during the Bush administration, before founding a defense services firm called Metris Solutions, which won some contracts for training Afghan special forces. Metris was acquired by PAE in 2020. Waltz won his current seat in the House in 2018, and has held positions on the House Armed Services Committee, as well as the foreign affairs and intel committees. In public statements, he has styled himself China hawk, a trait he shares with Rubio — a sign that under a Trump administration, there will likely be no backing off of the idea that China is the 'pacing threat' for the US military. During a September event at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Waltz issued support for the creation of a maritime czar — a single individual inside the executive branch whose authorities span across maritime issues related to both the Defense and Transportation Departments. As national security advisor, that idea may come to fruition. Additionally, Waltz was one of two cosponsors of a 2023 effort to authorize the use of military force against Mexican drug cartels. In a campaign policy platform, Trump pledged to 'use all resources needed to stop the Invasion — including moving thousands of Troops currently stationed overseas to our own Southern Border.' Trump also reportedly had discussed sending special forces operators into Mexico to target cartel leaders. In a note to investors, analyst Byron Callan of Capital Alpha Partners said Waltz’s appointment may have 'mixed implications' for defense spending. 'His views on China could be positive, but those on cartels, Ukraine aid, and DoD ‘waste’ may entail nuances for defense contractors to wade through in 2025 and beyond,' Callan wrote, noting an April HASC hearing where Waltz pushed on waste, fraud and abuse issues. Meanwhile, the race for secretary of defense appears wide open. Three leading names in defense circles have all been struck from the list: Waltz, taking the NSC job; former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who was ruled out by Trump; and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who took himself out of the running and is now expected to be named chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee. On the Senate side, it is expected that Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., will take over the Senate Armed Services Committee chair. Wicker is the architect of a plan to dramatically increase the defense budget to five percent GDP, with a $55 billion increase in FY25 alone. While that plan appeared dead on arrival under a Democratic administration, it may receive more support from a Trump White House. Wicker’s plan would raise all munitions production to maximum rates unless stocks are already above the required level, and call for the creation of alternate production lines to surge short-term capacity. It would also reform the Defense Production Act with updated authorities — which are not specified — and execute a $5.2 billion backlog of DPA projects on microelectronics, castings and forgings, and biomanufacturing. In the area of missile defense, the Defense Department should field the Guam defense system as soon as possible, reverse its decision to cancel the SM-3 Block 1B interceptor, and surge existing production lines for interceptors 'while exploring optionality in other systems like NASAMS, FrankenSAM, and others,' a summary of the plan states. The plan recommends a list of service-specific priorities, calling on the Navy to improve the health of the shipbuilding industrial base so it can deliver a 355-ship fleet — with Wicker’s proposal even laying out a path to get to to 357 ships by 2035. It includes reforms to get submarine builders to three Virginia-class attack subs per year and the creation of a 'large scale industrial base program' for surface combatants, which would cost $20 billion over five years. The Navy should also accelerate its buy of unmanned underwater vessels and surface drones, and use multi-year procurement to buy amphibious ships. Wicker’s plan states that the Air Force should buy at least 340 more fighter aircraft over the next five years and 'at least double' B-21 bomber procurement, currently set for 100 planes. It also directs the Air Force to begin a rapid acquisition program for the E-2D Hawkeye instead of buying the E-7 Wedgetail. The Army should 'adopt lessons war in Ukraine,' and field new air defense and counter-UAS units, the plan says. It should also accelerate the development of long-range munitions and command-and-control technologies for operations in the Western Pacific. Meanwhile, the Marine Corps needs to make 'major' investments in technologies to enable sophisticated contested logistics and accelerate its Force Design 2030 plans.

Trump’s defense secretary should focus on internal Pentagon challenges to meet external threats	Seal of the Pentagon on display at the Pentagon visitor center. (Photo by Trevor RaneyDigital Media Division) As the Trump administration begins the process of forming its government and assuming the presidency, one of the most consequential decisions will be selecting the next secretary of defense. This person will be charged with the immense responsibility of leading two million uniformed military members and nearly 750,000 civilian employees across the globe. The secretary of defense is really three jobs rolled into one. The first is that the secretary is a global leader, travelling the world to advance US national security and guiding combat and non-combat operations 24/7 in all domains. The second is that the secretary is the largest employer in the United States, leading one of the most complex organizations ever assembled, with a budget of over $850 billion per year. Lastly, the secretary is the principal assistant to the president in all matters relating to the Department of Defense and serves on the National Security Council. The 'to-do' list on day one for the incoming secretary will be staggering, with two ongoing wars, an aggressive China, and the responsibilities of working with the president on crafting the National Security Strategy within the National Security Council process. These will undoubtedly be the most urgent tasks, drawing the secretary towards jobs number one and three above. If the incoming defense chief does this, they will be following a well-worn path of outsourcing the management of the Pentagon to the deputy secretary of defense. This, however, would be a substantial mistake. The most urgent and strategically important job that the secretary must personally be involved in is the management of the department, the second job mentioned above. Our military is in its most perilous shape since the end of the 1970s: Woefully behind in utilizing existing technologies, sized for one-short war which our adversaries are willing to take advantage of, and burdened with an acquisition process and programs that cost billions to deliver hand-crafted weapons that cannot be manufactured to scale and often do not even work. Finally, if that is not bad enough, the military is short of people, and a coming demographic cliff is going to exacerbate this problem right at the time we need to project strength to our adversaries. The secretary should therefore come in and personally lead the charge to fix three things inside the Pentagon: acquisition, resources, and recruiting. Much ink has been spent describing in detail the disaster that is the acquisition system within the Pentagon. While some former secretaries such as Bob Gates and Ash Carter have tried to fix the system, it has, to date, remained stuck in the 1970s, producing high-cost, low-volume, and technologically-antiquated systems. Fixing this cannot be outsourced to the Deputy Secretary or the acquisition chief. Only the Secretary of defense, over the course of four years, will be able to drive the change that is needed. On day one, the secretary should come in and signal his or her seriousness by cancelling a major weapon system built for a past fight — think the Joint Strike Fighter or the Army’s Future Vertical Lift —vowing to use all of the dollars to invest in unmanned systems, artificial intelligence, and the mass production of weapons. Why go after the dollars immediately rather than changing acquisition regulations? Because if the secretary did the latter, the bureaucracy would wait him or her out and four years would go by without change. Next, the secretary must address the fact that the budget of the Pentagon is currently sized to fight only one, short-term war. Some will make the argument that the nation should pivot away from the Middle East and Europe in order to fit our national strategy to the fiscal constraints of the current budget. This, however, belies the fact that today, the North Koreans are supplying troops to the Russians to fight a war in Europe with Iranian weapons bought with oil proceeds from China. Our adversaries are using the entire globe to challenge us and no amount of 'wish-casting' is going to change that. On day one, the secretary should come in and signal his or her seriousness by stating that the new force-sizing construct for the military will be to fight one long war, with two simultaneous small wars. This matches up with the incoming president’s strategy of peace through strength. This new force-sizing construct will then drive the budget process going forward. And while the defense secretary doesn’t control the budget, they should use their early juice in the new role to push Congress to step up spending. Sen. Roger Wicker, who might become the Chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has put together a plan that provides an additional $55 billion to the Pentagon per year. This should be a starting point. Finally, but probably most importantly, the military needs people to serve. The wars in both Europe and the Middle East are teaching us the same lesson: That in a test of wills, the side that runs out of people and money first will lose. With wages in the private sector heading higher and a smaller number of available 18-years olds due to a demographic cliff expected to start in 2026, the secretary has no time to waste. On day one, they should signal their seriousness by stating that the Department of Defense supports the Congressional plan to dramatically increase the pay of the junior enlisted force. Some have said that the world is dangerously close to tipping into an all-out war. One way to prevent war is to make sure that those who wish you harm believe that they cannot prevail. This can only be done through an American military force that is utilizing the most technologically sophisticated weapons, produced at a scale that cannot be matched by our rivals, and used by the best service members the world has ever seen. Through strength comes peace. While the incoming secretary of defense will want to look to travel the globe and tend to the White House, his or her most important task is to first fix the Pentagon.

Weapons and radars built with modular design are relevant and flexible as threats evolve	Through the lens of new weapons development, Raytheon Advanced Technology employs composability as a catalyst for speed for weapon systems like hypersonic missiles. (Raytheon photo). Delivering new sensing and weaponry capability at the 'speed of relevance' is the idea behind quickly countering adversarial threats in the battlespace. Too often, though, ideas stay just that, concepts that do not effectively lead to solutions. The lost possibilities are sensors and weapons that have little commonality between them so they take longer and cost more to produce and can’t share data across warfighting and security domains. There are, however, major new systems in production now for both the U.S. Navy and Army that have gone from conception to becoming the cornerstone of air and missile defense in just a handful of years due to engineering principals built around 'composable' weapons and software-defined apertures. One of those systems is the Navy’s AN/SPY-6 (V) active electronically scanned array radar now undergoing sea trials. The Navy is integrating SPY-6 into its surface fleet beginning with the USS Jack H. Lucas (DDG 125), first of the Arleigh Burke-class Flight III destroyers, and the USS Richard M. McCool Jr. (LPD 29), an amphibious landing ship that introduced the (V)2 variant. Another is the Army’s Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor, or LTAMDS. The program has advanced through multiple live-fire tests of the 360-degree radar, demonstrating the radar's performance. Both programs are the centerpieces of their respective services air and missile defense modernization strategies, and both were architected in the Advanced Technology (AT) business of Raytheon. Building atop foundational blocks Raytheon’s Advanced Technology team is bringing ideas to fruition through the use of foundational building-blocks that enable technical innovations like software-defined apertures for radars and composable weapon architectures for missiles and other weaponry. Through the lens of new weapons development, composability is a catalyst for speed. Over the last decade, AT has architected the use of common, scalable, modular hardware and software building blocks, allowing the company to deliver faster and streamline its factories. 'It's absolutely central to all of our new weapon developments and pursuits,' said John C. Otto, Raytheon AT’s technology director. 'It's a toolbox of subsystems that we can pull together and use again and again with common interfaces without having to recreate the wheel from the beginning on each of them.' In missile development, for example, one of the core but common subsystems is guidance electronics. What Raytheon AT has done is partition the functionality across the guidance unit so that if more processing is desired, cards can be easily added to support that. Or vice versa; processing can be dialed back for less complex missions where the additional capability and subsequent cost is not needed. With commonality of hardware, customers can bundle buys at lower cost and take advantage of common factories and test equipment. From the standpoint of the engineering workforce, different programs look much the same so that personnel can move between programs and only have to learn the particulars of that one program as opposed to an entirely new system. They experience the same look and feel of a program down to the fundamental software level. The result is higher efficiency, faster development, and quicker upgrades to combat adversarial challenges. In radar development, Raytheon Advanced Technology uses a building block approach to create a software-defined aperture architecture to control and update radars and other weapon systems. (Raytheon photo). Software-defined apertures for system updates Radar structures built with modular blocks can be scaled larger for massive sensing capability for advanced warships like Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, or – using the exact same blocks – scaled down for the needs of an LPD. The Navy’s SPY-6 radar is a perfect example of how Raytheon AT used this approach to develop and scale radar systems for different customers, missions, and vessels. Each building block for the SPY-6 family of radars is a 2’x2’x2’ box called the radar modular assembly, or RMA. Each RMA is a self-contained radar antenna and arrays of different sizes for different uses can be made by stacking RMAs together. 37 RMAs make up each of the four faces of the SPY-6(V)1 radar on the DDG 51. The SPY-6(V)2 rotating array on the Nimitz class has nine RMAs, and the three faces of the SPY-6(V)3 on Ford-class carriers and the FFG(X) frigates also have nine RMAs. The four faces of the SPY-6(V)4 radar on the DDG 51 Flight IIA destroyers have 24 RMAs. Modular radar technology is also used in the GhostEye family of radars, including the Army’s LTAMDS radar. 'Think of your hardware as a capability that is unlocked with software commands,' explained Matt Tyhach, mission area director for next generation sensors and microelectronics at Raytheon AT. 'You may have a radar that is capable of detecting slow low-flying drones and then with software commands you can reoptimize its configuration to detect fast high-flying ballistic missiles. Very different target sets, but we can leverage the power and flexibility of our radar hardware baseline to stay ahead of the threat by upgrading performance through safe, secure software only upgrades.' From a radar development perspective, AT uses such building blocks to create a software-defined aperture architecture, rather than a conventional radar approach, to create flexible hardware solutions that serve multiple missions. Software apps like those on cell phones make it simpler to control and update the radars and other weapon systems. This modular approach to radar development, coupled with robotic assembly of each system, allows Raytheon to rapidly field radars for different missions. As new capabilities via software upgrades are developed, they’re added to the company’s common radar software product line, which is shared and re-used across multiple radar programs. 'This is a common library of radar software that was first developed for SPY-6 and as we learn more from sea trials and first deployment, that learning is all fed back into the common baseline for future radar franchises, including LTAMDS.' said Tyhach. 'Likewise, LTMADS is fielding its first units now at WSMR (White Sands Missile Range) and that learning is fed into the common radar baseline to benefit SPY-6 and expand our trusted and tried software without the larger non-recurring engineering build of most heritage non-software defined systems.' Matching weapons system capabilities to the mission Raytheon Advanced Technology has found the pathway to addressing complexity through the simplicity wrought by modularity and reuse of components that match weapon system capabilities to the mission – no more, no less – while software-defined apertures let those same systems modernize remotely as threats evolve.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/weapons-and-radars-built-with-modular-design-are-relevant-and-flexible-as-threats-evolve/	2024-11-12T05:19:38-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Raytheon-Hypersonic.png
SPACECOM to Huntsville? Bets are on ‘yes,’ and possibly soon	The Army's Redstone Arsenal is home to Army Space &amp; Missile Defense Command, the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, and NASA Marshall Space Flight Center among other organizations. (Photo: US Army) WASHINGTON — Space watchers say the odds are high that President-elect Donald Trump will redirect US Space Command headquarters to Huntsville, Ala., once he is in office — reversing the July 2023 decision by President Joe Biden to keep the command based in Colorado Springs, Co. 'I think it's a virtual certainty. He can announce it in the first 100 days, but the process will take many years and appropriations from Congress. But I think SPACECOM will end up moving to Huntsville,' said Todd Harrison, a long-time space analyst at the American Enterprise Institute. Those expressing confidence in such a move also include Alabama's senior Republican senator, Tommy Tuberville. 'Sen. Tuberville has spoken with President Trump several times about the importance of moving Space Command back to its rightful home in Huntsville,' a spokesperson for Tuberville's office told Breaking Defense. The spokesperson also pointed to a Nov. 7 interview with Tuberville on WREC radio station's 'Alabama Morning News with JT' show, where the senator stated that Huntsville was the 'best place' for SPACECOM HQ due to the level of security there. 'There is no doubt it's the best place, and it's secure. They're not secure out there [in Colorado]. But, again, I've told President Trump, listen, get a Secretary of Air Force. Let's go through this process again—[it's a] short period of time,' Tuberville said. 'It won't take long and I know where it's gonna go. Let's just do it the right way. Politics don't need to be involved. It needs to be done for the military and the people of this country,' he added. Clayton Swope, deputy director of the Aerospace Security Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that plans for making such a move already exist — given that Trump had decided on Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville as SPACECOM's home just before he left the Oval Office for the first time in January 2021. 'It's a safe bet that Space Command is going to Rocket City. Worth dusting off plans for the 60-acre site previously identified for a new Redstone headquarters,' he told Breaking Defense. Redstone Arsenal, a US Army post, currently is home to a number of service organizations, including Army Space and Missile Defense Command. It also houses the Missile Defense Agency and NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center. The SPACECOM basing decision has been a political football between the Alabama and Colorado congressional delegations since 2018, and the subject of investigations in 2022 by both the Pentagon's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) and Congress's watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office (GAO). In the 2024 National Defense Authorization Act passed in December 2023, lawmakers blocked funding for additional facilities at the Colorado location and mandated yet another investigation by the OIG, this time into the fairness of Biden's decision to let the command stay where it was. GAO, likewise, opened another investigation in September 2023. Nonetheless, then-SPACECOM commander Army Gen. Jim Dickinson on Dec. 15, 2023 declared that the command had reached 'full operational capability' at Peterson SFB, including having the necessary infrastructure 'to support command and control across mission and business functions.' In a long thread on LinkedIn over the past week, commenters including current and former military officials raised questions about the costs of moving the headquarters now that it has had time to settle in, as well as the potential effects on mission readiness. One big concern cited was whether there will be a huge brain drain among the civilian workforce because many will not want to move from Colorado Springs. However, some other analysts keeping eyes on SPACECOM told Breaking Defense that perhaps that expected attrition in personnel would be a good thing — shaking up status quo thinking about the command's mission, and making room for new blood.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/spacecom-to-huntsville-bets-are-on-yes-and-possibly-soon/	2024-11-11T11:59:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Army-redstone-arsenal-e1731352925128.jpg
Army inks $435 million deal for new TNT production facility	Paladin artillery crews assigned to 3rd Battalion, 29th Field Artillery Regiment, 3rd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 4th Infantry Division conduct Table VI qualifications in February 2017, firing the first 155-mm rounds in Poland at the training site. (US Army/Staff Sgt. Elizabeth Tarr) WASHINGTON —As part of the Army’s quest to boost weapons production, it is reestablishing TNT production on US soil, inking a deal to build out a new facility in Graham, Ky. 'For the first time in decades, America will produce TNT on its own soil, manufacturing the explosive material our military uses for everything from hand grenades to 155mm artillery,' outgoing Sen. Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a press release. McConnell’s comments came after the service announced a new $435 million deal last Friday, tasking Repkon USA with designing and building out the new explosives production facility that should be completed by early November 2028. 'This is a major step forward in rebuilding our industrial base and ensuring we have the critical capabilities to support our warfighters,' Army acquisition head Douglas Bush said in the press release. 'Reshoring TNT production gives us the ability to control and secure our supply chain for this vital component, especially in an era of increasing global challenges.' TNT is used to produce an array of explosive weapons including ammunition, bombs and 155-millimeter artillery rounds, but the military has been reliant on overseas sources. The decision to build out a new production comes as service leaders work to scale weapon production in the wake of the Ukraine war, including 155mm artillery rounds. By fiscal 2026, the service is aiming to have the capacity to produce 100,000 rounds each month. To get there, Bush previously said the Army plans to spend $4.2 billion to build up the industrial base across various initiatives, to include commissioning three new domestic facilities to support 155mm production and a new metal parts production facility in Canada. 'This new state-of-the-art [TNT] facility is essential to the … mission to develop, procure and field safe, reliable and lethal munitions to our joint warfighters and international partners,' Maj. Gen. John T. Reim, the joint program executive officer for armaments and ammunition, said in the Army press release. 'This project will also further strengthen our defense industrial base, enabling munitions production at speed and scale.'	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/army-inks-435-million-deal-for-new-tnt-production-facility/	2024-11-11T11:23:50-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/TNT-story-scaled.jpg
German MoD picks up tab for ICEYE-Rheinmetall SAR-sat data sales to Ukraine	Image of the Davis-Monthan Air Force 'Boneyard' in Tucson, Ariz., US, March 1, 2024. (ICEYE) WASHINGTON — Finnish satellite operator ICEYE and German arms maker Rheinmetall today announced they have jointly signed a contract to provide Ukraine's armed forces with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery — with funding provided by Germany's Ministry of Defense. 'The agreement further increases the SAR data and other support Ukraine has been receiving from ICEYE' since Russia's assault on the country in February 2022, according to the Rheinmetall press release. 'This provision will supplement further reconnaissance data obtained by other sensors and provide the basis for decision-making and operational planning by the Ukrainian armed forces. The collaboration includes dedicated satellite capacity and constellation access, which allows the capacity of the entire ICEYE satellite fleet to be utilized. Since 2018, ICEYE has launched 38 satellites for ICEYE’s and its customers’ use,' it adds. Rheinmetall did not release the value of the German contract. The two firms first inked a cooperation accord in June, and in September Düsseldorf-based Rheinmetall procured the exclusive rights to market ICEYE's products to 'military and government end users' in Germany and Hungary, according to an Oct. 9 Rheinmetall press release. Armin Papperger, CEO of Rheinmetall AG, said at the time: 'The space domain is an integral part of a defence strategy and of great relevance to our military clients. We are convinced that our combined capabilities will enable us to develop innovative approaches to offer customized solutions for our military customers in the future.' SAR satellites, which can take high-resolution images day and night regardless of weather conditions, have been particularly useful for Ukraine's warfighting capability, given the preponderance of cloudy weather in the country. ICEYE was an early provider, in August 2022 offering Kiev access to its constellation via an agreement with the Serhiy Prytula Charity Foundation in Ukraine for one of the company's satellites to be designated for Ukrainian government use. In July 2024, ICEYE and Ukraine's government signed a new 'Memorandum of Cooperation' to expand their collaboration.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/german-mod-picks-up-tab-for-iceye-rheinmetall-sar-sat-data-sales-to-ukraine/	2024-11-11T08:58:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/ICEYE-Press-Release_Aircarft_Boneyard_US-e1731343102183.png
Sweden selects Embraer C-390 transport aircraft, as Brazil eyes more Gripens	Embraer showed off its C-390 Millennium carrier during the 2024 Farnborough Airshow. Embraer signed a contract with the Netherlands and Austria for a combined order of the C-390 during the show. (Tim Martin/Breaking Defense) WASHINGTON — Sweden has selected the Brazilian-made C-390 for its next military transport aircraft, creating another strong defense industrial tie between the two nations. Stockholm announced it was signing a letter of intent over the weekend to purchase the C-390, produced by Embraer, which will open the way for negotiations to begin. Sweden joins Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Netherlands and Portugal as European operators of the Millennium, which has also been purchased by South Korea and, of course, home country Brazil. Quantities and cost were not disclosed in the announcement. Sweden currently operates six Lockheed Martin-made C-130H aircraft, and a one-for-one replacement would make sense given Sweden’s military needs and its recent membership in NATO. Every win for the C-390 is important, but adding another NATO nation to its user base is a particularly large victory for Embraer as the company seeks to expand its global footprint — and, it hopes, break into the lucrative US market. As Breaking Defense first reported, Embraer and US-based L3Harris are no long working together to market the tanker variant of the 390 to the US Air Force. However, Bosco da Costa Jr., the company’s defense chief, said in an interview that Embraer is still pursuing sales to the Air Force, positioning the Millennium as a multi-mission aircraft able to fill multiple needs. 'You can use this airplane to do air-to-air refueling, but in some hours, you could do the plane to do transport, to do search and rescue, to do other types of missions, not necessarily only for air-to-air refueling,' he told Breaking Defense last month. 'That is an advantage.' The letter of intent was signed on Saturday by Sweden’s Minister for Defence Pål Jonson and Brazil’s Minister of Defense José Múcio. A Swedish announcement of the LOI was also accompanied by a statement that Brazil plans to increase its buy of Jas 30 Gripen fighters by 25 percent. Brazil currently has 36 Gripens on order, so a 25 percent increase would mean nine additional fighters. Embraer and Saab have a joint production agreement, with Gripens being produced in-country in Brazil as part of the 2014 decision to purchase the jets. 'Aerospace cooperation is important to both Sweden and Brazil. The new letter of intent provides a basis for us to further deepen this cooperation,' Jonson said in a statement.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/sweden-selects-brazils-embraer-c-390-transport-aircraft-brazil-eyes-more-gripens/	2024-11-11T05:24:32-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/07/IMG_0906-e1721931015752.jpg
US Olympic Defender allies seek ‘common’ space picture	Space Delta 5 and the Combined Space Operations Center, one of five centers under US Space Forces &#8211; Space, on Nov. 4-6. 2024 hosted a meeting of the Operation Olympic Defender Common Operating Picture working group at Vandenberg SFB, Calif., including Australian, Canadian and British representatives. (US Space Force photo by Tech. Sgt. Luke Kitterman) WASHINGTON — The US and some of its closest allies in Operation Olympic Defender (OOD) this week launched 'initial' efforts to create new standards for sharing space monitoring data — the necessary foundation for developing a common view of the space battlefield, according to US Space Command (SPACECOM). Earlier this week the Space Force's Space Delta 5 and the Combined Space Operations Center (CSpOC) 'hosted a 3-day Operation Olympic Defender Common Operational Picture (COP) working group, consisting of space representatives from the Australian Space Operations Centre, Canadian Space Operations Centre and United Kingdom National Space Operations Centre,' SPACECOM said in a press release Thursday. Operation Olympic Defender is the US military's plan for space warfighting, alongside a select group of key allies. 'It’s essential that the [Olympic Defender] allies and partners have a shared understanding of the battlespace, to ensure mission impacting decision-making is based on common perceptions of what’s occurring and likely to occur in the Area of Responsibility,' said Royal Australian Air Force Group Captain Julien Greening, CSpOC deputy director. Space Delta 5's mission is to 'prepare, present, and fight' forces to SPACECOM for 'operational-level command and control,' according to SPACECOM's website. SPACECOM's CSpOC brings together the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand and the United Kingdom to collaborate on space command and control. Both organizations are located at Vandenberg SFB, Calif. Since July, Col. Justin Sorice is double-hatted as commander of both. As of last month, the same group of countries also are members of Operation Olympic Defender. At a meeting last year, the Operation Olympic Defender allies agreed on the need for commanders to be able to collectively see what is happening in space at the same time. At the meeting this week, the working group reviewed 'risks and mitigations, refined the concept of operation, and update the plan to develop a shared Space COP,' the SPACECOM press release explained. Further, the group also 'reviewed and contributed initial requirements and identifying standards to cooperatively produce shared situation understand of the space environment,' the release said. 'The team will build on data provided by the US Space Surveillance Network and utilize the existing Global Command and Control System – Joint, as the initial means of generating and displaying space track information integrated with available intelligence and environmental information, to provide the user a fused battlespace picture,' it added. Both the UK and Australia are in the process of standing up two of three planned sites for the US Deep Space Advanced Radar (DARC) to track satellites and dangerous space junk in far away orbits with more precision. (The third site will be in the US.) The first radar, in Western Australia, will become operational in 2026; all three are expected to be online by 2030. Canada is at the start of an effort to develop a successor to its aging Sapphire satellite that keeps tabs on the heavens. The project, called 'Surveillance of Space 2,' is expected to cost as much as $250 million CAN to $499 million CAN ($180 million USD to $358 million USD), according to a Ministry of Defence fact sheet.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/us-olympic-defender-allies-seek-common-space-picture/	2024-11-08T12:30:29-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/11/Operation-Olympic-Defender-Space-COP-working-group-Nov.-2024-scaled-e1731096548525.jpeg
Eyeing future CCA missions, Navy teams with Lockheed, GA to test new drone control system	Navy unmanned aerial vehicle pilots check the readouts during a test of a new Lockheed control system working with a General Atomics CCA 'surrogate' on Nov. 5, 2024. (NAVAIR) WASHINGTON — US Navy pilots sitting comfortably in Maryland recently took a new carrier-based drone control center out for a spin for the first time, piloting a General Atomics MQ-20 Avenger thousands of miles away using autonomous tech made by Lockheed Martin's secretive Skunk Works division. The live-flight test of the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation Mission Control Station (UMCS), conducted Nov. 5, was done 'as part of an effort to advance technology for future Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA),' Naval Aviation Systems Command wrote in a release on Thursday. Both the Air Force and the Navy are pushing forward with CCA — essentially robotic drone wingmen to fly alongside or ahead of manned aircraft in combat operations — seen as the future of air dominance. 'This was a huge step for unmanned naval aviation,' Navy Air Vehicle Pilot (AVP) Lt. Steven Wilster said in the Navy release. 'This demo showcased UMCS’s first live control of an unmanned air vehicle, and it was great to be part of history in the making. The team is paving the way for integrating critical unmanned capability across the joint force to combat the high-end threat our warfighters face today and in the future.' For the test, Navy pilots in Patuxent River, Maryland, controlled the jet-powered MQ-20, which served as a 'surrogate' for a future CCA bird, as it sliced through the sky in California, according to the Navy and a Lockheed announcement today. 'UMCS is laying a foundation that will enable control of all unmanned carrier aircraft, starting with the MQ-25 aircraft,' Capt. Daniel Fucito, program manager for the Navy's Unmanned Carrier Aviation Program Office, said in the Navy release. 'The UMCS opens the door for efficiently introducing future unmanned systems into the complex carrier command and control architecture.' The Navy's control station is built on what Lockheed Martin calls its 'MDCX autonomy platform,' which Skunk Works Vice President and General Manager John Clark said was used to 'rapidly integrate the MQ-20 &#8216;autonomy core' with the UMCS, demonstrating common control capability and third-party platform integration.' While both the Air Force and the Navy hope to see CCAs flying alongside their fighters and bombers within a few years, the services are pursuing the efforts separately. The Air Force has selected two platforms for its first tranche of aircraft, an aircraft from General Atomics's Gambit family and Anduril's Fury.

'I want something that’s going to fly for a couple hundred hours. The last hour it’s either a target or a weapon. I’m either going to hit something with it or I’m going to train [a sensor on it] and shoot it down,' Rear Adm. Stephen Tedford, the Navy’s program executive for unmanned systems and weapons, said during the Sea Air Space conference in April. 'But I’m not going to sustain them for 30 years.' At the time, he added that the Navy was looking for a platform that comes it an under $15 million each. Wherever the Navy lands, it's certain the USN and USMC AVPs want a reliable UMCS, perhaps aided by LM's MDCX, to fly their CCAs for ISR, EW or combat missions ASAP.

DCMA builds ‘information dictionary’ to decode DoD acronyms, key terms	Artificial intelligence and technology (Getty images) WASHINGTON — Employees at the Defense Contracting Management Agency created a much-needed solution to decipher between the ever-changing accumulation of Department of Defense key phrases and acronyms. Leading up to the DCMA’s IT Training Summit Innovation Contest this past summer, IT workers created a tool, dubbed the Information Dictionary, to help the agency quickly look up and see definitions for the DoD’s jargon-heavy terms and acronyms. The team behind the product won second place in the competition, according to a press release from DCMA. 'There are so many DOD and DCMA unique acronyms, and new ones are always being developed that we’re often asking, ‘what does XXXX stand for?’' Andy Bradshaw, DCMA’s Total Force Directorate Policy Branch supervisor, said in the release. 'Then we go on a rabbit hunt trying to figure it out, and at times there is more than one meaning. The DCMA Information Dictionary saves us a lot of time and frustration in determining acronyms and their definitions. It’s a great tool for us, and it will be a great asset for new agency employees as well.' He added that before the Information Dictionary was created, the agency used an Excel spreadsheet to track these key terms and acronyms. The second-place team was made up of team lead and data architect Joseph Lowe; business architect Sabrina Francis; technology architect Larry Hairston; and security architect Keith Young. The team used artificial intelligence from reports made by Power BI — a business intelligence platform that helps turn raw data into usable observations — that combined data from the DCMA, DoD, Federal Acquisition Regulation and National Institute of Standards and Technology to build the tool. So far, it’s been used over 400 times in the past month by DCMA employees, the release said. 'We manually extracted data over a period of six months from over 660 documents including more than 28 thousand rows of data that defines over two thousand unique terms and acronyms, and nearly two thousand unique references,' Lowe said in the press release. Though the Information Dictionary is jam-packed with data, it’s actually 'very user-friendly,' Francis added. 'For example, you can pick a filter on the left-hand navigation such as ‘DCMA Acronyms’ then search the words in alphabetic order. Let’s say you pick the term ‘ACQDemo’ from the list. The filter will show you all the different possible names for that acronym plus any related capabilities and policies related to the term,' he said. The team noted that the tool has been helpful, but there are improvements to be made. For example, automating the process of adding new terms, acronyms and definitions is next on the list. While currently only available to employees within DCMA, eventually the Information Dictionary will be available to others. 'I’m proud to say our approach to documenting organizational information for enterprise architectural purposes will be presented to DOD, other federal agencies and industry in the coming months,' Lowe said in the release.	https://breakingdefense.com/2024/11/dcma-builds-information-dictionary-to-decode-dod-acronyms-key-terms/	2024-11-08T10:38:13-08:00	https://breakingdefense.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/05/220524_AI_brain_icon_GettyImages-1296904409-scaled-e1663074689851.jpg
